     Summary: Bruins Bruins win 4th straight; Pastrnak nets 2 to pass 40 goals David Pastrnak celebrates his goal during the third period.
Pastrnak broke a second-period tie to pass the 40-goal plateau for the third time in his career, and then added another goal in the third for No.
Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston — the second straight time he has opened the scoring in two games since returning from an injury.
Finally, McAvoy chipped the puck free and it made it to Pastrnak, who had a 20-foot lead on the nearest defender.
ANTHEM ISSUESBruins anthem singer Todd Angilly had to do a restart before the game when he began with the U.S. national anthem for the game against Ottawa.

     Bruins Wrap: David Pastrnak Ensures It’s Not Senators’ Day In Boston’s Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — The Boston Bruins hosted the Ottawa Senators at TD Garden on Monday afternoon and behind David Pastrnak proved the third time would be the charm while earning a 3-1 victory.
The Bruins, who now have won four straight, previously lost once in regulation and once in a shootout to the Senators.
ONE BIG TAKEAWAYThe connection of Charlie McAvoy and Pastrnak proved to be the key in Boston’s victory on Presidents’ Day.
Pastrnak scored the game-winning and insurance goals for the Black and Gold, both of which were assisted by McAvoy.
Pastrnak previously scored what proved to be the game-winner late in the second period.

     David Pastrnak scores his 40th and 41st goals as Bruins turn back Senators
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Standing atop a crowded Eastern Conference playoff race, the Bruins are looking down at a tangle of hungry teams.
Neither he nor his teammates could get one for David Krejci, who was feted before the game for breaking the 1,000-game barrier.
DeBrusk, who had five goals in six games before a 17-game injury layoff after the Winter Classic, now has seven goals in his last eight games (7-3—10).
Pastrnak scored his 40th of the season at 17:06 of the second by ripping a far-side wrister from the circle, off a brilliant play by McAvoy.
Pastrnak held off a couple of Senators in the slot and dished to a flying Brad Marchand, who drew a trip.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ottawa Senators have given the Bruins fits this season and, in Monday’s matinee, they proved again to be no pushover.
But David Pastrnak scored a pair of goals and Linus Ullmark made 30 saves to send the B’s out on a four-game Western trip with a 3-1 victory, their fourth straight win.
They’re hard, they’re physical, they go to hard areas, they play playoff-type hockey.
And it was Pastrnak who finally gave the B’s a little breathing room with 7:50 left in the third period.
He threw a fake at Mandolese and calmly slid a backhander through the goalie’s pads to make it 3-1.
