     Next Stop 50 Goals? Bruins Star David Pastrnak Aims For Scoring Feat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Bruins forward David Pastrnak has it in his sights now after another terrific offensive display in Monday’s 3-1 win over the Ottawa Senators at TD Garden.
Only six players in the illustrious history of the Bruins have ever scored 50 goals in a season, and Pastrnak is aiming to become the seventh.
“I obviously haven’t scored 50 yet.
Pastrnak has scored at least 40 goals in three out of the last four seasons, but hitting the half-century mark has remained elusive for the 26-year-old.
The closest he got to 50 came during the 2019-20 season when he finished with 48 tallies — 14th most all-time in a single season for the Bruins.
