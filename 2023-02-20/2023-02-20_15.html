     Anthony Edwards’ All-Star weekend proves his superstar status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans of the Minnesota Timberwolves were thrilled when they learned that Anthony Edwards would be heading to Salt Lake City to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star weekend.
Edwards is currently in the middle of his best professional season at age 21.
Seeing James pick Anthony Edwards over all the other reserves just seemed right after his near All-Star snub, and after all he has accomplished this season.
And as Ernie Johnson noted, LeBron picking Edwards meant that the oldest player in the All-Star game selected the youngest player in the game.
It was the first of what will become many All-Star selections for Anthony Edwards, and his talent will only become more undeniable from here.

     Timberwolves' star Anthony Edwards calls out teams for 'load management'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Timberwolves’ guard Anthony Edwards was the team’s lone representative, after Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson couldn’t play due to injury.
I’m trying to take pride in playing every game," Edwards said.
He took the Timberwolves’ star with his first pick in the pregame player draft.
Not a bad night for his first All-Star Game.
Timberwolves forward Luka Garza, a former Iowa star, had 23 points and eight rebounds on the way to earning MVP honors.

     NBA ace Anthony Edwards criticises fellow superstars for new 'load management' trend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Edwards is not of that mindset, and has openly criticised those who take the decision to do so at times throughout the season.
Edwards was speaking at his full all-star game, and did not hold back on potentially rustling some feathers.
The 21-year-old's refreshing comments have seen him be heaped praised upon, with fans seemingly not pleased about a number of players sitting out.
As well as Edwards, FOX Sports reporter Skip Bayless has criticised players, namely LeBron James for skipping games this season.
The 'load management' strategy is only been implemented in recent years by players and coaches, but NBA commissioner Adam Silver recently stating he does not see it as a problem.

     Anthony Edwards becomes hero to fans because he wants to play every game — an NBA rarity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And rising Wolves star Anthony Edwards gave voice to the reason in the company of his star peers over the weekend.
Edwards has played all 60 games for the Wolves this season, battling through ailments along the way.
If an NBA player is legitimately injured, he of course shouldn't play.
As Edwards noted, with fans thanking him on social media for his attitude and declaration, it's disappointing when a star player misses the game you are at.
But that said: This is just one more reason Wolves fans should be glad Edwards is on their side.
