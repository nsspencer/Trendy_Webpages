     Exclusive: Kevin McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to massive trove of Jan. 6 riot tape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has given Fox News' Tucker Carlson exclusive access to 41,000 hours of Capitol surveillance footage from the Jan. 6 riot, McCarthy sources tell me.
Carlson TV producers were on Capitol Hill last week to begin digging through the trove, which includes multiple camera angles from all over Capitol grounds.
Now his shows — "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on Fox News, and "Tucker Carlson Today" and "Tucker Carlson Originals" on the streaming service Fox Nation — have a massive trove of raw material.
Carlson told me: "[T]here was never any legitimate reason for this footage to remain secret."
(Video, beginning 10:50)Pushing for the release of the footage, Carlson argued on his show last month that Washington has "a regime of secrecy and deceit."

     Speaker McCarthy Gives Tucker Carlson 41,000 Hours Of Jan. 6 Footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) handed over 41,000 hours of security tapes from the deadly January 6, 2021 Capitol riots to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a network spokesperson confirmed to Forbes, as Carlson seeks to further his narrative severely downplaying the event.
Tucker Carlson has his hands on thousands of hours of security tapes from the Capitol riots.
Getty ImagesKey FactsProducers for Carlson are poring over the footage and plan to roll out selected clips over the next few weeks, sources close to McCarthy told Axios.
McCarthy became Speaker of the House last month after a historic vote that took 15 rounds thanks to a group of ultra-conservative Republican legislators who took issue with McCarthy’s comparatively moderate views.
Carlson actually backed the pushback against McCarthy, calling the dissent “refreshing” and blasting McCarthy for being “ideologically agnostic.”Surprising FactCarlson referred to election fraud claims pushed by Trump and his cronies as “absurd” and "insane” in texts revealed in court filings last week.

     McCarthy gives Fox News’s Tucker Carlson access to Jan. 6 Capitol surveillance footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has granted Fox News host Tucker Carlson and his team access to surveillance footage from the U.S. Capitol around the time of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.
Carlson was granted access to some 41,000 hours of footage by McCarthy’s office, Axios first reported on Monday.
“I think the public should see what has happened on that,” McCarthy told reporters in January while discussing the footage.
The series led two contributors to leave their roles with the network and reportedly angered staffers within Fox News’s ranks.
U.S. Capitol Police had previously said they shared 14,000 hours of sensitive footage with the Jan. 6 select committee.

     McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to January 6 Capitol security footage, sources say

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has granted Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to all of the US Capitol security footage from January 6, multiple sources told CNN.
A Fox News spokesperson told CNN that the Axios report was accurate, but declined further comment.
Another source told CNN that McCarthy didn’t consult with his GOP leadership team before making the decision.
The now-defunct January 6 committee got access to all the security footage from US Capitol Police during its investigation, but did not release certain clips for security reasons.
News outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis.
