     Embattled Don Lemon absent Monday from 'CNN This Morning'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid ongoing criticism over his comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Don Lemon was absent Monday from “CNN This Morning.”NEW YORK -- Amid ongoing criticism over his comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Don Lemon was absent Monday from “CNN This Morning.” Co-host Poppy Harlow told viewers that “Don has the day off.”Lemon has not been on the air since Thursday, when during a discussion on “CNN This Morning” about the ages of politicians he said that the 51-year-old Haley was not “in her prime.” A woman, he said, was considered in her prime "in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s.”Challenged by Harlow, Lemon added: “Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying what the facts are.”Lemon has since apologized, but he has been widely condemned, including by CNN CEO Chris Licht.
According to The New York Times, Licht chastised Lemon during an editorial call Friday, saying his remarks were "upsetting, unacceptable and unfair” and a “huge distraction.”A CNN spokesperson had no immediate comment on whether Lemon would be back Tuesday.

Play video content TMZ.comBut, as we reported, his Monday absence was not pre-scheduled, and staffers found out in a memo circulated this weekend about the 'This Morning' lineup switch.
The reference I made to a woman’s “prime” this morning was inartful and irrelevant, as colleagues and loved ones have pointed out, and I regret it.

     Summary: Embattled CNN anchor Don Lemon has “zero defenders” left at the network source said, as it remains unclear whether he’ll be back on air Tuesday, sources told Page Six.
“The big question is, is CNN going to keep Don off air on a day-to-day basis?” said one well-placed industry insider.
But the insider countered this: “Don was definitely scheduled to work Monday, and I can tell you he has zero defenders left.
I don’t think he should be rewarded for bad behavior.”CNN chief Chris Licht has to decide whether to have Don Lemon back on air.
