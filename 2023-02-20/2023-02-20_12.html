     Bucks sign Meyers Leonard to a 10-day contract. Here's what you need to know about the 7-footer and his past issues.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bucks have signed 7-foot center Meyers Leonard to a 10-day contract, a league source confirmed to the Journal Sentinel.
Why did the Bucks sign Meyers Leonard?
Or, more likely, Leonard can sub for Bobby Portis as Portis will likely begin playing again after suffering a sprained right MCL on Jan. 23.
After his suspension, the Heat traded Leonard to the Oklahoma City Thunder and he was immediately waived.
With Giannis Antetokounmpo hurting his wrist right before the all-star break and Bobby Portis working his way back from knee and ankle issues, Leonard gives the Bucks some frontcourt depth.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent center Meyers Leonard is signing a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, according to a league source.
Leonard was suspended for one week and fined $50,000 in March 2021 after using an anti-Semitic slur on a live stream.
With both Antetokounmpo and Portis sidelined, the Bucks could use a big to help out Brook Lopez in coach Mike Budenholzer’s rotation.
Leonard, a 7-foot, 260-pound center, has not played in an NBA game since Jan. 9, 2021, when he underwent season-ending shoulder and ankle surgeries.

     Summary: Veteran big man Meyers Leonard is set to make his return to the NBA by signing a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, according to Adrian Wojnarowski.
Leonard has not played in over two full years due to an antisemitism scandal and multiple injuries.
In March of 2021, Leonard was livestreaming himself playing video games when he said an antisemitic slur.
Following the incident, Leonard, who then played for the Miami Heat, was fined $50,000 and suspended from all team activities for a week.
While Leonard's antisemitic comment was the driving force behind his unofficial suspension from the league, he has also dealt with numerous injuries.

     Summary: MIAMI (AP) — Meyers Leonard is getting another chance at the NBA, nearly two years after he used an anti-Semitic slur while playing a video game that was being livestreamed.
Leonard said then that he knew he’d used a bad term, but was unaware of the term’s meaning.
Leonard stood instead, his hand over his heart, and did so with the support of Heat teammates.
“I am a compassionate human being and I truly love all people,” Leonard told The Associated Press at the time.
For his career, Leonard has averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds on 48% shooting, 39% from 3-point range.
