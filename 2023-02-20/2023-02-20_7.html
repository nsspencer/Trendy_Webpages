     New George Washington letter of negotiating land sale valued at $50K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Raab Collection, a historical document dealer based in Pennsylvania, shared its discovery in a Sunday press release.
It’s valuing the letter at $50,000.
The note contained Washington’s correspondence with Israel Shreve, a former colonel in the Continental Army who was with Washington at Valley Forge, as they worked out the particulars of a land sale.
Shreve tried to use a form of credit to purchase a 1,600-acre plot of land in western Pennsylvania known as “Washington’s Bottom,” the auction house said, but Washington insisted that he needed money.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the type of business and location of The Raab Collection.

     Summary: Few figures in American history are as famous as George Washington.
We know that Washington was in Connecticut pretty regularly during his lifetime, but unfortunately, many of the specific locations have been lost to time.
However, we do have record of one specific spot where Washington spent the night in the Nutmeg State – several nights, actually!
In 1781, George Washington spent a few nights at the Webb House in Wethersfield.
The historic home is still standing today and is part of the wonderful Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum.

     George Washington’s Ohio Voyage

     Summary: William Crawford (Washington’s land agent) and others traveled nearly 700 miles from Virginia to Ohio and back.
Washington’s defeat at Fort Necessity only emboldened Britain’s efforts to secure the Ohio Country.
Washington’s fourth excursion into the Ohio Valley occurred as part of Gen. John Forbe’s successful campaign to capture Fort Duquesne in November 1758.
Washington’s journal leaves a detailed account of his Ohio trek spanning Oct. 5 through Dec. 1.
That same day, the party navigated the Ohio past modern-day Steubenville and reached Mingo Town, today Mingo Junction.
