     Jaylen Brown blasts ‘layup line’ All-Star Game after big performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following another NBA All-Star Game that was virtually void of defense, Boston Celtics’ star Jaylen Brown made his strong stance on the game known.
Brown called the game a glorified “layup line,” and expressed his desire to find a way to make the game more competitive in the future.
Team Giannis beat Team LeBron 184-175 behind an NBA All-Star Game record 55 points from Jayson Tatum, the game’s Most Valuable Player.
In the MLB, the winner of the All-Star Game gets home-field advantage in the World Series, which encourages players to try a little harder in the game.
But what Boston Celtics’ star Jaylen Brown said really is the crux of the All-Star Game in basically every sport: it just doesn’t matter.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics had a memorable All-Star Weekend in 2023 after Jayson Tatum landed the MVP honors for the game after a record-breaking 55 points in the win.
That reality led to Jaylen Brown getting candid about what he would like to see from the game going forward.
I don’t know how much notoriety we would want to to get from this.
“I don’t know if you can fix it.
That was the most competitive All-Star Game I’ve been a part of, and that was incredible.”

Rick Bowmer / AP PhotoThe Celtics’ star tandem of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown shone bright at the NBA All-Star Game in Salt Lake City on Sunday night.
But even with an impressive stat line in his second All-Star outing, Brown offered some candid and critical thoughts on Sunday’s collective defensive effort (or lack thereof).

     Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown describe thrill of NBA All-Star Game 1-on-1 battle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Tatum and Brown said about their 1-on-1 battle at All-Star Game originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonThe only way to split up the Jays is at the NBA All-Star Game.
For the second time in three seasons, Boston Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown found themselves on different All-Star rosters Sunday in Salt Lake City.
Tatum and Brown both put on a show throughout the game; Tatum scored an All-Star-record 55 points to take home MVP honors, while Brown was the top scorer for Team LeBron with 35 points.
While the two have yet to be on the same All-Star Team -- they were on opposing teams at the 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta -- Tatum enjoyed having another Celtics teammate present for the festivities.
Now Tatum and Brown get a few days off before the C's return to action Thursday against the Indiana Pacers.
