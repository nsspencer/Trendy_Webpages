     David Pastrnak scores twice as Bruins solve Senators, 3-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — On Presidents Day, the Bruins finally figured out how to solve the Senators.
David Pastrnak added two more goals to his total as Boston defeated Ottawa, 3-1, on Monday at TD Garden for their fourth straight victory.
The Senators who are well outside the playoff picture had been the rare team to have the Bruins’ number this season.
But Pastrnak scored once in the second and again in the third to give him 41 goals and Boston 43 wins.
Pastrnak scored his second with 7:50 remaining.

     Another Historic Win For Bruins Team ‘On Top Of The League’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – In some ways it was a nondescript Monday afternoon win for the Boston Bruins where they surpassed the Ottawa Senators, 3-1, with their depth and a star two goal performance from David Pastrnak at TD Garden.
The Monday afternoon victory for the Boston Bruins gives them a 43-8-5 record with 91 points in 56 games played.
That ties the 1979-80 edition of the Philadelphia Flyers for the fastest NHL team to ever hit the 90-point mark after notching their fourth win in a row with some afternoon hockey delight against the Sens.
We’ve got to be mentally prepared for each game,” said Boston Bruins center David Krejci.
“We hit a tough patch maybe a couple of weeks ago, but we’re a good team and we’ve got good guys on the team.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — David Pastrnak had already scored twice, and with the Senators’ net empty, a third was within reach.
“That was my only goal,” said Pastrnak, who scored twice to lead Boston to a 3-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday.
“I was looking for him all game.”Linus Ullmark stopped 30 shots in the Bruins’ fourth straight victory.
With the Bruins in the Ottawa zone and no goalie in net in the final minute, Pastrnak was looking for Krecji.
• Bruins anthem singer Todd Angilly had to do a restart before the game when he began with the U.S. national anthem for the game against Ottawa.

     David Pastrnak scores his 40th and 41st goals as Bruins turn back Senators
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Standing atop a crowded Eastern Conference playoff race, the Bruins are looking down at a tangle of hungry teams.
Neither he nor his teammates could get one for David Krejci, who was feted before the game for breaking the 1,000-game barrier.
DeBrusk, who had five goals in six games before a 17-game injury layoff after the Winter Classic, now has seven goals in his last eight games (7-3—10).
Pastrnak scored his 40th of the season at 17:06 of the second by ripping a far-side wrister from the circle, off a brilliant play by McAvoy.
Pastrnak held off a couple of Senators in the slot and dished to a flying Brad Marchand, who drew a trip.
