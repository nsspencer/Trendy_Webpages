    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were just a few problems with Ellis' homecoming: Duke basketball (20-8, 11-6 ACC) was more physical, capitalized on U of L's mistakes and walked away with a 79-62 win.
El Ellis:How Louisville basketball is managing its star's heavy workload — and asking him for more“They denied us all over the court," Payne said.
Louisville had just Ellis and JJ Traynor, who combined to account for nearly 60% of the Cardinals' points; 14 of their 23 field goals and all seven of their 3s.
"I need guys who are gonna get rebounds, who are gonna get assists, who are gonna play with energy, who are gonna fight," Payne said.
