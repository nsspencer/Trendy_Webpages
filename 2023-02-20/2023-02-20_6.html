    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DURHAM, N.C. — As a kid growing up in Bull City, El Ellis used to wear out the chain-link nets on the basketball goals at Elmira Avenue Park.
There was just one problem with Ellis’ homecoming: Duke’s team was hotter, capitalized on the Cardinals’ mistakes and walked away with a 79-62 win.
Cards' impressive victory:As 2013 team is honored, Louisville basketball beats Clemson for its biggest win of seasonEllis was hungry to prove himself on the hometown stage.
Louisville went on a 5-2 run after that bucket to take its largest lead of the night, 18-9 at the 13:14 mark, but it was all Duke from there.
