     Bucks sign Meyers Leonard to a 10-day contract. Here's what you need to know about the 7-footer and his past issues.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bucks have signed 7-foot center Meyers Leonard to a 10-day contract, a league source confirmed to the Journal Sentinel.
Why did the Bucks sign Meyers Leonard?
Or, more likely, Leonard can sub for Bobby Portis as Portis will likely begin playing again after suffering a sprained right MCL on Jan. 23.
After his suspension, the Heat traded Leonard to the Oklahoma City Thunder and he was immediately waived.
With Giannis Antetokounmpo hurting his wrist right before the all-star break and Bobby Portis working his way back from knee and ankle issues, Leonard gives the Bucks some frontcourt depth.
