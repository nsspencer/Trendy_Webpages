     Russell Westbrook plans to sign with LA Clippers, agent says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen A. Smith discusses Russell Westbrook's signing with the Clippers and what he brings to the team down the stretch.
(2:49)After completing a contract buyout, nine-time All-Star guard Russell Westbrook plans to sign with the LA Clippers, his agent, Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports, told ESPN.
The Clippers became increasingly interested with Westbrook as team officials, including coach Ty Lue and president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank, dug into a series of conversations with Westbrook, sources said.
The Los Angeles Lakers traded Westbrook and a 2027 first-round draft pick to the Jazz as part of a three-team deal Wednesday.
After a tumultuous season-plus with the Lakers, Westbrook took time to decompress and consider his possibilities.

(Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) Getty ImagesThe NBA buy-out market has already seen considerable activity before its March 1st deadline, with even former MVP Russell Westbrook joining the Los Angeles Clippers and former All-Star Kevin Love joining the Miami Heat.
Russell WestbrookIt's no secret that Westbrook isn't a prolific shooter, turns the ball over too much, and isn't much of an asset defensively.
Kevin LoveThe Miami Heat always seem to manage, even if they're down on talent, going through injuries, or a third thing altogether.
Will the Heat trust Love in the postseason where opponents will go straight at him, and likely burning him in pick-and-roll situations?

     Plaschke: In signing Russell Westbrook, Clippers foolishly mirror the Lakers' mistake

     Summary: Why would the Clippers sign Westbrook after all the problems he caused the Lakers?
(Christina House / Los Angeles Times)Fool you once, shame on Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook was so much trouble, the Lakers traded a first-round draft pick just to get rid of him.
