     ‘Atomic Heart’ Reviews Are Here, And They Are Just Okay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atomic Heart MundfishToday marks the embargo date for Atomic Heart, the bizarre new sci-fi game from Mundfish, which has attracted some manner of controversy given its connections to Russia.
But in terms of how the actual game performs and whether it’s worth playing, reviews are now in and the result is something perhaps…okay.
At the time of this writing, reviews split across PS5, Xbox Series X and PC (surprisingly evenly) are a 75, 74 and 78 on Metacritic respectively.
There are highs:Gaming Trend (9.5/10): “2023 has already been strong with Game of the Year contenders, and Atomic Heart is another one of them.
Nailing down a few things Atomic Heart is phenomenal at is nearly impossible because it’s extraordinary in all of them.

     Atomic Heart review: Rage against the machines
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After being founded in 2017, Mundfish is making a strong first impression with its debut game, Atomic Heart.
Atomic Heart reminded me a lot of the Bioshock franchise with its alternate historical setting.
Outside of controversial themes and a lack of enemy variety, it’s hard to point out any glaring issues with Atomic Heart.
This review is based on a PS5 copy of Atomic Heart provided by the publisher.
Atomic Heart releases on February 21 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, and PS5.

     Atomic Heart Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A simple playthrough of Atomic Heart will take players around 25 hours to beat, which is a solid playtime generally.
There is no variety, and every boss encounter in Atomic Heart feels just like the last one.
RELATED: Atomic Heart Composer Donated His Fee to UkraineThe game's crafting mechanic is memorable, but for the worst reason.
And, to make matters worse, Atomic Heart is absolutely riddled with performance issues and bugs on Xbox Series X.
Atomic Heart releases on February 21 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

     Atomic Heart starts with a bang — but can it land its Soviet story?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’m 10 hours into Atomic Heart and the end is nowhere in sight.
But as I barrel into the core of Atomic Heart, I wonder whether this game is what it appears to be — or if it’s something much more interesting.
The Soviet aesthetic is central to Atomic Heart in the way the original BioShock’s art deco was inseparable from (and underpinned) its critique of Randian philosophyLike those utopias, Atomic Heart’s Soviet nation is failing, under leaders plagued by the Icarus complex in which grand ideas come to naught.
Annoyingly, Atomic Heart lacks accessibility options: Subtitles are unbelievably tiny, making playing the game with Russian voice-acting practically impossible.
But for now, the pure pleasure of adventuring in this world as P3 is motivation enough to see this through to the end.

     Atomic Heart Review - Crispy Critters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atomic Heart doesn't hide its BioShock Infinite inspirations.
In the alternate history of Atomic Heart, a scientist named Dmitry Sechenov kickstarts a robotics boom in Russia in the 1930s.
It's an intriguing concept, one furthered by the notion that Atomic Heart is a video game and so we, the player, have been directing Sergei's actions the entire time.
There are quite a few parts of Atomic Heart that just don't neatly fit together, and those disparities create an experience that often feels at odds with itself.
Atomic Heart is certainly going to appeal to some people, especially those looking to relive BioShock Infinite, but it's not an easy recommendation.
