     Summary: Embattled CNN host Don Lemon will return to his morning show on Wednesday following an extended absence amid his controversial remarks about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, according to a memo from CNN boss Chris Licht to staff.

During Thursday's broadcast of "CNN This Morning," Lemon knocked Haley for supporting "mandatory mental competency tests" for politicians over 75 years old, accusing her of being past her "prime."
"And I’m just saying Nikki Haley should be careful about saying that politicians are not in their prime, and they need to be in their prime when they serve.

     Summary: New York CNN —CNN anchor Don Lemon will return to the network’s air on Wednesday after he participates in formal training following sexist comments he made last week, the network’s chief executive, Chris Licht, said in an email to employees Monday night.
“To that end, Don will return to CNN This Morning on Wednesday.”Lemon previously apologized to employees for his comments, which prompted internal and external backlash, during Friday’s daily editorial meeting.
“And I own this one as well.”Lemon made the sexist comments during a Thursday discussion on “CNN This Morning” over former South Carolina Gov.

“The people I am closest to in this organization are women,” Lemon added, citing his relationships with various hosts and executives.
