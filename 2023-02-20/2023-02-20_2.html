     Anthony Edwards Calls Out NBA Players Who Sit Out Regular Season Games: ‘You Gotta Play’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Videos by OutKickIt’s not just NBA fans who are sick and tired of seeing star players randomly sit out games during the regular season, Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards is annoyed by the reality as well.
Speaking ahead of this past weekend’s NBA All-Star Game, Edwards was asked if he’d like to change anything in the league.
Players sitting out games immediately came to the mind of the former Georgia Bulldog.
The only rule set in place to get players on the floor involve nationally televised games.
If healthy players sit out nationally televised games during the regular season they will be fined $100,000.

     Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards echoes Kobe Bryant's past criticism of load management
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was reported last week that the NBA and NBPA were considering a rule change that would focus on reducing load management by making regular-season awards dependent on a player's number of games played.
While Bryant was retired for three years when he made his load management comments, Edwards' playing career is just taking off.
The 21-year-old is only in his third NBA season and has been one of the most durable players in the league since being selected No.
Jaylen Nowell is the only other Timberwolves player to appear in every game this season.
Barring injury, it doesn't look like Edwards will be on the bench any time soon, as the Timberwolves can't afford to have one of their best players miss action.

     Anthony Edwards becomes hero to fans because he wants to play every game — an NBA rarity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And rising Wolves star Anthony Edwards gave voice to the reason in the company of his star peers over the weekend.
Edwards has played all 60 games for the Wolves this season, battling through ailments along the way.
If an NBA player is legitimately injured, he of course shouldn't play.
As Edwards noted, with fans thanking him on social media for his attitude and declaration, it's disappointing when a star player misses the game you are at.
But that said: This is just one more reason Wolves fans should be glad Edwards is on their side.

I’ve gotta get that together.”AdvertisementThe self-awareness is a hallmark of Edwards’ game.
AdvertisementIn the locker room after the game, Edwards sat next to his locker mate, Rivers, looping replays of the last play on his phone.
In a quiet locker room after the game, Edwards finally hollered across the room to Reid.
The All-Star game offers players the chance to put on a fashion show upon their arrival, even more so than the average regular season game.
