     Jerry Jeudy Alleged Victim Asks Judge To Dismiss Case, NFL Star's Mug Shot Released
    </h2>

     Summary: The alleged victim in Jerry Jeudy's criminal tampering arrest wants the case thrown out -- telling a judge she's never felt threatened by the NFL star and he never put a finger on her.
The ex-Alabama star was arrested and spent the night in jail ... before appearing in court Friday morning.
The judge imposed a mandatory protection order on Jeudy ... but the alleged victim did NOT request a no-contact order.
Jeudy is set to be released on personal recognizance.
Harvey Steinberg says Jerry Jeudy never should have been arrested.

     Summary: Adam Schefter details the charges Jerry Jeudy is facing after being arrested in the Denver area.
(0:37)ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was arrested Thursday by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department and, according to the Sheriff's Office, was charged with second-degree criminal tampering with a domestic violence enhancer, a misdemeanor.
Brown said that, per Colorado law, the domestic violence enhancer was added to the charge because of the relationship between Jeudy and the woman.
Also per Colorado law, the domestic violence enhancer prevents release at least until an appearance before a judge.
Brown said deputies were dispatched to an Arapahoe County residence at 10:15 a.m. as a "keep the peace" request.

     Broncos’ Jerry Jeudy arrested on misdemeanor after dispute

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER | Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was arrested Thursday on a misdemeanor charge after a dispute with his girlfriend at their suburban Denver home and he was being held at the Arapahoe County Jail, which is next to the team’s training complex.
Jeudy, the Broncos’ first-round draft pick out of Alabama in 2020, was being held on suspicion of second-degree criminal tampering with a domestic-violence enhancer, a misdemeanor.
Because of the domestic violence enhancer, Jeudy couldn’t be released on bond until appearing before a judge, she said.
Brown, who called the charge a “very low-level misdemeanor,” said he called the news conference to clarify a couple of points, including that there was no physical violence involved.
“The second portion of this is a domestic violence enhancer and I know the word ‘violence’ connotates physical contact.

     Broncos' Jerry Jeudy arrest: Victim asks judge to drop charges in domestic dispute case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mother of Jerry Jeudy’s 1-month-old child asked an Arapahoe County judge on Friday to dismiss the case against the Denver Broncos wide receiver, saying she never felt threatened during the domestic dispute that led to the 23-year-old’s arrest Thursday.
The victim told Judge Chantel Contiguglia that she made contact with authorities to “monitor the situation” but that Jeudy never made physical contact during the dispute.
Contiguglia did not immediately dismiss the case against Jeudy, who was arrested Thursday on a misdemeanor second-degree criminal tampering charge that included a domestic violence sentence enhancer.
She imposed a mandatory protection order, though the victim said she did not want a no-contact order.
Alongside wide receiver Courtland Sutton, Jeudy is expected is thrive this season with new quarterback Russell Wilson under center.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brown said the arrest happened too late in the day for the case to be fully processed and for Jeudy to see a judge on Thursday.
A police document obtained by Denver7 said after an argument on Wednesday night, Jeudy put the woman’s wallet, baby formula, and their 1-month-old child’s medical paperwork in his car and locked it.
After the hearing, Steinberg said he would be surprised if the case proceeds much further against Jeudy.
“It should only apply where there’s a threat of violence, there’s actual violence, or attempted violence.
“Hopefully people will understand that sometimes bad things happen to good people, and that’s what this case is,” Steinberg said.
