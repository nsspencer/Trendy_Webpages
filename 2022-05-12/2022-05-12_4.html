     Summary: The 2022 NFL schedule is upon us, and now we march towards fall.
This year gives us some truly fascinating matchups, and these are the games I’m circling on the calendar as can’t-miss.
Bills vs. Chiefs — Week 6Hell yeah I’ll take a rematch of the AFC Divisional Playoff game between these two, which was without a doubt the best game of the year.
Meanwhile, assuming Watson isn’t suspended by the NFL, this game is a litmus test for Cleveland’s chances to make a run.
Rams vs. Chiefs — Week 12These two teams are the measuring stick by which their respective divisions are measured — even now.
