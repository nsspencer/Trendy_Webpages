     The Milky Way’s Black Hole Comes to Light
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The center of the Milky Way coincides with a faint source of radio noise called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star).
If it was not a black hole, neither Einstein nor anyone else knew what it could be.
Chasing a shadowProving that it was a black hole was another job entirely.
But ionized electrons and protons in interstellar space scatter the radio waves into a blur that obscures details of the source.
To see deeper into the black hole shadow, researchers needed to be able to tune their radio telescopes to shorter wavelengths that could penetrate the haze.

     Black hole: First picture of Milky Way monster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mass of a black hole determines the size of its accretion disc, or emission ring.
The hole lives in the central brightness depression.
Its "surface" is called the event horizon, the boundary inside which even a light-ray is bent back on itself by the curvature in space-time.
Brighter regions in the accretion disc are where light gains energy as it moves towards us, and is said to be doppler boosted

     Summary: This is the first image of the black hole at the heart of the Milky WayEnlarge this image toggle caption EHT Collaboration EHT CollaborationFor years, the supermassive black hole in the dark center of the Milky Way galaxy has been theorized about and studied — and finally, it's been captured in an image.
"We finally have the first look at our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius A*," an international team of astrophysicists and researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope team announced on Thursday.
"It's the dawn of a new era of black hole physics," it added.
To obtain the image, scientists used observations from April 2017, when all eight observatories were pointed at the black hole.
Still, she said, the two black holes are very different from one another — for one thing, the Milky Way's black hole isn't as voracious.

     Astronomers capture 1st image of Milky Way’s huge black hole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getting a good image was a challenge; previous efforts found the black hole too jumpy.
The picture also confirms Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity: The black hole is precisely the size that Einstein’s equations dictate.
Scientists had expected the Milky Way’s black hole to be more violent, especially since the only other image from another galaxy shows a far bigger and more active black hole.
The Milky Way black hole is called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star).
The Milky Way black hole is much closer, about 27,000 light-years away.

     Summary: From that observation data, which was then crunched by supercomputer algorithms, came the image of the M87 black hole as well as the one just released.
M87 is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Galaxy cluster and has a mass about 6.5 billion times that of our sun.
It’s like looking at something through frosted glass.”“This is our supermassive black hole.
The averaged image retains features more commonly seen in the varied images and suppresses features that appeared less frequently.
The members of the group say they are now looking at a next-generation EHT (ngEHT) project: capturing video of a black hole.

     1st image of supermassive black hole at the center of Milky Way galaxy revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —For the first time, astronomers have captured an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.
It’s the first direct observation confirming the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.
Black holes don’t emit light, but the image shows the shadow of the black hole surrounded by a bright ring, which is light bent by the gravity of the black hole.
The bright center, surrounded by pink clouds, indicates the location of its black hole and areas of star birth.
Capturing a black hole in motion can show how it changes over time and what the gas does as it swirls around a black hole.
