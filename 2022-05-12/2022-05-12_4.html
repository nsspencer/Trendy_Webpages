     Summary: After decades of wartime neutrality, Finland now wants to join NATO without delayEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Augstein/AP Frank Augstein/APIn a joint statement released this morning, Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinistö said Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.
The announcement was widely expected and has broad support in the country: A recent poll showed that about three-quarters of all Finns support joining the military alliance.
The invasion of Ukraine in February prompted Finland, which shares an 830-mile border with Russia, to move away from its long history of neutrality and military nonalignment.
Finland's neighbor Sweden also is considering joining NATO.
On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Finland's entry into NATO a threat to Russia and said it "does not make our continent more stable and safe."

     Finland and Sweden joining NATO will help deter Russia, says security analyst
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision by Finland and Sweden to join NATO will improve deterrence against Russia in northern Europe and add to the U.S.-led military alliance's security, one analyst from Atlantic Council told CNBC on Thursday.
As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance," they said in a joint statement.
"Sweden and Finland joining NATO will increase deterrence in the region because of the assets they will provide the alliance.
And [because of] the ability to plan for Northern Europe's security in a comprehensive manner," said the Atlantic Council's Northern Europe director Anna Weislander.
Membership of the political and military alliance will be a historic decision for Finland, which shares a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia.

     Summary: Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin issued a joint announcement on Thursday backing NATO membership.
We believe NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” the leaders said in a statement.
Finland’s decision-making process on NATO membership is being informed by 10 separate parliamentary committees.
These committees are primed to submit their opinions on NATO membership to the Government’s Foreign Affairs Committee by May 15.
These are some of the benefits of NATO membership if we decide to join,” said Hultqvist.

     How the addition of Finland and Sweden would change NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How does the probable addition of Finland — and the likely subsequent addition of Sweden — reshape the power balance between Russia and NATO?
Curious what the addition of Finland and Sweden adds to NATO, I pulled data to see.
NATO is not contiguous, so land area is not a particularly useful metric, but aggregating the size of NATO countries relative to Russia is instructive.
With Finland and Sweden, the size of NATO countries is only 1.4 times the size of Russia in its entirety.
The addition of Finland and Sweden, however, wouldn’t change that much.

     Summary: Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency”.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession.
The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland’s membership application.
Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would “strengthen Nato and our common security”.
Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls.
The NATO chief said he agreed with Niinisto and Marin, "that NATO membership would strengthen both NATO and Finland's security."
Russia has previously warned both countries against joining NATO, saying there would be consequences.
Finland joining NATO would have both practical and symbolic consequences for Russia and the Western alliance.
