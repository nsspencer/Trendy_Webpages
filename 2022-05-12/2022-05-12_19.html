     Matt LaFleur eyes challenges of Packers' 2022 schedule, rematch with Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Matt LaFleur isn't shying away from the importance of a few more dates on Green Bay's calendar this fall.
Green Bay travels to Tampa to face the team that has held the upper hand in their last two meetings: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
"We did play them two years ago twice," LaFleur said during an appearance on NFL Network's '22 Schedule Release.
Green Bay is making its first appearance in Europe in franchise history, but it's not unfamiliar territory to LaFleur.
"Well, it's actually personally my third time going, you know, over to England," the Packers coach said.

     The Packers' full 2022 schedule is out. Here's the lowdown on opponents, game dates and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers will play on two holidays this season, Christmas and New Year's, and have only five noon games, and only one of them at Lambeau Field.
The Nov. 17 game is on a Thursday night, not the optimal time for Gold package holders, who are largely from southern Wisconsin.
The Packers will play five prime-time games, as well as their first game in the United Kingdom.
The New Year's Day game is at Lambeau, however, which could cut into some New Year's Eve celebrations.
Green Bay will play the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams on Dec. 19 at Lambeau, which can't hurt the Packers' chances.

     Summary: "The season is hopefully going to be one of those seasons where our guys kind of bond together as we go through it," Gutekunst said.
"Because obviously the ultimate goal is getting to that second season of the playoffs."
LaFleur will certainly adjust the practice schedule while he monitors the team's workload, as he's always done and which the players greatly appreciate.
But with this schedule, the players inevitably will be wiped come mid-November.
"Hopefully we've got a lot to play for during that time," Gutekunst said.

     Summary: The NFL's schedule-makers did the Green Bay Packers no favors in placing their bye weeks.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – It’s not who you play but when you play them.
From that perspective, the Green Bay Packers’ challenging schedule looks even more challenging.
Tom Bliss, a data scientist for the NFL, examined each team’s rest advantage.
If Team A plays on Sunday and Team B plays on Sunday, when Team A plays Team B the following week, there is no advantage.
