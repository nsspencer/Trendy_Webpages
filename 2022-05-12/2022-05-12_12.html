     Biden Administration Cancels Drilling Sales in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is canceling oil drilling lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, triggering furious responses from Republicans, who are blaming President Biden’s energy policies for high gas prices.
The decisions come at a challenging time for the Biden administration.
Surging prices at the pump have compounded inflationary pressures for consumers, which Mr. Biden this week said will be his top domestic priority.
The leasing program presents a dilemma for Mr. Biden.
At the same time, he has taken steps to increase oil supplies to try to bring down gas prices, including calling on the oil industry to pump more crude.

     Interior Department cancels offshore oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Biden administration announced Wednesday it would cancel three upcoming offshore oil and gas leases -- two in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska -- over a lack of interest and delays.
However, Biden officials have also emphasized the need for more domestic oil production to combat high gasoline prices, which have angered the public and inflamed inflation.
The Biden administration's five-year offshore drilling plan is set to expire next month, and as of yet, the Department of Interior has not indicated when a new one will be released.
While recently testifying in front of Congress, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the plan still needed "significant" work, and she didn't give a date for when the department would release it.
In a statement Wednesday, Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz cited a lack of industry interest as the reason Interior was abandoning the Cook Inlet sale.

     Biden administration scraps 3 offshore oil and gas lease sales in Alaska, Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration has announced it will ax three planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Cook Inlet, effectively halting the potential to sell drilling leases in coastal waters this year, several media outlets report.
"I’m glad Cook Inlet belugas won’t be forced to face even more oil drilling in their only habitats, but much more must be done to protect these endangered whales from offshore drilling,” Monsell said.
"It's good for Cook Inlet because offshore drilling is dangerous and disruptive.
And it's good for the people of Cook Inlet, including native people, who cherish the inlet in its natural state.
Lease sales in the area were canceled in 2006, 2008 and 2010, and lack of industry interest was cited at that time as well, according to The Hill.

     Interior cancels oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Interior Department said it will not move forward with three planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, meaning the administration will not hold a lease sale on coastal waters this year.
“Due to lack of industry interest in leasing in the area, the Department will not move forward with the proposed Cook Inlet OCS oil and gas lease sale 258” or the Cook Inlet project, DOI said.
It also comes at a difficult time for the oil and gas market.
Another major concern from industry groups is that the administration has not yet drawn an offshore program replacement plan ahead of the June expiration date.
A lapse in the five-year program could drive down production by roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a March analysis by API and the National Ocean Industries Association.

     Summary: (The Hill) – The Interior Department will not move forward with planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, it announced Wednesday night.
A spokesperson for the department confirmed the Cook Inlet lease sale would not proceed due to insufficient industry interest.
Meanwhile, the planned sale of two leases, lease 259 and lease 261, in the Gulf of Mexico will not proceed due to contradictory court rulings on the leases, the spokesperson confirmed.
Shortly after taking office, President Biden signed an executive order freezing all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands.
Meanwhile, in January, the Washington, D.C., District Court invalidated another Gulf of Mexico lease sold by the federal government, lease 257.

     Biden Cancels Offshore Oil Lease Sales in Gulf Coast, Alaska
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By MATTHEW DALY, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, removing millions of acres from possible drilling as U.S. gas prices reach record highs.
Louisiana and 12 other states challenged Biden’s order, saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters.
“New leasing will not lower current gas prices,'' countered Dustin Renaud, a spokesman for the environmental coalition Healthy Gulf.
The administration has appealed Doughty's ruling, but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly Western states.
Interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five-year plan.

     Summary: The Biden administration has canceled one of the most high-profile oil and gas lease opportunities pending before the Interior Department.
Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, wrote that "the Cook inlet sale was canceled.

And it's good for the people of Cook Inlet, including native people, who cherish the inlet in its natural state.
