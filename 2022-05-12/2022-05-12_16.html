     Friday the 13th Producer Puts Odds of New Movie at "50-50" After Legal Battle

     Summary: ✖Tomorrow will mark Friday the 13th, the 28th time that the "unlucky holiday" has arrived since the last movie in the Friday the 13th feature film series was released.
Central to the continued arguments is the status of Jason Voorhees the killer.
Voorhees also famously did not wear his signature hockey mask until the third film in the series, which Miller did not write.
This leaves the question up in the air, who owns the adult Jason Voorhees?
Jason was very much a presence in Miller's film.

     ‘Friday the 13th’ – Here’s What Victor Miller Can (and Might) Do With His Part of the Franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With another Friday the 13th upon us, it’s only natural that we’re once again talking about the Friday the 13th franchise.
As most horror fans know by now, the film franchise has been held up for several years now in a legal battle between Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller and Friday the 13th director Sean Cunningham, with the rights currently split between them.
Here’s a little backstory/recap, as this one gets a bit confusing…Ever since a judge ruled back in 2018 that Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller is the sole owner of the original screenplay (in the US, at least), Friday director Sean Cunningham has been working to have the decision reversed.
In other words, Miller only has young Jason Voorhees at his disposal, so he could theoretically work with filmmakers on a project involving Jason’s early years – before the mask.
I doubt it.”As for what Sean Cunningham is able to do without Victor Miller, it would seem that he can’t use Jason Voorhees without Miller’s permission, which ties his hands quite a bit.

     Jason lives? The court battle that's killing 'Friday the 13th'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As King James was conquering the court, Jason Voorhees was stuck in one, the subject of a legal battle that has left the horror franchise in limbo.
"I love that my two passions intersect, copyright law and 'Friday the 13th'," Zerner said.
A court sided with Miller, but in interviews with CNN, Cunningham and Miller's attorney reveal why Jason may not have hacked his way out of court just yet.
After an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling in September, Miller, the screenwriter, was awarded the copyright for the script and characters associated with the original "Friday the 13th" film.
The court concluded that Miller completed the "Friday the 13th" script for Cunningham as a contract worker.
