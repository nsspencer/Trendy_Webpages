     Dune: Part II has found its emperor in Christopher Walken
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film is a sweeping epic that introduces a new take on Paul Atreides at the beginning of his path to becoming a legend, but the movie’s careful to keep a number of details and characters from Frank Herbert’s original novel shrouded in secret.
Deadline reports that Christopher Walken has signed on to Dune: Part II to portray the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV who is initially responsible for sending Paul Atreides’ father Leto to the planet Arrakis.
In Herbert’s novel, House Harkonnen and the emperor are both shocked when they learn of the Fremen’s continued resistance on Arrakis following an attempt at eliminating House Atreides.
Considering how Dune: Part II is meant to cover elements from the book that the first film didn’t get around to, the emperor’s not going to be the only interesting new part of the story.
But he’ll definitely be one of the most important parts when Dune: Part II hits theaters on October 20th, 2023.

     Dune: Part 2 – Christopher Walken Is Perfect Choice for a God Emperor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his title, he is not quite evil incarnate like Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi (which the Dune novel clearly inspired).
And few acting turns can be as strange as those from Walken when he’s given the right material.
In the film, Walken will also play father to Princess Irulan (Pugh), the Bene Gesserit-trained royal heir to the Padishah Emperor and skilled courtier and historian with motives of her own.
In the first Dune movie, Chalamet’s Paul entertained the idea of demanding a royal marriage with Irulan to bind his house to the emperor’s Corrino clan.
One might say fans have a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell Christopher Walken.

     Christopher Walken Cast in ‘Dune: Part Two,’ Just as Fatboy Slim Prophesied
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christopher Walken will portray the Emperor of the universe in Dune: Part Two, the upcoming second installment of director Denis Villenueve’s Oscar-nominated space epic.
Walken is the latest actor to join the cast for Dune: Part Two, following Florence Pugh (who will star as the Emperor’s daughter Princess Irulan) and Austin Butler (playing Feyd-Rautha, or the character Sting played in David Lynch’s Dune in 1984).
The cast also includes Part One stars Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin and Rebecca Ferguson, the Hollywood Reporter writes.
While Emperor Shaddam IV plays a large role in author Frank Herbert’s Dune novel, the character didn’t appear in the first part of Villenueve’s Dune, building anticipation for the villain’s arrival.
Thanks in part to Walken’s gyrations to the Dune quote, the visual would later win Best Music Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards.
