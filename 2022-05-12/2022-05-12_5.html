     Summary: BOSTON (AP) — Brad Marchand scored one goal and assisted on another, and Jeremy Swayman stopped 23 shots to lead the Boston Bruins past the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 on Thursday night and send their first-round playoff series to a decisive seventh game.
The home team has won all six games in the series so far — an edge for Carolina, which will host Game 7 on Saturday.
The winner will play either the Penguins or Rangers in the Eastern Conference semifinals; Pittsburgh leads that series 3-2 heading into Game 6 on Friday night.
Svechnikov made it a one-goal game early in the third before Haula and Forbort gave Boston back its cushion.
NOTES: Bruins defenseman Hampus Lindholm returned after missing the last three games after a hit to the head.
