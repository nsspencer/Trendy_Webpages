     Summary: They host the 49ers, visit the Raiders, host the Colts on Thursday night and visit the Chargers on a long week.
Then the Broncos host the Jets and meet the Jaguars in London, so that’s a winnable stretch before the favorable Week 9 bye.
But they come out of it with a trip to Tennessee, which should be a good matchup for a Broncos team that was perceived to be a quarterback shy of contention.
The Broncos host the Chiefs and Cardinals before visiting the Rams and Chiefs and closing out the season with a home game against the Chargers.
That will be one of the toughest stretches of the season for any team.
