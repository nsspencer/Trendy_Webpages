     Kendrick Lamar Returns With ‘Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last Sunday, Lamar released a new music video, “The Heart Part 5,” as a teaser for “Mr.
Morale.” It has a spoken prologue stating “life is perspective” and then shows Lamar’s face melding with those of a series of Black men of varying levels of cultural heroism or controversy: O.J.
It shows Lamar, in a crown of thorns, holding a child while a woman on a bed nurses a baby, like an allegorical religious painting.
To some extent, those may also serve as clues for the next stage of Lamar’s career.
Morale” will be his last album for Top Dawg Entertainment, or TDE, Lamar’s home since the beginning of his career, which has released his music in partnership with Interscope.
