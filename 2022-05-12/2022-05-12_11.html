     ‘Friday the 13th’ – Here’s What Victor Miller Can (and Might) Do With His Part of the Franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With another Friday the 13th upon us, it’s only natural that we’re once again talking about the Friday the 13th franchise.
As most horror fans know by now, the film franchise has been held up for several years now in a legal battle between Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller and Friday the 13th director Sean Cunningham, with the rights currently split between them.
Here’s a little backstory/recap, as this one gets a bit confusing…Ever since a judge ruled back in 2018 that Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller is the sole owner of the original screenplay (in the US, at least), Friday director Sean Cunningham has been working to have the decision reversed.
In other words, Miller only has young Jason Voorhees at his disposal, so he could theoretically work with filmmakers on a project involving Jason’s early years – before the mask.
I doubt it.”As for what Sean Cunningham is able to do without Victor Miller, it would seem that he can’t use Jason Voorhees without Miller’s permission, which ties his hands quite a bit.

A court sided with Miller, but in interviews with CNN, Cunningham and Miller's attorney reveal why Jason may not have hacked his way out of court just yet.
After an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling in September, Miller, the screenwriter, was awarded the copyright for the script and characters associated with the original "Friday the 13th" film.
The court concluded that Miller completed the "Friday the 13th" script for Cunningham as a contract worker.

     Summary: The murder cast an awful shadow over the land and brought a fresh sentiment along with the number 13, which represented the unwanted 13th guest.
It was a bad, unlucky day,” Dossey explained to Euronews.
Considered a ‘complete number’, 12 is often viewed as a perfect point of reference, appearing regularly in religious and cultural contexts.
The number 13, for lack of a better phrase, isn’t quite so lucky.
While there is no exact reason as to why Friday the 13th is considered unlucky, there are some commonly held theories.
