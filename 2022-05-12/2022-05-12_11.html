     Here's Who Might Replace Ezra Miller in 'The Flash'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's Who Might Replace Ezra Miller in The FlashWith Ezra Miller facing more and more legal trouble and making themself look worse and worse, some fans are starting to wonder whether Warner Bros. will replace the queer actor in their role as the Flash in the DC Extended Universe.
And now we have an idea who they might replace Miller with.
According to Screengeek, Warner Bros. is considering replacing Miller with actor Dylan O’Brien.
However, this does come into conflict with earlier reports that the studio was not worried about replacing Miller, even after their second arrest in Hawaii.
For now, it seems like Warner Bros. isn’t planning on replacing Miller anytime soon.

     The Flash: Should DC Recast Ezra Miller and Move Forward?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Miller has gotten himself into a surplus of trouble over the past few years (with the public and the law), resulting in the film continuously being rescheduled.
In 2022, Ezra Miller has already been arrested twice -- once in March and then again in April.
Now, nobody ever really named names, but several prolific directors have dropped out of the project, and Ezra Miller (the face of The Flash franchise) is still around.
Regardless of what happens with the role, it's conclusive to say that fans are running out of patience when it comes to getting a standalone Flash film.
And Ezra Miller is running out of time on the benefit of the doubt.
