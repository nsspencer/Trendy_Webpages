     Bethesda’s Starfield and Redfall have been delayed to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Starfield, the biggest upcoming title from Microsoft-owned Bethesda, has been delayed to the first half of 2023, according to a tweet from the studio.
The game was originally set to launch on November 11th, 2022, an homage to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’s release date.
It’s likely that both games will be shown off in Bethesda’s upcoming games showcase on June 12th, so this early announcement is likely meant to set expectations ahead of time.
At this point, it’s almost expected that any game’s tentative release date may be pushed, regardless of the company.
For example, the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was recently pushed from its planned holiday release to 2023.

     'Starfield' delay is the best news about the game — here's why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meant to launch a new sci-fi universe for the developer, Starfield is also seen as a flagship game of the Xbox Series X|S.
Even before Cyberpunk approached its eventual launch, when it was still suffering multiple delays, we had seen far more of the game than we’ve currently seen of Starfield.
Everything Bethesda has said about Starfield suggests a game with Cyberpunk 2077-level ambitions, and that comes with the potential for a Cyberpunk 2077-level disaster.
If you were planning to play Starfield on Xbox Game Pass, you have even more options, with a dozen or more new games being added every month.
Now is a great time to check out Xbox Game Pass’ incredible selection of indie games like Citizen Sleeper.
