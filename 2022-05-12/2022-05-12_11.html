     Summary: Pop legend Madonna and NFT artist Beeple have combined talents to create the Mother of Creation NFT project, in which a tree grows out of the singing icon's vagina.
One sees a digital Madonna give birth to a tree, another butterflies escape her vagina and in the third a mechanical centipede scurries from her lady garden.
*You can watch it for yourself at the Madonna X Beeple Mother of Creation NFT page.
