     Biden Administration Cancels Drilling Sales in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is canceling oil drilling lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, triggering furious responses from Republicans, who are blaming President Biden’s energy policies for high gas prices.
The decisions come at a challenging time for the Biden administration.
Surging prices at the pump have compounded inflationary pressures for consumers, which Mr. Biden this week said will be his top domestic priority.
The leasing program presents a dilemma for Mr. Biden.
At the same time, he has taken steps to increase oil supplies to try to bring down gas prices, including calling on the oil industry to pump more crude.

     Biden administration scraps 3 offshore oil and gas lease sales in Alaska, Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration has announced it will ax three planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Cook Inlet, effectively halting the potential to sell drilling leases in coastal waters this year, several media outlets report.
"I’m glad Cook Inlet belugas won’t be forced to face even more oil drilling in their only habitats, but much more must be done to protect these endangered whales from offshore drilling,” Monsell said.
"It's good for Cook Inlet because offshore drilling is dangerous and disruptive.
And it's good for the people of Cook Inlet, including native people, who cherish the inlet in its natural state.
Lease sales in the area were canceled in 2006, 2008 and 2010, and lack of industry interest was cited at that time as well, according to The Hill.

     Interior Nixes Lease Sales in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David Merron/Getty ImagesIn a big win for Alaskan and Gulf of Mexico communities, the Department of Interior is cancelling three oil and gas lease sales off the coasts of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Interior’s move away from dirty energy is a key step; next it should commit to no new offshore leasing and investing in a clean energy future.
After decades of offshore oil development, onshore refining, and chemical manufacturing, the health of communities around the Gulf region is suffering.
The Gulf is still recovering from the catastrophic BP oil spill, and continued exploitation of offshore oil perpetuates the risk of another crisis.
We expect the Department of Interior to release its five-year plan for offshore oil and gas development in the next month.

     Summary: The Biden administration has canceled one of the most high-profile oil and gas lease opportunities pending before the Interior Department.
Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, wrote that "the Cook inlet sale was canceled.
The Alaska offshore lease arrangement would have opened drilling opportunities over a span of more than 1 million acres for 40 or more years of production.
And it's good for the people of Cook Inlet, including native people, who cherish the inlet in its natural state.
We need to end offshore oil leasing."

     Interior Department cancels offshore oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The Biden administration announced Wednesday it would cancel three upcoming offshore oil and gas leases – two in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska – over a lack of interest and delays.
In a statement Wednesday, Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz cited a lack of industry interest as the reason Interior was abandoning the Cook Inlet sale.
“Due to lack of industry interest in leasing in the area, the Department will not move forward with the proposed Cook Inlet [Outer Continental Shelf] oil and gas lease sale 258,” Schwartz said.
The same source noted sales dating back to 2004 in which there has been little to no industry interest in the Cook Inlet region.
While the administration announced it would restart a dramatically smaller area of onshore oil and gas leases in April, the latest cancellations suggest that the future of the federal government’s offshore oil and gas leasing this year is very much in doubt.

     Biden Cancels Offshore Oil Lease Sales in Gulf Coast, Alaska
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By MATTHEW DALY, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, removing millions of acres from possible drilling as U.S. gas prices reach record highs.
Louisiana and 12 other states challenged Biden’s order, saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters.
“New leasing will not lower current gas prices,'' countered Dustin Renaud, a spokesman for the environmental coalition Healthy Gulf.
The administration has appealed Doughty's ruling, but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly Western states.
Interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five-year plan.

     Biden pulls 3 offshore oil lease sales, curbing new drilling this year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Interior cannot hold any new oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a replacement plan.
The program’s looming expiration means the government doesn’t have enough time left to hold the three remaining oil and gas lease sales scheduled under the current plan.
Even if Interior held the three planned offshore lease sales, it typically takes years for companies to drill new wells and ramp up production.
Oil and gas industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers have tried to blame high gas prices on the president’s climate policies.
Interior held one more in November, auctioning off 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico in the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in the nation’s history.
