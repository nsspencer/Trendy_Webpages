     The Milky Way’s Black Hole Comes to Light
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Einstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be speckled with black holes.
Astronomers still do not understand how these supermassive black holes have grown so big.
Paradoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.
Materials — gas, dust, shredded stars — that fall into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.
Some of that matter falls into the black hole, but part of it is squirted out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.

     Summary: This is the first image of the black hole at the heart of the Milky WayEnlarge this image toggle caption EHT Collaboration EHT CollaborationFor years, the supermassive black hole in the dark center of the Milky Way galaxy has been theorized about and studied — and finally, it's been captured in an image.
"We finally have the first look at our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius A*," an international team of astrophysicists and researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope team announced on Thursday.
"It's the dawn of a new era of black hole physics," it added.
To obtain the image, scientists used observations from April 2017, when all eight observatories were pointed at the black hole.
Still, she said, the two black holes are very different from one another — for one thing, the Milky Way's black hole isn't as voracious.

     Summary: Now that the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration has released its image of the Milky Way's black hole, the team is focusing on making movies of the two photographed black holes and finding other distant black holes large enough to studyThe image of the Milky’s Way’s black hole, Sagittarius A*, with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the foreground ESO/Jos?
Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org), EHT CollaborationOn 12 May, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) revealed the first close-up picture of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.
Although they do have some data they could use, there currently isn’t enough to make movies of the black holes, she said.
Work is ongoing to spot other supermassive black holes the researchers could observe and compare to these two.
Based on statistical studies, there should be other black holes that are enormous enough and not too distant for the EHT to resolve, but researchers haven’t found them yet.

     Summary: Getting a good image was a challenge; previous efforts found the black hole too jumpy.
The picture also confirms Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity: The black hole is precisely the size that Einstein’s equations dictate.
Scientists had expected the Milky Way’s black hole to be more violent, especially since the only other image from another galaxy shows a far bigger and more active black hole.
The Milky Way black hole is called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star).
The Milky Way black hole is much closer, about 27,000 light-years away.

     Simulation meets observation in first image of the supermassive black hole at our galaxy’s center – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As countless science and general news outlets have reported today, the image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, is a fabulous scientific achievement.
To get effective parallax on a black hole 27,000 light-years away, you’d need to go quite a distance and probably break the laws of physics in the process.
In this case the alignment question being looked at is of inherent scientific value but could also help interpret, for example, the interference caused by gases and dust swirling around the black hole.
“And that would indicate that the spin axis of the black hole is not aligned with the spin axis of the galaxy as a whole, and if you believe what I said earlier, the disk does prefer to be aligned with the spin axis of the black hole.
In one of the papers released today, the team describes building seven different potential morphologies for the black hole, reflecting different arrangements of its matter, from ring to disc and even a sort of binary black hole — why not, right?

     Milky Way vs M87: Event Horizon Telescope photos show 2 very different monster black holes

Sagittarius A* in photos: The Milky Way's monster black hole discovery in imagesA comparison of Event Horizon Telescope views of the black holes at the center of the galaxy M87, on the left, and of the one in the Milky Way, at right.
(Image credit: EHT Collaboration)In particular, the two black holes differ in how difficult it is to image material moving around its boundary, or event horizon.
The turbulence in this region is determined by the black hole's appetite, which varies despite the popular conception that all black holes guzzle with the suction of a cosmic vacuum cleaner.
"When we look at the heart of each black hole, we find a bright ring surrounding the black hole shadow," Özel said.

     Supercomputing an Image of Our Galaxy's Supermassive Black Hole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A* (yes, the asterisk is part of it!)
This array was conglomerated with the distinct purpose of directly observing a black hole for the first time—and, indeed, in April 2019, they did just that, obtaining an image of a black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, around 55 million light-years from Earth.
To help, the researchers turned to supercomputing, building the largest-ever simulation library of black holes.
These models—based on the known physical properties of black holes, general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics and more—were aimed at simulating what the EHT would see based on researchers’ best understandings of what black holes should look like to such instruments.
“It’s remarkable because it explains not only the Event Horizon data, but data taken by other instruments.

     Summary: Sagittarius A* sits at the the center of our Milky Way galaxy, in the direction of the Sagittarius constellation.
Their motions suggested that at the center of the Milky Way was a black hole 4 million times the mass of the Sun.
The size of a black hole is defined by its event horizon – a distance from the center of the black hole within which nothing can escape.
The Milky Way’s black hole is huge compared to the black holes left behind when massive stars die.
But black holes are surrounded by clouds of gas, and astronomers can measure this gas to infer images of the black holes within.
