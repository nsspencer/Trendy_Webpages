     The Flash: Should DC Recast Ezra Miller and Move Forward?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Miller has gotten himself into a surplus of trouble over the past few years (with the public and the law), resulting in the film continuously being rescheduled.
In 2022, Ezra Miller has already been arrested twice -- once in March and then again in April.
Now, nobody ever really named names, but several prolific directors have dropped out of the project, and Ezra Miller (the face of The Flash franchise) is still around.
Regardless of what happens with the role, it's conclusive to say that fans are running out of patience when it comes to getting a standalone Flash film.
And Ezra Miller is running out of time on the benefit of the doubt.
