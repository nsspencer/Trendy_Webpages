     Friday the 13th tattoo tradition continues

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - The oldest tattoo shop in Nevada is continuing a long-standing Friday the 13th tradition.
Body Graphics Tattoo is offering $13 tattoos with a $7 tip.
Usually, Friday the 13th tattoos include the number 13, but many of the options this time around don’t.
The event usually means long lines for tattoo shops, but Body Graphics Tattoo doesn’t rake in a lot of money.
“We try to hook people up,” said Jesse Martynuik, owner of Body Graphics Tattoo Shop.

     Summary: Friday the 13th: a bad day for luck, but a good day for cheap tattoos.
Friday lands on the 13th of a month up to three times each year, and some tattoo and piercing parlors mark the superstitious holiday with discounted tattoos.
Friday the 13th:A holiday love storyWhy are there tattoo deals on Friday the 13th?
According to Vice, the tradition of the Friday the 13th tattoo flash sale is widely credited to tattoo artist Oliver Peck, who, in 1995, held a 24-hour tattooing bonanza at the now-defunct Pair O' Dice tattoo shop in Dallas, offering customers $13 tattoos.
Walk-in customers can find Friday the 13th flash sales today at Beelistic Tattoo's Clifton, Corryville and Mount Washington locations, and at Hive Tattoo Collective in West Chester.

     Why Jason X Is a Perfect Friday the 13th Sequel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason feels less like the creation of craven Hollywood producers and more like a boogeyman conjured by 11-year-olds trying to freak each other out.
By setting the movie in (the then-future of) 2008 and 2453, Jason X leans into the legend of Jason.
Thanks to its overstuffed cast, Jason X sends plenty of bodies to hit the floor.
The first occurs fairly early in the movie when Jason awakens aboard The Grendel.
It’s this second kill that makes Jason X the ideal movie to rewatch.

     ‘Friday the 13th’ – Here’s What Victor Miller Can (and Might) Do With His Part of the Franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With another Friday the 13th upon us, it’s only natural that we’re once again talking about the Friday the 13th franchise.
As most horror fans know by now, the film franchise has been held up for several years now in a legal battle between Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller and Friday the 13th director Sean Cunningham, with the rights currently split between them.
Here’s a little backstory/recap, as this one gets a bit confusing…Ever since a judge ruled back in 2018 that Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller is the sole owner of the original screenplay (in the US, at least), Friday director Sean Cunningham has been working to have the decision reversed.
In other words, Miller only has young Jason Voorhees at his disposal, so he could theoretically work with filmmakers on a project involving Jason’s early years – before the mask.
I doubt it.”As for what Sean Cunningham is able to do without Victor Miller, it would seem that he can’t use Jason Voorhees without Miller’s permission, which ties his hands quite a bit.
