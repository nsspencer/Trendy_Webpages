     The Packers' full 2022 schedule is out. Here's the lowdown on opponents, game dates and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers will play on two holidays this season, Christmas and New Year's, and have only five noon games, and only one of them at Lambeau Field.
The NFL released its full schedule Thursday night after a day of anxious leaking all over social media.
The games against the Patriots on Oct. 2 and the Titans on Nov. 17 are the Gold package games for Packers season ticket holders.
The Packers will play five prime-time games, as well as their first game in the United Kingdom.
Green Bay will play the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams on Dec. 19 at Lambeau, which can't hurt the Packers' chances.

     Summary: The NFL's schedule-makers did the Green Bay Packers no favors in placing their bye weeks.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – It’s not who you play but when you play them.
From that perspective, the Green Bay Packers’ challenging schedule looks even more challenging.
Tom Bliss, a data scientist for the NFL, examined each team’s rest advantage.
If Team A plays on Sunday and Team B plays on Sunday, when Team A plays Team B the following week, there is no advantage.

     Summary: "The season is hopefully going to be one of those seasons where our guys kind of bond together as we go through it," Gutekunst said.
"Because obviously the ultimate goal is getting to that second season of the playoffs."
LaFleur will certainly adjust the practice schedule while he monitors the team's workload, as he's always done and which the players greatly appreciate.
But with this schedule, the players inevitably will be wiped come mid-November.
"Hopefully we've got a lot to play for during that time," Gutekunst said.
