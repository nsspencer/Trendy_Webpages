     Watch Arsenal Pay Penalty For Clumsy Cedric Soares Challenge In North London Derby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal defender Cedric Soares was punished for a clumsy challenge on Son Heung-min which allowed Tottenham to strike first in Thursday's north London derby.
Spurs went on to win the game 3-0 but the Gunners had more than held their own in the opening 20 minutes.
Then they conceded an unnecessary penalty when Soares barged into Son who was attempting to connect with a Dejan Kulusevski cross.
A lack of discipline had led to Arsenal's concession of the penalty and more hotheadedness saw them reduced to 10 men before half time.
Kane quickly made Tottenham's numerical advantage pay as he headed in his second goal of the game.

     Tottenham vs. Arsenal score: Kane's brace, Son's fine finish shake up race for final Champions League spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pursuit of Champions League qualification for Arsenal is not secured.
And for Tottenham, it isn't quite over just yet.
On Thursday in the North London derby, Spurs battered 10-man Arsenal 3-0 at home to pull within a point of the fourth-place Gunners with two games to go in the Premier League season.
A win for Arsenal would have secured UCL qualification, but a lack of composure when most needed, combined with a smart and effective blueprint for Tottenham saw Spurs dominate from start to finish.
Had it not been for Aaron Ramsdale in goal, the score could have been even less flattering for Arsenal.
