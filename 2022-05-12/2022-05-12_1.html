     Crypto Crash Explained—Why Bitcoin, Luna, Ethereum Prices Plummeting

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both bitcoin and its rival, ethereum, are down about 30 percent in the past seven days.
But the crash led to the near-total collapse of TerraUSD's sister cryptocurrency Luna.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week that financial regulators would soon release a report on the risks of cryptocurrency and other digital assets.
It's why the President signed an [executive order] outlining the first ever whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and opportunities of digital assets.
Reviews of digital assets, including crypto, [are] underway across agencies."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum whales have been actively transacting ETH in the last 24 hours at a pace last seen in January.
According to the chart provided by Santiment, Ethereum whales fired off a total of 2,956 transactions, each valued at $1 million or more on May 11, marking the highest day of whale transactions in nearly five months.
This is the highest day of whale transactions since January, and something to monitor if $ETH drops below $2k for the first time since last July.
https://t.co/FZoTsFJwEn pic.twitter.com/MVFEpzysxN — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 11, 2022Santiment notes that this kind of whale transaction might be something to watch as Ethereum drops beneath the $2,000 mark.
Ethereum suffered liquidations worth $352 million over the last 24 hours.

     Ethereum price drops dramatically as bitcoin and other cryptocurrency hit by major crash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The price of ethereum has dropped dramatically amid a major crash in the cryptocurrency market.
Ethereum, the second biggest digital coin, was hardest hit among the major cryptocurrencies.
It has lost more than 20 per cent in the last 24 hours, with its price dropping below the $2,000 mark that is held as a milestone.
Bitcoin has dropped 12.5 per cent over the last 24 hours, taking it to $26,653 – well below the $30,000 mark that was seen as an important psychological support.
Those difficulties have led the market to drop almost 17 per cent in the last 24 hours – after an already negative few days.

     Summary: Cryptocurrency prices have crashed further, with many major coins losing a quarter of their value in a matter of hours.
What are the current crypto prices?
Investors appear to be moving away from cryptocurrency and towards less risky investments in the face of global inflation.
Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at trading platform eToro, said: “The concern now for cryptoasset investors is when the slide will end.
All crypto investments are risky, but meme coins like Shiba Inu are particularly volatile, and you should be prepared to lose everything you invest.

     Summary: Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money that use mathematics to create a unique piece of code that customers invest in.
The SEC filing, Staff Accounting Bulleting 121, requires crypto platforms to include customer's crypto holdings as assets and liabilities on balance sheets.
As an example, despite its recent plummet, bitcoin has still risen in value by nearly 11,000 per cent since its 2009 creation.
Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money that use mathematics to create a unique piece of code that customers invest in.
As has been proven by their recent plummets in value, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum are very volatile.
