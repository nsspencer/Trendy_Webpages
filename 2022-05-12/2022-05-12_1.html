     Naomi Judd Died of a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound, Her Daughter Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Naomi Judd, the Grammy-winning country music singer, died last month, her daughter Ashley Judd said that she had lost her mother to the “disease of mental illness.” On Thursday, Ms. Judd was more candid, saying in a television interview that her mother had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her home in Tennessee, and encouraging people who are distressed to seek help.
“So that’s really the impetus for this timing.
Otherwise, it’s obviously way too soon.
So that’s important for us to say up front.”Naomi Judd and her other daughter, Wynonna Judd, dominated the country music charts in the 1980s as the mother-daughter duo the Judds.
Naomi Judd, 76, died on April 30, a day before the duo was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
