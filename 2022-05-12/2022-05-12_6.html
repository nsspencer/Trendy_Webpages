     Movie review / ‘FireStarter’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “FireStarter” (M) Half a starKEITH Thomas’ second feature as director delivers many dramatic misfortunes.
Zac Efron plays Andy McGee, the dad of Charlie who, as a babe in arms, could set her environment alight just by disliking it.
When her unusual talent emotionally strains him, he weeps, not tears like the rest of humanity but trickles of blood.
The family – caring dad Andy, mom Vicky (Sydney Lemmon) and Charlie (11-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong who has amassed 18 roles since 2018!)
Anybody who’s stayed to the film’s flaccid finish knows that dousing Charlie in water can deal permanently with her proclivity.

     Review: A new adaptation of ‘Firestarter’ burns quickly but not brightly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is something filmmakers adapting King’s work often miss, as they focus on the big hooks of his books (werewolves!
For the most part, the new version of King’s “Firestarter” is truer to the 1980 novel’s spirit than the 1984 movie adaptation, which was more focused on the raw mechanics of the plot than its larger purpose.
And yet they still can’t figure out how to make their “Firestarter” as full and complex as King’s.
AdvertisementThomas, who previously made the effectively spooky low-budget ghost story “The Vigil,” handles the horror parts of “Firestarter” reasonably well.
Is this “Firestarter” supposed to be a more faithful and keenly felt King adaptation than the 1984 version?

     Firestarter Review – Modern Take on Stephen King's Novel Fails to Ignite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Stephen King renaissance continues with a modern adaptation of his 1980 novel, Firestarter.
While The Vigil director Keith Thomas does get Firestarter off to an energetic and engaging start, this reimaging ultimately fails to ignite.
The exposition of how couple Andy (Zac Efron) and Vicky (Sydney Lemmon) gained supernatural abilities, courtesy of an experiment, gets relayed over the opening credits.
Zac Efron brings a lot to his role, doing a lot of heavy lifting in the front half.
The goodwill built up in the front half gets squandered by the strange narrative and stylistic choices.

     Firestarter Review: A Stephen King Adaptation That Changes A Lot, But Keeps What's Important
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keith Thomas’ Firestarter is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Stephen King, but it’s not the first.
Firestarter changes a number of things from Stephen King's book, but mostly in smart ways.
Also expanded is the role Vicky plays (she’s actually dead at the start of Stephen King’s novel), and it’s a well utilized character as she adds an important perspective in the ensemble.
Ryan Kiera Armstrong proves to be an impressive find (and her reputation grows within the world of Stephen King adaptations, her resume including the scariest scene in Andy Muschietti’s IT Chapter Two).
Firestarter doesn’t rank among the all-time best Stephen King adaptations, but it is an entertaining, well-made, and cinematic interpretation of the book that is far better than its predecessor.

     ‘Firestarter’ and the evolution of the psychic teen girl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The original “Firestarter,” based on the 1980 novel by Stephen King, starred Drew Barrymore as Charlie, an 8-year-old girl who can set things on fire with her mind.
“Carrie” would pave the way for decades of dangerous psychic girls down the line in pop culture.

Seven seasons ensued, with Hart proving the staying power, and ratings clout, of the supernatural teen girl.
Of all the psychic girls in the pop culture landscape, Hermione probably looms largest, inspiring generations of girls to embrace their inner superpowers.
