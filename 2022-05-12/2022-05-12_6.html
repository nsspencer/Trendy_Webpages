     Son Heung-min "not angry" after Antonio Conte sub vs Arsenal

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Son Heung-Min "Not Angry, Just Disappointed" With Antonio Conte Substitution Against ArsenalTottenham forward Son Heung-min has admitted that he was unhappy with Antonio Conte's decision to substitute him off during Thursday's 3-0 win over Arsenal.
Son had helped Spurs build a three-goal lead over the Gunners for the first time in Premier League history.
With individual glory in his sights, Son understandably wanted to play the full game to give himself the best possible chance to overtake Salah.
Son was visibly disappointed as he reluctantly accepted a hug from manager Conte.

     Conte tells Arteta to stop complaining after Holding red in Arsenal defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte urged Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal manager blamed the referee Paul Tierney for jeopardising his team’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League.
“If I say what I think I will be suspended for six months and I want to be on the touchline for our next game on Monday night,” Arteta said.
To Conte, Arteta had no grounds to moan after Arsenal succeeded in getting the original game at Spurs postponed due to a selection crisis even though it was not influenced by positive Covid cases.
I just wanted to keep playing, I just wanted to continue to play.”On Holding’s second yellow card, Son said: “I couldn’t see because I was down.
If there was no yellow card then VAR would check it, but look, for me it was a clear foul and clear yellow card.”

     Arsenal injury news: Latest updates on Gabriel and Ben White ahead of crunch clash against Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal “don’t have enough players in the back” after Gabriel was forced off in Thursday night’s 3-0 defeat to Tottenham.
Arteta was already a defender down, with Ben White only fit enough to start on the bench.
The Arsenal boss said it was not worth “taking a risk” on White at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but hoped he would be able to return against Newcastle.
Gabriel is now a doubt for Monday night’s crucial trip to St James’ Park, which Arsenal cannot afford to lose with Spurs gaining ground.
“He [Gabriel] felt something, so hopefully Ben will be fit, and hopefully we can recover Gaby,” Arteta told Sky Sports.

(2:16)Antonio Conte has told Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal boss voiced his dismay at referee Paul Tierney following Tottenham's 3-0 win over the Gunners.
Tottenham manager Antonio Conte embraces Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta ahead of Thursday's North London derby.
He has just started to do this job and I think that I listen to him complain a lot," Conte said.
Conte hinted at his frustration over having to play Burnley on Sunday lunchtime, a day before Arsenal travel to Newcastle for their next game.

     Summary: Spurs' 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium closed the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal to a single point.
"Mikel Arteta is a really good coach," said Conte.
Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with COVID and they only had one player with COVID.
"Now, today I can complain about why I have to play on Sunday at 12 p.m. and Arsenal has to play on Monday night.
Despite his frustrations over Holding's red card, Arsenal are unable to appeal what was two separate yellow card incidents.

     Cox: How Tottenham’s win over Arsenal was shaped by home advantage, VAR and Arteta’s subs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham’s crucial 3-0 victory over Arsenal last night didn’t lend itself to a lot of deep tactical analysis.
But Cedric’s barge on Son Heung-min was “one of them” that a home team probably gets and an away team probably don’t.
Arsenal probably wouldn’t have got that penalty at the other end last night; Tottenham probably wouldn’t have got it at the Emirates.
Just as VAR didn’t elect to overturn the on-field referee’s decision to award a penalty, VAR wouldn’t have told Tierney to run over and have a look at the screen if he’d missed the incident.
In that world, if Arsenal had specifically challenged the penalty decision, and the VAR had decided that it was, let’s say, only about 40 per cent a penalty, the decision might have been changed.
