     Summary: After decades of wartime neutrality, Finland now wants to join NATO without delayEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Augstein/AP Frank Augstein/APIn a joint statement released this morning, Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinistö said Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.
The announcement was widely expected and has broad support in the country: A recent poll showed that about three-quarters of all Finns support joining the military alliance.
The invasion of Ukraine in February prompted Finland, which shares an 830-mile border with Russia, to move away from its long history of neutrality and military nonalignment.
Finland's neighbor Sweden also is considering joining NATO.
On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Finland's entry into NATO a threat to Russia and said it "does not make our continent more stable and safe."

     U.S. Embraces Finland’s Move Toward NATO Membership. What About Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Key members of NATO — led by France and Germany — have made clear they are opposed to including Ukraine.
Mr. Zelensky understands this dynamic, and weeks into the conflict, he dropped his insistence that Ukraine be ushered into NATO.
Those statements were a relief to Mr. Biden, whose first objective is to get the Russians out of Ukraine, irreversibly, but whose second is to avoid World War III.
Under that logic, Mr. Biden declined to send MIG fighters to Ukraine that could be used to bomb Moscow.
He rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine because of the risk that American pilots could get into dogfights with Russian pilots.

We believe NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” the leaders said in a statement.
Finland’s decision-making process on NATO membership is being informed by 10 separate parliamentary committees.
These committees are primed to submit their opinions on NATO membership to the Government’s Foreign Affairs Committee by May 15.
These are some of the benefits of NATO membership if we decide to join,” said Hultqvist.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finland's President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin expressed their approval Thursday for joining NATO, a move that would complete a major policy shift for the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security.
As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance," the Finnish leaders said in a joint statement.
The leaders said they came to their decision after allowing time for Finland's parliament and the public to consider the matter, and to consult with NATO and neighboring Sweden.
Officials in Sweden are expected to consider their own possible NATO application in the coming days.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession.
The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland’s membership application.
Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would “strengthen Nato and our common security”.
Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region.

     Summary: In the joint statement, Niinisto and Marin said: “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security.
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls.
Russia has previously warned both countries against joining NATO, saying there would be consequences.
Finland joining NATO would have both practical and symbolic consequences for Russia and the Western alliance.
The war in Ukraine, however, has sufficiently changed the calculation, so that joining NATO now seems the best way forward, regardless of what Russia’s reaction might be.
