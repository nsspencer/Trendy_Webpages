     2022 NFL schedule release: Patriots prime-time overkill, bumpy start for Cowboys and easy ride for Trey Lance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will you feel a little hollow these next 11 months until schedule-release month arrives again?
Sure, this is all a little silly, but it does give us a bit more fodder to consider as we size up a 2022 season that is still nearly a third of a year away (here's the full NFL schedule).
There are a few things that caught my attention upon beginning to really size up the schedule.
If so, it's probably all justified for having the nerve and temerity and nativity to foist Urban Meyer upon the NFL last year.
We are looking for critical areas of certain schedules or quirks that could end up impacting the games that really matter most in January and February.

Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons are all marquee stars worthy of the exclusive viewing window.
That said, Mike McCarthy's offense is going to have its hands full with a loaded Indianapolis defense.
Led by the sensational Darius Leonard and DeForest Buckner, the Colts scooped up Yannick Ngakoue and Stephon Gilmore this spring.
Well, I believe new QB Matt Ryan makes the Colts a playoff team.

That aforementioned stretch to start the season will be difficult but it's also littered with winnable games.
The NFC North is rebuilding, while the games against the two New York teams, Philly and Washington shouldn't be too tough.
