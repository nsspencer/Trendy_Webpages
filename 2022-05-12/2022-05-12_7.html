     Summary: Nick Baumgardner: The Eagles open the season with the following five-game stretch: At Detroit, vs. Minnesota, at Washington, vs. Jacksonville, at Arizona.
Even if things get off to a rocky start for whatever reason, or Philly struggles with unforeseen injuries, this is a forgiving start.
After the Dallas game in Week 6, Philly heads to a bye with three more manageable games afterward: vs. Pittsburgh, at Houston, vs. Washington.
Mike Sando: I agree that the Eagles are in good shape for a quick start based on their early schedule.
After the Roethlisberger-less Steelers and the Cowboys, the Bengals won't face another 2021 playoff team until Week 12 against the Titans.
