     The Milky Way’s Black Hole Comes to Light
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2019, the same team captured an image of the black hole in the galaxy Messier 87, or M87.
That image, the first ever taken of a black hole, is now enshrined in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
“We have seen what we thought was ‘unseeable,’” Sheperd Doeleman, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said at the time.
In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the M87 black hole was 1,500 times as massive as the Milky Way’s; typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.
“The similitude across such an immense scale is astonishing,” Dr. Galison said.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:Scientists have long believed that a cosmic beast lurks at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, a supermassive black hole.
This is the black hole that is the most studied black hole, really.
It looked like a fuzzy orange doughnut, a ring of hot gases swirling around an unseeable black hole.

     Summary: This is the first image of the black hole at the heart of the Milky WayEnlarge this image toggle caption EHT Collaboration EHT CollaborationFor years, the supermassive black hole in the dark center of the Milky Way galaxy has been theorized about and studied — and finally, it's been captured in an image.
"We finally have the first look at our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius A*," an international team of astrophysicists and researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope team announced on Thursday.
"It's the dawn of a new era of black hole physics," it added.
To obtain the image, scientists used observations from April 2017, when all eight observatories were pointed at the black hole.
Still, she said, the two black holes are very different from one another — for one thing, the Milky Way's black hole isn't as voracious.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getting a good image was a challenge; previous efforts found the black hole too jumpy.
The picture also confirms Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity: The black hole is precisely the size that Einstein’s equations dictate.
Scientists had expected the Milky Way’s black hole to be more violent, especially since the only other image from another galaxy shows a far bigger and more active black hole.
The Milky Way black hole is called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star).
The Milky Way black hole is much closer, about 27,000 light-years away.

     Simulation meets observation in first image of the supermassive black hole at our galaxy’s center – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As countless science and general news outlets have reported today, the image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, is a fabulous scientific achievement.
To get effective parallax on a black hole 27,000 light-years away, you’d need to go quite a distance and probably break the laws of physics in the process.
In this case the alignment question being looked at is of inherent scientific value but could also help interpret, for example, the interference caused by gases and dust swirling around the black hole.
“And that would indicate that the spin axis of the black hole is not aligned with the spin axis of the galaxy as a whole, and if you believe what I said earlier, the disk does prefer to be aligned with the spin axis of the black hole.
In one of the papers released today, the team describes building seven different potential morphologies for the black hole, reflecting different arrangements of its matter, from ring to disc and even a sort of binary black hole — why not, right?

The averaged image retains features more commonly seen in the varied images and suppresses features that appeared less frequently.

Black holes don't emit light, but the image shows the shadow of the black hole surrounded by a bright ring, which is light bent by the gravity of the black hole.
