     Kendrick Lamar Returns With ‘Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers’

     Summary: The visual artist Lina Iris Viktor sued, saying her work was used without permission in the track’s video; the lawsuit was settled in late 2018.
Last Sunday, Lamar released a new music video, “The Heart Part 5,” as a teaser for “Mr.
The lyrics in “The Heart Part 5” have already been scoured for meaning, as has the image that Lamar shared on Wednesday of the album’s cover, photographed by Renell Medrano.
To some extent, those may also serve as clues for the next stage of Lamar’s career.
Morale” will be his last album for Top Dawg Entertainment, or TDE, Lamar’s home since the beginning of his career, which has released his music in partnership with Interscope.

     Kendrick Lamar: Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers review – rap genius bares heart, soul and mind
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Kendrick Lamar notes on Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers’ opening track, it’s been 1,855 days since he last released an album.
As Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers makes clear, he also struggled with his mental health, sought therapy and endured a two-year stretch of writer’s block – cured, he suggests, when he “asked God to speak through me”.
Clearly his prayers were answered in no uncertain terms: on the evidence here, the block ended like a dam bursting.
Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers is absolutely crammed with lyrical and musical ideas.
But, on the evidence of Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, an album that leaves the listener feeling almost punch-drunk at its conclusion, it’s not a mantra Kendrick Lamar has any need of at the moment.

     Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers’: 5 Things We Learned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a long five-year absence, Kendrick Lamar has finally returned.
Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers is the kind of dense, complex, contradictory, and thrilling journey into the mind of Pulitzer Kenny that we’ve been waiting for.
Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers Is a Double Album … Sort OfWhile formatted like a double album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers is reminiscent of an old-school two-vinyl release, with a running time of an hour: 34 minutes for Disc One, Big Steppers; and 38 minutes for Disc Two, Mr. Morale.At 15-plus minutes per side, it’s comparable to the first double album in hip-hop history, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince’s 1998 hit, He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper.
Yes, Kendrick Lamar Has Been Reading the NewsThere are several topical lyrics on Mr. Morale.
Kendrick Lamar vs. “Cancel Culture”Mr. Morale listeners are already parsing several Lamar lyrics that seem to embrace “cancel culture,” a concept many would argue doesn’t exist.

     Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Auntie Diaries’ Is a Powerful, Genre-Shifting Statement on Transphobia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of Kendrick Lamar’s great strengths as a rapper is his ability to acknowledge and criticize his own biases and prejudices and not place himself above the people he’s singling out.
It’s a characteristic that appears frequently in his work, particularly on his deep and dense new album, “Mr.
Morale &amp; the Big Steppers,” which arrived late Thursday some five years after his Pulitzer Prize-winning 2017 album “DAMN.,” and particularly on the song “Auntie Issues,” which is a topic that few rappers have addressed at all, let alone with empathy.
In the song, Lamar speaks of an aunt who’d become an uncle, and speaks of his challenges with it but primarily concludes that he loves his family and defends it to his friends.
She was booed and Lamar gently but sternly lectured her onstage — and apparently has come to think twice about what he said at the time.
