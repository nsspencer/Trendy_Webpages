     Dallas Stars: Same Story in Game 5 Loss to Flames
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a new day, but it’s the same story for the Dallas Stars.
After playing four tight-checking games to start their first-round series, there was no reason to expect anything different in Game 5 between the Stars and Calgary Flames.
For Dallas, the team offense has really only been effective on one occasion in the last few years, and that was en route to the 2020 Stanley Cup Final.
Through five games, the Stars have scored eight goals, with four of those coming in Game 3.
Assuming that the Flames don’t completely become incapable of scoring goals in the next game or two, I expect the Stars’ shortcomings to lead to an early exit from the postseason.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Flames were down 1-0 to the Dallas Stars in the third period after 40 minutes of ugly, ineffective hockey.
Shot attempts were 22-13 with Backlund on the ice, and the Flames had around 73 percent of the expected goals.
There will be a playoff-savvy Dallas team waiting for them on Friday, a team that has given the Flames unexpected issues in this opening round.
“It’s going to feel a lot better than if we were down (in the series),” Backlund said.
Friday is their moment to show us they’re a different team from all the other Flames who couldn’t get that far.
