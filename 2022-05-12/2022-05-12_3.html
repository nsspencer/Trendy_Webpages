     Broncos WR Jerry Jeudy arrested, charged with criminal tampering with domestic violence enhancer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was arrested midday Thursday and charged with a misdemeanor related to a domestic violence investigation, according to the Arapahoe County (Colorado) Sheriff's Office.
Jeudy was booked into Arapahoe County Jail on a charge of second-degree criminal tampering with a domestic violence enhancer, the sheriff's office said in a social media post Thursday afternoon, shortly after confirming that he had been taken into custody around noon local time.
The sheriff's office said Jeudy is being held on a "no-bond hold," which means he will not be released from custody before his initial court appearance.
Arapahoe County includes most of the eastern and southern parts of the Denver metropolitan area, including the team's Englewood headquarters.
"We are aware of the matter involving Jerry Jeudy and are in the process of gathering more information," the Broncos said in a statement.

     Broncos' Jerry Jeudy arrested in Colorado, charged with criminal tampering in domestic violence case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid his first offseason preparing alongside new quarterback Russell Wilson, star Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy has been sidelined indefinitely due to an off-field issue.
On Thursday, the former first-round draft pick was arrested in Colorado on charges of second-degree criminal tampering as part of a domestic violence case, the Arapahoe Sheriff's Office announced.
Jeudy's charge of second-degree criminal tampering indicates interference with another person's property "with intent to cause injury, inconvenience or annoyance," as Tom Pelissero reported.
The charge, a misdemeanor, includes a "domestic violence enhancer," which designates Jeudy's relation to his accuser.
Jeudy missed seven games during the 2021 campaign while recovering from a high-ankle sprain.
