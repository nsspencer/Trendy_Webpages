     Broncos' Jerry Jeudy arrested in Colorado, charged with criminal tampering in domestic violence case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid his first offseason preparing alongside new quarterback Russell Wilson, star Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy has been sidelined indefinitely due to an off-field issue.
On Thursday, the former first-round draft pick was arrested in Colorado on charges of second-degree criminal tampering as part of a domestic violence case, the Arapahoe Sheriff's Office announced.
Jeudy's charge of second-degree criminal tampering indicates interference with another person's property "with intent to cause injury, inconvenience or annoyance," as Tom Pelissero reported.
The charge, a misdemeanor, includes a "domestic violence enhancer," which designates Jeudy's relation to his accuser.
"We are aware of the matter involving Jerry Jeudy," the Broncos said in a statement, "and are in the process of gathering more information."
