     Arsenal Could Not Handle Son Heung-Min But It Was Their Decision That Allowed Him To Play

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal Could Not Handle Son Heung-Min But It Was Their Decision That Allowed Him To PlayTottenham's Son Heung-min was a constant thorn in Arsenal's side as they suffered their heaviest ever loss in a Premier League north London derby on Thursday.
To cap off a dominant display, Son then scored his 21st Premier League goal of the season to rub salt into Arsenal's wounds.
However, the match was called off after Arsenal made a request to the Premier League at the eleventh hour, citing COVID as a factor.

Later in January, the Premier League changed its rules to avoid similar requests for postponements.

     How Tottenham beat Arsenal to close gap for Champions League spot to one point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur kept the race for fourth place alive by demolishing Arsenal 3-0 in the north London derby.
The match was effectively decided during a manic 15-minute period in which Harry Kane scored twice and Arsenal’s Rob Holding was sent off.
Kane put Spurs ahead in the 22nd minute with a nerveless penalty before Holding received two yellow cards for trying to rough up Son Heung-min.
A well-worked corner led to Kane’s second goal, headed in from close range, and Son gleefully added a third after 69 seconds of the second half.
The win moves Spurs to within a point of Arsenal, who have a tricky trip to Newcastle on Monday.

     Conte tells Arteta to stop complaining after Holding red in Arsenal defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte urged Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal manager blamed the referee Paul Tierney for jeopardising his team’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League.
“If I say what I think I will be suspended for six months and I want to be on the touchline for our next game on Monday night,” Arteta said.
To Conte, Arteta had no grounds to moan after Arsenal succeeded in getting the original game at Spurs postponed due to a selection crisis even though it was not influenced by positive Covid cases.
I just wanted to keep playing, I just wanted to continue to play.”On Holding’s second yellow card, Son said: “I couldn’t see because I was down.
If there was no yellow card then VAR would check it, but look, for me it was a clear foul and clear yellow card.”

     Tottenham vs. Arsenal: Antonio Conte tells Mikel Arteta to end six months of complaining after heated win

     Summary: Spurs' 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium closed the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal to a single point.
"Mikel Arteta is a really good coach," said Conte.
Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with COVID and they only had one player with COVID.
"Now, today I can complain about why I have to play on Sunday at 12 p.m. and Arsenal has to play on Monday night.
Despite his frustrations over Holding's red card, Arsenal are unable to appeal what was two separate yellow card incidents.

     Arsenal's leadership woes exposed by Tottenham, and could cost them a Champions League spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The disappointment shouldn't take over the great opportunity of the two games we have in front of us," Arteta said after Thursday's loss.
"We can't wait to play on Monday, this is how I feel, and that's all I want to say."
Arsenal has a core of young talented players but a lack of on-field leadership could see them miss out on a top-four finish.
Those three defeats against Palace, Brighton and Southampton -- games Arsenal should have won -- may yet see them miss out on Champions League football once again.
They are in a better position than a year ago, when they finished eighth and missed out on Europe altogether, but the priority of returning to the Champions League is now in the balance after the defeat at Spurs.
