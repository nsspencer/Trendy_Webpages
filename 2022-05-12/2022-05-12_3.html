     Summary: I knew before I even began that the schedules for AFC West teams would rank among the most difficult.
As for the Raiders, they get to enjoy the comfort of Allegiant Stadium for four of their final six games.
And while they will be able to spend a good amount of time at home in the final six weeks, the opponents won't be punching bags.
The Rams, New England, Pittsburgh and San Francisco await them from Weeks 14 through 17, before a Week 18 home game against the rival Chiefs.
Buckle up, AFC West teams.
