     My Chemical Romance Return With First New Song Since 2014, ‘The Foundations of Decay’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My Chemical Romance has returned with its first new song since 2014.
The six-minute track, titled “The Foundations of Decay,” harkens back to the emo band’s heyday with Gerard Way’s dramatic vocal delivery, soaring guitar riffs and an epic slow build.
My Chemical Romance is also hitting the festival circuit this summer, performing at emo fest When We Were Young and Riot Fest.
Despite the upcoming tour, new music was not necessarily expected from My Chemical Romance, who disbanded in 2013.
Since the disbanding of My Chemical Romance, each member — Gerard Way, Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero and bassist Mikey Way — has continued to pursue music.
