     Summary: Arsenal Could Not Handle Son Heung-Min But It Was Their Decision That Allowed Him To PlayTottenham's Son Heung-min was a constant thorn in Arsenal's side as they suffered their heaviest ever loss in a Premier League north London derby on Thursday.
To cap off a dominant display, Son then scored his 21st Premier League goal of the season to rub salt into Arsenal's wounds.
However, the match was called off after Arsenal made a request to the Premier League at the eleventh hour, citing COVID as a factor.

Later in January, the Premier League changed its rules to avoid similar requests for postponements.

     How Tottenham beat Arsenal to close gap for Champions League spot to one point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur kept the race for fourth place alive by demolishing Arsenal 3-0 in the north London derby.
The match was effectively decided during a manic 15-minute period in which Harry Kane scored twice and Arsenal’s Rob Holding was sent off.
Kane put Spurs ahead in the 22nd minute with a nerveless penalty before Holding received two yellow cards for trying to rough up Son Heung-min.
A well-worked corner led to Kane’s second goal, headed in from close range, and Son gleefully added a third after 69 seconds of the second half.
The win moves Spurs to within a point of Arsenal, who have a tricky trip to Newcastle on Monday.

     Arsenal's leadership woes exposed by Tottenham, and could cost them a Champions League spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The disappointment shouldn't take over the great opportunity of the two games we have in front of us," Arteta said after Thursday's loss.
"We can't wait to play on Monday, this is how I feel, and that's all I want to say."
Arsenal has a core of young talented players but a lack of on-field leadership could see them miss out on a top-four finish.
Those three defeats against Palace, Brighton and Southampton -- games Arsenal should have won -- may yet see them miss out on Champions League football once again.
They are in a better position than a year ago, when they finished eighth and missed out on Europe altogether, but the priority of returning to the Champions League is now in the balance after the defeat at Spurs.

     Summary: Tottenham's Son Heung-min, left, celebrates after scoring against Arsenal during the English Premier League soccer match between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in London, England, Thursday, May 12, 2022.
“This type of game is not easy — when it’s a game you must win, it's not easy,” Tottenham manager Antonio Conte said.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta refused to comment on either the penalty or the red card, but his anger was evident.
A miserable evening for Arsenal was capped by defender Gabriel hobbling off with an apparent right hamstring injury.
It means Arsenal and Tottenham look to be battling for the final one and it should go to the final day of the season.
