     Mikel Arteta's Arsenal Shown Another Red Card After Rob Holding Makes Four Fouls In 21 Mins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta's Arsenal Shown Another Red Card After Rob Holding Makes Four Fouls In 21 MinsArsenal's ill discipline under Mikel Arteta was highlighted yet again as Rob Holding was sent off during the first half of Thursday's 3-0 north London derby defeat.
Holding was dismissed after committing four fouls within 21 minutes of each other at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
In the 26th minute, Holding received his first yellow card, which was issued for an accumulation of fouls after he pulled Son down.
Holding was shown a second yellow for his elbow on Son but Sky Sports commentator Gary Neville felt he was lucky not to be given a straight red.
Had he been shown a straight red card, Holding would have been banned for three games, ruling him out for the rest of the season.
