     Finland and Sweden joining NATO will help deter Russia, says security analyst
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision by Finland and Sweden to join NATO will improve deterrence against Russia in northern Europe and add to the U.S.-led military alliance's security, one analyst from Atlantic Council told CNBC on Thursday.
As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance," they said in a joint statement.
"Sweden and Finland joining NATO will increase deterrence in the region because of the assets they will provide the alliance.
And [because of] the ability to plan for Northern Europe's security in a comprehensive manner," said the Atlantic Council's Northern Europe director Anna Weislander.
Membership of the political and military alliance will be a historic decision for Finland, which shares a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia.

     Finland's leaders urge NATO bid in blow to Putin; Russia vows response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finland’s leaders announced Thursday their intention for the country to join NATO “without delay,” a move that would bolster the Western military alliance and which prompted a swift vow of retaliation from Russia.
As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance,” they said.
Asked Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining NATO, Niinistö said Putin would be to blame.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Finland would be "warmly welcomed into NATO," adding that the process would be "smooth and swift."
While Norway was a founding member, Finland has been reluctant until now to fully join the alliance.
