     Ethereum Gas Costs Are Spiking as Lending Platforms Report Increased Gas Consumption

     Summary: According to Nansen gas tracker, Ethereum's gas cost spiked to 1000 Gwei as the network faces a massive increase in usage after lending and borrowing platforms report up to a 300% increase in consumption.
Among the biggest gas users on Ethereum chains are platforms like 1inch, Uniswap and Tether token contracts.
Following the drop in UST, the market saw massive outflows of funds from the whole DeFi industry.
AdsIn the matter of a week, the total TVL across various chains tumbled from $204 billion to $115 billion.
Such a drastic drop brings the DeFi industry back to July levels when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bottomed out right before the start of a new rally.

     Summary: The limits that Ethereum (ETH -11.61%) has on how it can scale today could be a serious challenge that allows competing blockchains to more fully develop in its place.
In this Motley Fool Live segment from "The Crypto Show," recorded on April 20, Fool.com contributor Travis Hoium talks about the advantages Ethereum has over Solana.
Travis Hoium: The fact that Ethereum has limits on how it can scale today, and that's going to be a challenge and basically allow competitors, competing blockchains, to more fully develop.
From a transaction basis, there are more transactions on Solana today in NFTs than there is in Open Sea.
And I think that's, long term, what makes me a little more bearish on Ethereum and a little more bullish on Solana.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money that use mathematics to create a unique piece of code that customers invest in.
The SEC filing, Staff Accounting Bulleting 121, requires crypto platforms to include customer's crypto holdings as assets and liabilities on balance sheets.
As an example, despite its recent plummet, bitcoin has still risen in value by nearly 11,000 per cent since its 2009 creation.
Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a digital token used on a digital database called a blockchain.
Bitcoin mining also uses an enormous amount of energy, estimated to be around 0.21 per cent of all the world's electricity.
