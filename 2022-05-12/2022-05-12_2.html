     Summary: May 12, 2022 at 2:08 PM EDTWhen Mikel Arteta signed his new contract as Arsenal manager last week, he was accompanied in the publicity photographs by the club’s technical director Edu and chief executive Vinai Venkatesham.
But there is another man, someone instrumental in the striking of that deal, who remained conspicuous by his absence: board member Tim Lewis.
In the months leading up to Friday’s announcement, Lewis was a key figure in the dialogue surrounding the nature and terms of the contract.
Since joining the board in the summer of 2020, Lewis has forged a strong relationship with Arteta and is a periodic visitor to the Spaniard’s office at the club’s London Colney training ground.
And yet, to most Arsenal fans, Lewis remains something of a mystery.

     Gabriel Jesus agent hands Arsenal huge transfer boost and confirms striker's Premier League plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gabriel Jesus' agent has given Arsenal a huge boost in their pursuit of the Manchester City striker after commenting on the Brazilian's future.
Arsenal's technical director Edu has been in talks with the player's representatives over the past few months, with Jesus' agent, Marcelo Pettinati, admitting that the Brazilian 'likes the project' at the Emirates.
According to the Brazilian's agent, Jesus wants to stay in the Premier League which could put the Gunners in pole position for the 25-year-old's signature this summer.
According to his agent, the Brazilian striker is set to turn down interest from Europe to continue playing in the English top-flight.
The 25-year-old joined City in 2017 and has an impressive record for Guardiola's side, scoring 58 goals in 157 Premier League appearances.

     What is Arsenal's record against the Big Six? Premier League home and away form in rivalry games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal's record vs. Man UnitedThe 2011/12 campaign also provided one of Arsenal’s lowest ever points as a club, though, on matchday three.
Despite the painful memories of that day, Arsenal have proven tougher opposition overall this decade for the Red Devils, with the two head-to-head Premier League record remaining relatively even.
Arsenal's record vs. LiverpoolThe North London outfit have struggled when playing against Liverpool, although they’ve only lost twice more against the Merseyside outfit than Manchester United.
That still remains Arsenal’s only Premier League victory against Liverpool across their last 14 league meetings, as the Reds continue to rack up huge scorelines in this matchup.
Is Arsenal's record better in cup competitions?
