     Summary: Arsenal Could Not Handle Son Heung-Min But It Was Their Decision That Allowed Him To PlayTottenham's Son Heung-min was a constant thorn in Arsenal's side as they suffered their heaviest ever loss in a Premier League north London derby on Thursday.

However, the match was called off after Arsenal made a request to the Premier League at the eleventh hour, citing COVID as a factor.

     Conte tells Arteta to stop complaining after Holding red in Arsenal defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte urged Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal manager blamed the referee Paul Tierney for jeopardising his team’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League.
“If I say what I think I will be suspended for six months and I want to be on the touchline for our next game on Monday night,” Arteta said.
To Conte, Arteta had no grounds to moan after Arsenal succeeded in getting the original game at Spurs postponed due to a selection crisis even though it was not influenced by positive Covid cases.
I just wanted to keep playing, I just wanted to continue to play.”On Holding’s second yellow card, Son said: “I couldn’t see because I was down.
If there was no yellow card then VAR would check it, but look, for me it was a clear foul and clear yellow card.”

Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with COVID and they only had one player with COVID.
"Now, today I can complain about why I have to play on Sunday at 12 p.m. and Arsenal has to play on Monday night.
