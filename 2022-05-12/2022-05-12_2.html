VOLATILITY IN CRYPTO MARKETS TO CONTINUE FOR NEXT FEW MONTHS: EXPERTIDX Digital Asset CIO Ben McMillan told FOX Business' "Mornings with Maria" on Thursday that Bitcoin's nosedive shows that the "low correlation thesis" between risky assets and the financial markets is "gone".
"Bitcoin is traded with a high correlation during down markets.
So I think the low correlation thesis is gone," he explained.
No, but I think the positive correlation is here to stay absolutely."

     Things Are Going Well in Bitcoin City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: @nayibbukele/TwitterThe president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, revealed renderings earlier this week of Bitcoin City, a city made to look like a Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin City is coming along beautifully,” Bukele tweeted alongside a photo of the model.
The proposed city, which is in the shape of a coin (also known as a circle), is supposed to sit between the Gulf of Fonseca and the Conchagua volcano.
The pitch is to power both the city and Bitcoin mining with the volcano’s geothermal energy, although the timing of the release was perhaps unfortunate.
On Thursday, CNBC reported the broad sell-off in crypto had “erased more than $200 billion from the entire market in a single day.”
