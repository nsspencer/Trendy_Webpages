    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Son Heung-Min "Not Angry, Just Disappointed" With Antonio Conte Substitution Against ArsenalTottenham forward Son Heung-min has admitted that he was unhappy with Antonio Conte's decision to substitute him off during Thursday's 3-0 win over Arsenal.
Son had helped Spurs build a three-goal lead over the Gunners for the first time in Premier League history.
With individual glory in his sights, Son understandably wanted to play the full game to give himself the best possible chance to overtake Salah.
Son was visibly disappointed as he reluctantly accepted a hug from manager Conte.

     Conte tells Arteta to stop complaining after Holding red in Arsenal defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte urged Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal manager blamed the referee Paul Tierney for jeopardising his team’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League.
“If I say what I think I will be suspended for six months and I want to be on the touchline for our next game on Monday night,” Arteta said.
To Conte, Arteta had no grounds to moan after Arsenal succeeded in getting the original game at Spurs postponed due to a selection crisis even though it was not influenced by positive Covid cases.
I just wanted to keep playing, I just wanted to continue to play.”On Holding’s second yellow card, Son said: “I couldn’t see because I was down.
If there was no yellow card then VAR would check it, but look, for me it was a clear foul and clear yellow card.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham's Son Heung-min, left, celebrates after scoring against Arsenal during the English Premier League soccer match between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in London, England, Thursday, May 12, 2022.
“This type of game is not easy — when it’s a game you must win, it's not easy,” Tottenham manager Antonio Conte said.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta refused to comment on either the penalty or the red card, but his anger was evident.
A miserable evening for Arsenal was capped by defender Gabriel hobbling off with an apparent right hamstring injury.
It means Arsenal and Tottenham look to be battling for the final one and it should go to the final day of the season.

     Summary: Spurs' 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium closed the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal to a single point.
"Mikel Arteta is a really good coach," said Conte.
Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with COVID and they only had one player with COVID.
"Now, today I can complain about why I have to play on Sunday at 12 p.m. and Arsenal has to play on Monday night.
Despite his frustrations over Holding's red card, Arsenal are unable to appeal what was two separate yellow card incidents.
