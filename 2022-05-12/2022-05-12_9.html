     Finland prepared in case Russia cuts off gas, emergency committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationHELSINKI, May 13 (Reuters) - Finland is ready to cope in the event that Russia cuts off its supply of natural gas, the government's emergency preparedness committee said after a meeting on Friday.
Key Finnish politicians had been warned of a possible halt to gas exports by Russia on Friday, Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Thursday.
"Finland is prepared for a suspension of Russian natural gas imports," the committee said in a statement.
The country imports most of its gas from neighbouring Russia but gas accounts for only about 5% of its annual energy consumption.
"Finland seems well placed to replace Russian flows with LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports from elsewhere," Capital Economics said in a note to clients.

     Erdogan says Turkey doesn't support Sweden, Finland joining NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan holds a news conference during the NATO summit at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium June 14, 2021.
"We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don't hold positive views," Erdogan told press in Istanbul on Friday.
Erdogan referenced the Nordic countries' hosting of members of the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, which Turkey considers a terrorist group.
Turkey and Greece are longtime rivals and have fought in conflicts against one another even as NATO members.
Sweden currently has six sitting Kurdish members of parliament, representing the Liberal, Sweden Democrats, Social Democrats and Left Party.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Key members of NATO — led by France and Germany — have made clear they are opposed to including Ukraine.
Mr. Zelensky understands this dynamic, and weeks into the conflict, he dropped his insistence that Ukraine be ushered into NATO.
Those statements were a relief to Mr. Biden, whose first objective is to get the Russians out of Ukraine, irreversibly, but whose second is to avoid World War III.
Under that logic, Mr. Biden declined to send MIG fighters to Ukraine that could be used to bomb Moscow.
He rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine because of the risk that American pilots could get into dogfights with Russian pilots.

     Erdoğan says Turkey does not support Finland and Sweden joining NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Friday that his government does not support Finland and Sweden joining NATO, claiming the Scandinavian countries are home to Kurdish "terrorist organizations."
Why it matters: A formal objection by Turkey would derail Finland and Sweden's expected NATO applications, which must be approved by all 30 NATO allies.
Finland's leaders on Thursday officially expressed support for applying to NATO "without delay," while Sweden's ruling party is expected to follow suit on Sunday.
What they're saying: "We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we are not of a favorable opinion," Erdoğan told reporters in Istanbul, according to AP.
The big picture: Turkey is the only NATO ally so far to suggest it may oppose Finland and Sweden's accession.

     Summary: “We are following developments concerning Sweden and Finland, but we are not of a favorable opinion,” Erdogan told reporters.
Public opinion in the two countries quickly started to shift toward favoring NATO membership after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Niinistö's office said the three leaders “shared a deep concern over Russia’s war on Ukraine.”“President Niinistö went through Finland’s next steps toward NATO membership.
Stoltenberg has said that Finland and Sweden, should they formally apply to join the world’s biggest security organization, would be welcomed with open arms.
But it pointed to NATO membership carrying a number of advantages for Sweden - above all the collective security provided by the 30-member military alliance.

     Summary: Leaders of most NATO countries have indicated they welcome Finnish and Swedish membership and believe it would strengthen the alliance.
NATO leaders were expected to sign off on the expansion at a June summit in Madrid — or that was the plan until Friday’s comments from Erdogan.
Advertisement"We are following the developments with Sweden and Finland, but we don’t have favorable thoughts,” Erdogan told reporters Friday.
It also could increase tensions with other NATO countries.
If Turkey can be won over, the expectation is that the NATO leaders will formally approve the application at their summit in June.
