     Here's Who Might Replace Ezra Miller in 'The Flash'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's Who Might Replace Ezra Miller in The FlashWith Ezra Miller facing more and more legal trouble and making themself look worse and worse, some fans are starting to wonder whether Warner Bros. will replace the queer actor in their role as the Flash in the DC Extended Universe.
And now we have an idea who they might replace Miller with.
According to Screengeek, Warner Bros. is considering replacing Miller with actor Dylan O’Brien.
However, this does come into conflict with earlier reports that the studio was not worried about replacing Miller, even after their second arrest in Hawaii.
For now, it seems like Warner Bros. isn’t planning on replacing Miller anytime soon.
