     Buffalo Bills 2022 schedule: Opponents, dates, times finalized
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One year after feeling that the Buffalo Bills were slighted in terms of prime-time games, the Bills Mafia has nothing to complain about this year.
It’s clear that the NFL views the Bills as the AFC’s top dog and treated them as such with five prime-time matchups.
Buffalo opens the season with back-to-back prime-time games against the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams and the AFC’s No.
In addition to being featured in prime-time, Buffalo will have a Thanksgiving Day game for the third time in four years.
Below is a look at the team’s entire 2022 schedule, dates and kickoff times.

     Bills 2022 Schedule Released: Buffalo’s 17 Opponents, Game Dates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bills may have had the most heartbreaking end to their 2021 season this past winter and will look for revenge in 2022.
Buffalo’s Super Bowl bid came to a crashing halt in January in what turned out to be a significant moment for the entire NFL.
The Bills’ top-ranked defense could do nothing against Patrick Mahomes and company but this time around things might be different.
The defense also added seven-time All-Pro linebacker Von Miller to its ranks and could be even more formidable this time around.
All things considered, they’re once again a favorite to come out of the AFC.
