     My Chemical Romance, 'The Foundations of Decay'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My Chemical Romance, 'The Foundations of Decay'YouTubeBefore the albums Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys and The Black Parade, and certainly before the band sang "I'm Not Okay" — giving a mute generation license for honesty and a language for their post Sept. 11 collective trauma — My Chemical Romance wrote comic book narratives on death.
In VFW halls and New Brunswick basements, they became vampiric superheroes, ready to give teens credence and optimism in their pain.
"The Foundations of Decay," My Chemical Romance's first new song since 2014's "Fake Your Death," recalls that time, sounding like a lost relic from its first album, 2002's I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, amplified by six-minute long proggy production.
Instead of the navel-gazing, easy misogyny of emo-pop, Way and his band identify everyday injustices and perform them.
Foundations decay, but in the debris is something beautiful.
