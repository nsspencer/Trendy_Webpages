     Hacks Season 2 Premiere: Jean Smart Talks Filming That Wild Fight Scene — 'I Didn't Mean to Hit Her!' (Watch Video)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This post contains spoilers from the first two episodes of Hacks Season 2.
HBO Max’s Hacks premiered its first two episodes of Season 2 Thursday, and while Deborah’s (Jean Smart) stand-up tour has officially kicked off, her relationship with writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder) has never been rockier.
“It’s a mixture of stress, fear, sadness, probably some anger,” Einbinder tells TVLine, detailing the tornado of emotions swirling through her character.
So what does that mean for the women and their tour, and what pointed dagger of an insult does Deborah launch Ava’s way?
See what Smart and Einbinder have to say in the video embedded above.

     Hacks Returns with Confident, Ambitious Second Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new season of “Hacks” picks up immediately after the end of season one with Ava realizing she made a huge mistake when she spilled all the tea about Deborah’s worst habits to a pair of TV writers.
“Hacks” understands how show business can make people who can’t stand each other on one level into creative inspirations for one another at the same time.
Despite the relatively deep previous paragraph, the second season is more of an ensemble comedy.
The premiere features almost all of the supporting players from season one, including Kaitlin Olson’s DJ, Chris McDonald’s Marty, and Mark Indelicato’s Damien.
Still, “Hacks” overcomes these set-ups to remain a remarkably smart comedy, one that understands human behavior and how it’s warped by show business.

     Hacks season 2 is a reminder that TV comedies should be meaner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This resulted in a steady stream of jokes: Deborah would effortlessly roast Ava, and Ava would sputter and flail while trying to update Deborah’s outdated feminism in vain.
This tension made Hacks compelling, and it’s always in danger of collapsing for a very simple and understandable reason: It all falls apart if the two leads start to like each other too much.
“Meanness” in this context is a source of tension, which all comedies need to survive.
This is what makes the central relationship in Hacks so compelling.
It speaks to something that’s true but rarely expressed in TV comedies, which need tension to thrive but can’t have too much out of fear that it would make a serial narrative unsustainable.

“It says something about Deborah that she makes Ava read it out loud to her,” says Smart.
I think that’s why she needs her adoring fans, because no one in her life actually loves her.”This final part “is just so brutally honest,” says Aniello.
Ava soon learns that Deborah is suing her for violating the lengthy nondisclosure agreement she signed in the first season.

     Hacks Seems a Bit Lost
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much of the first season of Hacks revolved around the love-hate relationship between Ava and Deborah, and the series is determined to keep that push and pull going.
But even Hacks itself acknowledges that the device is a bit thin.
Actually, Deborah probably keeps her around because she loves Ava, and Deborah tends to punish the people she loves most.
But every time Hacks cuts away from Deborah and Ava to show us what’s happening with them, it’s as though we’re being asked to pause Hacks so we can watch a different show.
Hacks is at its best in moments like that, when it highlights life at its most simultaneously hilarious and wrenching.
