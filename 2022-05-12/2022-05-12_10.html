     Trump tries to slow Kathy Barnette momentum in Pennsylvania's Senate primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President Donald Trump on Thursday sought to tamp down Republican Kathy Barnette’s roaring momentum in Pennsylvania’s GOP primary for the Senate.
Barnette, a political commentator, is surging in the polls as the closely watched primary quickly approaches, with a handful of Republican groups throwing support behind the candidate this week.
Barnette’s rise as a MAGA candidate herself comes despite TV star Mehmet Oz securing the prized Trump endorsement.
“Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump said in a statement on Thursday.
A vote for anyone else in the Primary is a vote against Victory in the Fall!”

     Barnette finds a following at a conservative forum in eastern Pennsylvania.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWTOWN, Pa. — Kathy Barnette, a previously little-known Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania whose underdog campaign has vaulted into surprising contention, made her pitch to a full house on Wednesday night at a candidate forum in Newtown in the eastern part of the state.
Ms. Barnette, a conservative commentator in the Trump style who has a history of incendiary remarks and has amplified the former president’s stolen-election lie, has been climbing in the polls against two big-spending rivals, Dr. Mehmet Oz and David McCormick.
With Election Day on Tuesday drawing closer, Ms. Barnette was among 15 Republican candidates running for local, state and federal elections who addressed voters at the forum.
(Dr. Oz attended, too.)
In front of a standing room-only crowd at the warehouse-size indoor athletic complex, she said that her newfound momentum was more about them than her.

     Pa. Senate Race: Donald Trump criticizes Kathy Barnette, questions background
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (WHTM) – Kathy Barnette has faced increasing questions regarding her background as her poll numbers surge less than a week from the May 17 Pennsylvania Senate race.
On Wednesday Barnette was endorsed by the super PAC “Club for Growth Action,” which launched a $2 million ad buy for Barnette.
Oz, McCormick, and Barnette have been virtually tied in recent polls, including a Fox News poll that found Oz with 22%, McCormick with 20%, and Barnette with 19% support in the primary.
This is not the first time Trump has voiced a vocal un-endorsement of a Pennsylvania candidate.
In April Trump called gubernatorial candidate Bill McSwain a “coward” for not helping overturn the 2020 election.

     Summary: Kathy Barnette has gone from virtual nobody to virtual front-runner in Pennsylvania’s Republican Senate contest — and now she's facing the heat that comes with being on top.
A super PAC backing one of her opponents released an ad calling Barnette, who would be Pennsylvania’s first Black senator if elected, "Crazy Kathy."
“Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,” the former president said in a statement.
Oz, meanwhile, criticized Barnette without spending a penny during a Wednesday night appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program.
Barnette also has forged an alliance with Doug Mastriano, the front-runner in Pennsylvania’s GOP primary for governor, appearing with him at events.

     Can Wild-Card Kathy Barnette Win Pennsylvania’s GOP Senate Primary?

     Summary: Kathy Barnette at a forum for Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania on April 2, 2022.
Kathy Barnette, a 50-year-old political commentator, is suddenly surging a week ahead of next Tuesday’s primary.
“MAGA does not belong to President Trump,” Barnette said at a recent debate.
On Thursday, Trump himself weighed in, reiterating his support for Oz and saying Barnette hasn’t been properly vetted.
The Club for Growth, which took on Trump and lost in Ohio’s GOP Senate primary, has recently thrown its support behind Barnette and launched a biographical ad campaign on her behalf.
