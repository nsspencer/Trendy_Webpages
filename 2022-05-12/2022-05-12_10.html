     Ranking the ‘Big 3’ Every Year Since 2010
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decade ago, three rappers emerged at the top of their class: Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole.
Every year since 2010, there’s been friendly (and sometimes not-so-friendly) competition between the Big 3.
Some years, all three of them dropped big projects around the same time, and competition was fierce.
Looking back on every year since 2010, we ranked each member of the Big 3, based on how much they dominated the year on a musical level.
Without further ado, here’s our ranking of the Big 3, every year since 2010.

     Kendrick Lamar's New Album Cover Might Reveal Second Child
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pulitzer Prize winner seemed to confirm the existence of the new family addition in the cover art for the forthcoming album.
The cover features Lamar with a crown of thorns and a gun tucked in his waistband holding his two-year-old daughter and fiancée, Whitney Alford, nursing what we presume to be the couple's second child in the background.
High school sweethearts, Lamar and Alford confirmed their engagement in 2015, gushing to Billboard that same year that “I wouldn’t even call her my girl... That’s my best friend.
With the album art's apparent family focus, it will be interesting to see if discussions of fatherhood work its way into Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers.
Fortunately, since the record drops at midnight we won't have to wait too long find out.
