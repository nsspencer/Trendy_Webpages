     Biden administration scraps 3 offshore oil and gas lease sales in Alaska, Gulf of Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration has announced it will ax three planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Cook Inlet, effectively halting the potential to sell drilling leases in coastal waters this year, several media outlets report.
"I’m glad Cook Inlet belugas won’t be forced to face even more oil drilling in their only habitats, but much more must be done to protect these endangered whales from offshore drilling,” Monsell said.
"It's good for Cook Inlet because offshore drilling is dangerous and disruptive.
And it's good for the people of Cook Inlet, including native people, who cherish the inlet in its natural state.
Lease sales in the area were canceled in 2006, 2008 and 2010, and lack of industry interest was cited at that time as well, according to The Hill.

     Biden cancels offshore oil and gas lease sales in Gulf, Alaska
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON - Offshore oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska have been canceled, the Department of Interior announced Wednesday night.
A department spokeswoman said two scheduled Gulf lease sales were cancelled as the result of, "delays due to factors including conflicting court rulings that impacted work on these proposed lease sales.” She said the lease sale for Alaska's Cook Inlet was cancelled due to lack of industry interest.
Offshore lease sales are at the center of an ongoing legal fight between the administration and the oil sector.
Upon coming into office, Biden put offshore lease sales on hold while the Interior Department studied the environmental impact of offshore oil production.
With midterm elections six months away, Republicans looked to cast the decision to cancel the lease sales as destructive to the U.S. economy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Interior Department said it will not move forward with three planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, meaning the administration will not hold a lease sale on coastal waters this year.
“Due to lack of industry interest in leasing in the area, the Department will not move forward with the proposed Cook Inlet OCS oil and gas lease sale 258” or the Cook Inlet project, DOI said.
It also comes at a difficult time for the oil and gas market.
Another major concern from industry groups is that the administration has not yet drawn an offshore program replacement plan ahead of the June expiration date.
A lapse in the five-year program could drive down production by roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a March analysis by API and the National Ocean Industries Association.

     Biden Cancels Offshore Oil Lease Sales in Gulf Coast, Alaska
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By MATTHEW DALY, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says it is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, removing millions of acres from possible drilling as U.S. gas prices reach record highs.
Louisiana and 12 other states challenged Biden’s order, saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters.
The administration has appealed Doughty's ruling, but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly Western states.
Interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five-year plan.
She defended Biden administration actions to scale down federal leasing, saying that industry has about 9,000 permits that have been approved but are not being used.

     White House scraps oil, gas lease sales as fuel prices hit new highs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration has canceled oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet — dealing a blow to potential domestic fuel protection as gas prices reach new highs across the country.
President Biden has blamed high gas prices on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
For weeks, the Biden administration has blamed high gas prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine — which prompted the halt of all US gas and oil imports from Russia.
“At the same time Biden just canceled our largest pending American oil &amp; gas lease sale.”“Gas prices are at a record high, and Biden just canceled oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf,” added Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
“It’s almost like the Biden administration WANTS gas prices to go higher.”As of Thursday morning, the national average price of a gallon of regular gas stood at $4.418.

     Biden pulls 3 offshore oil lease sales, curbing new drilling this year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Interior cannot hold any new oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a replacement plan.
The program’s looming expiration means the government doesn’t have enough time left to hold the three remaining oil and gas lease sales scheduled under the current plan.
Even if Interior held the three planned offshore lease sales, it typically takes years for companies to drill new wells and ramp up production.
Oil and gas industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers have tried to blame high gas prices on the president’s climate policies.
Interior held one more in November, auctioning off 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico in the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in the nation’s history.
