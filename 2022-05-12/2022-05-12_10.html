     Toronto Maple Leafs players decline to comment when asked about officiating in Game 6 loss to Tampa Bay Lightning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Maple Leafs were tight-lipped on the officiating after several plays went against them in a Game 6 overtime loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the teams' first-round Stanley Cup playoff series Thursday night in Tampa, Florida.
Brayden Point came through with the game winner to give Tampa Bay a 4-3 win and force Game 7 in Toronto on Saturday.
"We don't have any comments about it," John Tavares said when asked about the officiating in Game 6.
Toronto and Tampa Bay now have been called for the most penalties this postseason (41 for the Leafs; 36 for the Lightning).
Having lost Game 5 on Tuesday, Tampa Bay moved to 17-0 since 2019 in postseason games that follow a loss.

     Only Lightning Fan In Toronto Pulls Hilarious Move After Tampa Caps Off OT Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We know Lightning are 16-0 following a loss in last three playoffs, but hereâ€™s another one: Since 2018, Leafs have had six opportunities to advance to Round 2.
However, the Lightning were able to force overtime, and while Toronto seemed to have the momentum for the majority of the extra period, Braydon Point was able to send the series back to Toronto for the deciding contest by netting the game-winner.
That goal meant we were once again treated to a tradition unlike any other: the broadcast cutting to a shot of the despondent fans gathered in Maple Leafs Square outside Scotiabank Arena after being treated to their latest dose of disappointment.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there is one undeniable truth for the Tampa Bay Lightning this season, they have the heart of a champion.
Tampa Bay had to win back-to-back championships to garner the respect they should have received after winning in 2020.
When itâ€™s all said and done, history will be very kind to this era of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
That is who the Tampa Bay Lightning areâ€”champions, some of the greatest champions of this era, who will make you scratch and claw for every centimeter of ice.
What Tampa Bay has to do on Saturday is lay everything on the ice as they did in Game Six.

     Summary: 'We've got to find a way': Leafs set for another Game 7'The only thing Leafs need to change is the narrative': Tampa forces Game 7 in TorontoThe Toronto Maple Leafs are going the distance in their opening playoff series for the fifth straight year in a streak that currently includes four straight losses.
The Tampa Bay Lightning scored in overtime Thursday night to keep their season alive with a 4-3 win and force the series to a Game 7 in Toronto.
"We had a great chance here," Maple Leafs captain John Tavares said postgame.
It's about this next game and going out there with a purpose and details and just competing for 60 minutes or whatever it takes.
Saturday's Game 7 will mark the first time the Maple Leafs have held home-ice advantage with a full capacity crowd in the winner-take-all game during their playoff series drought.

     Mishkin's Extra Shift: Lightning 4, Maple Leafs 3 - OT - Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And in that first overtime, before Point's deciding goal, Toronto had been the more dangerous team.
But in the first period of Game Six, the Lightning's shot attempts, often through screens, did yield rebounds.
The Leafs boxed out well in front of Campbell, however, and the Lightning forwards couldn't get their sticks on those loose pucks.
The Leafs iced the puck on the next shift, but Tavares won the d-zone face-off and the Leafs transitioned quickly up ice.
Buoyed by the Kucherov goal, the Lightning owned nearly all of the possession and kept the Leafs back on their heels.
