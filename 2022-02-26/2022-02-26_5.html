     Bill Maher Helps Americans Understand Russia-Ukraine Conflict Using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian &amp; Pete Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In light of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine in an attempt to seize land and power, Maher decided to explain the situation as simple as possible — by using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson.
During his opening monologue on Friday (February 25), Maher tried his best to explain the conflict through a pop culture lens, equating Ye to Russia, Kardashian to Ukraine and Davidson to NATO.
“It’s like Russia is Kanye,” Maher said around the 2:25 mark to laughs from the audience.
“Ukraine is Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson is NATO, it just drives Russia crazy.
In court documents obtained by TMZ, Kardashian is firm in her stance regarding the divorce petition and alleges Ye’s social media posts are a continued cause for her desire to be declared legally single.

     Bill Maher Warns Democrats Not to Humiliate Republican Voters Whose ‘Trump Fever’ Is Cooling Down (Video)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Trump has fallen 26 points among white Republicans without a college degree, down 21 among conservative Republicans, 18 among Republican men, 23 among Republicans over 65, down 19 among white evangelicals,” Maher said.
“The question now really is for Democrats, how are you going to handle that?
Trump’s bond with his supporters is hatred for people they think look down on them.
It took Trump voters a long time to make it all the way down the MAGA rabbit hole.

     Bill Maher Compares Russia-Ukraine War To Kanye West &amp; Kim Kardashian Feud On ‘Real Time’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last night on HBO‘s Real Time with Bill Maher, which was the show’s final episode before a short break, the host expectedly tackled the tragic Russia-Ukraine war that is currently underway.
“What kind of superpower makes up shit like that?” said Maher, an obvious critique of the US invasion of Iraq.
Maher somehow found humor in an otherwise bleak situation by making a somewhat realistic analogy.
The relationship between Ukraine (Kardashian) and NATO (Davidson) just drives Russia crazy.

He invaded Ukraine,” Maher, 66, said during his Real Time With Bill Maher monologue on Friday, February 25.
Today, they demanded Billie Eilish‘s apology to Travis Scott,” Maher joked, referencing the 44-year-old rapper’s feud with the “Bad Guy” songstress earlier this year.
(West previously alleged Eilish, 20, dissed Scott, 30, when she stopped a concert to check on a fan’s health.

     Bill Maher Made the Political Case Against Cryptocurrency

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When I first tried to watch Friday’s Real Time With Bill Maher, HBO Max brought up something I wasn’t expecting.
Bill Maher isn’t wearing glasses like he’s been wearing for the last few months.
“[Putin] said he was going to do it because Ukraine was going to acquire WMDs,” Maher quipped at one point.
Maher brought up sanctions, and his concern with them — namely, that they adversely affect civilians more than the people in power.
The conversation about sanctions led Maher to return to one of his recurring targets — cryptocurrency.

     Bill Maher Uses Kim, Kanye and Pete to Explain Russian War Against Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Play video content Real Time with Bill Maher/HBOThe brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine is hard for some Americans to understand, so Bill Maher broke it down in terms a pop culture consumer can easily grasp.
Maher broke it down Friday night on "Real Time," equating Ukraine to Kim Kardashian, NATO to Pete Davidson, and -- sorry Ye -- you're Russia.
Maher ended his show in true Bill fashion ... showing unbridled contempt for the Republican Party, while blasting the Democrats for squandering an opportunity to avert midterm disaster.
He noted Trump's stranglehold on the Republican Party seems to be waining ... the poll numbers show a drop in support as dramatic as the decline of Omicron.
There's a fabulous sports metaphor Obama once used to describe this very opportunity ... and Bill recounts it well.
