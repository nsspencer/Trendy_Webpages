     Big Ben Simmons Injury Update

     According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, "Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness", and right now there is no timetable for his return to playing.
Charania wrote in the first tweet: "Sources: Nets star Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness in reconditioning process that requires further strengthening of the area over a period of time before return to action."
Charania wrote in the second tweet: "Brooklyn has no set timetable for Simmons' return.
The Nets recently traded for Simmons in the deal that sent 2018 NBA MVP James Harden and Paul Milsap to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and draft picks.
On top of Simmons being out, Kevin Durant has been out of the lineup since January 15 due to a knee injury, and Kyrie Irving is a part-time player only eligible to play in games on the road.

     Ben Simmons dealing with back soreness ahead of Nets debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE (AP) — Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness as the Brooklyn Nets’ new acquisition prepares to make his 2021-22 debut.
Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed before Saturday’s game with the Milwaukee Bucks that the three-time All-Star has encountered “just a little soreness in his back.”“It’s not like an injury,” Nash said.
“It’s just kind of like as he’s returning to play, his back’s flared up a little.
“I think that’s just a part of his process of returning to play.
As you ramp up, you’re a little bit susceptible to certain things, as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness.”While speaking to reporters after the trade, Simmons said he hoped to play again by the time the Nets visit Philadelphia on March 10.

Bobby Portis hit eight 3s and finished with 30 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, while Giannis went for 29 points, 14 rebounds and six assists.
When (or if) that comes to pass, Irving would finally be allowed to play home games for the Nets at Barclays Center.

     The Nets played their 19th straight game without Kevin Durant on Saturday night, but they may not have to wait much longer for their star to return.
“Every day closer,” Nash said before the Nets’ 126-123 win over the Bucks.
But it could be quick, it could be the whole week barring setbacks.”Nash described the high-intensity workouts as playing either half-court or full-court games with the Nets’ “stay-ready” group.

     Kevin Durant injury update: Nets star out Monday vs. Raptors, expected to return from sprained MCL this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brooklyn Nets star forward Kevin Durant is expected to return to the floor this upcoming week, Nets coach Steve Nash said Saturday.
While trying to guard Pelicans guard Herb Jones, Nets forward Bruce Brown fell backward into Durant's left knee, and Durant immediately reached for the knee in obvious discomfort.
While it will likely take the new-look Nets a bit to develop some solid chemistry, Durant is excited about the team's potential.
"I'm excited for our team," Durant said of the trade.
Ultimately, the Nets will go as far as Durant can take them, so the latest update regarding his status is obviously good news for the franchise.
