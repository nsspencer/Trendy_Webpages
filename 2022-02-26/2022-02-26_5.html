     College Hoops Takeaways: Arkansas Upends Kentucky, Michigan State Exposes Purdue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arkansas‚Äôs Dominance in Fayetteville ContinuesFor the third time this month, Arkansas hosted an elite opponent and found a way to win.
But Saturday‚Äôs road loss against a Michigan State team in freefall was yet another questionable performance from a team that often leaves you wanting more, particularly on the defensive end.
Both teams are still on the outside looking in as of now, with North Carolina entering the day as SI‚Äôs second team out and OU the fifth team out.
With their seventh Big 12 win and 20th victory overall, Iowa State is officially an NCAA tournament lock after a narrow win over Kansas State.
