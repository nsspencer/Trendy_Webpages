     'SNL': John Mulaney monologue covers his drug intervention, rehab, newborn son with Olivia Munn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     You know how bad a drug problem you have to have if when you open a door and see people gathered, your first thought is, 'This is an intervention about my drug problem.
Mulaney was in rehab from December to February 2021, during which he "broke up" with his drug dealers by texting them farewell and then blocking them.
It turned out one of his drug dealers was simply an artist who ended up procuring drugs "because you just kept asking," Mulaney said.
"I like that story because there are many stories of drug dealers turning innocent people into drug addicts," said Mulaney.
"I might be the first drug addict to turn an innocent man into a drug dealer."

He starts out his monologue about how it started in December of 2020, about an intervention regarding Mulaney's drug problem.
During the news segment "Weekend Update," co-host Colin Jost and Michael Che immediately discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
If you ever read on the news that Michael Che joined an American war, we have just lost that war!”Now a tradition when John Mulaney hosts "SNL," he performs an expansive musical number.

Conan O'Brien, Tina Fey, John Mulaney, Candice Bergen, and Steve Martin on the February 26 episode of "Saturday Night Live."
Advertisement:Here are the funniest sketches and biggest moments from John Mulaney’s episode of “SNL.”“Prayer For Ukraine” Cold OpenRather than beginning the evening’s show with jokes, “Saturday Night Live” struck a serious tone while addressing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The February 26 episode of “SNL,” hosted by John Mulaney, began with longtime cast members Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong introducing the Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York.
Cecily Strong’s sneering condescension and John Mulaney’s righteous indignation over a woman purchasing a less-than-premium dog food brand is pitch-perfect.

     It’s no monkey judge or anything, but sometimes Saturday Night Live just hurling stuff at the cast is good for a big, silly laugh.
But, man, does Saturday Night Live shank this sort of thing, hard, more often than not.
AdvertisementPeople quite rightly howl at Aaron Sorkin’s take on Saturday Night Live for painting a late -night comedy show’s creative process as a life-or-death battleground for the soul of America.
Was that the first time we saw one of the Please Don’t Destroy guys in a live sketch?
This is my last-ever Saturday Night Live review for The A.V.
