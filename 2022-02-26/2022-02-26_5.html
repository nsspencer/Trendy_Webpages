     War in Ukraine: What you need to knowThe latest: Air raid sirens sounded and residents sheltered underground early Sunday as Russian forces continued to bombard Kyiv with some of the fiercest shelling since the start of the invasion.

The response: Western nations have announced sweeping sanctions on Russian banks, companies and officials, including President Vladimir Putin.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.
While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts.
Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.
And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy.
But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

     EU, UK, Canada, US pledge to remove selected Russian banks from interbank messaging system SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Moscow's exclusion from SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, means Russian banks won't be able to communicate securely with banks beyond its borders.
"This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally," the global powers wrote in a joint statement announcing the significant retaliatory measure.
WASHINGTON — The U.S., European allies and Canada agreed Saturday to remove key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT, an extraordinary step that will sever the country from much of the global financial system.
SWIFT is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.
On Friday, the U.S. alongside the United Kingdom and the European Union announced sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

     US and Europe will block some Russian banks from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A coalition of NATO-aligned countries has committed to new measures meant to sever Russia from the global financial system, countries announced in a joint letter today.
In a dramatic escalation, the order also blocks select Russian banks from using SWIFT — the international payment system employed by banks to send money around the world.
SWIFT, which stands for The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a cooperative company based in Belgium, whose owners include many of Europe’s largest banks.
The organization’s eponymous payments network does not actually exchange money but is used to authenticate payment instructions between banks.
China also operates a rival system named Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS.

     Some traders said while Russian banks that were still off the sanctions list, such as Surgutneftegasbank, could probably clear dollars, that did not necessarily solve the problem.
"Lots of companies will treat Russian oil as sanctioned and not touch it even if it is allowed," said a senior executive from a major Western oil trading desk, also asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Russian energy and commodity flows to Asia, especially to China, will likely continue.
Russian officials have said the country can re-route its exports to China in case flows to the West are disrupted.
But analysts have said gas cannot be re-routed at all, while Beijing's capacity to take more oil is limited.

The move to kick Russia out of the SWIFT system is favored by UK prime minister Boris Johnson, per Bloomberg.

     West Unleashes SWIFT Bans, More Crushing Penalties on Russia

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Saturday’s move also includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.
Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war.
But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies, including those of the U.S. and key ally Germany.
The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties later.
In a tweet Saturday night, the American Embassy said the problem appears to be related to recent sanctions, imposed on Russian banks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Targeting the central bank would strike at the heart of Putin's yearslong efforts to insulate his economy from sanctions.
While discussions regarding Russia's central bank were described as still in their early stages, their consideration underscores the scale of the willingness to significantly escalate penalties in Washington and Brussels.
A senior Biden administration official, on a call with reporters, heralded Saturday's joint move as an "unprecedented act of global sanctions coordination."
One administration official said earlier that additional sanctions were likely to come if Kyiv, the besieged Ukrainian capital, fell.
Removing Russia from SWIFT would damage Russia but also big economies in Europe and impact energy exports to the continent.

     EU: SWIFT financial system to cut off access to some Russian banksUkraine begged the U.S. and Europe to disconnect Russia from the global financial system known as SWIFT for months as tensions in the region increased, but it took an invasion to finally spur action.
SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, processes transactions between 11,000 financial institutions across the world, according to its website.
The SWIFT ban will stop Russian banks from operating worldwide, block Russian exports and imports, and make it harder to obtain loans and invest abroad, according to von der Leyen.
As of March 2018, over 400 institutions, mostly banks, were a part of the Russian network, according to Russian Forbes.
European leaders who agreed to cut Russia off SWIFT said that these measures are justified.
