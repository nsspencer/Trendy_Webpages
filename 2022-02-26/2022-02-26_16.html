     Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel: Roman Abramovich decision will 'change nothing' in day-to-day running
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel believes Roman Abramovich's decision to pass stewardship to the club's trustees will "change nothing" in the day-to-day running of the club.
Abramovich announced on Saturday night his intention to take a step back from his involvement with the Blues while retaining ownership of the team he bought for £140 million in 2003.
"For the news yesterday, I think it will change nothing for me on a daily basis.
This will not change and I think it will not change with the news from yesterday."
Earlier Sunday, the club released a statement on the situation in Ukraine, calling it "horrific and devastating."

     Russian Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich gives 'stewardship' of club over to trustees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has announced he plans to give the "stewardship" of Chelsea Football Club over to trustees of the club's charitable foundation.
Abramovich made the announcement in the days after Russia's invaded Ukraine to protect the club's reputation, a source close to the club told CNN.
"I have always taken decisions with the Club's best interest at heart.
That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.
I believe ... they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans," Abramovich wrote in a statement released on Saturday.

     Roman Abramovich has handed "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to the club's charitable foundation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
It is also understood that Abramovich remains adamant that Chelsea is not for sale.
Bur there are now questions about his long-term future at the club.
There have been calls from MPs this week that Russian-born Abramovich should not be allowed to own Chelsea due to his alleged links to Vladimir Putin's regime.
That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.

     Roman Abramovich, a Russian Mystery in London, Moves to Shield His Prize Soccer Asset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON—When Roman Abramovich landed in London in 2003 with the intention to buy one of the city’s soccer clubs, all the sellers knew about him was what they found in a cursory Google search.
He was Russian.
He had made a fortune running the Sibneft energy company.
And he had ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Beyond that, Mr. Abramovich was a mystery wearing a scruffy beard and jeans, according to people who were present.

     Gary Neville accuses Roman Abramovich of 'cowardly approach' over Chelsea stewardship statement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Roman Abramovich has come in for criticism from Gary Neville, with the former England international saying the Chelsea owner has taken a “cowardly approach” by handing over running of the Blues to the club’s charitable trust.
"One of the smartest things that I think Roman Abramovich has done over the last 20 years is not speak, not make statements," Neville said.
"There's no way that the charitable foundation of Chelsea is running the club and I'm not quite sure why Roman Abramovich made that statement.
Neville’s fellow pundit Jamie Carragher echoed those sentiments, saying Chelsea embarrassed themselves with Saturday’s statement.
"They should have been a lot stronger in what they said, and regarding Roman Abramovich passing on to Chelsea trustees, that’s not him relinquishing the club, stewardship is not ownership.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A day after Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich handed over the "stewardship and care" of the Premier League club to its charitable foundation trustees, declaring he always had "the club’s best interest at heart," several issues remain.
What hasn’t been heard is condemnation by Chelsea and its Russian oligarch owner of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC."
And there’s a direct link from the charitable foundation to the club’s board of directors with Bruce Buck the chair of both.
For all the success Abramovich has brought to Chelsea — including five Premier League titles and two Champions League successes — the fans are demanding answers about his ownership.
