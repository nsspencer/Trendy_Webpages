     CPAC in Orlando: Trump slams ‘radical left,’ President Biden

     At the convention in 2021, Trump hinted for the first time that he might seek the White House again and called for Republican unity.
He has yet to make any public decision about 2024, despite his hints.

     At CPAC, Ukraine and Policy Take a Back Seat to Cultural Grievances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has much of the world transfixed and on edge.
President Biden announced a new Supreme Court appointment who is unlikely to get any significant Republican support.
But at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of the right wing of American politics, the news convulsing the world seemed oddly distant.
Instead, the focus was on cultural grievances, former President Donald J. Trump and the widespread sense of victimization that have replaced traditional conservative issues .
“If I said ‘I’m not going to run,’ the persecution would stop immediately,” Mr. Trump said.

     Former president bashes Biden after Putin declares war on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DONALD Trump slammed President Joe Biden at the CPAC event in Orlando Saturday night, criticizing his "pathetic" foreign policies and vowing to evict "the Biden crime family" from the White House.
Former President Trump heavily criticized current president Joe Biden in the wake of Vladimir Putin declaring war on Ukraine.
Biden has announced a raft of sanctions on Russia this week, however, critics have accused him of being "weak" and not doing enough to stop Putin's advance.
Earlier this week, before Russia's attack got underway, Trump praised Putin’s "genius" plan to invade Ukraine - but said it would never have happened under his watch.

     The Ukraine Invasion Has Scrambled CPAC’s Brain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This was the Ukraine take they were hoping to hear, and it was perfectly fitting that a self-styled meme lord would be the one to deliver it.
Trump’s party is not the party of senior fellows or ancient Cold War history.
It is also a party sick to death of grinding wars to save democracy that result in humiliation and lost lives.
An hour later, Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA wove the anti-interventionist position into yet another Republican mainstay—illegal immigration at the Southern border.
When your power comes from the people, you’d better give the people what they want, lest you find yourself replaced.

     False voting fraud claims permeate CPAC, signaling potential 2022 troubles for GOP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Meanwhile, prominent figures in the effort to overturn the 2020 election were active on the fringes of the conference.
“They’re afraid of this place getting sued,” Lindell said of why some are avoiding the election fraud issue at CPAC.
Another voting machine company, Dominion Voting Systems, is suing former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne over his fraud claims.
Unfounded fraud claims popular at CPACCourts repeatedly have rejected these voting fraud claims for lack of evidence, yet they live on in a subculture where individuals such as Lindell are heroes.
“There’s just a lot of voters who are very turned off by this continued talk of election fraud,” Jewett said.

     Trump, at CPAC, claims Biden is to blame for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “We did it twice, and we’ll do it again,” said Trump, who has not formally announced he is running in 2024.
The GOP leaders did not embrace Trump’s praise of Putin and instead criticized Moscow for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, hailing Ukrainians who were battling Russian aggressors.
Among those considered to be top-tier candidates if Trump doesn’t run are Florida Gov.
They wore Trump gear and waved Trump flags and carried bedazzled Trump purses.
Forty-one percent of those polled said they’d vote for Trump, while 7% said they were undecided.
