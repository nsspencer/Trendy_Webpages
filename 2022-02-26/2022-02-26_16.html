     Bill Maher explained the conflict between Russia and Ukraine during his monologue on Real Time With Bill Maher by comparing the countries to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian while pitting NATO as Pete Davidson.
A lot of s—t we’ve got to talk about tonight and, you know, there’s war in Europe and we didn’t think this would happen.
He invaded Ukraine,” Maher said on his show, Friday.

Kardashian explained her reasoning for leaving West, earlier this month.

     Bill Maher Helps Americans Understand Russia-Ukraine Conflict Using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian &amp; Pete Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In light of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine in an attempt to seize land and power, Maher decided to explain the situation as simple as possible — by using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson.
During his opening monologue on Friday (February 25), Maher tried his best to explain the conflict through a pop culture lens, equating Ye to Russia, Kardashian to Ukraine and Davidson to NATO.
“It’s like Russia is Kanye,” Maher said around the 2:25 mark to laughs from the audience.
“Ukraine is Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson is NATO, it just drives Russia crazy.
In court documents obtained by TMZ, Kardashian is firm in her stance regarding the divorce petition and alleges Ye’s social media posts are a continued cause for her desire to be declared legally single.

     Bill Maher Compares Russia-Ukraine War To Kanye West &amp; Kim Kardashian Feud On ‘Real Time’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last night on HBO‘s Real Time with Bill Maher, which was the show’s final episode before a short break, the host expectedly tackled the tragic Russia-Ukraine war that is currently underway.
“What kind of superpower makes up shit like that?” said Maher, an obvious critique of the US invasion of Iraq.
Maher somehow found humor in an otherwise bleak situation by making a somewhat realistic analogy.
The relationship between Ukraine (Kardashian) and NATO (Davidson) just drives Russia crazy.

     The brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine is hard for some Americans to understand, so Bill Maher broke it down in terms a pop culture consumer can easily grasp.
Maher broke it down Friday night on “Real Time,” equating Ukraine to Kim Kardashian, NATO to Pete Davidson, and — sorry Ye — you’re Russia.
Maher ended his show in true Bill fashion … showing unbridled contempt for the Republican Party, while blasting the Democrats for squandering an opportunity to avert midterm disaster.
He noted Trump’s stranglehold on the Republican Party seems to be waining … the poll numbers show a drop in support as dramatic as the decline of Omicron.
There’s a fabulous sports metaphor Obama once used to describe this very opportunity … and Bill recounts it well.

     While foreign affairs can be difficult for many individuals to comprehend, Bill Maher broke down the current Russian invasion using a Kim Kardashian and Kanye West metaphor.

He invaded Ukraine,” Maher, 66, said during his Real Time With Bill Maher monologue on Friday, February 25.
Today, they demanded Billie Eilish‘s apology to Travis Scott,” Maher joked, referencing the 44-year-old rapper’s feud with the “Bad Guy” songstress earlier this year.
(West previously alleged Eilish, 20, dissed Scott, 30, when she stopped a concert to check on a fan’s health.
