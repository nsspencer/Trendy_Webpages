     Kevin Durant's Status For Nets-Bucks Game Saturday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets will be in Wisconsin on Saturday evening to take on the Milwaukee Bucks.
For the game, they will be without their best player Kevin Durant, who has been out since January 15 with a knee injury.
The status of Durant for Saturday night in Milwaukee can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Underdog NBA.
The Nets had been the top seed in the east at one point this season, but before the All-Star break they endured an 11-game losing streak.
They are 31-29 on the season, which has them as the eighth seed in the east.

     Grading the Milwaukee Bucks’ signing of Jevon Carter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Milwaukee Bucks were required to add a player this week to get their roster up to 14 players, and after initial speculation, it has been revealed who it will be.
As reported by ESPN senior insider Adrian Wojnarowski, the Bucks signed Jevon Carter after he recently cleared waivers.
Carter had been with the Brooklyn Nets until he was recently waived to make room for Goran Dragic, clearing the way for him to sign with Milwaukee.
The financial impact of the Milwaukee Bucks signing Jevon CarterAccording to Spotrac, Carter’s deal with the Bucks will be worth $457,149 for the remainder of the season.
As the 14th man on Milwaukee’s roster, Carter’s deal is reasonable and should not cause any controversy.

     The Milwaukee Bucks Will Reportedly Work Out A Former Rookie Of The Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     According to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, the Milwaukee Bucks will workout 2010 NBA Rookie of The Year Tyreke Evans in the next few days.
The clip of Charania's report can be seen embedded below from his Twitter account.
Evans has been out of the NBA since the 2018-19 season due to a drug suspension that imposed a ban from the league.
If he can give even a fraction of that production to an NBA team, he will be a great signing.
He has played for the Sacramento Kings, New Orleans Pelicans and Memphis Grizzlies and most recently played for the Indiana Pacers.

     NBA Rumors: Reactions to the Milwaukee Bucks working out Tyreke Evans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After signing Jevon Carter earlier this week, the Milwaukee Bucks had one roster spot left to fill, and it looks like they may have a target in mind.
He was officially reinstated earlier this month, and the Bucks will give the 32-year-old an opportunity to make an NBA roster by granting him a workout.
Reactions to the Milwaukee Bucks planning to bring in Tyreke Evans for a workout to possibly fill their final roster spotMilwaukee’s interest in Evans makes sense for two big reasons: their need for guard depth and bench scoring.
Averaging a combined 9.4 points per game this season, these two will help Milwaukee more on defense than offense.
Stay tuned for any updates on the Milwaukee Bucks and their interest in Tyreke Evans as a workout is set to take place within the next week.

     After clearing their minds for eight days free from the rigors of NBA competition, the Milwaukee Bucks are returning to the court (hopefully refreshed) and ready to do battle with a Brooklyn Nets team that remains devoid of most of its star players.
pic.twitter.com/mqAj9bSUqT — Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) February 21, 2022The Antetokounbros bowed out of the skills competition, and apparently weren’t fully aware of the rules?
pic.twitter.com/Hd3by3lpTC — Jim Owczarski (@JimOwczarski) February 25, 2022The interesting subplot for this game is, of course, built around a re-tooled Brooklyn Nets roster.
Goran Dragic will also make his Nets debut.
Player to WatchI think the triumvirate of DeAndre Bembry, Jevon Carter and Goran Dragic make quite a trio of capable watching candidates for this one.

He was recently reinstated and is now eligible to join a team for the remainder of the season.
Milwaukee still has one roster spot left to use on a midseason addition even after adding Jevon Carter, who was waived by the Brooklyn Nets.

     The Nets wound up waiving Jevon Carter and DeAndre Bembry to make way for the new members of the team, and they signed with the Bucks as free agents.
He gives the Bucks interior presence and plenty of toughness as he battles opposing bigs on the boards.
Aside from the minutes total, the Nets have counted on Patty Mills to create offense, and that’s not his game.
On the court, he’s shooting a career high from the field (50.7 percent) and three point range (40.7 percent) as well.
The Nets need for Irving to put plenty of downhill pressure on the Bucks and get to the free throw line.
