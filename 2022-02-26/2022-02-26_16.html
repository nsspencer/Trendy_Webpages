     LCD Soundsystem's Thrills' For 'Saturday Night Live' Episode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A few weeks ago, John Mulaney decided to let the world know that he’d be hosting Saturday Night Live in the very near future — and that indie legends LCD Soundsystem would be the musical guests.
This is just the second time James Murphy and co. are appearing on the late night show, which seems unbelievably given how intrinsically tied the are to music in New York over the last two decades.
Back then, Saturday Night Live was just as impacted by the spread, canceling the studio audience for their last episode of the year, and also putting the kibosh on Charli XCX’s highly-anticipated performance.
Luckily, they recently rescheduled Charli so she can have her main pop girl moment.
For now, watch LCD have their Brooklyn indie moment up top.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Saturday Night Live returned tonight with host John Mulaney and musical guest LCD Soundsystem.
For those who thought LCD might announce a fifth album, or at least play a new song, well, nope, they played some serious deep cuts instead: "Thrills" and "Yr City's a Sucker."
This was John Mulaney's first major public appearance since going into rehab after after his November 2020 SNL appearance -- he talked about it during his monologue -- and it was also his entry into the Five Timers Club, and Steve Martin, Paul Rudd and Candice Bergen welcomed him into the group, not to mention Tina Fey, Elliot Gould, and Conan O'BrienKeeping with Mulaney's previous appearances, there was a musical, this time about the subway where LCD Soundsystem play Guardian Angels.
On a serious note, the episode opened not with a sketch but with ​​“Prayer for Ukraine” performed by Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York.
Watch video below.

     ‘SNL’: LCD Soundsystem Performs Deep Cuts ‘Thrills’ and ‘Yr City’s A Sucker’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For their second appearance as musical guests on Saturday Night Live, LCD Soundsystem decided to perform two deep cuts from their discography.
The Brooklyn indie outfit spearheaded by James Murphy kicked off their set with the industrial-tinged “Thrills” before returning to the stage for a funky synth performance of their hit “Yr City’s A Sucker”— both from their self-titled 2005 album.
The group previously played on SNL in 2017, performing songs from their 2017 LP American Dream including the title track and “Call The Police.”Last year, the LCD was supposed to play a 20-show residency at Brooklyn Steel but had to cancel three dates because of a surge in Covid-19 cases.
Earlier this week the band announced they would be doing multi-night residencies in Philadelphia and Boston.
Performances will be held at Franklin Music Hall in Philadelphia on March 28, 29, 30, and 31 and at Roadrunner in Boston on April 3, 4, 5 and 6.
