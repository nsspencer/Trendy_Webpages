    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2022 Major League Soccer season gets underway this weekend, and the premier match to start off the new campaign features two teams looking to put last year’s playoff disappointment behind them, as the New England Revolution and Portland Timbers square off.
The Timbers’ shot at a second MLS Cup went amiss in the final match against New York City FC, which saw Portland fall in penalties.
This will be the first time these two franchises have met in the regular season since September 2019.

     New England Revolution opens MLS season with 2-2 tie at Portland Timbers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Yimmi Chara scored on a bicycle kick goal in the 78th minute to pull the Portland Timbers into a 2-2 draw with the New England Revolution in the Major League Soccer opener for both teams Saturday.
Dairon Asprilla also scored for the Timbers to help deny the Revolution their first victory at Providence Park.
Revolution coach Bruce Arena remained tied with the late Sigi Schmid for the most regular-season victories in MLS with 240.
New England is the reigning Supporters Shield winner after amassing an MLS record 73 points last season.
The Timbers Army supporters group, known for large, coordinated displays called tifos, announced a break with tradition and had no tifo for the season opener.

     How MLS works 2022: Explaining league rules, structure, format and playoffs that determine cup champions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The regular season will take place from late February all the way through early October, with the playoffs unfolding between October and November.
How to watch MLSIn the United States, MLS games air across a number of networks and platforms for the 2022 season, including ESPN, Fox and Univision.
As a closed league, the same MLS teams compete every year, no matter their position in the standings the season prior.
Lower league clubs do occasionally get added as well, such as in 2020 when Nashville SC made the jump from the USL Championship.
The MLS playoffs are essentially a seeded, single-elimination knockout tournament contested at the conclusion of the regular season.
