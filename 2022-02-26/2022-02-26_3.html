     'SNL': John Mulaney monologue covers his drug intervention, rehab, newborn son with Olivia Munn

     My least favorite kind of intervention," said Mulaney.
You know how bad a drug problem you have to have if when you open a door and see people gathered, your first thought is, 'This is an intervention about my drug problem.
Mulaney was in rehab from December to February 2021, during which he "broke up" with his drug dealers by texting them farewell and then blocking them.
It turned out one of his drug dealers was simply an artist who ended up procuring drugs "because you just kept asking," Mulaney said.
"I like that story because there are many stories of drug dealers turning innocent people into drug addicts," said Mulaney.

     Hosting his fifth SNL, John Mulaney joins a very crowded Five Timers Club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Could John Mulaney have dreamed of hosting Saturday Night Live for the fifth time back when he was scribbling down jokes to crack up Bill Hader on air?
Probably not, as the former SNL writer turned stand-up superstar and sometime animated rodent wandered timidly into Saturday Night Live’s vaunted Five Timers Club on Saturday.
Fey tired to assert that she was a writer, but Conan exploded that she was in the cast, too, so she can zip it.
As for Mulaney, Conan soothed the unlikely Five Timer’s imposter syndrome, noting that it’s the writers at SNL who (despite being too “hideous” for TV as a rule), are really the power behind these preening, velour-jacketed phonies.
Showing Mulaney their true powers, Conan then shouted, “Live, from New York, it’s Saturday Night!,” even though the sketch aired well into the body of the show.

    </h2>

     John Mulaney was welcomed into “Saturday Night Live’s” five-timers club with a sketch that featured suprise appearances by Conan O’Brien, Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Candice Bergen, Steve Martin and Elliott Gould.
The group of veteran past “SNL” hosts hazed Mulaney before handing him a coveted royal blue smoking jacket with a large numeral 5 embrodered on the right breast.
The sketch opened with Martin, Rudd and Bergen meeting in a private library-like setting, all wearing their jackets.
“I’m just happy you’re here in my episode,” Mulaney joked.
The sketch ended with an overhead shot of the august group shaking hands and exchanging greetings.

“After a very complicated year, it is wonderful to be in a place that’s always emphasized sobriety and mental health,” Mulaney cracked.
Mulaney had the show in the smooth palm of his hand throughout the night.
And he got his Five-Timer velvet jacket, taken from Paul Rudd—he who had already lost so much when his Five-timer episode was torpedoed when cases surged before Christmas.
Also on hand to celebrate Mulaney joining the club were Steve Martin, Candice Bergen, Tina Fey, Elliot Gould, and Conan O’Brien.

     Entertainment ‘SNL’ recap: The best moments from John Mulaney’s episode The comedian joined the illustrious "Saturday Night Live" five-timers club, with guests like Conan O'Brien and Steve Martin on hand to welcome him.
Conan O'Brien, Tina Fey, John Mulaney, Candice Bergen, and Steve Martin on the February 26 episode of "Saturday Night Live."
Advertisement:Here are the funniest sketches and biggest moments from John Mulaney’s episode of “SNL.”“Prayer For Ukraine” Cold OpenRather than beginning the evening’s show with jokes, “Saturday Night Live” struck a serious tone while addressing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Feb. 26 episode of “SNL,” hosted by John Mulaney, began with longtime cast members Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong introducing the Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York.
Cecily Strong’s sneering condescension and John Mulaney’s righteous indignation over a woman purchasing a less-than-premium dog food brand are pitch-perfect.
