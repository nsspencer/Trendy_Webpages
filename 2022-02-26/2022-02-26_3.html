     Putin Seems to Sideline Advisers on Ukraine, Taking a Political Risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Does President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have the support he needs at home to wage a costly war in Ukraine?
After all, Mr. Putin has already invaded Ukraine, suggesting he feels confident in his resources.
And his public image is that of a strongman, with the power to direct the Russian state as he pleases.
And a series of events this week, including Russia’s decision to throttle access to Facebook and censor news about the war in Ukraine, raise questions about just how much political support Mr. Putin will be able to draw on during the conflict.
An early sign that something might be amiss came on Monday in a televised meeting of Russia’s Security Council.

     Trump defends praise of Putin even as he calls Ukrainian president 'brave'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Former President Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday while also calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "a brave man" amid Russia's deadly invasion of his country.
"Putin is playing [President Joe] Biden like a drum and it's not a pretty thing to watch," he continued.
In addition to Putin, Trump has previously made positive comments about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
In back-to-back appearances at CPAC, rumored GOP presidential hopefuls echoed Trump's criticism of the Biden administration but stopped short of complimenting Putin like the former President has.
"I have no doubt that President Putin made his decision... only after watching the pathetic withdrawal from Afghanistan."

     Donald Trump defends calling Putin ‘smart’, hints at 2024 presidential bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Donald Trump, the former US president, has defended his description of Russia’s Vladimir Putin as “smart” while seeking to blunt accusations that he admires the invasion of Ukraine.
Having retold “the big lie”, he went on to compare himself favourably with other presidents’ handling of Putin.
Under Obama, Russia took Crimea.
“The problem is not that Putin is smart – which of course, he’s smart – but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb.
As president, Trump was notoriously reluctant to condemn Putin and, at a summit in Helsinki, took the Russian leader’s word over that of his own intelligence agencies.

Ordinary civilians have joined with Ukrainian forces, making Molotov cocktails, blocking roads and even shooting at the tires of Russian vehicles to impede their progress.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly grown frantic by his military’s failure to control Ukraine.
Russian forces have meant stiff resistance by Ukrainian soldiers in the Lugansk region.

It’s a headache having to face up to the blunt fact that Putin is trying to utterly change the world.
The Kremlin’s foreign policy thinktanks are already churning out articles about how his invasion of Ukraine means the start of a “multipolar world”.
Putin wants the whole world to witness his aggression, to grind in the point there’s nothing that can stop him.
Putin thinks we won’t go through with any changes because all our talk of “democracy” and “values” are just bunk.
