     Phil Mickelson Will No Longer Serve as Host of PGA Tour's American Express Event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oisin Keniry/Getty ImagesPhil Mickelson will no longer serve as the host for the American Express PGA Tour event in 2023 after his comments regarding the Saudi Arabia-backed Super Golf League.
The PGA Tour revealed the news to Larry Bohannan of the Palm Springs Desert Sun, who also wrote that the Mickelson Foundation will no longer be part of the event either.
Mickelson's remarks occurred during a November interview with Alan Shipnuck for his upcoming biography, Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!)
The most controversial remarks included Mickelson's explaining why he considered the Super Golf League despite Saudi human rights violations.
Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.

“Phil has apologized and we know he regrets how he handled recent events.
Last week, golf writer Alan Shipnuck published comments Mickelson made to him in November, in which Mickelson referred to the Saudis as “scary m—–f——” and admitted his involvement with the SGL was a means of gaining leverage on the PGA Tour.
Days after the remarks were made public, Mickelson issued a lengthy statement on social media.
“I have incredible partners, and these relationships mean so much more to me than a contract,” he said.

     Hall of Fame golfer Phil Mickelson out as American Express host after controversial comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the wake of his controversial comments about a proposed Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league and his perceived problems with the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson will no longer serve as host of The American Express PGA Tour event in La Quinta.
The PGA Tour confirmed to The Desert Sun on Saturday that Mickelson, who served as tournament host since 2020, will not return to that role in 2023.
Mickelson, a Hall of Fame golfer and winner of 45 PGA Tour events and six major championships, has been a fixture in the desert and at the tournament.
Mickelson, a 19-time tournament participant since his desert debut in 1993, has won twice in 2002 and 2004.
The PGA Tour has a direct contract with American Express, which announced at the tournament last month an extension of its title sponsor deal through 2028.

     Phil Mickelson out as host of PGA Tour event The American Express
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A week of reckoning continued for Phil Mickelson who has stepped down as the host of The American Express, the Desert Sun reported.
Mickelson had served as host of the PGA Tour event since 2020 although he appeared disengaged at this year’s event where he didn’t hold a press conference and missed the cut.
The Tour confirmed to the Sun that neither Mickelson nor his foundation, which was formed in 2019 to be the charitable arm of the event, would be associated with the tournament.
On Tuesday, Mickelson released a lengthy apology to the super league and LIV Golf, the investment fund behind the rival circuit, but didn’t mention the PGA Tour.
Mickelson hasn’t played on Tour since the Farmers Insurance Open in late January and he’s not in the field for next week’s Arnold Palmer.
