     The Brooklyn Nets will be in Wisconsin on Saturday evening to take on the Milwaukee Bucks.
For the game, they will be without their best player Kevin Durant, who has been out since January 15 with a knee injury.
The status of Durant for Saturday night in Milwaukee can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Underdog NBA.
The Nets had been the top seed in the east at one point this season, but before the All-Star break they endured an 11-game losing streak.

     Ben Simmons dealing with back soreness ahead of Nets debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE (AP) — Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness as the Brooklyn Nets’ new acquisition prepares to make his 2021-22 debut.
Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed before Saturday’s game with the Milwaukee Bucks that the three-time All-Star has encountered “just a little soreness in his back.”“It’s not like an injury,” Nash said.
“It’s just kind of like as he’s returning to play, his back’s flared up a little.
“I think that’s just a part of his process of returning to play.
As you ramp up, you’re a little bit susceptible to certain things, as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness.”While speaking to reporters after the trade, Simmons said he hoped to play again by the time the Nets visit Philadelphia on March 10.

     The Nets played their 19th straight game without Kevin Durant on Saturday night, but they may not have to wait much longer for their star to return.
“Every day closer,” Nash said before the Nets’ 126-123 win over the Bucks.
But it could be quick, it could be the whole week barring setbacks.”Nash described the high-intensity workouts as playing either half-court or full-court games with the Nets’ “stay-ready” group.

Previous reports revealed that Simmons is still dealing with a back problem that will keep him out for a few more games.
I know this: That won’t be Ben Simmons’ debut.
But his return is going to come on the heels of Durant.”It is important to note that Woj hasn’t ruled out Ben Simmons actually playing against the Sixers on March 10.
According to Woj, the former Rookie of the Year could actually make his debut before that game.

     The Nets are treating Simmons’ back issue as day to day and a normal part of the recovery process, sources said, but it remains unclear when the three-time All-Star will make his season debut.
In his introductory news conference with the Nets on Feb. 14, Simmons said he hoped to be ready to play in what would be a highly anticipated return game in Philadelphia on March 10.
Simmons last played in June 2021 during the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
On Saturday morning, Nets coach Steve Nash told reporters that Simmons is traveling with the team, but has not yet been able to do any high-intensity work yet.
Nets teammate Patty Mills, who shares a close friendship and history with Simmons, said recently that he's viewed a positive mindset from the 25-year-old star.
