     Report: Phil Mickelson out as host of The American Express
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phil Mickelson is out as host of The American Express that is played each January in California's Coachella Valley.
The Palm Springs Desert Sun reported on Saturday that the PGA Tour confirmed that Mickelson won’t be the future host after serving the event in that capacity for the past three years.
The charitable arm of the tournament, the Mickelson Foundation, will also no longer be part of the event, the tour said.

     Phil Mickelson out as host of PGA Tour event The American Express
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A week of reckoning continued for Phil Mickelson who has stepped down as the host of The American Express, the Desert Sun reported.
Mickelson had served as host of the PGA Tour event since 2020 although he appeared disengaged at this year’s event where he didn’t hold a press conference and missed the cut.
The Tour confirmed to the Sun that neither Mickelson nor his foundation, which was formed in 2019 to be the charitable arm of the event, would be associated with the tournament.
On Tuesday, Mickelson released a lengthy apology to the super league and LIV Golf, the investment fund behind the rival circuit, but didn’t mention the PGA Tour.
Mickelson hasn’t played on Tour since the Farmers Insurance Open in late January and he’s not in the field for next week’s Arnold Palmer.

“Phil has apologized and we know he regrets how he handled recent events.
Last week, golf writer Alan Shipnuck published comments Mickelson made to him in November, in which Mickelson referred to the Saudis as “scary m—–f——” and admitted his involvement with the SGL was a means of gaining leverage on the PGA Tour.
Days after the remarks were made public, Mickelson issued a lengthy statement on social media.
“I have incredible partners, and these relationships mean so much more to me than a contract,” he said.

     Phil Mickelson dropped as host of The American Express event amid Saudi controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The American Express event in La Quinta, Calif., dropped him as a host on Saturday.
Additionally, the PGA Tour told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs that the Mickelson Foundation will no longer be the charitable arm of the event.
The foundation, which was formed specifically to fill that role, had a contract with the American Express event through 2024.
The American Express event is the fifth sponsor to change its relationship with Mickelson following comments he made about the proposed Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway league.
Mickelson said he didn’t care about the human rights violations of the regime so long as it gave him leverage over the PGA Tour.

     Hall of Fame golfer Phil Mickelson out as American Express host after controversial comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the wake of his controversial comments about a proposed Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league and his perceived problems with the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson will no longer serve as host of The American Express PGA Tour event in La Quinta.
The PGA Tour confirmed to The Desert Sun on Saturday that Mickelson, who served as tournament host since 2020, will not return to that role in 2023.
Mickelson, a Hall of Fame golfer and winner of 45 PGA Tour events and six major championships, has been a fixture in the desert and at the tournament.
Mickelson, a 19-time tournament participant since his desert debut in 1993, has won twice in 2002 and 2004.
The PGA Tour has a direct contract with American Express, which announced at the tournament last month an extension of its title sponsor deal through 2028.
