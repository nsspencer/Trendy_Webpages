The response: Western nations have announced sweeping sanctions on Russian banks, companies and officials, including President Vladimir Putin.

     Japan joins U.S., others in excluding Russia from SWIFT system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationTOKYO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Japan will join the United States and other Western countries in blocking certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Sunday, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly and transferring trillions of dollars each year in what has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade.
Kishida's decision came after the U.S. and its allies took a similar step on Saturday, a move seen to deal a blow to Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business.

     SWIFT Ban Means the Fed May Need to Be Ready With Dollars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The decision to exclude various Russian lenders from the SWIFT messaging system could result in missed payments and giant overdrafts within the international banking system and spur monetary authorities to reactivate daily operations to supply the market with dollars.
That’s the view of prominent Credit Suisse Group AG strategist Zoltan Pozsar, who published a note Sunday examining the consequences for money markets of the decision to take some lenders off SWIFT, a system that facilitates international payments between institutions.

     That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.
While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts.
Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.
And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy.
But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

     What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The White House announced Saturday that the United States and allies agreed to block select Russian banks from SWIFT, the global financial messaging system.
Here’s what you need to know:What is the SWIFT financial system?
Barring Russia from SWIFT would damage the country’s economy right away and, in the long term, cut Russia off from a swath of international financial transactions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and other countries to cut Russia from the system.
Early Saturday morning, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told Zelenskyy that Italy supported "Russia's disconnection from SWIFT, the provision of defense assistance."

     The United States and its allies announced an agreement on Saturday to take aim at Russia through SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions.
"We commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system.

President Joe Biden on Thursday, when announcing new U.S. sanctions against Russia, noted differences among European nations on punishing Russia through SWIFT.
On Saturday, Germany’s government indicated publicly it might support restricting or limiting Russia’s access to SWIFT in a targeted way, short of a total removal.

NORTHAM: Well, the U.S., the European Commission and allies are planning to cut several Russian banks off of something called SWIFT.
If the Russian banks are expelled from SWIFT, they won't be able to make or receive payments, which, of course, has a knock-on effect for both Russia and any business it has internationally.
The allies have also committed to placing sanctions on Russia's central bank, and this could be key.
