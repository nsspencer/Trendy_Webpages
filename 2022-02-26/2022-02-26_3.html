     Ukrainian Forces Repel Russian Attack on Kyiv, Prepare for Next Assault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine—Ukrainian forces and thousands of freshly recruited volunteers regained control of Kyiv’s streets after Russian troops and undercover units in civilian clothes tried to enter the city early Saturday, while Russian airstrikes, airborne landings and armored advances continued throughout the country.
On the third day of the war that Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed with the aim of overthrowing Ukraine’s elected government and ending its alignment with the West, Ukrainian forces fought fiercely on all fronts, with each side asserting it had inflicted heavy losses on the other.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The fighting, part of a seesaw battle over two nights in the northern parts of Kyiv, left Russian trucks and a tracked vehicle smoldering on a highway.
And it signaled that, though vastly outgunned, Ukraine’s army and a growing corps of civilian volunteers are mounting a spirited defense of the capital.
The change to a war footing has been swift, for some almost bewilderingly so.
What just three days ago had been a bustling, modern European capital, with copious restaurants, bars and cafes, slipped into an eerie war footing faster than seemingly imaginable.
Checkpoints went up seemingly at every stoplight, with men and women in civilian clothes, carrying rifles, stopping cars.

     Zelensky’s office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city.
“We will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,” Zelensky vowed.
It was unclear how much territory Russian forces had seized or to what extent their advance had been stalled.
Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian “sabotage groups.” Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.
The effort was already coming at great cost to Ukraine, and apparently to Russian forces as well.

Russia was the only country to veto a U.N. resolution Friday that demanded Moscow end its attack on Ukraine.
Elsewhere, artillery and cruise missiles pounded cities across Ukraine, where Russian troops and armored vehicles have poured over the border.
Zelenskyy said that Russia wanted to capture the city and install its own "puppets" to run Ukraine.

     This follows two large explosions that rocked an area south of Kyiv just before 1 a.m. One of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said.
Elsewhere, Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, according to the Ukrainian president's office.
The new economic penalties on Moscow come as Russia’s military continues to bombard Kyiv and other population centers in its deadly invasion of Ukraine.
Germany’s chancellery announced it will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 “Stinger” surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine “as quickly as possible.”“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point.
