     Wisconsin basketball recruiting: UW offers 2024 big man James Brown out of Chicago
    </h2>

     It’ll include updates on current commits, including stats from their high school games, as well as news on players the Badgers are still pursuing.
He is slender, as he only weighs 210 pounds, but there is clearly room for him to add good weight once he gets to college.
His high school, St. Rita, just won the Illinois 4A regional championship over Morgan Park, led by 2024 teammate high 4-star Morez Johnson, who is committed to the Illini already.
He is an enticing prospect for the Badgers and, personally, I like any big guy that wears rec specs on the court.
I think Wisconsin has had good luck with tall, lanky, rec spec’d dudes from Illinois in the past.
