     Rutgers vs. Wisconsin basketball: Everything Steve Pikiell said after Scarlet Knights' loss to No. 13 Badgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rutgers head men's basketball coach Steve Pikiell remains confident in the Scarlet Knights' NCAA Tournament outlook despite a 66-61 loss Saturday to Wisconsin.
13 Badgers (23-5, 14-4 Big Ten) outlasted a second-half charge by Rutgers (16-12, 10-8) and escaped Jersey Mike's Arena in Piscataway, New Jersey, before 8,227 on hand.
Rutgers trailed 63-61 with 28 seconds left after senior Ron Harper Jr.'s 3-pointer and remained within game-tying distance following Tyler Wahl's 1-for-2 trip to the free-throw line five seconds later.
Baker's attempt to knot Rutgers with Wisconsin at 64 apiece on a triple with four seconds left missed, though, and Davis polished off the 66-61 final after two free throws.
ET) and Penn State (next Sunday, noon ET), how does Pikiell feel about Rutgers on the heels of a hard-fought defeat?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a path to the Big Ten title directly in front of them and a Saturday where the top 6 AP Top 25 teams all lost, Wisconsin should be feeling really good about their weekend.
Wisconsin has been hovering around the 3-seed or 4-seed line for what has felt like an eternity, but they have just kept on winning.
2 seed before their loss to Michigan State.
2 seed as the Badgers and Boilers meet in a clash that also has major Big Ten title implications.
Is there anything Wisconsin can do to land on the top seed line?

     It’ll include updates on current commits, including stats from their high school games, as well as news on players the Badgers are still pursuing.
He is slender, as he only weighs 210 pounds, but there is clearly room for him to add good weight once he gets to college.
His high school, St. Rita, just won the Illinois 4A regional championship over Morgan Park, led by 2024 teammate high 4-star Morez Johnson, who is committed to the Illini already.
He is an enticing prospect for the Badgers and, personally, I like any big guy that wears rec specs on the court.
I think Wisconsin has had good luck with tall, lanky, rec spec’d dudes from Illinois in the past.

Big Steve also had a bit of an off game shooting the ball.

UW’s poor season-long shooting from deep aside, they had a great game from beyond the arc against Rutgers.
In their first meeting, Rutgers was 7-of-12 from deep and it was a big reason why they left the Kohl Center with the win.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In addition to the Badgers’ much-needed victory over the Scarlet Knights, Davison was able to finally break out of a seven-game shooting slump.
… Super special day for my family.”Davison started the day with his teammates and spent the afternoon leading up to his game watching Michigan State beat No.
Leading up to Saturday’s game, Davison had been struggling to connect on his shots, going 26% from the field and 20.4% from 3-point range over the previous seven games.
He hit another shot from deep with 9:30 left before halftime, just 24 seconds after Scarlet Knights center Clifford Omoruyi made a hook shot to bring Rutgers within four points.
UW leading scorer Johnny Davis has been joking about Davison’s slump since it began and was grateful to see the beginning of the end.
