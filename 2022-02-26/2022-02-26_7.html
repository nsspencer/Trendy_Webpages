     At CPAC, Ukraine and Policy Take a Back Seat to Cultural Grievances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has much of the world transfixed and on edge.
President Biden announced a new Supreme Court appointment who is unlikely to get any significant Republican support.
But at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of the right wing of American politics, the news convulsing the world seemed oddly distant.
Instead, the focus was on cultural grievances, former President Donald J. Trump and the widespread sense of victimization that have replaced traditional conservative issues .
“If I said ‘I’m not going to run,’ the persecution would stop immediately,” Mr. Trump said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene raised eyebrows after she delivered a keynote address at a conference hosted by noted white supremacist Nicholas J. Fuentes.
Noted white supremacist Nicholas J. Fuentes called Greene the “standard-bearer of Trumpism” in Congress.
The guy Marjorie Taylor Green is with is a David Duke type anti-Semitic racist who defends Hitler.
Less than 24 hours later, Greene took the stage at CPAC as part of a panel discussion about cancel culture.
Last year, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar stopped by the Fuentes gathering before later appearing on stage at CPAC.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. (WFLA) — Former President Donald Trump is set to take the stage as the main event for this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday.
The annual political conference features conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States.
This year’s event promotes speakers such as Donald Trump, Jr., Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Candace Owens, Sen. Marco Rubio and Papa John.
He even pointed to a third run for president in 2024.
Trump recently came under fire for “praising” Russian President Vladimir Putin as “smart.”“Of course he’s smart,” Trump said during the Saturday night conference.

     CPAC Welcomes Marjorie Taylor Greene Hours After She Appears at White Nationalist Conference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hours after appearing at a white nationalist conference — because that’s apparently something a Republican member of Congress can do these days — Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene received a warm reception at the Conservative Political Action Conference across town.
“If there’s anything worth fighting for, it’s our freedom of speech and all of our rights.”On Friday, Greene unabashedly exercised her freedom of speech rights as a surprise guest of America First PAC organizer and white nationalist Nick Fuentes.
Greene referred to those in attendance (at the gathering of white nationalists, remember!)
Fuentes took the stage afterward, and declared, “God bless Marjorie Taylor Greene.” (Fuentes’ address also included him giggling through a bit of coded praise for Adolf Hitler.)
House Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who spoke at last year’s conference, delivered a pre-recorded address to the group.

     “We did it twice, and we’ll do it again,” said Trump, who has not formally announced he is running in 2024.
The GOP leaders did not embrace Trump’s praise of Putin and instead criticized Moscow for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, hailing Ukrainians who were battling Russian aggressors.
Among those considered to be top-tier candidates if Trump doesn’t run are Florida Gov.
They wore Trump gear and waved Trump flags and carried bedazzled Trump purses.
Forty-one percent of those polled said they’d vote for Trump, while 7% said they were undecided.

     Marjorie Taylor Greene Gets a Warm Welcome at CPAC After Headlining White Nationalist Conference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sign up for the free Mother Jones newsletterRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was warmly welcomed at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday, the day after she appeared as a surprise speaker at the white nationalist conference hosted by anti-Semitic, white nationalist activist Nicholas Fuentes.
In the past, CPAC has shunned the fringiest, most racist elements of the Republican Party.
It offers white nationalists who are trying to capture the GOP their own place to gather adjacent to the more mainstream CPAC.
But the Trumpist, white nationalist fringe is increasingly welcomed in today’s GOP, and Greene’s easy shift from one conference to another demonstrates that trend.
When Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a conspiracy about Jewish space lasers, she said she didn’t know more about it.

Trump ally and former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is reportedly in talks with the House select committee about testifying regarding the events of January 6, 2021.
The New York Times additionally reported on Wednesday that Ivanka Trump, the former president's eldest daughter, is having discussions with the House select committee about sitting down for an interview.
The House select committee is also investigating that scheme.
Raffensperger, who voted for and donated to Trump's 2020 campaign, declined to cave to Trump's pressure.

     It is clear, however, that some prominent CPAC speakers are, as the kids say, here for it.
On Friday she was introduced by Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist whose own AFPAC address featured giggling praise of Adolph Hitler.
Nor is it surprising that Sheriff Joe Arpaio attended CPAC to hawk his new book but also got a speaking slot at AFPAC.
All of this is true for the Republican Party writ large.
There was a time when CPAC was a sideshow, a place for the conservative fringe to gather and rant about how the Republican Party was taking them for granted.
