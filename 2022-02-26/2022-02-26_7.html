    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On a day when six other top-10 men's college basketball teams lost, No.
The 'Zags hadn't lost in WCC play since Feb. 22, 2020, when it lost at Brigham Young.
They got after us and played us really, really physical,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of Saint Mary’s.
“It’s kind of life in late February and early March, especially on the road,” Few said of his team's loss.
Gonzaga is still well-positioned to garner the top overall seed on Selection Sunday, although unlike last year the 'Zags have lost several times.

     Recap: Zags perfect conference record record spoiled by Saint Mary's
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a 67-57 loss to the Saint Mary’s Gaels in Moraga, Gonzaga’s historic conference winning streak was snapped on Saturday.
After enduring the toughest true road stretch of the season, the Zags (24-3, 13-1 WCC) still holds all the cards heading into the conference tournament as the nation’s top team.
The program will still be dancing in a few weeks regardless, with an opportunity to boost its current standing with a strong showing in the conference tournament as the No.
The same couldn’t be said of the Zags’ offense, who struggled to take the lid off the rim against the Gaels’ suffocating interior defense.
LOOKING AHEADWith a spot in the semifinal secured, Gonzaga can sit back and watch the first two rounds of the conference tournament starting next Thursday.

     College basketball rankings: Gonzaga remains atop Top 25 And 1 despite season-finale loss to Saint Mary's
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It ended with Gonzaga losing at Saint Mary's.
If Arizona would've won at Colorado, Tommy Lloyd's Wildcats would've moved to No.1 in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings.
So the only sensible thing to do is leave Mark Few's Zags in the top spot, despite the loss at Saint Mary's, because of a combination of their body of work and strong computer numbers.
Baylor is Sunday's biggest mover thanks to the Bears recording their national-best 11th Quadrant 1 win via a double-digit victory over Kansas.

     10 Observations from Gonzaga’s loss to Saint Mary’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was disappointing to see the Zags make so many poor decisions in the first half of the game.
It was an uncharacteristic opening 20 minutes from a group that is usually so composed and comfortable with what they do.
The Zags were shockingly poor at protecting the ball against digs from Saint Mary’s help defenders during the first half.
Saint Mary’s could teach a class on slowing down Gonzaga’s transition offense.
Saint Mary’s took complete control of the game at the opening tip and Gonzaga totally capitulated.

23 Saint Mary’s, which beat No.
1 Gonzaga 67-57 on Saturday night to prevent the Bulldogs from completing another undefeated run in the West Coast Conference.
But Saint Mary’s never let Gonzaga get comfortable on Saturday, leading from start to finish while winning their fourth straight since that loss in Spokane.
They got after us and played us really really physical,” Few said of Saint Mary’s.
