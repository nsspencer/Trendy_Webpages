     Islam Makhachev dominates Bobby Green with first-round TKO at UFC Fight Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russian continued his dominance Saturday night with a first-round TKO (punches) of Bobby Green in the headliner of UFC Fight Night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.
His latest win came at catchweight of 160 pounds, with Makhachev making it clear that he's more than ready for his shot at gold.
"I just want a title shot," Makhachev said in the Octagon following the win.
Following a quick striking exchange between the fighters, Makhachev got Green in a clinch and pressed him up against the Octagon.
From there, Makhachev secured a half guard and set a trap with a kimura attempt to mount Green.

     Islam Makhachev is on a mission for UFC lightweight gold, but wouldn’t mind taking a fight against Conor McGregor if he meets a certain requirement first.
Afterward, he made his intentions to fight for the title in his next outing clear.
However, nothing has been guaranteed ahead of the upcoming lightweight title fight at UFC 274 between champion Charles Oliveira and Justin Gaethje.
“He have to come back, beat someone, then let’s go.”Islam Makhachev says Conor McGregor would be light work.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This takedown from Islam Makhachev in the first round ends up being the difference-maker in a win vs. Bobby Green.
But Islam Makhachev made a statement that was necessary to peg himself as the next UFC lightweight title contender.
"I just want a title fight," Makhachev said in his postfight interview.
Makhachev-Dariush had been billed as a potential lightweight title eliminator bout.
Makhachev vs. Green took place at a catchweight of 160 pounds due to the short-notice nature of the contest.

     However, in the second round, Turman did a great job finishing his rival via arm-bar as soon as he closed the guard.
Petrosyan landed 20 more significant strikes in the first round, but the Brazilian fighter’s punches were way harder.
In the very first round, Tsarukyan landed a massive elbow and Alvarez was bleeding very badly.
In the second round, one punch was enough for the Armenian fighter to make Alvarez blind with his own blood.
The referee stopped the fight in the second round, and Tsarukyan earned a TKO victory.

     It would be a farce if McGregor, or any other lightweight, were to leapfrog Makhachev and fight the Oliveira-Gaethje winner.
Islam Makhachev made it look easy against Bobby Green on Saturday at UFC Vegas 49 in Las Vegas.
As they were trading against the cage, Makhachev dragged Green to the canvas and wound up in half-guard.
He quickly got into mount and finished Green with a fierce ground-and-pound.
