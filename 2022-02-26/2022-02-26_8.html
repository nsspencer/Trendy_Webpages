     Manchester United vs Watford live updates: Premier League latest as Rangnick's side held to 0-0 draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United failed to capitalise on their dominance as they were held to a 0-0 draw against a resolute Watford side at Old Trafford.
With 55 minutes gone, Ronaldo went down under a challenge in the box, but, after a VAR check, play resumed.
From that moment on, United kept pushing to find a winner and Watford defended resolutely.
Watford could have snatched a winner when Kuco robbed Pogba in the middle of the park, surged forward to the edge of the United box but fired wide.
The result sees both sides remain in their original position, with United 4th and Watford 19th.

     Crowd vent frustration after wasteful Manchester United are held by Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United’s inability to finish any of their countless chances was near-comedic and ultimately costly.
Against a Watford side with one league win since November, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes were the chief culprits, both missing when it appeared easier to score.
In contrast the draw is a deep frustration for Ralf Rangnick considering how dominant United were.
At the final whistle boos rang out around Old Trafford as the home supporters vented their ire at United’s toothlessness.
Ronaldo was unable to beat Foster from yards out, before Elanga and Fernandes had the same problem.
