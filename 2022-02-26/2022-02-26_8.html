    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kentucky basketball was back at full strength Saturday in Arkansas, but this time the Wildcats were unable to complete a comeback from a double-digit first half-deficit.
For the fourth consecutive game, Kentucky trailed by double digits in the first half, falling behind by 13 early.
"It was the game, that play," Kentucky coach John Calipari said.
