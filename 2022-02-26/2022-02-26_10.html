     Bill Maher Compares Russia-Ukraine War To Kanye West &amp; Kim Kardashian Feud On ‘Real Time’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last night on HBO‘s Real Time with Bill Maher, which was the show’s final episode before a short break, the host expectedly tackled the tragic Russia-Ukraine war that is currently underway.
“What kind of superpower makes up shit like that?” said Maher, an obvious critique of the US invasion of Iraq.
Maher somehow found humor in an otherwise bleak situation by making a somewhat realistic analogy.
The relationship between Ukraine (Kardashian) and NATO (Davidson) just drives Russia crazy.

     Bill Maher Says Dems Should Be ‘Gracious’ to Trump Voters: Don’t Say ‘Nice Work, You Stupid, Racist Sh*t-kicker!’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Comic and pundit Bill Maher said Democrats should be “gracious” to former President Donald Trump voters, and resist the urge to say things like “Nice work, you stupid, racist shit-kicker.”On Friday night’s edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the host devoted the end of his “New Rules” segment to the plight of the slowly-awakening Trump voter.
It took Trump voters a long time to make it all the way down the MAGA rabbit hole.
Instead of saying “Nice work, you stupid, racist shit-kicker.” Maybe try: “Hey, how you been?
Happens to all of us.” And don’t… And don’t talk politics at all.
Just say, I don’t know.

     “Trump has fallen 26 points among white Republicans without a college degree, down 21 among conservative Republicans, 18 among Republican men, 23 among Republicans over 65, down 19 among white evangelicals,” Maher said.
“The question now really is for Democrats, how are you going to handle that?

     Bill Maher Helps Americans Understand Russia-Ukraine Conflict Using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian &amp; Pete Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In light of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine in an attempt to seize land and power, Maher decided to explain the situation as simple as possible — by using Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson.
During his opening monologue on Friday (February 25), Maher tried his best to explain the conflict through a pop culture lens, equating Ye to Russia, Kardashian to Ukraine and Davidson to NATO.
“It’s like Russia is Kanye,” Maher said around the 2:25 mark to laughs from the audience.
“Ukraine is Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson is NATO, it just drives Russia crazy.
In court documents obtained by TMZ, Kardashian is firm in her stance regarding the divorce petition and alleges Ye’s social media posts are a continued cause for her desire to be declared legally single.

     Bill Maher has called on Democrats to show “graciousness” towards Republicans who may be losing the faith with Donald Trump.
Citing polls that suggest Mr Trump’s hold on the Republican Party is waning, the Real Time with Bill Maher host said on Friday’s episode there were “signs that the Trump fever is starting to break”.
The 66-year-old comedian said Mr Trump no longer commanded nearly the same level of attention as he did a year ago, and attendance at his rallies was down.
Those figures had essentially flipped, as Mr Trump had become less visible after his defeat in the 2020 election and hia ban from social media for inciting violence.
To Republicans who no longer supported Mr Trump, Mr Maher said: “You've got taken by a salesman.

     Play video content Real Time with Bill Maher/HBOThe brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine is hard for some Americans to understand, so Bill Maher broke it down in terms a pop culture consumer can easily grasp.
Maher broke it down Friday night on "Real Time," equating Ukraine to Kim Kardashian, NATO to Pete Davidson, and -- sorry Ye -- you're Russia.
Maher ended his show in true Bill fashion ... showing unbridled contempt for the Republican Party, while blasting the Democrats for squandering an opportunity to avert midterm disaster.
He noted Trump's stranglehold on the Republican Party seems to be waining ... the poll numbers show a drop in support as dramatic as the decline of Omicron.
There's a fabulous sports metaphor Obama once used to describe this very opportunity ... and Bill recounts it well.
