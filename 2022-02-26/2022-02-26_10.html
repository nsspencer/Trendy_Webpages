     Kevin Durant's Status For Nets-Bucks Game Saturday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets will be in Wisconsin on Saturday evening to take on the Milwaukee Bucks.
For the game, they will be without their best player Kevin Durant, who has been out since January 15 with a knee injury.
The status of Durant for Saturday night in Milwaukee can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Underdog NBA.
The Nets had been the top seed in the east at one point this season, but before the All-Star break they endured an 11-game losing streak.
They are 31-29 on the season, which has them as the eighth seed in the east.

     Grading the Milwaukee Bucks’ signing of Jevon Carter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Milwaukee Bucks were required to add a player this week to get their roster up to 14 players, and after initial speculation, it has been revealed who it will be.
As reported by ESPN senior insider Adrian Wojnarowski, the Bucks signed Jevon Carter after he recently cleared waivers.
Carter had been with the Brooklyn Nets until he was recently waived to make room for Goran Dragic, clearing the way for him to sign with Milwaukee.
The financial impact of the Milwaukee Bucks signing Jevon CarterAccording to Spotrac, Carter’s deal with the Bucks will be worth $457,149 for the remainder of the season.
As the 14th man on Milwaukee’s roster, Carter’s deal is reasonable and should not cause any controversy.

     Milwaukee Bucks vs. Brooklyn Nets Preview: The Wait is Over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After clearing their minds for eight days free from the rigors of NBA competition, the Milwaukee Bucks are returning to the court (hopefully refreshed) and ready to do battle with a Brooklyn Nets team that remains devoid of most of its star players.
pic.twitter.com/mqAj9bSUqT — Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) February 21, 2022The Antetokounbros bowed out of the skills competition, and apparently weren’t fully aware of the rules?
pic.twitter.com/Hd3by3lpTC — Jim Owczarski (@JimOwczarski) February 25, 2022The interesting subplot for this game is, of course, built around a re-tooled Brooklyn Nets roster.
Goran Dragic will also make his Nets debut.
Player to WatchI think the triumvirate of DeAndre Bembry, Jevon Carter and Goran Dragic make quite a trio of capable watching candidates for this one.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Nets wound up waiving Jevon Carter and DeAndre Bembry to make way for the new members of the team, and they signed with the Bucks as free agents.
He gives the Bucks interior presence and plenty of toughness as he battles opposing bigs on the boards.
Aside from the minutes total, the Nets have counted on Patty Mills to create offense, and that’s not his game.
On the court, he’s shooting a career high from the field (50.7 percent) and three point range (40.7 percent) as well.
The Nets need for Irving to put plenty of downhill pressure on the Bucks and get to the free throw line.
