     At CPAC, Ukraine and Policy Take a Back Seat to Cultural Grievances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has much of the world transfixed and on edge.
President Biden announced a new Supreme Court appointment who is unlikely to get any significant Republican support.
But at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of the right wing of American politics, the news convulsing the world seemed oddly distant.
Instead, the focus was on cultural grievances, former President Donald J. Trump and the widespread sense of victimization that have replaced traditional conservative issues.
“If I said ‘I’m not going to run,’ the persecution would stop immediately,” Mr. Trump said.

     Former President Donald J. Trump repeated familiar boasts and grievances in a keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.
Mr. Trump repeatedly invoked the lie that the 2020 election was “rigged” and mounted exaggerated attacks on President Biden.
What Mr. Trump Said“The wall will be quickly competed.
During his campaign in 2016, Mr. Trump promised to construct a 1,000-mile-long border wall that would be paid for by Mexico.
By the time he left office, his administration had constructed 453 miles of border wall, most of which replaced or reinforced existing barriers.

     Trump takes center stage at Florida CPAC conference

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. (WFLA) — Former President Donald Trump is set to take the stage as the main event for this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday.
The annual political conference features conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States.
This year’s event promotes speakers such as Donald Trump, Jr., Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Candace Owens, Sen. Marco Rubio and Papa John.
He even pointed to a third run for president in 2024.
Trump recently came under fire for “praising” Russian President Vladimir Putin as “smart.”“Of course he’s smart,” Trump said during the Saturday night conference.

     Trump again calls Putin 'smart' in CPAC speech, hints at 2024 presidential run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Trump also continued to tease another presidential run in a profane and lengthy campaign-style speech to a large crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando.
“Sanction, well that’s a pretty weak statement,” Trump said of the steps taken to penalize Russia by American and European allies.
“Putin is saying: ‘Oh they’re going to sanction me, they’ve sanctioned me for the last 25 years.
"I believe Americans deserve a president who will stop the invasion of our country also,” he added, referring to illegal immigration.
"They want to say their borders are sacred and we feel for Ukraine in so many ways," Trump added.

     “We did it twice, and we’ll do it again,” said Trump, who has not formally announced he is running in 2024.
The GOP leaders did not embrace Trump’s praise of Putin and instead criticized Moscow for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, hailing Ukrainians who were battling Russian aggressors.
Among those considered to be top-tier candidates if Trump doesn’t run are Florida Gov.
They wore Trump gear and waved Trump flags and carried bedazzled Trump purses.
Forty-one percent of those polled said they’d vote for Trump, while 7% said they were undecided.

     White Nationalists Raid CPAC But Find Themselves Right at Home

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It is clear, however, that some prominent CPAC speakers are, as the kids say, here for it.
On Friday she was introduced by Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist whose own AFPAC address featured giggling praise of Adolph Hitler.
Nor is it surprising that Sheriff Joe Arpaio attended CPAC to hawk his new book but also got a speaking slot at AFPAC.
All of this is true for the Republican Party writ large.
There was a time when CPAC was a sideshow, a place for the conservative fringe to gather and rant about how the Republican Party was taking them for granted.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe specter of escalating war in Europe may have overshadowed this year’s CPAC, but it did not haunt it.
The former president has long professed a variety of complex feelings towards Russia and Ukraine.
It became almost a de facto 2024 stump speech, served with thick slices of red meat to the CPAC crowd.
Overall, what Trump had to say differed little from what other CPAC speakers with presidential ambitions offered up across the multi-day conference.
The most eye-raising speech in Orlando over the weekend didn’t even happen at CPAC.
