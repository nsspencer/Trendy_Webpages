     Here's The Video Mike Conley Tweeted After The Jazz Beat The Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Utah Jazz defeated the Dallas Mavericks 114-109 at home in Utah on Friday evening.
The win improved them to 37-22 on the season in the 59 games that they have played so far.
After the game, Mike Conley sent out a tweet with a highlight from the game, and his post can be seen embedded below from his Twitter account.
The Jazz are the fourth seed in the Western Conference, and have a deep roster.
However, they have had regular season success over the last few seasons that has not led to a deep playoff run.

     Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert puts Bleacher Report on blast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Buying or selling 2 more buyout targets for the Utah Jazz by James PierceyUtah Jazz treasure Rudy Gobert has some beef with one particular outlet.
In the final minutes of Friday night’s 114-109 home victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Utah Jazz essentially tasked three-time All-Star Rudy Gobert with locking down three-time All-Star Luka Doncic throughout the visitors’ entire halfcourt possessions.
But for some reason — I blame Bleacher Report for that — the perception has never matched the numbers.
More words of defense from the Utah Jazz big manAfter learning from a reporter that Luka Doncic cried foul in his postgame comments, Rudy Gobert took the high road, sort of:“I mean, I’m not a ref.

     Utah Now Turns Its Attention To Five-Game Road Trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An argument can be made that Utah's five-point victory over Dallas on Friday night was its biggest win of the season.
Over the final three minutes, Utah shot 3-for-5, 2-of-2 from the free throw line, and had no turnovers.
goodnight, jazz fans — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 26, 2022Utah has now won seven of its past eight games — including victories over Denver, Brooklyn, Golden State, and Dallas — too firmly put itself in the No.
But now the Jazz have the opportunity to continue to climb those rankings when it heads out on a five-game road trip — something they have struggled with as of late.
After having started the season dominant on the road with a 15-6 record, Utah is currently on a six-game losing streak away from Vivint Arena.

     (Rachel Rydalch | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rudy Gobert, left, defends the basket for a stop against Dallas Mavericks, Luke Doncic, in the Vivint arena in Salt Lake City on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.
“It’s just multiple actions — he’s a very smart player,” Gobert said of Doncic.
“First of all, he knows I’m trying to take away the stepback, so he’s faking a stepback and then he’s driving.
“When Rudy switched onto him — we talked about how good Luka Doncic is — that is really hard,” noted Snyder.
“It was a very physical game.

goodnight, jazz fans — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 26, 2022Here are five things to know following the win:1.)
"That's the point where we've got to recognize and feel the game and play those possessions with more focus and more recognition of that point in the game and how pivotal it is."
"Sometimes you get better at the end of the game," Snyder said.
Finally, the trip wraps up with another showdown against Doncic and Dallas, a game that would clinch the season series over the Mavericks.

     Adjusting to life without Chris Paul is still a work in progress for the Phoenix Suns.
The Suns enter Sunday's home contest against the Utah Jazz trying to avoid their first two-game losing streak since late December.
On Friday, Phoenix dropped its second game without Paul in the lineup, falling to the New Orleans Pelicans 117-102.
The Suns had been surging before their All-Star point guard fractured his thumb Feb. 16 against Houston.
It wasn't enough to overcome CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram, who combined for 60 points against the Suns' defense.
