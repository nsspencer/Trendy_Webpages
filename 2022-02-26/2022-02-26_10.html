The 'Zags hadn't lost in WCC play since Feb. 22, 2020, when it lost at Brigham Young.
They got after us and played us really, really physical,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of Saint Mary’s.
“It’s kind of life in late February and early March, especially on the road,” Few said of his team's loss.
Gonzaga is still well-positioned to garner the top overall seed on Selection Sunday, although unlike last year the 'Zags have lost several times.

     Recap: Zags perfect conference record record spoiled by Saint Mary's
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a 67-57 loss to the Saint Mary’s Gaels in Moraga, Gonzaga’s historic conference winning streak was snapped on Saturday.
After enduring the toughest true road stretch of the season, the Zags (24-3, 13-1 WCC) still holds all the cards heading into the conference tournament as the nation’s top team.
The program will still be dancing in a few weeks regardless, with an opportunity to boost its current standing with a strong showing in the conference tournament as the No.
The same couldn’t be said of the Zags’ offense, who struggled to take the lid off the rim against the Gaels’ suffocating interior defense.
LOOKING AHEADWith a spot in the semifinal secured, Gonzaga can sit back and watch the first two rounds of the conference tournament starting next Thursday.

     MORAGA, Calif. – Saint Mary’s finally has its first perfect record at home -- and a memorable win over top-ranked Gonzaga to go with it.

They got after us and played us really really physical,” Few said of Saint Mary's.
Saint Mary’s: Bennett spent the week telling anyone who would listen that he liked his team’s chances.
