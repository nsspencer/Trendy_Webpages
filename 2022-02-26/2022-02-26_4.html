     John Mulaney’s ‘SNL’ Opening Monologue: “It’s Great To Be Somewhere That’s Always Emphasized Sobriety”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     John Mulaney kicked off his fifth time hosting Saturday Night Live by addressing his drug problem and talking about his newborn son.
In his opening monologue, the Kid Gorgeous comedian kicked off by saying, “For many many reasons, I’m grateful to be here tonight after a very complicated year, it’s always great to be somewhere that’s always emphasized sobriety and mental health.
“It was an intervention, for me, my least favorite kind of intervention.
Only it turned out that Arvin wasn’t a drug dealer but a painter who didn’t want Mulaney to buy his drugs on the street.
“There are many tales of drug dealers turning innocent people into drug addicts, but I might be the first drug addict to turn an innocent man into a drug dealer,” he added.
