     Kevin Durant's Status For Nets-Bucks Game Saturday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets will be in Wisconsin on Saturday evening to take on the Milwaukee Bucks.
For the game, they will be without their best player Kevin Durant, who has been out since January 15 with a knee injury.
The status of Durant for Saturday night in Milwaukee can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Underdog NBA.
The Nets had been the top seed in the east at one point this season, but before the All-Star break they endured an 11-game losing streak.
They are 31-29 on the season, which has them as the eighth seed in the east.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, "Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness", and right now there is no timetable for his return to playing.
Charania wrote in the first tweet: "Sources: Nets star Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness in reconditioning process that requires further strengthening of the area over a period of time before return to action."
Charania wrote in the second tweet: "Brooklyn has no set timetable for Simmons' return.
The Nets recently traded for Simmons in the deal that sent 2018 NBA MVP James Harden and Paul Milsap to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and draft picks.
On top of Simmons being out, Kevin Durant has been out of the lineup since January 15 due to a knee injury, and Kyrie Irving is a part-time player only eligible to play in games on the road.

     Ben Simmons dealing with back soreness ahead of Nets debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE (AP) — Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness as the Brooklyn Nets’ new acquisition prepares to make his 2021-22 debut.
Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed before Saturday’s game with the Milwaukee Bucks that the three-time All-Star has encountered “just a little soreness in his back.”“It’s not like an injury,” Nash said.
“It’s just kind of like as he’s returning to play, his back’s flared up a little.
“I think that’s just a part of his process of returning to play.
As you ramp up, you’re a little bit susceptible to certain things, as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness.”While speaking to reporters after the trade, Simmons said he hoped to play again by the time the Nets visit Philadelphia on March 10.

     Kevin Durant is working his way back from a knee injury, and by the looks of it, he’ll be returning to action for the Brooklyn Nets soon.
Woj noted that it will all depend on how Durant is feeling, though he has really progressed in his recovery and looked great during the team’s practices.
The Nets have shown signs of life since trading away James Harden in exchange for Ben Simmons and a slew of players and picks.
Steve Nash said it's likely Kevin Durant doesn't play in either game against Toronto.
With that said, they could really use Kevin Durant’s help in a bid to turn the season around ands still fight for the automatic playoff qualifications spot.

The Nets were good enough to win without those two Saturday, thanks largely to Irving.

     Nets' Ben Simmons dealing with back soreness, season debut unclear: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Nets are treating Simmons’ back issue as day to day and a normal part of the recovery process, sources said, but it remains unclear when the three-time All-Star will make his season debut.
In his introductory news conference with the Nets on Feb. 14, Simmons said he hoped to be ready to play in what would be a highly anticipated return game in Philadelphia on March 10.
Simmons last played in June 2021 during the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
On Saturday morning, Nets coach Steve Nash told reporters that Simmons is traveling with the team, but has not yet been able to do any high-intensity work yet.
Nets teammate Patty Mills, who shares a close friendship and history with Simmons, said recently that he's viewed a positive mindset from the 25-year-old star.
