     Putin Seems to Sideline Advisers on Ukraine, Taking a Political Risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Does President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have the support he needs at home to wage a costly war in Ukraine?
After all, Mr. Putin has already invaded Ukraine, suggesting he feels confident in his resources.
And his public image is that of a strongman, with the power to direct the Russian state as he pleases.
And a series of events this week, including Russia’s decision to throttle access to Facebook and censor news about the war in Ukraine, raise questions about just how much political support Mr. Putin will be able to draw on during the conflict.
An early sign that something might be amiss came on Monday in a televised meeting of Russia’s Security Council.

     Putin puts Russian nuclear forces on high alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon PollyRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday, reminding the world he has the power to use weapons of mass destruction, after complaining about the West’s response to his invasion of Ukraine.
Putin’s threat came during yet another highly-staged meeting, broadcast to the Russian public on video, this time with his top military commanders, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the chief of the general staff of the Russian military, Valery Gerasimov.
“The top officials of the leading NATO countries allow aggressive statements against our country,” Putin griped, a day after Germany and other European countries said they would speed weapons and other military assistance to help Ukraine battle the Russian invaders.
“Therefore, I order the Minister of Defense and the Chief of the General Staff to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian military’s deterrent forces to be on alert.
The announcement comes on the fourth day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The move is a reaction to the West announcing significant financial sanctions against Russian businesses as well as Putin himself, according to Putin’s televised comments.
According to Russia’s news agency, Tass, Putin told his top officials the move was in response to NATO leaders making “aggressive statements”.
This is a developing story.

     In 'unprecedented' action, Putin orders nuclear deterrent forces to be on 'high alert' amid spiraling tensions over Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Vladimir Putin took "unprecedented" post-Cold War action Sunday by ordering his nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert as international tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spiraled.
Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington nonprofit group, said Putin's action is a modern first.
Putin had promised a strong reaction to any Western power that tried to stand in his way in Ukraine.
"I don't think we should look at this as a threat by Putin to use nuclear weapons against the United States, against Europe, against NATO.
It's a point in which both sides needs to back down and move the word 'nuclear' from this equation."

     Key questions after Putin’s nuclear announcement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Experts weigh in after President Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert in a dramatic escalation of East-West tensions after the Ukraine invasion.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order on Sunday to place Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert is part of a pattern of escalating tensions following his attack on Ukraine.
Just as in NATO, a portion of Russian nuclear weapons are in constant readiness and “can be launched within 10 minutes”, said Marc Finaud, a nuclear proliferation expert at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.
Putin’s nuclear menace is all the more puzzling because it departs from established Russian nuclear deterrence doctrine.
They were when ballistic missiles were fired at Russia’s or allied territory, when an enemy used nuclear weapons, an attack on a Russian nuclear weapons site, or an attack threatening the existence of the Russian state.

     Putin’s order to put Russia’s nuclear weapons on what was described as high alert has raised the possibility that the Russia-Ukraine war could escalate to a nuclear war.
The instruction raises the possibility the Russia-Ukraine war could escalate to a nuclear war.
