     Ben Simmons dealing with back soreness ahead of Nets debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE (AP) — Ben Simmons is dealing with back soreness as the Brooklyn Nets’ new acquisition prepares to make his 2021-22 debut.
Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed before Saturday’s game with the Milwaukee Bucks that the three-time All-Star has encountered “just a little soreness in his back.”“It’s not like an injury,” Nash said.
“It’s just kind of like as he’s returning to play, his back’s flared up a little.
“I think that’s just a part of his process of returning to play.
As you ramp up, you’re a little bit susceptible to certain things, as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness.”While speaking to reporters after the trade, Simmons said he hoped to play again by the time the Nets visit Philadelphia on March 10.
