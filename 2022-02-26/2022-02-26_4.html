     That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.
The idea is to strike those who are closest to Mr. Putin and undermine their ability to live in both Russia and the West.
While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts.
Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.
But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

     The European Union is getting closer to supporting the expulsion of Russia from the SWIFT financial messaging system over the invasion of Ukraine, with Germany throwing its weight behind the move.
“We are working flat out on how to limit the collateral damage of decoupling from SWIFT in such a way that it affects the right people,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in a statement on Saturday.
“What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT.”

     What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The White House announced Saturday that the United States and allies agreed to block select Russian banks from SWIFT, the global financial messaging system.
Here’s what you need to know:What is the SWIFT financial system?
Barring Russia from SWIFT would damage the country’s economy right away and, in the long term, cut Russia off from a swath of international financial transactions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and other countries to cut Russia from the system.
Early Saturday morning, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told Zelenskyy that Italy supported "Russia's disconnection from SWIFT, the provision of defense assistance."

     US and Europe will block some Russian banks from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A coalition of NATO-aligned countries has committed to new measures meant to sever Russia from the global financial system, countries announced in a joint letter today.
In a dramatic escalation, the order also blocks select Russian banks from using SWIFT — the international payment system employed by banks to send money around the world.
SWIFT, which stands for The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a cooperative company based in Belgium, whose owners include many of Europe’s largest banks.
The organization’s eponymous payments network does not actually exchange money but is used to authenticate payment instructions between banks.
China also operates a rival system named Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationPARIS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A decision to cut Russia off from the global SWIFT payment system will be taken in a matter of days, the governor of a central bank within the euro zone told Reuters on Saturday.
"SWIFT is just a matter of time, very short time, days," the central bank governor, who asked not to be named, said.
Sanctions only make sense if there are costs for both sides and this will be costly," the central banker added.

     World powers move to block some Russian banks from global SWIFT transaction system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States, European Union and United Kingdom on Saturday agreed to block “selected’ Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system and to impose ”restrictive measures” on its central bank in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.
Saturday’s move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.
The U.S. has succeeded before in persuading the Belgium-based SWIFT system to kick out a country — Iran, over its nuclear program.
Cutting several commercial banks from SWIFT “will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,” she added.
“Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports,” she added.

     West Unleashes SWIFT Bans, More Crushing Penalties on Russia

     Saturday’s move also includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.
Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war.
But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies, including those of the U.S. and key ally Germany.
The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties later.
In a tweet Saturday night, the American Embassy said the problem appears to be related to recent sanctions, imposed on Russian banks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     White House and EU nations announce expulsion of 'selected Russian banks' from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Targeting the central bank would strike at the heart of Putin's yearslong efforts to insulate his economy from sanctions.
While discussions regarding Russia's central bank were described as still in their early stages, their consideration underscores the scale of the willingness to significantly escalate penalties in Washington and Brussels.
A senior Biden administration official, on a call with reporters, heralded Saturday's joint move as an "unprecedented act of global sanctions coordination."
One administration official said earlier that additional sanctions were likely to come if Kyiv, the besieged Ukrainian capital, fell.
Removing Russia from SWIFT would damage Russia but also big economies in Europe and impact energy exports to the continent.
