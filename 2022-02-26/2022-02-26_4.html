     Will There Be a ‘Euphoria’ Season 3 on HBO?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just like the first season, Euphoria Season 2 only consists of eight episodes, which means tonight’s installment (“All My Life, My Heart Has Yearned for a Thing I Cannot Name”) is the season finale.
When can we expect Euphoria Season 3 to premiere on HBO?
Earlier this month, HBO renewed Euphoria for a third season.
Based on all the aforementioned information, we expect Euphoria Season 3 to premiere in mid-to-late 2023 or even early 2024 on HBO.
WHERE TO WATCH EUPHORIA SEASON 2:Euphoria is available to stream on HBO Max or HBO’s linear channel.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When we left Euphoria Season One, there was no doubt that the focus was on Rue and Rue alone.
Here's everything we know so far about Euphoria Season Three.
What's in Store For Euphoria High in Season Three?
A few days before Euphoria's season finale, Elliot himself—or Dominic Fike, as he's known in real life—appeared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.
So we can safely rule out Elliot transferring out of Euphoria High after Season Two's dramatics, especially because his apology song to Rue seemed genuine.

     Class will be back in session, as Euphoria season 3 has been confirmed.
Then, after a Covid-19-related wait, Euphoria season 2 was filmed between April and November 2021.
This all leaves us thinking Euphoria season 3 may not get here until early 2024 at the latest.

     Lexi’s play includes notable moments from the Season 1 finale, including that infamous carousel scene.
With the latest kill, it’s clear that Fez isn’t going to make it to Lexi’s play.
After storming out of the play, Nate loads his father’s gun and meets his dad (Eric Dane).
The clock turns back once again to Rue’s emotional eulogy for her father, which plays out in real time via Lexi’s play.
Hopefully Euphoria season 3, which premieres in 2024, will provide answers, and much more.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rue is the heart of Euphoria, but the show has also lost sight of its ensemble nature.
Still pissed from getting dumped by Nate, Cassie walks onto the stage to confront Lexi for mining her life for theater.
Their fight ends with an exhausted Maddy, Cassie, and Kat “No Lines” Hernandez in the bathroom.
“Nate broke up with me before I even went up on that stage.” Maddy can only empathize.
Like Kat, Jules has had so frustratingly little to do this season, despite the special episode revealing so much promise.
