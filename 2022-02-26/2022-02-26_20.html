     AP Photo/Eduardo VerdugoRafael Nadal's red-hot start to the 2022 season continued on Saturday with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Cameron Norrie in the final of the Mexican Open.
The Mexican Open was his first event since the Australian Open final on Jan. 30.
The 26-year-old had to overcome his bad history against Nadal to win another event.
Nadal is currently riding a 15-game winning streak, the longest stretch to open a season in his career.
After getting a well-earned week off, Nadal is expected to be in the field at Indian Wells starting March 7.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rafael Nadal gets the ATP 500 Acapulco semifinal after having defeated the new world no.1 Daniil Medvedv, but just before the final, the Spaniard gets new records.
After beating Stefan Kozlov and Tommy Paul in the Acapulco tournament, Rafael Nadal not only matched his best start to the season since playing tennis, but scored his 117th win in an ATP 500 tournament starting in 2009 by overtaking his compatriot.
If instead we add up the history of victories in ATP 500 tournaments, the Spaniard is in fifth place with 167 successes in the Open era.
The now former world number one Novak Djokovic is far behind at 110 also because he has played fewer tournaments than the others.
In the semifinals he will have to contend with the new world number one Daniil Medvedev who will be eager for redemption after the defeat at the Australian Open.

     Rafael Nadal continues perfect start to season with Acapulco title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     21-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal continued his perfect start to the 2022 season in Acapulco on Saturday night, defeating Cameron Norrie in the final of the ATP 500 event, 6-4, 6-4, to improve to 15-0 on the year.
It’s his fourth career title in Acapulco, winning it twice on clay (in 2005 and 2013) and now twice since it switched to hard courts (in 2020 and 2022).
“It always has been a very special place,” Nadal told ATPTour.com after the match.
After four holds to open the match, Nadal drew first blood with a break in the fifth game for a 3-2 lead—which turned out to be the only break point of the first set—and the two held from there until Nadal pocketed the set, 6-4.
But getting the second break back proved too much for Norrie, as Nadal served it out on his second attempt for a one-hour, 54-minute victory.
