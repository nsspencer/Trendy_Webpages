    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     — For the first time since Jan. 29, Kansas basketball guard Remy Martin warming up ahead of a Kansas game.
The super senior was seen during warm-ups ahead of KU’s road game against Baylor.
According to KU basketball head coach Bill Self, Martin returned to practice in a “limited” capacity last Thursday and Friday ahead of KU’s trip to West Virginia.
Martin continued to practice this week but was in street clothes for KU’s game against Kansas State on Tuesday.
Since the Kentucky game, Yesufu has been playing a little over 16 minutes per game.
