Thamba went 8 of 13 for 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds, while Sochan had 17 points and five rebounds coming off the bench.
Adam Flagler and James Akinjo contributed 13 and 12, respectively, and the Bears battled back for the win.
With the win, Baylor improved its record to 24-5 overall and 12-4 in the Big 12.
After the game, Baylor head coach Scott Drew addressed the media, discussing the contributions from his big men, what comes next for Baylor and more.

     WACO, Texas — Remy Martin’s streak of missed Kansas basketball games ended Saturday during the Jayhawks’ 80-70 loss at Baylor.

Playing more than any other Kansas substitute, Martin finished with those five points Self mentioned.
Kansas junior guard Christian Braun thought Martin looked fast and hit a couple significant shots.
“He’s doing a great job just being a leader, being vocal,” said Braun, asked what’s needed from Martin moving forward.

     What we learned from Remy Martin’s return in Kansas Jayhawks basketball loss to Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because Martin wasn’t excellent ... and he wasn’t awful either.
Reading between the lines, though, Self wasn’t exactly effusive in his praise for Martin either.
There are risks in playing Martin too.
Joseph Yesufu has brought energy and athleticism off the bench recently, but playing Martin carves into his playing time while potentially killing some positive momentum built up there.
Martin wasn’t KU’s most significant problem against Baylor ... but didn’t prove himself to be a long-term solution either.
