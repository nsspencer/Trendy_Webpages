     At CPAC, Ukraine and Policy Take a Back Seat to Cultural Grievances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has much of the world transfixed and on edge.
President Biden announced a new Supreme Court appointment who is unlikely to get any significant Republican support.
But at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of the right wing of American politics, the news convulsing the world seemed oddly distant.
Instead, the focus was on cultural grievances, former President Donald J. Trump and the widespread sense of victimization that have replaced traditional conservative issues .
“If I said ‘I’m not going to run,’ the persecution would stop immediately,” Mr. Trump said.

     Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, U.S. February 26, 2022.
REUTERS/Marco BelloORLANDO, Florida, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Some 59% of attendees at the CPAC conservative conference in Florida want former Republican President Donald Trump to be the party's 2024 presidential candidate, according to a straw poll released on Sunday.
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for instance, beat out rivals in its 2016 straw poll but Trump ended up clinching the nomination.
In a straw poll question that omitted Trump, DeSantis garnered 61% of votes.
I want Trump to run and win," said CPAC attendee Tom Freeman, 66, who works at a retail company in Florida.

     Trump wins CPAC straw poll
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Former President Donald Trump easily won an informal straw poll of conservatives Sunday, when asked who they would support in a GOP primary for president in 2024.
Among attendees as the Conservative Political Action Conference, 59% said they would vote for Trump if the 2024 Republican primary were held today.
The straw poll, which covers conference attendees, is not a scientific survey and does not represent the larger GOP electorate.
While Trump breezed to the top of the potential Republican field, it was by a smaller margin than when CPAC conducted a similar straw poll last summer.
During that informal poll in July 2021, Trump topped the GOP field with support from 70% of conference attendees, compared to 21% who selected DeSantis last year.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In last year’s straw poll, DeSantis notched 21 percent support.
Eighty-five percent of respondents said they would support Trump again in 2024 if he launches another campaign for the White House.
But the straw poll also reaffirms DeSantis growing star power among conservatives, many of whom are eager for fresh leadership in the coming years.
Both scored 6 percent in the straw poll.
A plurality of straw poll respondents — 49 percent — said that election integrity is the issue most important to them, while 48 percent pointed to immigration.

     At CPAC, Trump delivers a reminder of his muscle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But among the activists at CPAC, it turns out, diehard conservatives remain more excited about the prospect of a Trump reelection than anything else.
“I think everyone in this room wants Trump to run again,” said George Santos, a New York Republican congressional candidate.
“I want Trump to run again and I want him to win in 2024 but he needs a competitive primary.
If Trump doesn’t run, Schlapp suggested the next nominee might even be someone who’s not on his straw poll list.
“So that’s the fun part of all of this — OK, if Donald Trump doesn’t run, who’s out there?” Schlapp said.

     Trump wins CPAC straw poll, revs up campaign speculation as Biden's polling collapses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump overwhelmingly won a straw poll at the country’s top conservative conference Sunday, another sign of his continued dominance of the GOP.
It's a modest improvement of about 4 percentage points since last year's CPAC Florida straw poll.
Trump’s CPAC speech had more of a forward-looking, Biden-focused campaign vibe, criticizing the president’s handling of Ukraine, inflation and security at the U.S.-Mexico border.
“As your president,” Trump said at one point, pausing dramatically as his words were swallowed in a thunderous ovation.
When CPAC tested a Trumpless primary in its straw poll, DeSantis got 61 percent support, an improvement of 18 points since the last CPAC straw poll a year ago.
