     Arkansas basketball: Razorbacks put country on notice with upset win over Kentucky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The first half of basketball on Saturday between Arkansas and Kentucky was, put simply, dominated by Arkansas.
On the back of Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky battled back in the second half, even taking the lead at certain points.
Kentucky took the lead on a 3-point shot with just over two minutes to play and it looked like it would come out with the win.
But then, the Razorbacks took over.
Tshiebwe’s performance in the game was the national story but it was Arkansas that came out with the win and shocked college basketball once again.
