    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Utah Jazz defeated the Dallas Mavericks 114-109 at home in Utah on Friday evening.
The win improved them to 37-22 on the season in the 59 games that they have played so far.
After the game, Mike Conley sent out a tweet with a highlight from the game, and his post can be seen embedded below from his Twitter account.
The Jazz are the fourth seed in the Western Conference, and have a deep roster.
However, they have had regular season success over the last few seasons that has not led to a deep playoff run.

     Rudy Gobert’s defense on Luka Doncic highlighted the Jazz’s best game of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     You missed the most exciting game of the season, and I say that for three reasons.
The energy of the game from beginning to end had the feel of a postseason matchup.
Mitchell finished the game with a career-high tying seven 3-pointers made, racked up 33 points and was engaged on the defensive end.
He’s going to dictate what he gets.”But what Doncic got was all 7-foot-1 of Gobert at his absolute finest.
Rudy Gobert's 4th quarter defense vs. the Mavericks was nothing short of spectacular.

     (Rachel Rydalch | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rudy Gobert, left, defends the basket for a stop against Dallas Mavericks, Luke Doncic, in the Vivint arena in Salt Lake City on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.
“It’s just multiple actions — he’s a very smart player,” Gobert said of Doncic.
“First of all, he knows I’m trying to take away the stepback, so he’s faking a stepback and then he’s driving.
“When Rudy switched onto him — we talked about how good Luka Doncic is — that is really hard,” noted Snyder.
“It was a very physical game.

goodnight, jazz fans — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 26, 2022Here are five things to know following the win:1.)
"That's the point where we've got to recognize and feel the game and play those possessions with more focus and more recognition of that point in the game and how pivotal it is."
"Sometimes you get better at the end of the game," Snyder said.
Finally, the trip wraps up with another showdown against Doncic and Dallas, a game that would clinch the season series over the Mavericks.
