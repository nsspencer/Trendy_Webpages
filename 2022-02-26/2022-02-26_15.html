     Final Purdue Boilermakers 65 Michigan State Spartans 68Michigan State basketball needed a near-perfect effort to beat Purdue on Saturday afternoon and it was all thanks to strong defense and hot shooting.
It’s never easy and it was stressful until the very end, but Michigan State basketball stepped up to beat No.
The win improves Michigan State to 19-9 overall and 10-7 in conference play and the Spartans should be comfortably in the NCAA Tournament now.
The lineup changes helpedInstead of falling behind big early on, Michigan State raced out to a 5-0 lead thanks to a three by Gabe Brown and a quick bucket.
There was a ton more energy on the floor to start the game and these lineup changes were a welcome sight.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Opening statement..."Well, I tell you — any time you play Purdue, you earn your win.
It wasn't lucky, I thought we earned it from the get-go, the start to the finish — the second half, every time they came back and made some plays.
Before halftime, that was tough, to go in to the locker room after playing so good and then giving them three free throws.
Mady Sissoko gave us about four minutes and I thought they were an incredible four minutes.
If he just hangs in there with us, he's going to be a good player before we are done.

Gonzaga Takes First WCC Loss in Over Two YearsUntil today, Gonzaga hadn’t even played a conference game decided by single digits.
With every other projected top seed losing today, Gonzaga will likely stay put as the No.
But in Baylor’s biggest game of the season to date, Scott Drew saw his other two frontcourt players step up in big ways.
Wednesday's matchup with Indiana in Bloomington could end up being something of a play-in game for NCAA tournament selection.
