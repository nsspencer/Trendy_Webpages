     Big Sean Denies Nude Photo on Instagram: ‘This Is Not Me’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Big Sean is shutting down an X-rated rumor.
The 33-year-old rapper began trending this weekend after his purported dick pic began circulating online.
As reported by The Shade Room, the image was “allegedly uploaded to his close friends on Instagram and made its way around social media.”A number of fans were quick to congratulate Sean on his … above-average endowment.
Minutes after The Shade Room shared the post, the rapper took to the comments section to deny the dick pic was his.
The now-debunked leak came just weeks after Nelly posted an explicit Instagram video.

     Big Sean Responds To Alleged Nude Leak Following Viral XXX-Rated Photo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just weeks after Nelly and Lil Fizz had their genitals plastered all over social media, Big Sean was purported to be the latest victim of a nude leak.
Both Sean Don and girlfriend Jhené Aiko started trending on Twitter Saturday evening (February 26) after a lewd photo went viral, which someone claimed featured the Detroit 2 lyricist.
Naturally, Twitter exploded with comments about the leak from people who seemed largely impressed with what Big Sean was packing.
“Now I see why Jhene Aiko won’t leave Big Sean,” one person wrote, while another said, “I see why his name is Big* Sean.” But according to the man himself, the appendage in the photo doesn’t belong to Big Sean.
They reportedly launched an investigation into the breach to ensure other personal information and documents weren’t jeopardized.

After an uncensored picture of his private parts allegedly hit the internet, the Detroit rap star began trending on social media.
