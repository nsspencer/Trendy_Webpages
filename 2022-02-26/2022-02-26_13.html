     Roman Abramovich has handed "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to the club's charitable foundation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
It is also understood that Abramovich remains adamant that Chelsea is not for sale.
Bur there are now questions about his long-term future at the club.
There have been calls from MPs this week that Russian-born Abramovich should not be allowed to own Chelsea due to his alleged links to Vladimir Putin's regime.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich suddenly handed over the "stewardship and care" of the Premier League club to its charitable foundation trustees Saturday.
Sources have told ESPN that Abramovich has no intention of calling in his loans to the club.
That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.
He did, however, have the final say on key decisions, including player transfers and the future of respective head coaches, something he will now step back from, sources have told ESPN.
Chelsea have won five Premier League titles since Abramovich's arrival as well as two Champions League trophies, in 2012 and 2021.

    </h2>

     Chelsea F.C.
In a move that is undoubtedly related to the recent invasion of Ukraine, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has given up the supervision of Chelsea F.C., a club he has owned for 20 years, to the charitable foundation of Chelsea.
While Abramovich is giving up “the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC,” no mention is made of his ownership in the club.

     So far, he has remained unscathed by the sanctions announced by the United States, Britain and the European Union this past week.
Lawyers for Abramovich, speaking this month before the Russia invasion of Ukraine, told the Guardian that he didn’t fit the criteria of British sanctions under discussion.
The United States and Europe on Friday announced sanctions on Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
The U.S. government has also cut off the largest Russian bank and blocked four others from doing business in the United States.
It joined the United States and Canada in vowing to cut off Russian financial institutions from a key global network on Saturday.
