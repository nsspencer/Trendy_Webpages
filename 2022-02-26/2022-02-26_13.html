The Timbers’ shot at a second MLS Cup went amiss in the final match against New York City FC, which saw Portland fall in penalties.
This will be the first time these two franchises have met in the regular season since September 2019.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Timbers and New England Revolution went toe-to-toe in a 2-2 draw at Providence Park, closing Saturday night of the 2022 campaign’s opening weekend in thrilling fashion.
The visitors and reigning Supporters’ Shield winners twice went ahead, starting in the 41st minute when right back Brandon Bye powerfully headed home a corner kick from Carles Gil, the reigning Landon Donovan MLS MVP.
Come the 63rd minute, midfielder Sebastian Lletget scored on his debut for New England, cushioning home a left-footed finish to the far post.
But Portland, MLS Cup 2021 hosts back on their rain-soaked turf, responded in kind in the 60th minute when forward Dairon Asprilla calmly finished Santiago Moreno’s line-breaking feed.
Then the spectacular arrived in the 78th minute through attacker Yimmi Chara, whose bicycle kick evaded goalkeeper Earl Edwards Jr.

     How MLS works 2022: Explaining league rules, structure, format and playoffs that determine cup champions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The regular season will take place from late February all the way through early October, with the playoffs unfolding between October and November.
How to watch MLSIn the United States, MLS games air across a number of networks and platforms for the 2022 season, including ESPN, Fox and Univision.
As a closed league, the same MLS teams compete every year, no matter their position in the standings the season prior.
Lower league clubs do occasionally get added as well, such as in 2020 when Nashville SC made the jump from the USL Championship.
The MLS playoffs are essentially a seeded, single-elimination knockout tournament contested at the conclusion of the regular season.
