The Timbers’ shot at a second MLS Cup went amiss in the final match against New York City FC, which saw Portland fall in penalties.
This will be the first time these two franchises have met in the regular season since September 2019.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Yimmi Chara scored on a bicycle kick goal in the 78th minute to pull the Portland Timbers into a 2-2 draw with the New England Revolution in the Major League Soccer opener for both teams Saturday.
Dairon Asprilla also scored for the Timbers to help deny the Revolution their first victory at Providence Park.
Revolution coach Bruce Arena remained tied with the late Sigi Schmid for the most regular-season victories in MLS with 240.
New England is the reigning Supporters Shield winner after amassing an MLS record 73 points last season.
The Timbers Army supporters group, known for large, coordinated displays called tifos, announced a break with tradition and had no tifo for the season opener.

     Minnesota United opens sixth MLS season with 1-1 draw at Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Healthy all preseason, Minnesota United opened its sixth MLS regular season with a contentious, uneven 1-1 draw at Philadelphia and with a starting 11 patched together with three unexpected newcomers and some baling wire.
Heath's team lost its first four games last season and still made the playoffs for a third consecutive season.
On Saturday, they started with a point on right-side attacker Robin Lod's 23rd minute goal that Philadelphia countered with Cory Burke's 35th-minute header.
The second half, there's like no midfield and you're going back and forth because it's so early in the season."
Heath often says he expects 10 goals a season from Lod, the Finnish national team player who scored zero, seven and nine goals in his first three MLS seasons.
