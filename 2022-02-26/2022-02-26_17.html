     The movie had not started yet while Mr. Oulson texted, they said.
Charles Cummings, who was 68 at the time and had served in the Marines, was in the row ahead of Mr. Reeves during the shooting.
Mr. Reeves got up and told Mr. Oulson to quit texting.
Then Mr. Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Mr. Reeves, who then shot Mr. Oulson in the chest, according to a criminal complaint.
The authorities said Mr. Reeves sat down calmly, put the gun on his lap and stared ahead.

     FLORIDA -- A Florida jury acquitted retired Florida police captain Curtis Reeves in the shooting death of a man in a movie theater eight years ago, CNN reported.
"(Reeves) killed another human being in a crowded movie theater next to his wife for no reason.
His wife was shot in the hand.Reeves told authorities he was "in fear of being attacked," according to the complaint.
He and his attorneys have argued Oulson threw a cellphone at Reeves' head and was aggressively leaning over a chair toward him when the shooting occurred.
Prosecutors have said popcorn is not a weapon and added witnesses did not report seeing Oulson throwing his cellphone.

     Terry SpencerAssociated PressA Florida jury on Friday acquitted a retired police SWAT commander of murder for fatally shooting a fellow moviegoer during an argument over cellphone use.
When Reeves returned, seeing that Oulson had put his phone away, he told Oulson that if he wouldn't have told the manager if he had known he would comply.
What happened over the next few seconds is where the stories diverge until Oulson grabbed Reeves' popcorn and flicked it back into Reeves' face.
But the video does show Oulson grabbing Reeves' popcorn bag, tossing it at him and Reeves firing.
He killed Oulson in anger after he had his ego hurt by being challenged and having popcorn thrown in his face, Rosenwasser said.
