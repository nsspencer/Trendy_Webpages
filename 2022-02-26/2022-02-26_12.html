     How to watch: Wisconsin basketball vs. Rutgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Saturday evening, the Wisconsin Badgers will head to Piscataway, N.J., to face off for the second time this season against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.
13 Wisconsin vs. RutgersThis will be a revenge game for the Badgers since they were beaten by the Scarlet Knights at home 73-65 earlier in the season.
Wisconsin’s leading scorers, Brad Davison and Jonathan Davis, both struggled to find the basket in the last loss to Rutgers, so it will be important for the Badgers to get them going early.
It should be a phenomenal game to watch as Rutgers fights for its March Madness chances and as Wisconsin tries to keep level with Purdue for first place in the Big Ten.

     It’ll include updates on current commits, including stats from their high school games, as well as news on players the Badgers are still pursuing.
He is slender, as he only weighs 210 pounds, but there is clearly room for him to add good weight once he gets to college.
His high school, St. Rita, just won the Illinois 4A regional championship over Morgan Park, led by 2024 teammate high 4-star Morez Johnson, who is committed to the Illini already.
He is an enticing prospect for the Badgers and, personally, I like any big guy that wears rec specs on the court.
I think Wisconsin has had good luck with tall, lanky, rec spec’d dudes from Illinois in the past.

Big Steve also had a bit of an off game shooting the ball.

UW’s poor season-long shooting from deep aside, they had a great game from beyond the arc against Rutgers.
In their first meeting, Rutgers was 7-of-12 from deep and it was a big reason why they left the Kohl Center with the win.
