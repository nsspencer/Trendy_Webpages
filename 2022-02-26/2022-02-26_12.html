It is also understood that Abramovich remains adamant that Chelsea is not for sale.
Bur there are now questions about his long-term future at the club.
There have been calls from MPs this week that Russian-born Abramovich should not be allowed to own Chelsea due to his alleged links to Vladimir Putin's regime.

     “That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.
The 55-year-old billionaire’s spending in the transfer market is largely credited with helping Chelsea reach the status of European elite.
According to Forbes, Abramovich has given Chelsea a $2 billion loan, which could allow him leverage if the UK does impose sanctions.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson erroneously claimed Tuesday that Abramovich had already been sanctioned, leading his office to issue a correction.
“Surely Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country,” Bryant said in Parliament.

He did, however, have the final say on key decisions, including player transfers and the future of respective head coaches, something he will now step back from, sources have told ESPN.
Chelsea have won five Premier League titles since Abramovich's arrival as well as two Champions League trophies, in 2012 and 2021.

     The signatories, including Yad Vashem’s Dani Dayan, Chief Rabbi David Lau, and Sheba Medical Center director-general Prof. Yitshak Kreiss, said such a measure would both be unfair and negatively impact Israel and the Jewish world.
Last week, Yad Vashem’s Dayan announced that Abramovich had made a multi-million shekel donation “that will significantly strengthen Yad Vashem’s mission.”AdvertisementThe announcement came just over two weeks after the letter was reportedly sent to Nides.
Yad Vashem’s spokesman did not give the exact sum donated by Abramovich, but said that it is “an eight-figure donation.”“With this contribution, Roman Abramovich will become the second-largest private donor to Yad Vashem, after Miri and Sheldon Adelson,” he said.
In 2018 the oligarch immigrated to Israel, instantly becoming one of the country’s richest people, with an estimated wealth of some $14 billion.
The move came after he was unable to extend his visa in the UK amid a diplomatic spat between London and Moscow.

Lawyers for Abramovich, speaking this month before the Russia invasion of Ukraine, told the Guardian that he didn’t fit the criteria of British sanctions under discussion.
The United States and Europe on Friday announced sanctions on Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
The U.S. government has also cut off the largest Russian bank and blocked four others from doing business in the United States.
It joined the United States and Canada in vowing to cut off Russian financial institutions from a key global network on Saturday.
