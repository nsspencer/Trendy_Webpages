     LCD Soundsystem Become Guardian Angels for SNL: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LCD Soundsystem swung by Studio 8H last night as the musical guest for Saturday Night Live.
Murphy and co. also took part in “Subway Churro,” arguably the most hilarious skit of the evening.
— to face off against Aidy Bryant’s Jesus lookalike for control of the New York subway system.
The show marked LCD Soundsystem’s second time as musical guest on SNL, following their first appearance back in 2017 with host Chris Pine to promote their fourth, and still most recent, studio set American Dream.
This spring, the band will head to Philadelphia and Boston for a pair of short-term residencies from March 28th-31st and April 3rd-6th.

     LCD Soundsystem Performs ‘Thrills’ &amp; ‘Yr City’s a Sucker’ From 2005 Debut on ‘SNL’: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LCD Soundsystem took a trip down memory lane during its Feb. 26 appearance on Saturday Night Live.
In an unusual move, the Brooklyn-born band performed a pair of deep cuts from its 2005 self-titled debut album instead of promoting new music.
LCD Soundsystem last appeared on SNL in 2017, during which the electronic band performed a pair of songs from its fourth album, American Dream.
The band also released a Christmas special, titled LCD Soundsystem Holiday Special, in late December on Amazon.

     LCD Soundsystem Go Deep Into Their Catalog in Second Saturday Night Live Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LCD Soundsystem hit the Saturday Night Live stage for the second time last night, following their 2017 debut.
James Murphy and company went deep into their catalog to perform “Thrills” and “Yr City’s A Sucker” from 2005’s self-titled album.
Katy Perry was the last musical guest and made her performance one to remember.
Last year also saw the band collaborate with funnyman Eric Wareheim on a holiday special aptly titled All My Friends.
We spoke with the comedian about how the show came together and what it was like to play Murphy.

     ‘SNL’: LCD Soundsystem Performs Deep Cuts ‘Thrills’ and ‘Yr City’s A Sucker’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For their second appearance as musical guests on Saturday Night Live, LCD Soundsystem decided to perform two deep cuts from their discography.
The Brooklyn indie outfit spearheaded by James Murphy kicked off their set with the industrial-tinged “Thrills” before returning to the stage for a funky synth performance of their hit “Yr City’s A Sucker”— both from their self-titled 2005 album.
LCD Soundsystem also made an in-sketch appearance as a gang of Guardian Angels in the “Subway Churro” musical:The group previously played on SNL in 2017, performing songs from their 2017 LP American Dream including the title track and “Call The Police.”Last year, LCD was supposed to play a 20-show residency at Brooklyn Steel but had to cancel three dates because of a surge in Covid-19 cases.
Earlier this week the band announced they would be doing multinight residencies in Philadelphia and Boston.
Performances will be held at Franklin Music Hall in Philadelphia on March 28, 29, 30, and 31 and at Roadrunner in Boston on April 3, 4, 5 and 6.
