     How to watch: Wisconsin basketball vs. Rutgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Saturday evening, the Wisconsin Badgers will head to Piscataway, N.J., to face off for the second time this season against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.
13 Wisconsin vs. RutgersThis will be a revenge game for the Badgers since they were beaten by the Scarlet Knights at home 73-65 earlier in the season.
Wisconsin’s leading scorers, Brad Davison and Jonathan Davis, both struggled to find the basket in the last loss to Rutgers, so it will be important for the Badgers to get them going early.
It should be a phenomenal game to watch as Rutgers fights for its March Madness chances and as Wisconsin tries to keep level with Purdue for first place in the Big Ten.

     “This group has had a Big Ten championship in their sights since we started in the offseason,” Gard said Saturday night after Wisconsin took over first place with a hard-fought 66-61 road win over Rutgers.
“The way we played in the second half was the way we played in beating four ranked teams in a row,” Harper said.
A free throw by Wahl five seconds later gave Rutgers on last shot but Baker missed it.
Wisconsin built a 33-23 halftime lead and it was Davison and Hepburn who carried the load.
Rutgers: Needs a win or two next week to assure itself a second straight NCAA trip.
