     #4 Purdue 65, Michigan St. 68- Another Buzzer Beats the Boilers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s a crushing loss for Purdue who controlled their own destiny in the Big Ten.
Gillis was fouled out on a question rebounding call in a big late game situation.
The Spartans had one game plan for Purdue, and that was to limit the Boilers deadly outside shooting.
Michigan State on the other end did just enough, mostly by taking advantage of Purdue turnovers.
Michigan State was 9 of 20 from three, out shooting Purdue, including the dagger late.
