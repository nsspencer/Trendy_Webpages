     War in Ukraine: What you need to knowThe latest: Air raid sirens sounded and residents sheltered underground early Sunday as Russian forces continued to bombard Kyiv with some of the fiercest shelling since the start of the invasion.
Maps: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.
The response: Western nations have announced sweeping sanctions on Russian banks, companies and officials, including President Vladimir Putin.

     That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.
While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts.
Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.
And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy.
But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

     US and Europe will block some Russian banks from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A coalition of NATO-aligned countries has committed to new measures meant to sever Russia from the global financial system, countries announced in a joint letter today.
In a dramatic escalation, the order also blocks select Russian banks from using SWIFT — the international payment system employed by banks to send money around the world.
SWIFT, which stands for The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a cooperative company based in Belgium, whose owners include many of Europe’s largest banks.
The organization’s eponymous payments network does not actually exchange money but is used to authenticate payment instructions between banks.
China also operates a rival system named Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS.

     What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The White House announced Saturday that the United States and allies agreed to block select Russian banks from SWIFT, the global financial messaging system.
Here’s what you need to know:What is the SWIFT financial system?
Barring Russia from SWIFT would damage the country’s economy right away and, in the long term, cut Russia off from a swath of international financial transactions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and other countries to cut Russia from the system.
Early Saturday morning, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told Zelenskyy that Italy supported "Russia's disconnection from SWIFT, the provision of defense assistance."

     West Unleashes SWIFT Bans, More Crushing Penalties on Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Saturday’s move also includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.
Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war.
But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies, including those of the U.S. and key ally Germany.
The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties later.
In a tweet Saturday night, the American Embassy said the problem appears to be related to recent sanctions, imposed on Russian banks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     SWIFT: White House and EU nations announce expulsion of 'selected Russian banks' from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At a press conference Thursday, Biden was pressed on why he had avoided removing Russia from SWIFT or sanctioning Putin personally.
Targeting the central bank would strike at the heart of Putin’s yearslong efforts to insulate his economy from sanctions.
While discussions regarding Russia’s central bank were described as still in their early stages, their consideration underscores the scale of the willingness to significantly escalate penalties in Washington and Brussels.
One administration official said earlier that additional sanctions were likely to come if Kyiv, the besieged Ukrainian capital, fell.
Removing Russia from SWIFT would damage Russia but also big economies in Europe and impact energy exports to the continent.
