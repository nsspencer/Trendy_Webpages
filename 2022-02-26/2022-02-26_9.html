     That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.
While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts.
Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.
And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy.
But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The White House announced Saturday that the United States and allies agreed to block select Russian banks from SWIFT, the global financial messaging system.
Here’s what you need to know:What is the SWIFT financial system?
Barring Russia from SWIFT would damage the country’s economy right away and, in the long term, cut Russia off from a swath of international financial transactions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and other countries to cut Russia from the system.
Early Saturday morning, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told Zelenskyy that Italy supported "Russia's disconnection from SWIFT, the provision of defense assistance."

     US and Europe will block some Russian banks from SWIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A coalition of NATO-aligned countries has committed to new measures meant to sever Russia from the global financial system, countries announced in a joint letter today.
In a dramatic escalation, the order also blocks select Russian banks from using SWIFT — the international payment system employed by banks to send money around the world.
SWIFT, which stands for The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a cooperative company based in Belgium, whose owners include many of Europe’s largest banks.
The organization’s eponymous payments network does not actually exchange money but is used to authenticate payment instructions between banks.
China also operates a rival system named Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS.

     Moscow's exclusion from SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, means Russian banks won't be able to communicate securely with banks beyond its borders.
"This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally," the global powers wrote in a joint statement announcing the significant retaliatory measure.
WASHINGTON — The U.S., European allies and Canada agreed Saturday to remove key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT, an extraordinary step that will sever the country from much of the global financial system.
SWIFT is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.
On Friday, the U.S. alongside the United Kingdom and the European Union announced sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States, European Union and United Kingdom on Saturday agreed to block “selected’ Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system and to impose ”restrictive measures” on its central bank in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.
Saturday’s move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.
The U.S. has succeeded before in persuading the Belgium-based SWIFT system to kick out a country — Iran, over its nuclear program.
Cutting several commercial banks from SWIFT “will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,” she added.
“Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports,” she added.

     Targeting the central bank would strike at the heart of Putin's yearslong efforts to insulate his economy from sanctions.
While discussions regarding Russia's central bank were described as still in their early stages, their consideration underscores the scale of the willingness to significantly escalate penalties in Washington and Brussels.
A senior Biden administration official, on a call with reporters, heralded Saturday's joint move as an "unprecedented act of global sanctions coordination."
One administration official said earlier that additional sanctions were likely to come if Kyiv, the besieged Ukrainian capital, fell.
