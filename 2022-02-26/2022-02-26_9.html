    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phil Mickelson is out as host of The American Express that is played each January in California's Coachella Valley.
The Palm Springs Desert Sun reported on Saturday that the PGA Tour confirmed that Mickelson won’t be the future host after serving the event in that capacity for the past three years.
The charitable arm of the tournament, the Mickelson Foundation, will also no longer be part of the event, the tour said.

     Phil Mickelson out as host of PGA Tour event The American Express
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A week of reckoning continued for Phil Mickelson who has stepped down as the host of The American Express, the Desert Sun reported.
Mickelson had served as host of the PGA Tour event since 2020 although he appeared disengaged at this year’s event where he didn’t hold a press conference and missed the cut.
Phil Mickelson dealing with more sponsorship falloutThis comes a day after more of Mickelson’s sponsors distanced themselves from the 51-year-old.
On Tuesday, Mickelson released a lengthy apology to the super league and LIV Golf, the investment fund behind the rival circuit, but didn’t mention the PGA Tour.
Mickelson hasn’t played on Tour since the Farmers Insurance Open in late January and he’s not in the field for next week’s Arnold Palmer.

Mickelson did not mention the PGA Tour or Commissioner Jay Monahan, which he referred to in the Shipnuck interview as a "dictatorship."
Workday, which has sponsored Mickelson since 2017, told Golf Digest it would not be renewing the contract when it expires at the nd of March.

     Anyway, since the spectacular reversal that ended the Saudi league (for the moment), Mickelson has since faced a good deal of fallout of his own.
A Statement from Phil Mickelson pic.twitter.com/2saaXIxhpu — Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) February 22, 2022British-Dutch accounting firm KPMG, which has done major business in Saudi Arabia for 30 years, was the first to drop Mickelson, who’d been sponsored by the firm for 14 years.
Workday, which also does business in Saudi Arabia, had sponsored Mickelson for four years until this week when they announced a mutual decision to part ways.
“Callaway does not condone Phil Mickelson’s comments and we were very disappointed in his choice of words,” the brand said.
Alan Shipnuck, the writer to whom Mickelson made his infamous comments, defended himself against any idea that he misquoted Mickelson or otherwise did the golfer dirty.

     The American Express event on the PGA Tour will no longer have Phil Mickelson serve as host
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (3:39)Phil Mickelson's controversial comments about the PGA Tour and organizers of a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league continue to create backlash, as the six-time major champion will no longer serve as host of The American Express event in La Quinta, California.
The PGA Tour on Saturday told The Desert Sun that in addition to Mickelson not returning as host in January 2023, the Mickelson Foundation will no longer be the charitable arm of the event.
His comments drew widespread criticism -- including from fellow PGA Tour players -- leading Mickelson to apologize days later.
Mickelson, 51, had served as host of The American Express event since 2020.
Last month, American Express extended its title sponsorship deal with the event through 2028.

     Phil Mickelson's Saudi Arabia comments prove costly as sponsors cut ties with embattled golfer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rarely do groups of the most important people run away from Phil Mickelson.
This one from Heineken, Amstel's parent company, is emblematic of all of them:"We made the decision to go our separate ways and end Amstel Light's partnership with Phil Mickelson," the spokesperson said.
He also noted that he was going to step away from golf for a while.
Certainly, Mickelson's comments were putrid, but his chief crime was trying to upend PGA Tour policies by leveraging a hostile government against them.
The PGA Tour is powerful, though, and Mickelson -- as this saga has proven -- is not bigger than the entity under which he made his name.
