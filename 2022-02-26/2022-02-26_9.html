     Buying or selling 2 more buyout targets for the Utah Jazz by James PierceyUtah Jazz treasure Rudy Gobert has some beef with one particular outlet.
In the final minutes of Friday night’s 114-109 home victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Utah Jazz essentially tasked three-time All-Star Rudy Gobert with locking down three-time All-Star Luka Doncic throughout the visitors’ entire halfcourt possessions.
But for some reason — I blame Bleacher Report for that — the perception has never matched the numbers.
More words of defense from the Utah Jazz big manAfter learning from a reporter that Luka Doncic cried foul in his postgame comments, Rudy Gobert took the high road, sort of:“I mean, I’m not a ref.

     (Rachel Rydalch | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rudy Gobert, left, defends the basket for a stop against Dallas Mavericks, Luke Doncic, in the Vivint arena in Salt Lake City on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.
“It’s just multiple actions — he’s a very smart player,” Gobert said of Doncic.
“First of all, he knows I’m trying to take away the stepback, so he’s faking a stepback and then he’s driving.
“When Rudy switched onto him — we talked about how good Luka Doncic is — that is really hard,” noted Snyder.
“It was a very physical game.

     In their return to the court on Friday night against a dominant Luka Doncic, Utah played better down the stretch to come out on top.
goodnight, jazz fans — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 26, 2022Here are five things to know following the win:1.)
"That's the point where we've got to recognize and feel the game and play those possessions with more focus and more recognition of that point in the game and how pivotal it is."
"Sometimes you get better at the end of the game," Snyder said.
Finally, the trip wraps up with another showdown against Doncic and Dallas, a game that would clinch the season series over the Mavericks.
