     KYIV, Ukraine — As Russian troops lay siege to Kyiv, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, again appeared on camera on Saturday to furnish proof of his continued presence in his country’s capital, praise his outgunned and outmanned military and beseech Western countries for more support.
“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted around noon local time, the latest of several speeches he has released.
“The occupiers wanted to put a blockade on the seat of our state’s power and set up their puppets here,” he said.
“We messed up their plans, they did not gain any advantage over us,” he added in Ukrainian.
The occupiers are hitting residential areas using jet artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities.

The money was raised at Catholic churches across Europe at the call of Pope Francis.

     Citing TikTok and other social media platforms, along with satellites and live traffic data on Google Maps, Friedman writes, "Welcome to World War Wired -- the first war in a totally interconnected world."
And the heroic figure at the center of this war is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian who rose to prominence playing a character on a popular TV show who accidentally becomes the Ukrainian president.
Imagine a country where a television star could become president and emerge as a beacon of courage!
He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage.
We are protecting Ukraine," Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers.

     A Prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before he became the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played the part on television.
As Zelensky has stumbled through his actual career in politics, those doubts have dogged him.
But in life, as in the fictional version he created, Zelensky, slightly diminutive and gravelly-voiced, has been subjected to the most intense stress test of character.
Yesterday, Zelensky told a videoconference of European leaders that they would likely not ever see him again.
Zelensky relocated his production company to Kyiv and began to truly master the Ukrainian language.

     The big picture: It's a role few could imagine Zelensky playing when he won the presidency in 2019, his closest qualification being playing a president on television.
Zelensky had no prior political experience before becoming president and named his political party after the television sitcom on which he played a president, "Servant of the People."
"Throughout my entire life, I’ve tried to do everything so Ukrainians smiled," Zelensky said during his inauguration speech, per Politico.
Zelensky has turned down an American offer to evacuate, saying "the fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."
The bottom line: "He has some shortcomings," a woman who would give only her first name, Ekaterina, told Politico of Zelensky.

     In Ukraine, there’s precedent for Shuklin’s screen-to-reality sense of confidence: President Volodymyr Zelensky was an actor and comedian, whose only political experience before getting elected was playing the role of Ukraine’s president in a satirical TV series.
Ukrainians felt he was weak in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and too quick to seek compromise with Moscow.
As a wartime president, however, Zelensky has risen remarkably to the challenge.
AdvertisementBefore the war, Valiiev wasn’t the president’s biggest fan, worrying about corruption and who he perceived as some pro-Russian appointees.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 26 that his country should join the European Union.
