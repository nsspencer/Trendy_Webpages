     Phil Mickelson Loses Another Sponsor Following Controversial Comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Earlier this week, controversial comments Phil Mickelson made about the Saudi-backed Super Golf League stole the headlines.
In the days following his comments, Mickelson has seen several longtime sponsors end their partnership with him.
In a statement to Golf Digest, Workday announced it has ended its partnership with Mickelson.
Here’s the statement from Workday, via Golf Digest:“At this time, Workday and Phil Mickelson have mutually and amicably agreed to not renew our brand sponsorship that ends this March,” a Workday spokesperson told Golf Digest on Friday.
“We want to thank Phil for his great contributions as a Workday ambassador, both on and off the course.

“Phil has apologized and we know he regrets how he handled recent events.
Last week, golf writer Alan Shipnuck published comments Mickelson made to him in November, in which Mickelson referred to the Saudis as “scary m—–f——” and admitted his involvement with the SGL was a means of gaining leverage on the PGA Tour.
Days after the remarks were made public, Mickelson issued a lengthy statement on social media.
“I have incredible partners, and these relationships mean so much more to me than a contract,” he said.

     Hall of Fame golfer Phil Mickelson out as American Express host after controversial comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the wake of his controversial comments about a proposed Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league and his perceived problems with the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson will no longer serve as host of The American Express PGA Tour event in La Quinta.
The PGA Tour confirmed to The Desert Sun on Saturday that Mickelson, who served as tournament host since 2020, will not return to that role in 2023.
Mickelson, a Hall of Fame golfer and winner of 45 PGA Tour events and six major championships, has been a fixture in the desert and at the tournament.
Mickelson, a 19-time tournament participant since his desert debut in 1993, has won twice in 2002 and 2004.
The PGA Tour has a direct contract with American Express, which announced at the tournament last month an extension of its title sponsor deal through 2028.

     Despite this, Mickelson said the threat of the proposed league offered players a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates".
Mickelson apologised for his "reckless" comments on Tuesday and said he will be taking a break from golf.
SearchThe comments were widely criticised by the golf community, with Rory McIlroy calling the six-time major winner's comments "egotistical and ignorant".
At this time, we have agreed to pause our partnership and will re-evaluate our ongoing relationship at a later date."
Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, world number one Jon Rahm and No 2 Collin Morikawa are among other high-profile golfers who have expressed their PGA Tour allegiance.

     Phil Mickelson’s spectacular fall and golf’s infighting over Saudi riches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mickelson had accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” over matters which nobody in the wider world had particular reason to care about.
Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.
Norman’s open letter to the PGA Tour, published on Thursday, warned: “This is just the beginning.” The Australian has a salary that dictates such bullishness is necessary.
Alliances exist between the LET and the US-based LPGA Tour, just as they do between the LPGA Tour and the PGA Tour.
Norman has chosen to focus on claims that no player can combine the super league with the PGA Tour.
