     Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer.
Zelensky said in response: “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelensky as upbeat.

     KYIV, Ukraine — As Russian troops lay siege to Kyiv, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, again appeared on camera on Saturday to furnish proof of his continued presence in his country’s capital, praise his outgunned and outmanned military and beseech Western countries for more support.
“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted around noon local time, the latest of several speeches he has released.
“The occupiers wanted to put a blockade on the seat of our state’s power and set up their puppets here,” he said.
“We messed up their plans, they did not gain any advantage over us,” he added in Ukrainian.
The occupiers are hitting residential areas using jet artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities.

     Zelensky defiant: Ukrainian president refuses US offer to evacuate, saying 'I need ammunition, not a ride'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy.
In a video posted on Saturday morning entitled “do not believe the fakes,” Zelensky revealed that he is still in Kyiv.
Zelensky remains a “prime target for Russian aggression,” US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday evening amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“According to our information, the enemy marked me as target №1, my family - as target №2,” Zelensky said Thursday.
“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.

     A Prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before he became the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played the part on television.
As Zelensky has stumbled through his actual career in politics, those doubts have dogged him.
But in life, as in the fictional version he created, Zelensky, slightly diminutive and gravelly-voiced, has been subjected to the most intense stress test of character.
Yesterday, Zelensky told a videoconference of European leaders that they would likely not ever see him again.
Zelensky relocated his production company to Kyiv and began to truly master the Ukrainian language.

     Op-Ed: Is Zelensky Ukraine’s George Washington?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Ukrainian Washington might emerge in a similar manner, and now perhaps he has.
AdvertisementThen, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy.
The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura.
And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

     What to know about Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The big picture: It's a role few could imagine Zelensky playing when he won the presidency in 2019, his closest qualification being playing a president on television.
Zelensky had no prior political experience before becoming president and named his political party after the television sitcom on which he played a president, "Servant of the People."
"Throughout my entire life, I’ve tried to do everything so Ukrainians smiled," Zelensky said during his inauguration speech, per Politico.
Zelensky has turned down an American offer to evacuate, saying "the fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."
The bottom line: "He has some shortcomings," a woman who would give only her first name, Ekaterina, told Politico of Zelensky.
