     Biden and Putin, Children of the Cold War, Face Off in New Conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If Mr. Biden underestimated his counterpart, Mr. Putin may have done the same.
Mr. Biden wanted Mr. Putin to basically stay in his box and Mr. Putin wanted to expand the size of his box.
Mr. Putin never talks about his family, while Mr. Biden can hardly stop talking about his.
Mr. Putin spent no time in elective politics before being plucked out of obscurity to succeed Boris N. Yeltsin, while Mr. Biden spent a lifetime running for office.
They each have a penchant for macho exhibitionism, Mr. Putin posing for pictures shirtless or with tigers and Mr. Biden showing off his muscle cars and boasting that he would like to beat up Mr. Trump.

     Representative Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, took aim at former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—suggesting they are providing Moscow with propaganda in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Pompeo in recent interviews described the Russian president as "savvy" and "talented," he also said he had "enormous respect" for Putin.
"As Russian forces invade Ukraine, Russian TV features Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and Tucker Carlson praising Putin," Cheney tweeted.

     Trump defends praise of Putin even as he calls Ukrainian president 'brave'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Former President Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday while also calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "a brave man" amid Russia's deadly invasion of his country.
"Putin is playing [President Joe] Biden like a drum and it's not a pretty thing to watch," he continued.
In addition to Putin, Trump has previously made positive comments about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
In back-to-back appearances at CPAC, rumored GOP presidential hopefuls echoed Trump's criticism of the Biden administration but stopped short of complimenting Putin like the former President has.
"I have no doubt that President Putin made his decision... only after watching the pathetic withdrawal from Afghanistan."

     Donald Trump defends calling Putin ‘smart’, hints at 2024 presidential bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Donald Trump, the former US president, has defended his description of Russia’s Vladimir Putin as “smart” while seeking to blunt accusations that he admires the invasion of Ukraine.
Having retold “the big lie”, he went on to compare himself favourably with other presidents’ handling of Putin.
Under Obama, Russia took Crimea.
“The problem is not that Putin is smart – which of course, he’s smart – but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb.
As president, Trump was notoriously reluctant to condemn Putin and, at a summit in Helsinki, took the Russian leader’s word over that of his own intelligence agencies.

     He was sure it would be a cake walk.”US Defense officials also said Saturday that Russian forces are growing increasingly frustrated by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.
Ordinary civilians have joined with Ukrainian forces, making Molotov cocktails, blocking roads and even shooting at the tires of Russian vehicles to impede their progress.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly grown frantic by his military’s failure to control Ukraine.
Russian forces have meant stiff resistance by Ukrainian soldiers in the Lugansk region.
Russian forces have occupied Chernobyl and its nuclear power plants in Ukraine.

It’s a headache having to face up to the blunt fact that Putin is trying to utterly change the world.
The Kremlin’s foreign policy thinktanks are already churning out articles about how his invasion of Ukraine means the start of a “multipolar world”.
Putin wants the whole world to witness his aggression, to grind in the point there’s nothing that can stop him.
Putin thinks we won’t go through with any changes because all our talk of “democracy” and “values” are just bunk.
