     FLORIDA -- A Florida jury acquitted retired Florida police captain Curtis Reeves in the shooting death of a man in a movie theater eight years ago, CNN reported.
"(Reeves) killed another human being in a crowded movie theater next to his wife for no reason.
His wife was shot in the hand.Reeves told authorities he was "in fear of being attacked," according to the complaint.
He and his attorneys have argued Oulson threw a cellphone at Reeves' head and was aggressively leaning over a chair toward him when the shooting occurred.
Prosecutors have said popcorn is not a weapon and added witnesses did not report seeing Oulson throwing his cellphone.

I never wanted it to happen.”In the courtroom gallery, Oulson’s widow, Nicole Oulson, wept as the verdict was read, the Times reported.
Reeves told Chad Oulson to put the phone away, but the younger man ignored him and continued to scroll on his device, the Times reported.
Reeves immediately reached into his pocket, drew a .380 caliber pistol and fired, striking Oulson in the chest, the Times reported.
Nicole Oulson had raised her hand in an attempt to get her husband to sit down, and the bullet hit her finger before striking Chad Oulson, the Times reported.

     PASCO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) — Curtis Reeves, the man who shot and killed Chad Oulson at a movie theater in Florida in 2014, was found not guilty on all charges Friday night.
After over three hours of deliberation, a six-person jury returned to the courtroom Friday evening and delivered its verdict.
The retired police captain spent several hours on the witness stand Thursday, telling a Pasco County jury about what he says happened the day he shot Oulson in the theater.
Reeves told him to stop, then went to complain to the management before coming back to find that Oulson had put away his phone, according to the outlet.
Following the verdict, Reeves commended his defense team for doing a “fantastic job in bringing out the truth.”“This is great,” Reeves said after walking out of the courthouse a free man.

     Curtis Reeves, now 79, had been charged with second-degree murder for killing Chad Oulson during an altercation at a suburban movie theater on Jan. 13, 2014.
When Reeves returned, seeing that Oulson had put his phone away, he told Oulson that if he wouldn’t have told the manager if he known he would comply.
What happened over the next few seconds is where the stories diverge until Oulson grabbed Reeves’ popcorn and flicked it back into Reeves’ face.
But the video does show Oulson grabbing Reeves’ popcorn bag, tossing it at him and Reeves firing.
He killed Oulson in anger after he had his ego hurt by being challenged and having popcorn thrown in his face, Rosenwasser said.
