     As battle for Kyiv rages, Ukraine’s president tries to rally his people.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine — As Russian troops lay siege to Kyiv, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, again appeared on camera on Saturday to furnish proof of his continued presence in his country’s capital, praise his outgunned and outmanned military and beseech Western countries for more support.
“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted around noon local time, the latest of several speeches he has released.
“The occupiers wanted to put a blockade on the seat of our state’s power and set up their puppets here,” he said.
“We messed up their plans, they did not gain any advantage over us,” he added in Ukrainian.
The occupiers are hitting residential areas using jet artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities.

     A Prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before he became the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played the part on television.
As Zelensky has stumbled through his actual career in politics, those doubts have dogged him.
But in life, as in the fictional version he created, Zelensky, slightly diminutive and gravelly-voiced, has been subjected to the most intense stress test of character.
Yesterday, Zelensky told a videoconference of European leaders that they would likely not ever see him again.
Zelensky relocated his production company to Kyiv and began to truly master the Ukrainian language.

     Opinion: President Zelensky is a profile in courage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Citing TikTok and other social media platforms, along with satellites and live traffic data on Google Maps, Friedman writes, "Welcome to World War Wired -- the first war in a totally interconnected world."
And the heroic figure at the center of this war is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian who rose to prominence playing a character on a popular TV show who accidentally becomes the Ukrainian president.
Imagine a country where a television star could become president and emerge as a beacon of courage!
He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage.
We are protecting Ukraine," Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers.

     Op-Ed: Is Zelensky Ukraine’s George Washington?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Ukrainian Washington might emerge in a similar manner, and now perhaps he has.
AdvertisementThen, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy.
The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura.
And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

     Zelensky's latest video message to Ukrainians: "We will fight as long as it takes"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Volodymyr Zelensky released a new and defiant video message Saturday night local time as curfew set in for Ukrainians in Kyiv, saying "we will fight as long as it takes to liberate the country. "
Driving the news: Zelensky also suggested western allies were now prepared cut off Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, a secure messaging service used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions throughout the world.
The move has been under consideration for a while, though some European nations have expressed concern that disconnecting Russian banks' access to the primary system for global financial transactions would cause significant collateral economic damage.
"Our diplomats fought around the clock to inspire all European countries to agree on a strong and fair decision to disconnect Russia from the international interbanking network," Zelensky said.
The official added that there are indications Russia did not anticipate this level of Ukrainian resistance and has had to commit more logistics and supplies, such as fuel, than initially planned.
