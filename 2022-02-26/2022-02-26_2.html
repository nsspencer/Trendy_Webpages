     Alolan Pokémon are coming to Pokémon Go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pokémon Go is getting its next wave of Pokémon: Alolan Pokémon.
Announced on the Pokémon 25th Anniversary stream, the introduction of Alolan Pokémon will kick off starting on March 1.
You’ll likely be able to find Pokémon Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio, but no official events have been announced yet.
Notably, there are still a ton of Pokémon from older regions that have not been added to Pokémon Go, including Kecleon from the Hoenn region, and Mythical Pokémon like Shaymin and Manaphy from the Sinnoh region.
Alolan forms of existing Pokémon, like Alolan Rattata and Alolan Meowth, were added to Pokémon Go a while ago, though we haven’t gotten many other seventh-gen Pokémon in the game until now.

     A new main series Pokémon game is coming in late 2022 – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Step aside, whatever “Pokémon Café Remix” is — the ninth generation of Pokémon is coming.
This morning, a Pokémon Presents broadcast announced “Pokémon Scarlet and Violet,” the latest installment in the main series Pokémon games after “Pokémon Sword and Shield” came out in late 2019.
The Nintendo Switch games are expected to be released in late 2022.
(Update: apparently these new friends are: Sprigatito, a “capricious, attention-seeking Grass Cat Pokémon;” Fuecoco, a “laid-back Fire Croc Pokémon that does things at its own pace;” and Quaxly, an “earnest and tidy Duckling Pokémon.” Don’t ask me how any of these are pronounced.)

     Nintendo announces new Pokémon games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So, only weeks after releasing spin-off prequel Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a few months after releasing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (two remakes of DS-era games), and just a couple of years after releasing Pokémon Sword and Shield, Nintendo has announced another brand new Pokémon game.
Or, rather, two brand new Pokémon games, because that’s how this series works.
AdvertisementTitled Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, the two games were announced as part of developer The Pokémon Company’s “Pokémon Presents” stream today with a trailer that (for some reason) opens with a live-action security guard of some sort investigating a mysterious room before cutting to, you know, regular Pokémon stuff.
It doesn’t look dramatically different from Sword and Shield, save for a vaguely Mediterranean aesthetic in the game’s world, but it will take more than a three-minute trailer for Nintendo to explain how these Pokémon games are different from the last few Pokémon games.
Make more Pokémon games, Nintendo.

Alolan forms of existing Pokémon have been available in Pokémon Go for some time, though this season should see many more become available.

     There are even more Pokémon games on the way.
At a livestreamed event on Sunday morning, The Pokémon Company teased two new titles: Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
As one of the main characters, trainers will jump into the world of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to begin their adventure, where they will have a different outfit depending on which game they are playing.
Trainers will then choose either Sprigatito, the grass cat pokémon, Fuecoco, the fire croc pokémon, or Quaxly, the duckling pokémon to be their first partner pokémon before setting off on their journey.
And the competitive battle game Pokémon Unite will also be getting some notable new features, including new, more intense fights called “fury battles” that launch today.

     Rarest Pokémon in Pokémon Go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following last year’s teaser of Pokémon from the Alola region coming to Pokémon Go, today’s Pokémon Presents presentation confirmed that these Pokémon will soon be landing in our world.
There will soon be over 800 different species of Pokémon roaming the world of Pokémon Go, and because of how the mobile game is structured, players may never be able to get their hands on the Pokémon they want.
From event-exclusive Pokémon to those that can only be encountered in specific parts of the world, Pokémon Go seeks to make certain Pokémon much more rare than others, oftentimes unobtainable for the casual player base.
Here are a few of the rarest Pokémon that have been released in Pokémon Go, some of which may never return to the game.
Armored Mewtwo and the Pokémon ClonesTo celebrate the release of the movie Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution in 2019, Pokémon Go included some of the strange variants of Pokémon that appeared only within the movie.
