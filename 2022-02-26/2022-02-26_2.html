     KYIV, Ukraine — As Russian troops lay siege to Kyiv, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, again appeared on camera on Saturday to furnish proof of his continued presence in his country’s capital, praise his outgunned and outmanned military and beseech Western countries for more support.
“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted around noon local time, the latest of several speeches he has released.
“The occupiers wanted to put a blockade on the seat of our state’s power and set up their puppets here,” he said.
“We messed up their plans, they did not gain any advantage over us,” he added in Ukrainian.
The occupiers are hitting residential areas using jet artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities.

     (CNN) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has turned down an offer from the United States of evacuation from the capital city Kyiv, the Ukraine embassy in Britain said Saturday on Twitter.
"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride," Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy.
"Ukrainians are proud of their President," the tweet adds.
In a video posted on Saturday morning entitled "do not believe the fakes," Zelensky revealed that he is still in Kyiv.
We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this," he said.

     A Prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before he became the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played the part on television.
As Zelensky has stumbled through his actual career in politics, those doubts have dogged him.
But in life, as in the fictional version he created, Zelensky, slightly diminutive and gravelly-voiced, has been subjected to the most intense stress test of character.
Yesterday, Zelensky told a videoconference of European leaders that they would likely not ever see him again.
Zelensky relocated his production company to Kyiv and began to truly master the Ukrainian language.

AdvertisementThen, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy.
The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura.
And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

     CNN —Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal and wholly unjustified invasion of Ukraine has transfixed the world in horror.
And the heroic figure at the center of this war is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian who rose to prominence playing a character on a popular TV show who accidentally becomes the Ukrainian president.
He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage.
We are protecting Ukraine,” Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers.
But we certainly know that Zelensky has proved himself a hero of his time and a worthy spokesman for liberal democracy and Ukrainian freedom.

     The big picture: It's a role few could imagine Zelensky playing when he won the presidency in 2019, his closest qualification being playing a president on television.
Zelensky had no prior political experience before becoming president and named his political party after the television sitcom on which he played a president, "Servant of the People."
"Throughout my entire life, I’ve tried to do everything so Ukrainians smiled," Zelensky said during his inauguration speech, per Politico.
Zelensky has turned down an American offer to evacuate, saying "the fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."
The bottom line: "He has some shortcomings," a woman who would give only her first name, Ekaterina, told Politico of Zelensky.

Would the Jewish calendar have reached the year 5782 had Jews not been able to say, at critical moments, “Listen, we are here”?

     President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the positions of Ukrainian servicemen on the front line of defence, where intense shelling continues.
But that appeal will also stand as an emphatic rhetorical contrast with the Russian president — a human, dignified counterpoint to the snarling, rambling rants emanating from the Kremlin.
We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies.”Related“We will defend ourselves,” the Ukrainian president said in that address, hours before the invasion began.
The Russian president has made it repeatedly clear in his garbled discourses that he considers Ukrainian nationhood an empty and malign artifice.
Zelensky has at once crafted a narrative and channelled one emerging organically from his people: one of defiance, resilience and survival.
