     ‘Saturday Night Live’ Pays Tribute to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This weekend, “Saturday Night Live” faced two questions of significantly different orders of magnitude: Would the show try to find topical humor in the Russian invasion of Ukraine?
And, of far less importance to the global order, but still a noteworthy matter within the “S.N.L.” realm: How would it address the return of John Mulaney?
To answer the first question, the show avoided an opening comedy sketch altogether and instead began with a performance by Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York, which sang the hymn “Prayer for Ukraine.” At the conclusion of the performance, cast members Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong took the stage behind an arrangement of candles which were shown to spell Kyiv.

     John Mulaney talks fatherhood, sobriety in ‘SNL’ monologue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     John Mulaney touched on sobriety and his son with Olivia Munn, Malcolm, in his “Saturday Night” monologue this weekend, joking he knew the exact moment he knew that the baby was his Mini-Me.
[He’s] under this big bright light, and light is just shining in his eyes,” the comedian, 39, said.
I was like, ‘That’s my son.’ A polite man in an uncomfortable situation, but he’s not going to make a fuss.
Instagram“It is wonderful to be in a place that’s always emphasized sobriety and mental health,” he quipped.
“I got into this relationship that’s been really beautiful with someone incredible,” he said at the time.

     A Vulnerable SNL for a Vulnerable Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The former SNL writer’s grandiose musical numbers and irreverent adoration of pop culture make him a guaranteed bright spot whenever he appears.
Rather than try to tease a punch line from the tragedy of war, the episode opened by making space for something more poignant.
It was also a refreshing approach for SNL: a tonal shift that acknowledged the vulnerability required to address the current moment.
Still, SNL made room for Mulaney to do what he does best.
Meanwhile, SNL kept “Weekend Update” noticeably short—with merely a few surface-level swipes at the conflict in Ukraine—and didn’t invite out any colorful characters.

     'SNL': John Mulaney Sits Through an Uncomfortable COVID Dinner Sketch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Naturally, as is custom, the host took part in many of last night’s humorous sketches.
One of these was the ‘COVID Dinner Discussion’ skit which perfectly encapsulates what it’s like to have conversations about the pandemic nowadays.
The sketch features Mulaney, Kenan Thompson, Kate McKinnon, Bowen Yang, Aidy Bryant, and Heidi Gardner and a trio of couples who are having a friendly dinner.
Mulaney tries to help her get her message across, but he encounters the same resistance.
Check out the COVID dinner sketch below:Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Among Winners at 53rd NAACP Image Awards Winners were announced at the star-studded live ceremony.

     John Mulaney Laughed About His “Complicated Year” on Saturday Night Live

     Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
“After a very complicated year, it is wonderful to be in a place that’s always emphasized sobriety and mental health,” Mulaney cracked.
Mulaney had the show in the smooth palm of his hand throughout the night.
And he got his Five-Timer velvet jacket, taken from Paul Rudd—he who had already lost so much when his Five-timer episode was torpedoed when cases surged before Christmas.
Also on hand to celebrate Mulaney joining the club were Steve Martin, Candice Bergen, Tina Fey, Elliot Gould, and Conan O’Brien.
