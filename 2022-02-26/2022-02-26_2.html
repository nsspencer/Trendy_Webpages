     A Prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before he became the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played the part on television.
As Zelensky has stumbled through his actual career in politics, those doubts have dogged him.
But in life, as in the fictional version he created, Zelensky, slightly diminutive and gravelly-voiced, has been subjected to the most intense stress test of character.
Yesterday, Zelensky told a videoconference of European leaders that they would likely not ever see him again.
Zelensky relocated his production company to Kyiv and began to truly master the Ukrainian language.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Citing TikTok and other social media platforms, along with satellites and live traffic data on Google Maps, Friedman writes, "Welcome to World War Wired -- the first war in a totally interconnected world."
And the heroic figure at the center of this war is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian who rose to prominence playing a character on a popular TV show who accidentally becomes the Ukrainian president.
Imagine a country where a television star could become president and emerge as a beacon of courage!
He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage.
We are protecting Ukraine," Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers.

     A Ukrainian Washington might emerge in a similar manner, and now perhaps he has.
AdvertisementThen, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy.
The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura.
And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

     Now, he is at the center of the continent’s most significant conflict since World War II, framing himself as a possible martyr on the world stage.
We are defending Ukraine,” Zelensky said.
Furthermore, questions about his Jewishness have exploded into the international consciousness: Has his Jewish background put him — or his fellow Ukrainian Jews — in more danger?
That prompted some to speculate whether that could include Ukrainian Jews.
Lila Corwin Berman, a professor of Jewish history at Temple University in Philadelphia, said questions of loyalty can assail Jewish leaders in times of crisis.

     Ukraine’s President Zelensky: In the streets of a war-rattled city, a hero is born
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Ukraine, there’s precedent for Shuklin’s screen-to-reality sense of confidence: President Volodymyr Zelensky was an actor and comedian, whose only political experience before getting elected was playing the role of Ukraine’s president in a satirical TV series.
Ukrainians felt he was weak in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and too quick to seek compromise with Moscow.
As a wartime president, however, Zelensky has risen remarkably to the challenge.
AdvertisementBefore the war, Valiiev wasn’t the president’s biggest fan, worrying about corruption and who he perceived as some pro-Russian appointees.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 26 that his country should join the European Union.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the positions of Ukrainian servicemen on the front line of defence, where intense shelling continues.
But that appeal will also stand as an emphatic rhetorical contrast with the Russian president — a human, dignified counterpoint to the snarling, rambling rants emanating from the Kremlin.
We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies.”Related“We will defend ourselves,” the Ukrainian president said in that address, hours before the invasion began.
The Russian president has made it repeatedly clear in his garbled discourses that he considers Ukrainian nationhood an empty and malign artifice.
Zelensky has at once crafted a narrative and channelled one emerging organically from his people: one of defiance, resilience and survival.
