     FLORIDA -- A Florida jury acquitted retired Florida police captain Curtis Reeves in the shooting death of a man in a movie theater eight years ago, CNN reported.
"(Reeves) killed another human being in a crowded movie theater next to his wife for no reason.
His wife was shot in the hand.Reeves told authorities he was "in fear of being attacked," according to the complaint.
He and his attorneys have argued Oulson threw a cellphone at Reeves' head and was aggressively leaning over a chair toward him when the shooting occurred.
Prosecutors have said popcorn is not a weapon and added witnesses did not report seeing Oulson throwing his cellphone.
