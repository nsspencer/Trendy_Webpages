     But that perch doesn’t bother goalkeeper Sean Johnson one bit, with his shootout heroics earning him MLS Cup MVP presented by Audi honors last December upon beating the Portland Timbers for the league title.
“This is territory that we haven't been in before, but last year we won the championship being in unfamiliar territory,” Johnson, club captain, said.
“So I think those experiences we can lean on.
But just maintaining what's valuable to us as a group and then moving forward with confidence, attacking every situation with humility, I think is going to get us where we need to be.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Timbers and New England Revolution went toe-to-toe in a 2-2 draw at Providence Park, closing Saturday night of the 2022 campaign’s opening weekend in thrilling fashion.
The visitors and reigning Supporters’ Shield winners twice went ahead, starting in the 41st minute when right back Brandon Bye powerfully headed home a corner kick from Carles Gil, the reigning Landon Donovan MLS MVP.
Come the 63rd minute, midfielder Sebastian Lletget scored on his debut for New England, cushioning home a left-footed finish to the far post.
But Portland, MLS Cup 2021 hosts back on their rain-soaked turf, responded in kind in the 60th minute when forward Dairon Asprilla calmly finished Santiago Moreno’s line-breaking feed.
Then the spectacular arrived in the 78th minute through attacker Yimmi Chara, whose bicycle kick evaded goalkeeper Earl Edwards Jr.
