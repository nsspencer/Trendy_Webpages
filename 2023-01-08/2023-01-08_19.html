    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Corporal Elvis Presley is seen in this Jan. 21, 1960, file photo taken in Bad Nauheim while serving for the U.S. Army in Germany.
By the time I understood that Elvis Presley was a real person, somewhere out there in the world, my parents had long ceased to be fans.
That album is believed to be the first greatest-hits album in rock 'n' roll history, and for the rest of Elvis' life I believed it was the only Elvis album anyone ever needed.
It is not too much to say that Elvis Presley and Sam Phillips, in a little studio in Memphis, started a fire that consumed the world.
Elvis Presley’s “Elvis” album RIGHT TIME, RIGHT PLACEHe came along at the right time in the right place, and it helped that he was pretty.

     Remember When: Elvis Was Censored From the Waist Down on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elvis could appear on television, but it was demanded he be shot from the waist up only.
In 1957, Elvis made his final of three agreed-upon appearances for The Ed Sullivan Show.
While Elvis’ first two appearances, each scheduled a month or so apart, showed the rocker head-to-toe, his final performance was broadcasted without a pelvis in sight.
Despite the controversy surrounding Elvis, the host complimented the singer at the close of his final performance.
So now let’s have a tremendous hand for a very nice person!”Check out a glimpse of Elvis’ final performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on Jan. 6, 1957, two days before his 22nd birthday.
