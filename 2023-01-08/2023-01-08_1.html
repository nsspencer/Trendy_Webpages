     Summary: Buffalo, New York CNN â€”A flood of memories came rushing in as I flew to Buffalo a week ago to cover the story of Damar Hamlin â€“ the Buffalo Bills safety who suffered cardiac arrest during a game Monday night.
Being a member of the Buffalo Bills is one of the greatest honors of my life.
Buffalo has endured tragedy after tragedy recently â€“ a deadly mass shooting seven months ago, a snowstorm about two weeks ago took the lives of dozens.
But if any city was going to come out stronger on the other side of adversity like this, it was Buffalo.
Through this tragedy, the world came together to show support for Hamlin.
