     Dallas Cowboys Week 18 Player Props: Zeke to Find Paydirt Yet Again?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Thursday’s 27-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans, the Dallas Cowboys enter the final week of the regular season still with an opportunity to capture the NFC East title as well as the NFC’s No.
Assuming Dallas gets past the Washington Commanders, the Boys need the Philadelphia Eagles to fall to the New York Giants to claim the division crown.
As for the Cowboys’ path to the conference’s top seed, Dallas again needs a victory, an Eagles loss, and the 49ers to lose to the Arizona Cardinals, the latter scenario seeming particularly unlikely.
With Dallas’ playoff scenarios taken care of, I’ve highlighted my top Cowboys player props for Sunday’s finale down below.
Overall, I’m banking on a big game from the Cowboys offense and like Zeke’s touchdown streak to continue.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 18 may be a pointless contest for some teams but to the Dallas Cowboys, it’s important for multiple reasons.
The second reason Week 18 is so important is there is still an important roster issue that needs resolution.
Kelvin Joseph, the Cowboys second round pick in 2021, was the natural choice to replace Brown.
Both have seen action outside as of late and both should see plenty of snaps against Washington in Week 18.
But it seems they won’t hesitate to move Bland outside to insure the best possible coverage.

     Dallas Cowboys Playoff Scenarios Week 18: Win and Hope for Help
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite clinching a postseason birth a few weeks back, the Dallas Cowboys have intriguing playoff scenarios for Week 18.
Let’s take a look through the Cowboys’ scenarios this week and what help they need in Week 18 if they are to improve their seeding from their current spot in the NFL standings.
Cowboys Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18When it comes to the final week of the 2022 NFL schedule, there is a lot still at stake for the Cowboys, but they have very little control over it outside of needing to win and hoping they get some help.
Right now, Dallas is the fifth seed in the NFC playoff picture, and if they fail to win this week, that is where they will remain.
However, with a win, the Cowboys have a chance to host a playoff game.
