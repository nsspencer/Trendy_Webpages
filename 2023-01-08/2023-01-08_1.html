The Dallas Cowboys will start their 2022 playoffs in Tampa.
The Cowboys finished the season with a 12-5 record after a loss to the Washington Commanders in Week 18.
The fourth seed hosts the fifth seed, the third seed hosts the sixth seed and the second seed hosts the seventh seed.
The game in Tampa will be a rematch from Week One, when the Buccaneers beat the Cowboys, 19-3, at AT&amp;T Stadium in a nationally-televised Sunday Night Football matchup.

     Summary: The Cowboys will enter the tournament as owners of the No.
5 seed in the NFC, set to face off against the winners of the NFC South: Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
To steal away the top seat in the division, the Cowboys needed a victory against the Commanders and a loss by the Eagles.
It'll be an opportunity for Dallas to perform an exorcism against Brady, seeing as he's 7-0 against the Cowboys.
Brady has long had Dallas under his thumb, giving Dak Prescott and the Cowboys defense more than enough motivation to finally end his reign over them.

     Jerry Jones: Cowboys must find motivation in 'nightmare' finale loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jerry Jones discusses the Cowboys' disappointing loss to the Commanders and how it can motivate the team for the playoffs.
-- The Dallas Cowboys entered Sunday with hopes of a second straight division title and the chance to move up to one of the top two seeds in the NFC if things went their way.
"We get to suck on that all week," owner and general manager Jerry Jones said.
The Cowboys' previous worst loss of the season was a 19-3 defeat in Week 1 against the Buccaneers.
The second-worst showings came in the loss to the Buccaneers to start the season (244 yards, 3-of-15 on third down).

     Dallas Cowboys Week 18 Player Props: Zeke to Find Paydirt Yet Again?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Thursday’s 27-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans, the Dallas Cowboys enter the final week of the regular season still with an opportunity to capture the NFC East title as well as the NFC’s No.
Assuming Dallas gets past the Washington Commanders, the Boys need the Philadelphia Eagles to fall to the New York Giants to claim the division crown.
As for the Cowboys’ path to the conference’s top seed, Dallas again needs a victory, an Eagles loss, and the 49ers to lose to the Arizona Cardinals, the latter scenario seeming particularly unlikely.
With Dallas’ playoff scenarios taken care of, I’ve highlighted my top Cowboys player props for Sunday’s finale down below.
Overall, I’m banking on a big game from the Cowboys offense and like Zeke’s touchdown streak to continue.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We played poorly," before stating the obvious, "You want to play your best ball in January."
But look here: Sunday against the Commanders, the Cowboys only had one guy – one guy – playing where he had played all season long.
Start with losing one of their best, if not the best run-blocking lineman, Terence Steele, against Houston five games ago.
Then, while they survived the Tennessee game a week ago Thursday when Biadasz went down, that began the line dance.
On top of all that, the Cowboys longest play of the game was 15 yards, CeeDee Lamb's first half-ending touchdown grab.

     Eatman: Regular Season Ends Worse Than It Began
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: – The term "full circle" is typically used in a good way – when something ends in the same place as it started.
In this case, the fact that both the Cowboys and Dak Prescott have seen their regular season come full circle is certainly not a good thing.
I can assure you they were there, but I can also assure you they won't be opened because the Cowboys didn't do anything on Sunday to make that happen.
But what makes this one so strange is that this regular season ends exactly like it started … awful.
Are you one who points out that the Cowboys started the regular season in an awful way against the Buccaneers and now get to start the postseason the same way?
