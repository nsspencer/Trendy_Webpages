     Steelers take 10-7 lead over Browns at halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Steelers didn’t get off to a hot start in their regular-season finale against the Browns.
But the club turned it on toward the end of the first half to take a 10-7 lead at halftime.
After the Browns took a 7-0 lead with David Njoku‘s 10-yard touchdown, the Steelers went down the field for a nine-play, 69-yard touchdown drive.
Cleveland had a chance to hold Pittsburgh to a field goal with a third-and-15 play, but then the defense left George Pickens wide open down the right side.
The Steelers turned that into a 49-yard field goal by Chris Boswell to go up 10-7.

     Steelers Miss Playoffs Because of Controversial Penalty in Dolphins-Jets Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers fell on the wrong end of a controversial call in the Jets-Dolphins game.
PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers were leading by two scores with under four minutes left to play against the Cleveland Browns.
While the Browns were conducting their final, inconsequential drive, the Dolphins were mounting what would ultimately become the game-winning drive that knocked the Steelers out of the playoffs.
Replays showed Williams did not reach into Waddle's pads - his hands slid off the back of Waddle's pads instead but officials stuck by the call and Miami went on to win 9-6.

     4 Downs: Browns end painful season on a low-note vs. Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Deshaun Watson continued to find success through the air after he caught fire in the second half against the Washington Commanders.
However, his two killer turnovers were unacceptable and gave the Steelers 10 cheap points on the afternoon.
He tried to force a football in a two-minute drill after the Steelers had just scored.
Then in the second half on a third and 18, Watson threw a pick in his own territory that completely flipped field position.
The Browns would have punted and at least pushed the Steelers back, and instead, the Steelers scored on a short field.
