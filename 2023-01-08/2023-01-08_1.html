    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Steelers didn’t get off to a hot start in their regular-season finale against the Browns.
But the club turned it on toward the end of the first half to take a 10-7 lead at halftime.
After the Browns took a 7-0 lead with David Njoku‘s 10-yard touchdown, the Steelers went down the field for a nine-play, 69-yard touchdown drive.
Cleveland had a chance to hold Pittsburgh to a field goal with a third-and-15 play, but then the defense left George Pickens wide open down the right side.
The Steelers turned that into a 49-yard field goal by Chris Boswell to go up 10-7.
