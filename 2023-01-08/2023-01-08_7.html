    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the final Sunday of the NFL Regular Season, one team will look to give themselves a chance at clinching a playoff spot, as the Seattle Seahawks prepare to host the Los Angeles Rams.
They got back on the proverbial horse last Sunday with a dominating win over the New York Jets at home.
A win does not necessarily send the Seahawks to the playoffs.
All-time, the Seahawks are 26-24 against the Rams, including sneaking out of Hollywood with a 27-23 win in Week 13.

     Summary: ‘You can’t suppress it.’ Rams’ Matt Skura shares painful story of his dad’s death by suicideDoug Skura, left, embraces his son, Matt, after a Duke football game.
Matt Skura is now an offensive lineman for the Rams and is mourning the loss of his father, who died by suicide last year.
(Courtesy of the Skura family)The weight has been unimaginable, a burden far bigger than a rushing defensive lineman, attacking with far more ferocity, and sometimes Matt Skura fights simply to stay on his feet.
While helping carry the Rams through this difficult season, the massive offensive lineman has struggled with the far more challenging task of carrying himself.
“I wrote something like, ‘Hey Dad, I’m coming to Columbus, nothing going on, I just want to see you,’ ” Skura says.

     Seattle Seahawks Playoff Chances and Scenarios Week 18: Still a Chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks can punch their ticket to the playoffs in Week 18 against the Los Angeles Rams if they win and another game goes their way.
Seahawks Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18For the Seahawks to secure the seventh seed and a spot in the playoffs, these are the possible scenarios in Week 18.
If both the Seahawks and Packers win, they’ll have the same record.
The Lions, Commanders, and Seahawks would then break their tie on conference record, and the Lions would advance.
If the Commanders lose in a scenario where the Rams and Seahawks tie while the Packers and Lions tie, then it’s no longer a four-way tie.
