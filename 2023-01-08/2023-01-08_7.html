     Ravens start rookie QB Anthony Brown, rest four starters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI -- The Ravens will have a different look on offense in Sunday's regular-season finale against the Bengals.
The Ravens will start undrafted rookie Anthony Brown at quarterback and rest four starters: running back J.K. Dobbins, tight end Mark Andrews, guard Kevin Zeitler and cornerback Marcus Peters.
Brown becomes the third undrafted rookie to start for the Ravens, joining Huntley and Anthony Wright.
In four games without Jackson, the Ravens have averaged 12.3 points per game (second worst in the league), totaling an NFL-low three touchdowns.
Without Dobbins, Baltimore will rely more on Gus Edwards, who carried the ball three times for 2 yards last week.

     Summary: The cards are stacked against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, and their revolving door at quarterback is contributing to their woes.
Tyler Huntley has been the starter since then, but his status against the Cincinnati Bengals is up in the air after suffering wrist and shoulder injuries.
Instead, an announcement on who is starting under center isn’t expected until the Bengals take to the field for pregame warmups against the Bengals.
Ravens are not expected to an announce their starting QB Sunday vs. the Bengals until pregame warmups.
The price tumbled leading up to Sunday, but the Ravens are holding steady as +10 underdogs, per the line info from FanDuel Sportsbook.

After the game, head coach John Harbaugh answered in typical Harbaugh-fashion that he was indifferent to a Ravens-Bengals rematch in the playoffs and that “it doesn’t matter what my feelings are….

Harbaugh may not harbor any feelings about this rematch, but if Sunday’s game was any indication, Ravens and Bengals players alike will enter the Wild Card round with emotions running high and a burning desire to eliminate a divisional rival.

     Best reactions after Bengals beat Ravens, prep to host playoff game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals earned massive reactions during their Week 18 win over the Baltimore Ravens.
First and foremost, because Joe Mixon and the offense busted out a coin-flip touchdown celebration to mock the NFL.
But also because with a win, the Bengals avoided the coin-flip stipulation the league made up on the fly and solidified the home-field advantage aspect of being AFC North champions for the second season in a row.
A 27-16 win over a divisional rival and forcing a season split of the series with the Ravens doesn’t hurt either.
Here’s a look at the most notable reactions after the game ended before the team preps for the playoffs.

Fortunately for the Bengals, this rule never needed to be implemented after Cincinnati beat the Ravens, 27-16, to secure a home playoff match against the Ravens during the wild-card round.
Bengals weren't happy with the rule change earlier this weekThe celebration wasn't subtle, similar to the Bengals' responses to the coin flip rule when it was announced.
“So, we have the opportunity to play for a coin flip that can only negatively impact us.

     Ravens vs. Bengals - NFL Game Recap - January 8, 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI -- — The Cincinnati Bengals built a big lead and came out flat in the second half, but held off the division rival Baltimore Ravens to close the season on an eight-game winning streak.
Joe Burrow threw for a touchdown and Joe Mixon ran for another as the Bengals took advantage of four Ravens turnovers to win 27-16 on Sunday.
NFL owners approved the coin-flip scenario because the cancellation deprived the Ravens of an opportunity to win the division.
But rather than go all-out for the slim chance of getting a home playoff game, Ravens coach John Harbaugh ensured the Bengals will see a somewhat different team when sixth-seeded Baltimore returns to Paycor Stadium next weekend.
Cornerback Mike Hilton picked off Brown on Baltimore's next possession, giving the ball to the Bengals at the Ravens 30.
