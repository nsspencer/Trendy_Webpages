Mark Andrews joins J.K. Dobbins and Tyler Huntley on the sidelines, giving way to Anthony Brown, Gus Edwards, and Isaiah Likely.
Ravens TE Mark Andrews is inactive.
Instead, Baltimore is using Week 18 as a pseudo-bye week to get healthy before a playoff push.

     Joe Burrow on Bengals' Super Bowl window: 'The window's my whole career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For as much confidence as Burrow exudes year in and year out, the 26-year-old will give a sensible assessment of his performance on a weekly basis.
"If we didn't win this one, I guess technically we would've won the division, but it wouldn't have felt like it," said Burrow, whose 35 TDs on the season set a new franchise record.
Sunday's victory brought the Bengals to the 12-win mark for just the fourth time in the franchise's history.
On two of those occasions in 1981 and 1988, Cincinnati reached the Super Bowl.
Of course, the Bengals have yet to win a Super Bowl in three total tries.

     Summary: Joe Mixon pushes his way into the end zone and celebrates with a coin flip.
(0:17)CINCINNATI -- In case it wasn't clear enough, Bengals running back Joe Mixon reminded everyone how those in Cincinnati feel about coin flips.
The celebration highlighted the emotions after the NFL approved a resolution Friday that called for a coin flip to decide the site of a potential Cincinnati-Baltimore game under certain conditions.
We don't have the opportunity to play for a coin flip that will positively impact us."
He also lost a fumble in the end zone for a Bengals touchdown after defensive end Trey Hendrickson sacked Brown and knocked the ball loose.

     Ravens vs. Bengals - NFL Game Recap - January 8, 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI -- — The Cincinnati Bengals built a big lead and came out flat in the second half, but held off the division rival Baltimore Ravens to close the season on an eight-game winning streak.
Joe Burrow threw for a touchdown and Joe Mixon ran for another as the Bengals took advantage of four Ravens turnovers to win 27-16 on Sunday.
NFL owners approved the coin-flip scenario because the cancellation deprived the Ravens of an opportunity to win the division.
But rather than go all-out for the slim chance of getting a home playoff game, Ravens coach John Harbaugh ensured the Bengals will see a somewhat different team when sixth-seeded Baltimore returns to Paycor Stadium next weekend.
Cornerback Mike Hilton picked off Brown on Baltimore's next possession, giving the ball to the Bengals at the Ravens 30.
