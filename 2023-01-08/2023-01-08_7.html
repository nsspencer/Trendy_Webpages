    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Patriots losing to the Bills, the result means that the Dolphins will be heading to Buffalo for a date with the Bills next weekend.
Their chances of moving on will look better if Waddle is healthy, but big questions at quarterback remain for Miami.
The Dolphins defense held the Jets to 187 yards, but there wasn’t anything close to a threat on the field beyond rookie wideout Garrett Wilson.
The loss was the Jets’ seventh in the final eight games and their sixth in a row.
They did not score a touchdown in the final three games and finding some way to generate offense will be a priority this offseason.

     Summary: Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson (17) makes a catch against the Dolphins on Jan. 8, 2023.
APJets quarterback Joe Flacco (19) throws a pass against the Dolphins on Jan. 8, 2023.
USA TODAY SportsThe Dolphins’ Raekwon Davis reacts during a game against the Jets on Jan. 8, 2023.
For the Jets, the attention will now turn to what they do at the quarterback position after an ugly sophomore season for Wilson, the No.
Asked after the game if offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur would return for the 2023 season, Jets head coach Robert Saleh said he has to go through his process now that the season has ended.

     A snoozer in Miami as NY Jets-Dolphins tied at 3 at halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though he’s avoided any official sacks, Flacco has been knocked down on six occasions, with Jaelan Phillips alone responsible for three.
There are few reasons from a Jets fans perspective beyond masochistic affairs, but watching these young hopefuls for the last time until August might be sufficient enough.
Mann of the HourAs the Jets prepare to ponder their special teams future, the oft-maligned Braden Mann might’ve been the Jets’ MVP in this first half.
Two punts have averaged over 50 yards and both landed inside the 20.
That’s the perfect defense for a seventh-round rookie quarterback in way over his head, as well as a downtrodden offense desperate for any kind of traction.

     Summary: Veterans Jimmy Garoppolo (San Francisco 49ers free agent) and Derek Carr (Las Vegas Raiders) are the most logical candidates.
Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens free agent) would be a name to watch if he somehow becomes available.
He's not a free agent -- he's under signed through 2023 (fifth-year option) -- but he will be the big story because he will command the largest contract in franchise history.
The highest-paid defensive tackle, based on average annual value, is the Los Angeles Rams' Aaron Donald at $31.7 million.
Quincy, 27, might be their most coveted free agent.

     Summary: The New York Jets go into the offseason on as quiet of a whimper as you can imagine.
The Jets didn’t even reach 200 yards of total offense, finishing with 187.
The Jets provided the only sack of the game as Quincy Williams got to Skylar Thompson just before halftime.
A lackluster effort with a chance to play spoiler and get some positive vibes going into the offseason only magnifies how important this offseason now is for the Jets and sums up the 2022 New York Jets in a nutshell.
Sunday’s lackluster loss signals the beginning of a long offseason for the Jets.

     Summary: Jason Sanders nails a 50-yard field goal to help the Dolphins earn a playoff spot with an 11-6 victory over the Jets.
The Jets (7-10) ended the season with six straight losses, finishing a disappointing collapse for Robert Saleh's squad.
In their most important game of the season, the Dolphins’ offense was limited with veteran left tackle Terron Armstead inactive and rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback.
Hill was limited by an ankle injury sustained in the first half, but he only briefly left the game.
Jets: Enter the offseason with a big question mark at quarterback after Zach Wilson’s rough second NFL season.

     Summary: A South Beach slog concluded the New York Jets’ 2022-23 season, as the Miami Dolphins took home an 11-6 decision at Hard Rock Stadium in Week 18 action.
Highlights were at a premium throughout the game, with all points earned through Jason Sanders and Greg Zuerlein field goals.
It was Sanders’ 50-yard field goal with 18 seconds to go that helped punch the Dolphins’ ticket and more or less end the Jets’ season.
Garrett Wilson was a rare silver lining for the Jets, capping his season off with a game-best 89 yards on nine receptions.

That’s the second week in a row he has missed a long one to set up the opposing team with good field position.
Zuerlein’s 32-yard field goal was good to tie the score.
