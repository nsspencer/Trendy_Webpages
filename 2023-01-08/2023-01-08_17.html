     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Cardinals are not wasting any time in their search for a new General Manager.
Owner Michael Bidwill announced Monday that the team already has interviewed internal candidates Adrian Wilson and Quentin Harris.
Wilson is vice president, pro personnel and just concluded his eighth season with the team, while Harris is vice president, player personnel and just concluded his 15th season with the Cardinals.
“There’s an incredible sense of urgency,” Bidwill said, via video from Johnny Venerable of PHNX Cardinals.
The team is looking to replace Steve Keim, who has left the organization after initially taking a medical leave of absence Dec. 14.

     Arizona Cardinals fire Kliff Kingsbury

     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals have parted ways with Kliff Kingsbury, per Adam Schefter.
Sources: The Arizona Cardinals fired head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who 10 months ago signed a contract extension through the 2027 season.
The Cardinals still never have had a head coach - any head coach - last longer than six years while the team has existed for over 100 years.
pic.twitter.com/kYWb1AfjIG — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 9, 2023Kliff is the third-winningest coach in Arizona Cardinals history (since the move to Arizona), behind Bruce Arians (49 wins) and Ken Whisenhunt (45) with 28 wins.
Kingsbury is also one of only seven coaches in Arizona Cardinals’ franchise history to make the playoffs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The experiment of Kliff Kingsbury has run its course in Arizona, with the Cardinals firing the head coach following his fourth season in the role.
When it comes down to head coach, there are some intriguing names out there on both sides of the football to consider if you’re owner Michael Bidwill.
An offensive-minded head coach with a knack for getting the best out of his quarterback?
After an 8-8 finish in 2014, the head coach opted to head back to college to coach at Michigan.
That hasn’t stopped the Broncos from reportedly kicking the tires on the head coach, though, who are planning to interview Harbaugh.

     Summary: "We have announced that head coach Kliff Kingsbury has been relieved of his duties," the team said in a statement.
"In addition, general manager Steve Keim has decided to step away from his position in order to focus on his health.
Kingsbury signed an extension through 2027 in March, but that didn't stop owner Michael Bidwill from making a change.
"I've been around this organization my entire life, and I don't know any coach that has worked harder than Kliff Kingsbury," Bidwill said during a news conference on Monday.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

     Summary: The Cardinals have reportedly already asked for permission of four GM candidates: Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham, 49ers assistant GM Adam Peters, 49ers director of pro personnel Ran Carthon, and Titans director of player personnel Monti Ossenfort.
On the flip side, the Titans have reportedly asked permission to talk to Harris about their vacant GM post.
Asked about his financial wherewithal to hire a high-profile coach, Bidwill said he wanted the "best coach and the best GM."
"I don't know if the biggest name correlates to the best coach," he said.
He doesn't see the need to say one or the other necessarily has to have personnel control, because he'd prefer a "real partnership" between the GM and coach.

     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals will be starting from scratch this offseason in the front office and on the sideline.
Here’s a look at how the Cardinals got here and some of the biggest questions they face:Why did the Cardinals fire Kingsbury?
With GM Steve Keim "stepping away" and coach Kliff Kingsbury fired, the Cardinals could look vastly different in the 2023 season.
They started four quarterbacks, and had their five starting offensive linemen together for just three games this season.
They'll have the tall task of making decisions on Arizona's pending free agents, including four of the five starting offensive linemen.
