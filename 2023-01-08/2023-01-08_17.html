     Kevin Durant injury update: Nets star leaves game vs. Heat with right knee issue; MRI set for Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the midst of the Brooklyn Nets' 102-101 win against the Miami Heat Sunday night, the team lost superstar Kevin Durant, who left the game in the third quarter with what the team announced as a right knee injury.
After the game, Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said that Durant will have an MRI on the knee Monday to determine the severity of the injury.
The injury occurred at the end of the third quarter when Heat guard Jimmy Butler landed on Durant's knee after falling from an attempted layup.
Durant immediately began grabbing at his right knee and stayed on the ground for a moment before ultimately limping back to the locker room.
During that span, the Nets went just 5-16, including an 11-game losing streak, showing just how important Durant is to this team.
