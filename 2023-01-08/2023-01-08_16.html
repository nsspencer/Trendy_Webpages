     Lions' Jamaal Williams references Naruto in viral 'Swagg Kazekage' intro on 'Sunday Night Football'

     Summary: Williams didn't state his college or high school in his introduction, nor did the Lions running back state his name.
LIVE: Follow Lions vs. Packers 'Sunday Night Football' game with Sporting NewsWilliams apparently was referring to himself as "Swagg Kazekage," as you can hear in the clip below.
In Naruto, the Kazekage are the leaders of Sunagakure, a small but powerful village located in the Land of Wind.
So, it would seem that Williams is referring to himself in the intro as a leader of the Lions team by calling himself "Swagg Kazekage."
One would presume that "the hidden village of the den" that Williams referenced is the Lions, or perhaps the city of Detroit.

     Summary: (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)It probably took longer into the game than anyone would‚Äôve preferred, but Jamaal Williams tied then set the Detroit Lions‚Äô single season record for rushing touchdowns on Sunday night.
Jamaal Williams has had a fantastic second season with the Detroit Lions, leading the NFL with 15 rushing touchdowns heading into Week 18.
In Lions‚Äô history, Williams joined some exclusive company by simply having a 1,000-yard rushing season.
Plenty of Williams‚Äô previous 15 scores this season have come from that distance, so he was a practical lock to get his 16th rushing touchdown of the season, right?
The franchise record is now his alone, with 17 rushing touchdowns this year.

     Summary: When it comes to running the football into the end zone, no Detroit Lions player has ever done it better in a season than those guys.
Williams added yet another in the season finale on Sunday night in Green Bay, bringing his league-leading total to 16.
That ties Sanders‚Äô all-time franchise record, set back in 1991 -- the last time the Lions won a playoff game, as it happens.
He snapped the 1,000-yard mark early in the game against Green Bay, becoming the first Lions player to do that since Reggie Bush in 2013.
But Green Bay didn‚Äôt want him back.
