     What Netflix Just Did To ‘Inside Job’ Season 2 Is Brutal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside Job Inside JobWhile Netflix cancelling a show is not exactly breaking news at this point, this week we have a unique case with Inside Job, and its newly aflame mob of angry fans.
Inside Job was not just cancelled after season 1, it was actually un-renewed, a rare move that is sadly becoming increasingly more common in the tumultuous streaming era.
Inside Job is a series from former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi that posits a world where conspiracy theories are real.
Netflix famously renewed GLOW for a final season and then reversed that decision, cancelling the series without a proper conclusion, though at the time, they cited COVID-based production issues for that decision.
It’s not clear how many seasons Inside Job had planned, but it was not given even a second one to expand, while other animated shows like Big Mouth are entering their seventh season after renewal.

     ‘Inside Job’ Canceled By Netflix, Reversing Season 2 Renewal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There will be no second season for Inside Job, the adult animated conspiracy theory comedy series from Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi and creator Alex Hirsch.
The news was confirmed Sunday by Takeuchi on Twitter, a decision that reverses the series’ previously announced Season 2 renewal.
“I’m heartbroken to confirm that Netflix has decided to cancel Season 2 of Inside Job, Takeuchi tweeted.
Inside Job is an adult animated comedy about the shadow government – and the dysfunctional team whose daily grind is committing the world’s conspiracies.
Netflix had announced a Season 2 renewal for the series in June.

     ‘Inside Job’ Canceled by Netflix After One Season, Creator Says ‘I’m Heartbroken’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix has swung the axe on “Inside Job,” the adult-animation conspiracy comedy, after one season, according to creator and showrunner Shion Takeuchi.
“I’m heartbroken to confirm that Netflix has decided to cancel Season 2 of ‘Inside Job,'” she wrote.
“Inside Job,” a sendup of ’90s sci-fi drama “The X-Files,” stars Lizzy Caplan, Christian Slater and Clark Duke.
The first half of “Inside Job” (10 episodes) premiered on Netflix in October 2021, and the second part (eight episodes) debuted this past November.
“Inside Job” was the first project under Takeuchi’s overall deal with Netflix and was the first adult-animation series produced in-house by Netflix Animation Studios.

     Inside Job Is Yet Another Story Netflix Has Left Unfinished
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside Job has been canceled by Netflix ahead of its second season, its creator Shion Takeuchi has confirmed.
Inside Job has been left out in the cold, and it sucks.
A lot of big names turned to Netflix, whose coffers were opened for all willing to sign their name on the dotted line.
This rings true with Inside Job, as creator Shion Takeuchi made a name for herself on shows like Gravity Falls and Disenchantment before landing at Netflix.
While the first season provided only a few glimpses of this brilliance, I’m sure the now shrouded future was to hold so many more.
