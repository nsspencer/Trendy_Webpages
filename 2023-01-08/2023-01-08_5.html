     Cincinnati Bengals vs. Baltimore Ravens: Live updates from the season finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI, Ohio -- After a rollercoaster week following the postponement and eventual cancellation of Monday night’s matchup against the Bills, the Cincinnati Bengals will close out the regular season at home against the Baltimore Ravens.
Both teams are already headed to the playoffs no matter the outcome, and the Bengals have already clinched the AFC North.
The Ravens defense has always been a formidable group and this season has been no different.
Tee Higgins has 1,022 yards this season while Ja’Marr Chase, despite missing four week with a hip injury, is at 960.
Even Tyler Boyd is north of 700 yards, so the Ravens will have their work cut out for them as well.

     Summary: A new report by ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio suggests that the Bengals never would have even found themselves in this situation had they known the Bills had no intention of finishing the game later in the week.
Bengals head coach Zac Taylor decided to act honorably and give the Bills a chance to continue the game later, even mentioning Tuesday.
As Florio writes, “Bengals players generally accepted the prospect of a one-day delay.”But then the Bills left Cincinnati, which confused a number of Bengals players.
And while the Bengals players were sensitive to the situation, they “fully realized the stakes of the game” and “wanted to get it played”.
Here’s an excerpt of the report:If this is true, the Bengals cannot be happy with how the Bills handled the situation.
