     Summary: That means the New England Patriots will travel to Buffalo for a matchup against Hamlin’s Bills.
After a Mac Jones incompletion and a Damien Harris two-yard run, Jones was sacked on third-down for a nine-yard loss.
Two straight Damien Harris runs set the Patriots up with another third-and-short, where Jones’ pass was broken up.
The Patriots were set up at the Buffalo 11-yard line following the turnover, but they were not able to capitalize.
That was all the success they found, as Jones’ pass on third-and-seven to Tyquan Thornton was incomplete.
