     Aaron Rodgers, Packers Mocked by NFL Fans for Losing Playoff Spot After Loss to Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is because the Green Bay Packers blew their win-and-in playoff opportunity with a stunning 20-16 loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Lambeau Field.
Green Bay's offense was largely to blame, as it consistently stalled in scoring opportunities and saw Aaron Rodgers throw a critical interception in the closing minutes.
Green Bay managed just three field goals in a first half that saw Aaron Jones lose a fumble and a failed fourth-down attempt.
The offense finally broke through when Christian Watson made an incredible catch on a deep ball as he was being interfered with, which set up a Rodgers touchdown pass to Allen Lazard.
Rodgers then threw a terrible interception to Kerby Joseph and never touched the ball again.

     Aaron Rodgers' failed jersey swap after loss to Lions fuels exit talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readIs Aaron Rodgers retiring after the Green Bay Packers’ failed playoff bid in Week 18 against the Detroit Lions?
After the Lions took down the Packers 20-16 to deny them a playoff berth, Williams approached Rodgers for a potential jersey swap.
“Rodgers retiring?
“I don’t think he’s retiring, but I think he’s going to try his best to land somewhere else,” another fan said.
This franchise wasted his best years.”To be fair, it’s unlikely Aaron Rodgers is thinking about his future right after the game.

     Summary: The Detroit Lions beat the Green Bay Packers 20-16 on Sunday night to dash the Packers’ playoff hopes.
There were brief moments of brilliance from Rodgers, but he missed too many throws for the Packers to reach the playoffs.
The Packers led at the time, 16-13, with the Lions facing a second and 8 from the Packers’ 9-yard line with 7:24 left in the game.

     Summary: Since winning the Super Bowl in 2010, Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to the playoffs nine times.
They failed to reach the Super Bowl in any of those seasons.
He’s been okay this season, but far from the star he’s been for years.
The team’s window for another Super Bowl isn’t getting wider.
While his Hall of Fame jacket is secured, Aaron Rodgers is left to wonder about what his ultimate legacy will be.

But he did have an interesting exchange with rookie wide receiver Jameson Williams, who wanted to swap jerseys with Rodgers.
It could be nothing, or it could be something, but speculation about Rodgers' future in Green Bay is surely going to heat up now.
This isn't the first time Rodgers' future with the team has been brought up.
