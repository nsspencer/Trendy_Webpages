     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Houston Texans scored their first defensive touchdown of the season Sunday when defensive end Jonathan Greenard intercepted Colts quarterback Sam Ehlinger and returned it 39 yards.
It was the first play after the Colts recovered a fumble from Texans running back Royce Freeman in the second quarter.
Ehlinger was under pressure, as Texans defensive tackle Rasheem Green had Ehlinger in his grasp, but he still threw the ball while being dragged down.
Greenard, while being blocked, intercepted the pass to extend the Texans' lead to 17-7.

     Houston Texans lose No. 1 pick after wild last-second win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A last-second win on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Houston Texans out of contention for the No.
1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.
The first pick appeared to be locked up for Houston – until the unthinkable happened.
2 overall pick should net them a high-level talent, but it’s a tough consolation prize after being in position to pick first for most of the season.
Second-year QB Davis Mills started 15 games for the Texans in 2022, totaling 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:29)INDIANAPOLIS -- Houston Texans coach Lovie Smith expects to return in 2023 after finishing 3-13-1 in his first season.
"We understand the totality of the season on what's going on," Smith said postgame.
ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that Smith "could be on shaky ground" back on Dec. 14 when the Texans were 1-11-1.
With the Texans' win along with the Chicago Bears' 29-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Texans earned the No.
If the Texans were to fire Smith, they would head into next year with a new head coach for the fourth consecutive season.

     Summary: Houston was able to get a field goal on the second drive because of a kick return fumble.
But similar to giving up the first touchdown, the defense was able to make some big plays to get the Colts back in the game.
The Colts would follow up that turnover with the touchdown drive that gave them the 28-24 lead.
The game look like it was going to end Indy’s way after a Zaire Franklin put the Texans in a fourth-and-20 from the Colts’ 28-yard line.
As upsetting as it can be to end that game for the Colts, in the end, it was more beneficial for them to have the Texans find a way to win it.

     Texans Insider Reveals Nugget Involving Chicago Bears And #1 Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears were part of some wild drama in the finale of the 2022 regular season.
If the Texans won, it would push their record to a half-game better than Chicago’s, handing the Bears the #1 overall pick.
@gallerysports — John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) January 8, 2023Such a scenario would be perfect for the Chicago Bears.
The Chicago Bears hold all the leverage.
Remember the 49ers got a 3rd round pick, a 4th round pick, and a future 3rd round pick when the Bears moved from #3 to #2 in 2017.
