    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Houston Texans scored their first defensive touchdown of the season Sunday when defensive end Jonathan Greenard intercepted Colts quarterback Sam Ehlinger and returned it 39 yards.
It was the first play after the Colts recovered a fumble from Texans running back Royce Freeman in the second quarter.
Ehlinger was under pressure, as Texans defensive tackle Rasheem Green had Ehlinger in his grasp, but he still threw the ball while being dragged down.
Greenard, while being blocked, intercepted the pass to extend the Texans' lead to 17-7.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A last-second win on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Houston Texans out of contention for the No.
1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.
The first pick appeared to be locked up for Houston – until the unthinkable happened.
2 overall pick should net them a high-level talent, but it’s a tough consolation prize after being in position to pick first for most of the season.
Second-year QB Davis Mills started 15 games for the Texans in 2022, totaling 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:29)The Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday night, hours after the team finished 3-13-1 in his first season.
The Texans now have fired back-to-back coaches after just one year, having ousted David Culley last January.
Smith was the defensive coordinator and associate head coach on Culley's staff in 2021, and was elevated to head coach on Feb. 7.
With the Texans' win Sunday along with the Chicago Bears' loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Texans earned the No.
Houston now heads into 2023 on the hunt for its fourth head coach since 2020.

     Texans fire head coach Lovie Smith after just one season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I appreciate Coach Smith and his entire family for their contributions over the last two seasons," McNair said.
Smith was one of six minority head coaches in the NFL during the 2022 season (not including interim coaches).
As the Texans continue a franchise reconstruction, they will begin a search for a fourth full-time head coach in as many years.
Bill O'Brien was fired amid the 2020 season (and replaced by interim head coach Romeo Crennel), opening the door for Culley, who went 4-13, and then Smith.
Whomever the next head coach is, he will likely be tasked with finding the next franchise quarterback.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Houston was able to get a field goal on the second drive because of a kick return fumble.
But similar to giving up the first touchdown, the defense was able to make some big plays to get the Colts back in the game.
The Colts would follow up that turnover with the touchdown drive that gave them the 28-24 lead.
The game look like it was going to end Indy’s way after a Zaire Franklin put the Texans in a fourth-and-20 from the Colts’ 28-yard line.
As upsetting as it can be to end that game for the Colts, in the end, it was more beneficial for them to have the Texans find a way to win it.
