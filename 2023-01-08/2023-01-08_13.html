     Lions' Jamaal Williams references Naruto in viral 'Swagg Kazekage' intro on 'Sunday Night Football'

     Summary: Williams didn't state his college or high school in his introduction, nor did the Lions running back state his name.
LIVE: Follow Lions vs. Packers 'Sunday Night Football' game with Sporting NewsWilliams apparently was referring to himself as "Swagg Kazekage," as you can hear in the clip below.
In Naruto, the Kazekage are the leaders of Sunagakure, a small but powerful village located in the Land of Wind.
So, it would seem that Williams is referring to himself in the intro as a leader of the Lions team by calling himself "Swagg Kazekage."
One would presume that "the hidden village of the den" that Williams referenced is the Lions, or perhaps the city of Detroit.

     Summary: With a goal-line score at 5:55 in the fourth quarter, Williams passed Lions Hall of Famer Barry Sanders with his 17th rushing touchdown of the season for the most in Lions history.
"I write goals for myself every year, and this year, I hit a lot of them," Williams said.
You make those at the beginning of OTAs and before the season, and I look at my goal list now and check, check, check.
And I've got one on there that I didn't even have, which is the rushing [touchdowns] record, which is a check that I didn't even have on my goals.
The Lions would hold on to beat the Packers, 20-16, as Williams also finished as the NFL's leader in total rushing touchdowns.
