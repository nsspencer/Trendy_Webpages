     Summary: "The first week (videos) were kind of slow coming in, and I was like, 'This is going to be the all-time backfire,' " Burke said.
It had an impact, because Watt did what he wanted, sacking 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy a pair of times to bring his season total to 12¬Ω and his career total to 114¬Ω.
His final game included five tackles, three tackles for loss, two quarterback hits and a pass defensed.
