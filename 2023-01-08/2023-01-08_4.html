     Lakers' Thomas Bryant: Logs massive 29/14 double-double
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryant logged 29 points (12-14 FG, 5-7 FT), 14 rebounds, one block and one steal across 34 minutes during Saturday's 136-134 win over the Kings.
The Lakers will find a way to keep Bryant involved upon Anthony Davis' (foot) return if he keeps playing at this level.
If anything, Bryant's performances have already ignited thought about Davis' future with the team.
The Lakers have won five straight games without Davis and have been quite vocal about potential activity at the trade deadline.
Bryant is a great streaming option right now, but he has a chance to be the full-time guy if the Lakers make a big move.

     LeBron James on Thomas Bryant: 'One of the most skilled bigs in this game'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James, who finished with 37 points, said Bryant had taken advantage of Anthony Davis's absence to show off his skills.
And he's a guy who plays extremely hard, knows how to play, and probably one of the most skilled bigs in this game.
But he also has a soft, soft touch from the mid-range and from the three point line.
And he's just has a motor and he's just a huge motor that there's just always going on both sides of the floor.
Thomas has definitely done his part and we're all trying to chip in", James told reporters after the game.

     Thomas Bryant Records Dominant Statline That No Lakers Player Has Done Since Shaquille O’Neal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The vibes are certainly very solid for the Los Angeles Lakers, and a large reason for that has been the resurgence of Thomas Bryant.
Bryant is nowhere near the physical specimen and player O’Neal was, but there’s no denying that he’s been just about as effective and efficient as any other center in the league right now.
Several times throughout a game, Bryant will run hard toward the basket where he gets rewarded for layups and dunks.
LeBron James explains Lakers recent successThere’s a renewed optimism and positivity revolving around Los Angeles, and it shows whenever they are on the floor.
It’s the best way to watch player interviews, exclusive coverage from events, participate in live shows, and more!
