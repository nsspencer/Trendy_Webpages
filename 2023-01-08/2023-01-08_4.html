     Joe Burrow on Bengals' Super Bowl window: 'The window's my whole career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For as much confidence as Burrow exudes year in and year out, the 26-year-old will give a sensible assessment of his performance on a weekly basis.
"If we didn't win this one, I guess technically we would've won the division, but it wouldn't have felt like it," said Burrow, whose 35 TDs on the season set a new franchise record.
Sunday's victory brought the Bengals to the 12-win mark for just the fourth time in the franchise's history.
On two of those occasions in 1981 and 1988, Cincinnati reached the Super Bowl.
Of course, the Bengals have yet to win a Super Bowl in three total tries.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The cards are stacked against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, and their revolving door at quarterback is contributing to their woes.
Tyler Huntley has been the starter since then, but his status against the Cincinnati Bengals is up in the air after suffering wrist and shoulder injuries.
Instead, an announcement on who is starting under center isn’t expected until the Bengals take to the field for pregame warmups against the Bengals.
Ravens are not expected to an announce their starting QB Sunday vs. the Bengals until pregame warmups.
The price tumbled leading up to Sunday, but the Ravens are holding steady as +10 underdogs, per the line info from FanDuel Sportsbook.

     Ravens Excited to Visit Bengals on Wild-Card Weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens will get another crack at the Bengals in the playoffs, and they're embracing it.
Baltimore will visit Cincinnati on Wild Card weekend (TBD), after the results of Sunday's games determined the AFC's playoff seedings.
When they meet again on Wild-Card Weekend, the stakes will be much higher, with the winner advancing and the loser going home.
Jackson was in the lineup when the Ravens defeated the Bengals, 19-17, in Week 5, but regardless of who plays quarterback, Baltimore is not conceding anything.
Many people expected the Bengals and Ravens to battle for the AFC North crown before the season began, and that's exactly what happened.

    </h2>

     Summary: Joe Mixon pushes his way into the end zone and celebrates with a coin flip.
(0:17)CINCINNATI -- In case it wasn't clear enough, Bengals running back Joe Mixon reminded everyone how those in Cincinnati feel about coin flips.
The celebration highlighted the emotions after the NFL approved a resolution Friday that called for a coin flip to decide the site of a potential Cincinnati-Baltimore game under certain conditions.
We don't have the opportunity to play for a coin flip that will positively impact us."
He also lost a fumble in the end zone for a Bengals touchdown after defensive end Trey Hendrickson sacked Brown and knocked the ball loose.

     Bengals’ Joe Mixon breaks out epic coin flip celebration vs. Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After scoring a touchdown in the first quarter against the Ravens, the Bengals running back pulled a coin out of his glove, flipped it and kicked it away.
The celebration is a clear shot at the NFL’s updated AFC playoff rules, which were altered after Damar Hamlin’s collapse forced the cancellation of last week’s Bengals-Bills game.
If the Bengals (11-4) lose to the Ravens (10-6) in Week 18 and they were to face in the wild card round, the league would flip a coin to decide home field.
Bengals head coach Zach Taylor wasn’t too pleased with the updated rules, considering that Cincinnati would have won the AFC North and potentially play a road wild card game.
With the Ravens starting rookie quarterback Anthony Brown and resting key players Mark Andrews and J.K. Dobbins, the Bengals aren’t having much trouble squashing the potential coin flip scenario.

     'A cigar smoking winner': Joe Burrow leads the Bengals to clinch a home field playoff game

     Summary: Around 4:30 on Sunday afternoon, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was standing in the middle of the Bengals locker room, carrying a cardboard box full of Leather Rose cigars.
The Bengals just beat the Baltimore Ravens, 27-16, at Paycor Stadium to clinch a first-round home playoff game and put a stamp on their AFC North championship season.
“That’s who Joe Burrow is,” Bengals backup quarterback Brandon Allen said.
That message continued when different players were celebrating, were approached by Burrow and were offered a cigar from the “Drew Estate” line.
With the NFL’s rule changes about the playoffs this season, Burrow said the Bengals were given another slight.
