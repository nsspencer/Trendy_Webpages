     'Is it time?' Packers QB Aaron Rodgers contemplates his future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY – Not surprisingly, the vast majority of Aaron Rodgers' 20 minutes with the media in the Lambeau Field auditorium after Sunday's season-ending loss to the Lions focused on his future.
Equally unsurprisingly, there were no clear answers in the immediate aftermath of a deflating 20-16 home defeat that cost the Packers a playoff spot.
As he's emphasized before, Rodgers is going to take some time to get away, ponder whether he wants to continue playing, and discuss with the Packers where the organization stands.
Jordan Love is waiting in the wings and several veterans and longtime teammates may or may not be back.
Rodgers said he could walk away from the money, but he also knows the competitive juices aren't likely to dissipate within his ultra-competitive personality.

     Summary: The Detroit Lions beat the Green Bay Packers 20-16 on Sunday night to dash the Packers’ playoff hopes.
There were brief moments of brilliance from Rodgers, but he missed too many throws for the Packers to reach the playoffs.
The Packers led at the time, 16-13, with the Lions facing a second and 8 from the Packers’ 9-yard line with 7:24 left in the game.
— SchneidmanThe Lions treated this like a playoff gameThe Lions said all week, no matter what happened with the Seahawks-Rams game, they were going to go to Lambeau and treat this like a playoff game.

     Aaron Rodgers to contemplate future after 'emotion' of season has passed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if the organization has yet to tell Rodgers face-to-face whether it wants him, it has done so publicly.
LaFleur said he believes the organization still feels the same way, even after one of Rodgers' least productive seasons.
Rodgers' last throw of the season was intercepted by Lions safety Kerby Joseph with 3:27 left in the game.
It was Rodgers' 12th interception of the season -- second highest only to the 13 he threw in 2008, his first season as a starter.
Just like he did after the previous campaign, Rodgers said he wanted to get away from the season and "take the emotion out of it."

But trying to interpret the body language of Rodgers comes with a warning label: PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Rodgers' love for games extends beyond the football field and into the media room.
But know this: Rodgers is as precise with his words as he is with the football.
He knows that, the Packers know that.

     Aaron Rodgers, Packers Mocked by NFL Fans for Losing Playoff Spot After Loss to Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is because the Green Bay Packers blew their win-and-in playoff opportunity with a stunning 20-16 loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Lambeau Field.
Green Bay's offense was largely to blame, as it consistently stalled in scoring opportunities and saw Aaron Rodgers throw a critical interception in the closing minutes.
Green Bay managed just three field goals in a first half that saw Aaron Jones lose a fumble and a failed fourth-down attempt.
The offense finally broke through when Christian Watson made an incredible catch on a deep ball as he was being interfered with, which set up a Rodgers touchdown pass to Allen Lazard.
Rodgers then threw a terrible interception to Kerby Joseph and never touched the ball again.

Last year, Rodgers’ decision to return became public on March 8.
We’ll see where life takes us.”All the Packers and anyone else following Rodgers’ decision are left to do now is wait.
In other words, the only thing for certain after Rodgers emotionally departed the podium Sunday night is that we don’t know much about Rodgers’ future at all.
