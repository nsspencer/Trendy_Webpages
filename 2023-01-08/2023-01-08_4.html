     Summary: Rich had been largely absent from Twitter the past few months.
Ok, or not ok, is the only way to create change, &amp; stomp the stigma!
With his exaggerated pageboy haircut, Rich became a sensation and the show's MVP, immediately appearing in teen magazines even though he wasn't a teen.
Post-"Eight Is Enough," he was a series regular on "Code Red" (1981-1982) and provided a voice on the animated series "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" (1983-1985).
In light of aging out of his former image and his personal struggles, Rich worked far less after the '80s.
