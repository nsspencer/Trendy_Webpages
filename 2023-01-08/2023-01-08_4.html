     Seahawks Give Up Late TD, Trail Rams at Halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks had an early mistake and didn't maximize offensive opportunities, as they trailed headed into halftime against the Los Angeles Rams in a must-win game.
In order to reach the postseason, the Seattle Seahawks needed some straightforward assistance headed into Sunday's meeting with the Los Angeles Rams at Lumen Field.
The Seahawks defense held strong in the red zone and forced a 22-yard field goal from Rams kicker Matt Gay, but the early mistake was one that Seattle could hardly afford.
LA went three-and-out on the ensuing drive, which was followed up with another field goal from Myers and the Seahawks.
