     Aaron Rodgers, Packers Mocked by NFL Fans for Losing Playoff Spot After Loss to Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is because the Green Bay Packers blew their win-and-in playoff opportunity with a stunning 20-16 loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Lambeau Field.
Green Bay's offense was largely to blame, as it consistently stalled in scoring opportunities and saw Aaron Rodgers throw a critical interception in the closing minutes.
Green Bay managed just three field goals in a first half that saw Aaron Jones lose a fumble and a failed fourth-down attempt.
The offense finally broke through when Christian Watson made an incredible catch on a deep ball as he was being interfered with, which set up a Rodgers touchdown pass to Allen Lazard.
Rodgers then threw a terrible interception to Kerby Joseph and never touched the ball again.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Lions celebrated, veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers walked on the field to offer his congratulations before heading to the locker room.
But he did have an interesting exchange with rookie wide receiver Jameson Williams, who wanted to swap jerseys with Rodgers.
It could be nothing, or it could be something, but speculation about Rodgers' future in Green Bay is surely going to heat up now.
This isn't the first time Rodgers' future with the team has been brought up.
While the Lions were already eliminated from the playoffs, they sent the Seattle Seahawks to the big dance next weekend.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since winning the Super Bowl in 2010, Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to the playoffs nine times.
They failed to reach the Super Bowl in any of those seasons.
He’s been okay this season, but far from the star he’s been for years.
The team’s window for another Super Bowl isn’t getting wider.
While his Hall of Fame jacket is secured, Aaron Rodgers is left to wonder about what his ultimate legacy will be.

     Aaron Rodgers Vague About Future Following Loss to Lions

     Summary: The 2022 season ended in disappointment for Aaron Rodgers and the Packers on Sunday Night Football as the club was eliminated from playoff contention following a 20–16 home loss to the Lions.
The loss not only ended Green Bay’s playoffs hopes, but also reignited conversations surrounding Rodgers’s NFL future with his 18th season officially in the books.
Speaking to reporters after the game, Rodgers remained noncommittal about playing next season and explained that he is still unsure about where he stands on what he wants to do.
“I mean, it’s a little raw right now, just a little bit after the game,” Rodgers said.
On the season, Rodgers logged 3,695 yards, 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 17 starts.

     Summary: Even if the organization has yet to tell Rodgers face-to-face whether it wants him, it has done so publicly.
LaFleur said he believes the organization still feels the same way, even after one of Rodgers' least productive seasons.
Rodgers' last throw of the season was intercepted by Lions safety Kerby Joseph with 3:27 left in the game.
It was Rodgers' 12th interception of the season -- second highest only to the 13 he threw in 2008, his first season as a starter.
Just like he did after the previous campaign, Rodgers said he wanted to get away from the season and "take the emotion out of it."
