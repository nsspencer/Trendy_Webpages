    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Houston Texans scored their first defensive touchdown of the season Sunday when defensive end Jonathan Greenard intercepted Colts quarterback Sam Ehlinger and returned it 39 yards.
It was the first play after the Colts recovered a fumble from Texans running back Royce Freeman in the second quarter.
Ehlinger was under pressure, as Texans defensive tackle Rasheem Green had Ehlinger in his grasp, but he still threw the ball while being dragged down.
Greenard, while being blocked, intercepted the pass to extend the Texans' lead to 17-7.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A last-second win on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Houston Texans out of contention for the No.
1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.
The first pick appeared to be locked up for Houston – until the unthinkable happened.
2 overall pick should net them a high-level talent, but it’s a tough consolation prize after being in position to pick first for most of the season.
Second-year QB Davis Mills started 15 games for the Texans in 2022, totaling 3,118 yards, 17 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

     Texans fire Lovie Smith after one season as coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareThe Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday night, hours after he orchestrated a late comeback at Indianapolis that gave the team its third victory of the season but kept the franchise from having the top pick in the NFL draft.
Smith was ousted after only one season in which the Texans had a record of 3-13-1.
A fourth Black coach, Steve Wilks, served as interim coach of the Panthers after they fired Matt Rhule in October.
Smith and Bowles were the only Black head coaches hired leaguewide last offseason, among the 10 teams that hired new coaches.
Two other Black coaches, Wilks and Ray Horton, later joined the lawsuit.

     Summary: (0:29)The Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday night, hours after the team finished 3-13-1 in his first season.
The Texans now have fired back-to-back coaches after just one year, having ousted David Culley last January.
Smith was the defensive coordinator and associate head coach on Culley's staff in 2021, and was elevated to head coach on Feb. 7.
The Texans now begin their search for their fourth head coach in four seasons.
With the Texans' win Sunday along with the Chicago Bears' loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Texans earned the No.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I appreciate Coach Smith and his entire family for their contributions over the last two seasons," McNair said.
The Texans promoted Smith to head coach ahead of the 2022 season in an effort to turn things around with a young, rebuilding squad.
Smith was one of six minority head coaches in the NFL during the 2022 season (not including interim coaches).
As the Texans continue a franchise reconstruction, they will begin a search for a fourth permanent head coach in as many seasons.
Whomever the Texans hire as head coach, he will likely be tasked with finding the next franchise quarterback.

But similar to giving up the first touchdown, the defense was able to make some big plays to get the Colts back in the game.
The Colts would follow up that turnover with the touchdown drive that gave them the 28-24 lead.
The game look like it was going to end Indy’s way after a Zaire Franklin put the Texans in a fourth-and-20 from the Colts’ 28-yard line.
As upsetting as it can be to end that game for the Colts, in the end, it was more beneficial for them to have the Texans find a way to win it.
