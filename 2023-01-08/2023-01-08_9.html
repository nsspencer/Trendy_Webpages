     Saleh confident in Jets’ future despite losing last 6 games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Saleh is confident that next season, the Jets will be able to execute the one or two plays needed to be the difference in winning and losing important late-season games.
“We had our opportunities,” said Saleh, who completed his second season with the Jets.
The Jets then dropped games to Minnesota, Buffalo, Detroit and Jacksonville and were eliminated from the playoffs with a Week 17 loss to Seattle.
As the Jets enter the offseason with the goal of getting healthy, Wilson’s future with the team is murky.
“We’ve got a good team,” Saleh said.

     A snoozer in Miami as NY Jets-Dolphins tied at 3 at halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though he’s avoided any official sacks, Flacco has been knocked down on six occasions, with Jaelan Phillips alone responsible for three.
There are few reasons from a Jets fans perspective beyond masochistic affairs, but watching these young hopefuls for the last time until August might be sufficient enough.
Mann of the HourAs the Jets prepare to ponder their special teams future, the oft-maligned Braden Mann might’ve been the Jets’ MVP in this first half.
Two punts have averaged over 50 yards and both landed inside the 20.
That’s the perfect defense for a seventh-round rookie quarterback in way over his head, as well as a downtrodden offense desperate for any kind of traction.

     Dolphins Clinch Playoff Berth With 11-6 Win Over Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Miami took both of its first two drives into Jets territory but failed to come away with points.
The opening drive stalled on the Jets' 44-yard line after an incomplete pass on fourth-down.
The Dolphins' second drive got off to a promising start when Thompson found tight end Durham Smythe for a 26-yard gain, setting up first-and-10 from the New York 39-yard line.
New York then responded with an 11-play, 61-yard drive that culminated in a 32-yard field goal from kicker Greg Zuerlein.
After outrushing New York 63-15 over the first 30 minutes of action, Miami leaned heavily on its run game to begin the second half.

     Summary: The Jets attempt multiple laterals on the final play, but it results in a safety as the Dolphins win 11-6.
"You know, I say sorry to everybody," Saleh said, naming chairman Woody Johnson, vice chairman Christopher Johnson and other top executives.
It was an epic collapse by the Jets, who finished 7-10 after being hailed as one of the NFL's surprise teams at 6-3 and 7-4.
Officially eliminated last week, the Jets have gone 12 straight years out of the playoffs, the league's longest active drought.
Saleh vowed to "get the quarterback position right" in 2023, saying the Jets are "committed" to Wilson.

     Summary: Jason Sanders nails a 50-yard field goal to help the Dolphins earn a playoff spot with an 11-6 victory over the Jets.
The Jets (7-10) ended the season with six straight losses, finishing a disappointing collapse for Robert Saleh's squad.
In their most important game of the season, the Dolphins’ offense was limited with veteran left tackle Terron Armstead inactive and rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback.
Hill was limited by an ankle injury sustained in the first half, but he only briefly left the game.
Jets: Enter the offseason with a big question mark at quarterback after Zach Wilson’s rough second NFL season.

The New York Jets competed hard against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday as 3.5-point underdogs.
Any Jets bettor who felt comfortable hasn't been betting on football for very long.
The multiple lateral play — dubbed "Pitchy Pitchy Woo Woo" by ESPN's Scott Van Pelt — was still to come.
It was ruled a safety, which meant an 11-6 Dolphins win and a bad beat for Jets +3.5 bettors.

There is no way to positively spin what transpired with the Jets’ offense this season, especially during the six-game losing streak.

The Dolphins (9-8) pulled out the touchdown-less affair with Jason Sanders' third field goal of the game, a 50-yarder solidly between the uprights with 18 seconds remaining.
The Jets finish Robert Saleh's second season at the head-coaching helm at 7-10 with six straight losses.
But their offense couldn't produce a touchdown for the third consecutive game.
It was the Jets' first touchdown-less game since 2010 and a 9-0 loss vs. Green Bay and their first on the road since their wind-aided 3-0 win at Washington in 1993.

Highlights were at a premium throughout the game, with all points earned through Jason Sanders and Greg Zuerlein field goals.
It was Sanders’ 50-yard field goal with 18 seconds to go that helped punch the Dolphins’ ticket and more or less end the Jets’ season.
Garrett Wilson was a rare silver lining for the Jets, capping his season off with a game-best 89 yards on nine receptions.
