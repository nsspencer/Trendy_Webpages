     Seattle Seahawks Playoff Chances and Scenarios Week 18: Still a Chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks can punch their ticket to the playoffs in Week 18 against the Los Angeles Rams if they win and another game goes their way.
Seahawks Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18For the Seahawks to secure the seventh seed and a spot in the playoffs, these are the possible scenarios in Week 18.
If both the Seahawks and Packers win, they’ll have the same record.
The Lions, Commanders, and Seahawks would then break their tie on conference record, and the Lions would advance.
If the Commanders lose in a scenario where the Rams and Seahawks tie while the Packers and Lions tie, then it’s no longer a four-way tie.

     Summary: Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks: Betting odds, lines and picks against the spreadRams quarterback Baker Mayfield runs on to the field before a win over the Las Vegas Raiders on Dec. 8.
(Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)The Rams will look to end the season on a high note and potentially play spoiler against the Seattle Seahawks.
The win over the Rams looks to be the easy part based on the spread, as Seattle is almost a touchdown favorite at home.
Seattle was victorious 27-23 in the first meeting at SoFi Stadium in Week 13 when John Wolford got the start for the Rams.
The Seahawks had 6.7 yards per play on offense to 5.3 for the Rams and probably should have won by more than they did.
