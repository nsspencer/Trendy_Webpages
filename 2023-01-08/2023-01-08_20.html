     S&amp;P 500 could sink another 22%, Morgan Stanley warns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. stock market could face even steeper losses in 2023 than many investors currently expect, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.
"The consensus could be right directionally, but wrong in terms of magnitude," Wilson wrote in the note.
He suggested the S&amp;P 500 could tumble to 3,000 points by year-end, down about 22% from current levels.
Stocks have rallied in early 2023, with the S&amp;P up about 2% on Monday following the better-than-expected December jobs report that showed wage growth slowed markedly last month.
"In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy."

     Stocks almost flat as S&amp;P 500 struggles near 3,900
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 struggled to stay above the key 3,900 level after an advance that reached almost 1.5% earlier in the session.
Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said she expects the central bank to raise rates to somewhere over 5%.
Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson said that while investors are generally pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth, corporate profit estimates are indeed still too high.
That suggests the S&amp;P 500 could fall much lower than the 3,500 to 3,600 points the market is currently estimating in the event of a mild recession, he said.
Elsewhere, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was set to enter a bull market after surging over 20% from its October low.

     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 could sink by more than investors anticipate, Morgan Stanley warned on Monday.
Investors see the S&amp;P 500 sitting at 3,500-3,600.
The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19% in 2022 but has been pushing higher as 2023 trade gets underway.
The S&amp;P 500 was pushing its rally into a second consecutive session on Monday, up by more than 1% to around 3,945.
"The bottom line, we don't think a 3,500-3,600 S&amp;P 500 is consistent with the consensus view for a mild recession.

     S&amp;P Could Fall 24% This Year, Morgan Stanley Says, But One Sector May Be The Best Bet To Avoid The Slide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineThe S&amp;P 500 may soon sink to its lowest level in three years, Morgan Stanley strategists warned Monday, as concerns about how a bleak macroeconomic situation will weigh on bottom lines continue to haunt Wall Street.
Getty ImagesKey FactsAnalysts led by Michael Wilson estimated the S&amp;P could slip to as low as 3,000 points during 2023, according to a note to clients.
That indicates 24% downside from the index’s 3,930 mark as of Monday and would be the S&amp;P’s lowest mark since May 2020.
It’s an “easy sale” at the S&amp;P’s current price with “inevitable earnings declines” one the way, Wilson wrote.
Surprising FactThe S&amp;P is overvalued according to 17 of the 20 historical metrics tracked by Bank of America.

     Why stock-market bulls are ‘woefully myopic’ about S&amp;P 500 profit growth — even before the impact of a potential recession
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 to see single-digit profit growth in 2023-24 seem “woefully myopic,” with the U.S. stock-market benchmark’s historically high operating margins being a “material risk,” according to Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management division.
“Even before we consider the potential impact of recession,” said Shalett, “mean reversion could yield earnings disappointments.”On a trailing four-quarter basis, S&amp;P 500 operating margins are above their rolling 10-year average, a chart in her note shows.
MORGAN STANLEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT NOTE DATED JAN. 9, 2023“On a four-quarter basis, S&amp;P 500 operating margin, at 11.6%, is still near its 13.1% all-time high,” she wrote.
“It also remains above the prepandemic 10.2% and the 9.4% rolling 10-year average.”Inflation and corporate pricing power have “distorted” operating margins, Shalett warned.
“Consider recalibrating profit expectations for mean reversion” and a risk of a slowdown or potential recession, said Shalett.
