After dawn, people living in Midtown Sacramento awoke to find cars crushed by streets with roadblocks on busy streets.
A contractor said he would have to wait longer to remove a tree.
"I don't want to do more damage to the roof, so we're going to have to wait for a crane."
"I think Sacramento doesn't have enough help to get these trees down," John Small Jr said.

     Half of Sacramento loses power as 70 mph winds batter California

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Half of the customers in the Sacramento Municipal Utility District were in the dark Sunday morning after high winds took out power lines and trees overnight.
As of 6 a.m., SMUD is reporting 320,260 out of its approximately 650,000 customers are being affected by outages in the greater Sacramento area; that's 817 total outages reported.
Unlike most of Northern California, Sacramento has its own electricity provider.
"Due to the severe weather, we’re experiencing many outages," SMUD said in a statement.
Kathleen Ronayne/APSacramento was battered by high winds Saturday night, with the National Weather Service recording gusts of up to 70 mph.

     Storm leaves hundreds of thousands without power in Northern California
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (KTXL) — A storm that hit California Saturday night and early Sunday morning knocked down trees and powerlines, leaving more than 300,000 people without power in Sacramento County and surrounding counties.
The weekend storm hit California after several days of relatively calm weather following another windy storm mid-week.
State officials declared a state of emergency due to the storms and the flooding risks that they pose.
Another storm is expected to hit the state over the next two days, with the brunt of it coming Monday evening into Tuesday.
In anticipation of the storm, Sacramento County officials issued an evacuation warning for the community of Wilton, one of the harder hit areas in the New Year’s weekend storm.

Significant gusts were also tallied at McClellan Airport (68 mph), Sacramento Executive Airport (67 mph), near the former Sleep Train Arena in North Natomas (65 mph) and Mather Airport (64 mph).
