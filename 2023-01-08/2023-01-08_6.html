     Summary: On the final Sunday of the NFL Regular Season, one team will look to give themselves a chance at clinching a playoff spot, as the Seattle Seahawks prepare to host the Los Angeles Rams.
They got back on the proverbial horse last Sunday with a dominating win over the New York Jets at home.
A win does not necessarily send the Seahawks to the playoffs.
All-time, the Seahawks are 26-24 against the Rams, including sneaking out of Hollywood with a 27-23 win in Week 13.

     Summary: NFL readers Q&amp;A: Have the Rams learned any lessons from this season?
Rams quarterback Baker Mayfield walks back to the bench during a loss to the Chargers on Jan. 1.
(Kyusung Gong / Associated Press)Will the Rams take the lessons learned from this past season and use their first draft pick in the second round of the NFL draft in April on an offensive lineman?
They did that last year when they selected offensive lineman Logan Bruss with their first pick — and then saw him suffer a season-ending knee injury during the preseason.
The Rams no doubt must improve that position group, but the draft is not the only means.

     Seattle Seahawks Playoff Chances and Scenarios Week 18: Still a Chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks can punch their ticket to the playoffs in Week 18 against the Los Angeles Rams if they win and another game goes their way.
Seahawks Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18For the Seahawks to secure the seventh seed and a spot in the playoffs, these are the possible scenarios in Week 18.
If both the Seahawks and Packers win, they’ll have the same record.
The Lions, Commanders, and Seahawks would then break their tie on conference record, and the Lions would advance.
If the Commanders lose in a scenario where the Rams and Seahawks tie while the Packers and Lions tie, then it’s no longer a four-way tie.
