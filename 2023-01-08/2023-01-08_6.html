     Steelers Miss Playoffs Because of Controversial Penalty in Dolphins-Jets Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers fell on the wrong end of a controversial call in the Jets-Dolphins game.
PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers were leading by two scores with under four minutes left to play against the Cleveland Browns.
While the Browns were conducting their final, inconsequential drive, the Dolphins were mounting what would ultimately become the game-winning drive that knocked the Steelers out of the playoffs.
Replays showed Williams did not reach into Waddle's pads - his hands slid off the back of Waddle's pads instead but officials stuck by the call and Miami went on to win 9-6.

The kick that keeps the #Steelers out of the playoffs pic.twitter.com/svnoGkYDDC — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) January 8, 2023Pittsburgh began the year with a Week One win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
But they struggled from there, in part due to the loss of T.J. Watt with a pec injury, who did not return until after the bye week.
But their early-season struggles proved to be their downfall and their turnaround since the bye week wasn’t quite enough to save them.
Under GM Omar Khan and assistant Andy Weidl in their first full offseason with the team, the Steelers will likely undergo plenty of roster turnover.
