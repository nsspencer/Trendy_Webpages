Swarms of the Bolsonaro supporters, known as "Bolsonaristas," were seen charging past security barriers and clashing with police who appeared to be using pepper spray against them.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Sergio Lima/AFP via Getty Images Sergio Lima/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident da Silva, who was away in São Paulo state, called the storming an act of "barbarism" by a mob of "fascists."
Since da Silva's narrow defeat of Bolsonaro in October, Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting the win by camping out in front of army barracks around the country, blocking roads, and calling for armed forces to intervene and overturn the election.
The former Brazilian president himself left the country for Florida late last month.

     Biden administration condemns storming of government buildings in Brazil's capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “President Biden is following the situation closely and our support for Brazil’s democratic institutions is unwavering,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on Twitter.
The former Brazilian president is reported to have been spending significant time in Florida, Trump’s state of residence, in recent weeks.
Speaking on CNN following the attacks, Castro called for the Biden administration or Florida authorities to extradite Bolsonaro to Brazil.
“The United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who has inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil,” Castro said.
Privately, and sometimes publicly, Latin American officials say the Biden administration needs to pay more attention to its own hemisphere, and not simply see it through the lens of migration.

     Summary: Other outlets showed Bolsonaro suporters entering the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, where CNN Brasil showed the arrivals of anti-riot police and the Brazilian Armed Forces.
The floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet, according to CNN Brasil.
Officials at Planalto Palace are waiting for the Air Force to evacuate them from the building, per CNN Brasil.
President Lula da Silva can count on the unconditional support of France,” Macron said on Twitter.
The President of the European Council Charles Michel also condemned “the assault on the democratic institutions of Brazil” and pledged his support to the Brazilian president, as did Spain and Colombia.
