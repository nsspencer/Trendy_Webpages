     Biden administration condemns storming of government buildings in Brazil's capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “President Biden is following the situation closely and our support for Brazil’s democratic institutions is unwavering,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on Twitter.
The Biden administration should solidify its relationship with Lula’s government by formally inviting him to the White House, Marczak urged.
| AP Photo/Eraldo PeresSpeaking on CNN following the attacks, Castro called for the Biden administration or Florida authorities to extradite Bolsonaro to Brazil.
“The United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who has inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil,” Castro said.
Privately, and sometimes publicly, Latin American officials say the Biden administration needs to pay more attention to its own hemisphere, and not simply see it through the lens of migration.

     Brazil markets to see fresh volatility after Bolsonaro supporters storm capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/2] Supporters of Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro are pictured through broken glass as they hold a demonstration against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Brasilia, Brazil, January 8, 2023.
REUTERS/Adriano MachadoMEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian assets may be hit by fresh volatility on Monday after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key government buildings, echoing the U.S. Jan. 6 insurrection of 2021, analysts said.
Ricardo Lacerda, founder and CEO of Brazilian investment bank BR Partners (BRBI11.SA), said he expects markets to react with volatility in the short term, especially on Monday, given the higher institutional risk.
But Komura expects the markets to recover by the end of the week considering a strong institutional reaction against the rioters.
While large sections of the Brazilian banking industry has tended to back Bolsonaro given his free market credentials relative to Lula's Workers' Party, the sector's main industry association roundly condemned Sunday's violence.

     Summary: LIMBONG: Over the past few hours, supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the Congress building, presidential offices and Supreme Court.
And you have the Supreme Court building, the Congress building and the presidential offices there.
It's Sunday, so there's no congressmen or justices there, and President Lula wasn't there either.
He laid blame for the action of the rioters squarely on the shoulders of former President Jair Bolsonaro.
As you said, Bolsonaro never conceded loss, and his supporters say that the election was rigged and stolen from Bolsonaro.
