     Summary: For the first time ever, South Dakota State is the national champion, and for the first time ever, North Dakota State has been defeated in the FCS title game at Toyota Stadium.
More:Huge turnout of South Dakota State football fans makes for memorable weekend in FriscoThat hole has been filled.
There were, if you were willing to look past NDSU’s 9-0 history in Frisco, some reasons to believe a dominant SDSU win might be forthcoming.
It was the first time in 10 national championships that NDSU ever trailed by more than a touchdown, but SDSU was just getting started.
It’s their first time beating NDSU in the playoffs, and their fourth straight win over the Bison overall.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Well, this is pretty sweet how it's worked out," coach John Stiegelmeier said after South Dakota State won its first Football Championship Subdivision title Sunday.
Amar Johnson rushed for 126 yards and Isaiah Davis had 119 for his ninth 100-yard game this season, and both scored touchdowns for South Dakota State.
It was their 114th meeting since 1903, but only the fifth in the FCS playoffs and first in the championship game.
South Dakota State: The Jackrabbits have won a school-record 14 games in a row since opening this season with a 7-3 loss at Big Ten team Iowa.
South Dakota State still hopes to fill an open slot on its 2023 schedule for Labor Day weekend.

What was once a tie game was now a 21-7 lead for South Dakota State.
NDSU was in a spiral and the experience was starting to get religious for South Dakota State fans.
South Dakota State is the team in FCS football right now and they left no doubt about at that this season.
North Dakota State, for as good as they are, will no longer be seen as untouchable in the playoffs.
