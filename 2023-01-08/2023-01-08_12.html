     Brazilian government retakes buildings from pro-Bolsonaro protesters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former president has repeatedly sparred with Supreme Court justices, and the room where they convene was trashed by the rioters.
Lula said at his news conference there was “incompetence or bad faith″ on the part of police, and that they had been likewise complacent when Bolsonaro supporters rioted in the capital weeks ago.
Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials were likely to have been working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday.
Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter he had fired the capital city’s head of public security, Anderson Torres.
Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lula’s electoral win since Oct. 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.

     Brazil markets to see fresh volatility after Bolsonaro supporters storm capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/2] Supporters of Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro are pictured through broken glass as they hold a demonstration against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Brasilia, Brazil, January 8, 2023.
REUTERS/Adriano MachadoMEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian assets may be hit by fresh volatility on Monday after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key government buildings, echoing the U.S. Jan. 6 insurrection of 2021, analysts said.
Ricardo Lacerda, founder and CEO of Brazilian investment bank BR Partners (BRBI11.SA), said he expects markets to react with volatility in the short term, especially on Monday, given the higher institutional risk.
But Komura expects the markets to recover by the end of the week considering a strong institutional reaction against the rioters.
While large sections of the Brazilian banking industry has tended to back Bolsonaro given his free market credentials relative to Lula's Workers' Party, the sector's main industry association roundly condemned Sunday's violence.
