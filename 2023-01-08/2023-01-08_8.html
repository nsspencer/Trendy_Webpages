They will, however, have to do so without edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney who was sent home after his critical comments against the Browns organization earlier this week.

     Browns vs. Steelers - NFL Game Recap - January 8, 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- — The Pittsburgh Steelers spent the second half of the season digging their way out of a deep hole, but they finally encountered one obstacle they couldn't overcome.
The Steelers wanted a chance at carrying the momentum they've built over the last two months into next week's wild-card round.
There might be changes.”While Browns coach Kevin Stefanski is expected to return, he might have to shake up his staff.
KOSAR FIREDThe Browns fired former quarterback and Ohio native Bernie Kosar from the club's pregame radio broadcast for violating NFL policy by placing a bet on a game.
Kosar said earlier in the week he bet on the Browns to beat the Steelers.

     From the Press Room: Steelers vs. Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And it was a feeling felt throughout the Steelers locker room at Acrisure Stadium.
Very proud of the guys in that locker room.
The Steelers turned their season around after starting off a disappointing 2-6, finishing out strong with a 9-8 record.
And even though they capped it with a win over the Browns, the locker room wasn't one where there was celebration or satisfaction.
Never know who's going to be back, who's not, but very confident with the guys in this locker room.
