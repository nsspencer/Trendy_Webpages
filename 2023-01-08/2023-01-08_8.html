     Jets end season with six straight losses after coming up short vs. Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. â€” The Jets' season mercifully came to an end Sunday against the Miami Dolphins.
The Jets (7-10) ended the season with six straight losses, finishing a disappointing collapse for Robert Saleh's squad.
The Jets reached midfield with 7:28 left on a 27-yard penalty after a defensive pass interference call on Dolphins cornerback Kader Kohou.
Miami got close to the end zone midway through the third quarter, set up by tough runs of 14, 11 and 21 yards by Raheem Mostert.
Tight end Mike Gesicki led the Dolphins with 46 yards, including a 32-yard catch in the fourth quarter.

     A snoozer in Miami as NY Jets-Dolphins tied at 3 at halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though heâ€™s avoided any official sacks, Flacco has been knocked down on six occasions, with Jaelan Phillips alone responsible for three.
There are few reasons from a Jets fans perspective beyond masochistic affairs, but watching these young hopefuls for the last time until August might be sufficient enough.
Mann of the HourAs the Jets prepare to ponder their special teams future, the oft-maligned Braden Mann mightâ€™ve been the Jetsâ€™ MVP in this first half.
Two punts have averaged over 50 yards and both landed inside the 20.
Thatâ€™s the perfect defense for a seventh-round rookie quarterback in way over his head, as well as a downtrodden offense desperate for any kind of traction.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A South Beach slog concluded the New York Jetsâ€™ 2022-23 season, as the Miami Dolphins took home an 11-6 decision at Hard Rock Stadium in Week 18 action.
Highlights were at a premium throughout the game, with all points earned through Jason Sanders and Greg Zuerlein field goals.
It was Sandersâ€™ 50-yard field goal with 18 seconds to go that helped punch the Dolphinsâ€™ ticket and more or less end the Jetsâ€™ season.
Garrett Wilson was a rare silver lining for the Jets, capping his season off with a game-best 89 yards on nine receptions.

     Summary: Jason Sanders nails a 50-yard field goal to help the Dolphins earn a playoff spot with an 11-6 victory over the Jets.
The Jets (7-10) ended the season with six straight losses, finishing a disappointing collapse for Robert Saleh's squad.
In their most important game of the season, the Dolphinsâ€™ offense was limited with veteran left tackle Terron Armstead inactive and rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback.
Hill was limited by an ankle injury sustained in the first half, but he only briefly left the game.
Jets: Enter the offseason with a big question mark at quarterback after Zach Wilsonâ€™s rough second NFL season.

     Summary: Veterans Jimmy Garoppolo (San Francisco 49ers free agent) and Derek Carr (Las Vegas Raiders) are the most logical candidates.
Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens free agent) would be a name to watch if he somehow becomes available.
He's not a free agent -- he's under signed through 2023 (fifth-year option) -- but he will be the big story because he will command the largest contract in franchise history.
The highest-paid defensive tackle, based on average annual value, is the Los Angeles Rams' Aaron Donald at $31.7 million.
Quincy, 27, might be their most coveted free agent.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins are heading to the postseason for the first time in six years.
Miami secured the final playoff berth in the AFC on Sunday, thanks to its 11-6 win over the New York Jets and the New England Patriots' 35-23 loss to the Buffalo Bills.
Miami tacked on a safety on the game's final play, a failed series of Jets laterals.
Miami is 1-3 all-time in the postseason against the Bills, and 0-2 in Orchard Park.
Tua Tagovailoa remains in concussion protocol, and McDaniel said after Sunday's win that there was still no timeline for his return.

     Summary: NFL bad beat: Jets bettors did not like the final play against the DolphinsAnother day of football, another bad beat on the dreaded lateral play.
The New York Jets competed hard against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday as 3.5-point underdogs.
Any Jets bettor who felt comfortable hasn't been betting on football for very long.
The multiple lateral play â€” dubbed "Pitchy Pitchy Woo Woo" by ESPN's Scott Van Pelt â€” was still to come.
It was ruled a safety, which meant an 11-6 Dolphins win and a bad beat for Jets +3.5 bettors.

     Summary: The New York Jets go into the offseason on as quiet of a whimper as you can imagine.
The Jets didnâ€™t even reach 200 yards of total offense, finishing with 187.
The Jets provided the only sack of the game as Quincy Williams got to Skylar Thompson just before halftime.
A lackluster effort with a chance to play spoiler and get some positive vibes going into the offseason only magnifies how important this offseason now is for the Jets and sums up the 2022 New York Jets in a nutshell.
Sundayâ€™s lackluster loss signals the beginning of a long offseason for the Jets.

     Summary: Jason Sanders kicked the Dolphins into the postseason with the game-winning field goal in the dying seconds, and a last-play safety tacked on two more points.
- The Jets almost opened the scoring in the second quarter but Greg Zuerlein narrowly missed a 55-yard field goal.
Thatâ€™s the second week in a row he has missed a long one to set up the opposing team with good field position.
Zuerleinâ€™s 32-yard field goal was good to tie the score.
That moved Miami into range for the potential game-winning field goal.
