     Robert Saleh “sorry to everybody” for how Jets season concluded
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Zach Wilson was benched after a loss to the Patriots that week and the Jets would go on to lose their final six games after Mike White led them to a Week 12 win over the Bears.
The 7-10 finish left the Jets on the outside of the playoffs for the 12th straight season.
Jets head coach Robert Saleh said in September that he was “taking receipts” of those mocking the Jets, but he was left to offer an apology for the way things unfolded after Sunday’s 9-6 loss to Miami.
“You know, I say sorry to everybody .
The Jets did not score a touchdown in the final three weeks of the season and they had three different starters — Wilson, White, and Joe Flacco — leading the offense in those losses.

     Summary: With the Patriots losing to the Bills, the result means that the Dolphins will be heading to Buffalo for a date with the Bills next weekend.
Their chances of moving on will look better if Waddle is healthy, but big questions at quarterback remain for Miami.
The Dolphins defense held the Jets to 187 yards, but there wasn’t anything close to a threat on the field beyond rookie wideout Garrett Wilson.
The loss was the Jets’ seventh in the final eight games and their sixth in a row.
They did not score a touchdown in the final three games and finding some way to generate offense will be a priority this offseason.

     Dolphins Clinch Playoff Berth With 11-6 Win Over Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Miami took both of its first two drives into Jets territory but failed to come away with points.
The opening drive stalled on the Jets' 44-yard line after an incomplete pass on fourth-down.
The Dolphins' second drive got off to a promising start when Thompson found tight end Durham Smythe for a 26-yard gain, setting up first-and-10 from the New York 39-yard line.
New York then responded with an 11-play, 61-yard drive that culminated in a 32-yard field goal from kicker Greg Zuerlein.
After outrushing New York 63-15 over the first 30 minutes of action, Miami leaned heavily on its run game to begin the second half.

     Summary: The Jets attempt multiple laterals on the final play, but it results in a safety as the Dolphins win 11-6.
"You know, I say sorry to everybody," Saleh said, naming chairman Woody Johnson, vice chairman Christopher Johnson and other top executives.
It was an epic collapse by the Jets, who finished 7-10 after being hailed as one of the NFL's surprise teams at 6-3 and 7-4.
Officially eliminated last week, the Jets have gone 12 straight years out of the playoffs, the league's longest active drought.
Saleh vowed to "get the quarterback position right" in 2023, saying the Jets are "committed" to Wilson.

     Summary: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — It was fitting that on the final play of the Jets’ season they went backwards.
The win by the Dolphins clinched a playoff spot for Miami, something the Jets thought they’d be playing for when they had a 7-4 record at the end of November.
On Sunday, they had 187 total yards, their second-lowest output this season and just 38 rushing, their lowest this season.

     Summary: A South Beach slog concluded the New York Jets’ 2022-23 season, as the Miami Dolphins took home an 11-6 decision at Hard Rock Stadium in Week 18 action.
Highlights were at a premium throughout the game, with all points earned through Jason Sanders and Greg Zuerlein field goals.
It was Sanders’ 50-yard field goal with 18 seconds to go that helped punch the Dolphins’ ticket and more or less end the Jets’ season.
Garrett Wilson was a rare silver lining for the Jets, capping his season off with a game-best 89 yards on nine receptions.

     Summary: Jason Sanders nails a 50-yard field goal to help the Dolphins earn a playoff spot with an 11-6 victory over the Jets.
The Jets (7-10) ended the season with six straight losses, finishing a disappointing collapse for Robert Saleh's squad.
In their most important game of the season, the Dolphins’ offense was limited with veteran left tackle Terron Armstead inactive and rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback.
Hill was limited by an ankle injury sustained in the first half, but he only briefly left the game.

The New York Jets competed hard against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday as 3.5-point underdogs.
Any Jets bettor who felt comfortable hasn't been betting on football for very long.
The multiple lateral play — dubbed "Pitchy Pitchy Woo Woo" by ESPN's Scott Van Pelt — was still to come.
It was ruled a safety, which meant an 11-6 Dolphins win and a bad beat for Jets +3.5 bettors.

The Dolphins (9-8) pulled out the touchdown-less affair with Jason Sanders' third field goal of the game, a 50-yarder solidly between the uprights with 18 seconds remaining.
The Jets finish Robert Saleh's second season at the head-coaching helm at 7-10 with six straight losses.
But their offense couldn't produce a touchdown for the third consecutive game.
It was the Jets' first touchdown-less game since 2010 and a 9-0 loss vs. Green Bay and their first on the road since their wind-aided 3-0 win at Washington in 1993.

There is no way to positively spin what transpired with the Jets’ offense this season, especially during the six-game losing streak.
To be fair, the Jets lacked even league-average quarterback play this season, and the offensive line was in shambles by Sunday.
It’s a good lesson for this team.”(Photo of Jets coach Robert Saleh: Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images)
