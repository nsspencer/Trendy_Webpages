     Biden administration condemns storming of government buildings in Brazil's capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “President Biden is following the situation closely and our support for Brazil’s democratic institutions is unwavering,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on Twitter.
The Biden administration should solidify its relationship with Lula’s government by formally inviting him to the White House, Marczak urged.
| AP Photo/Eraldo PeresSpeaking on CNN following the attacks, Castro called for the Biden administration or Florida authorities to extradite Bolsonaro to Brazil.
“The United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who has inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil,” Castro said.
Privately, and sometimes publicly, Latin American officials say the Biden administration needs to pay more attention to its own hemisphere, and not simply see it through the lens of migration.

     Bolsonaro supporters storm Brazil’s presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former president has repeatedly sparred with Supreme Court justices, and the room where they convene was trashed by the rioters.
They sprayed fire hoses inside the Congress building and ransacked offices at the presidential palace.
Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., it is likely that few officials were working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday.
The office of Lula’s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to order Torres’ imprisonment.
Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lula’s electoral win since Oct. 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.
