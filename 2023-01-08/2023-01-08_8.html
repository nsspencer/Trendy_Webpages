Seahawks Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18For the Seahawks to secure the seventh seed and a spot in the playoffs, these are the possible scenarios in Week 18.
If both the Seahawks and Packers win, they‚Äôll have the same record.
The Lions, Commanders, and Seahawks would then break their tie on conference record, and the Lions would advance.
If the Commanders lose in a scenario where the Rams and Seahawks tie while the Packers and Lions tie, then it‚Äôs no longer a four-way tie.
