     Summary: At least 170 arrested after Bolsonaro supporters storm Brazil's CongressEnlarge this image toggle caption Sergio Lima/AFP via Getty Images Sergio Lima/AFP via Getty ImagesSupporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed Congress and other buildings in the capital of Brasília on Sunday, calling for the military to take over Brazil's government.
Swarms of Bolsonaro supporters, known as "Bolsonaristas," were seen charging past security barriers and clashing with police who appeared to be using pepper spray against them.
The former Brazilian president himself left the country for Florida late last month.
World leaders condemn "anti-democratic" attack on Brazil's institutionsU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted: "We condemn the attacks on Brazil's Presidency, Congress, and Supreme Court today.
The European Union's top diplomat said the EU strongly condemns the "anti-democratic acts of violence" on Brazil's federal quarter.

     Biden administration condemns storming of government buildings in Brazil's capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “President Biden is following the situation closely and our support for Brazil’s democratic institutions is unwavering,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on Twitter.
The Biden administration should solidify its relationship with Lula’s government by formally inviting him to the White House, Marczak urged.
Speaking on CNN following the attacks, Castro called for the Biden administration or Florida authorities to extradite Bolsonaro to Brazil.
“The United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who has inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil,” Castro said.
Privately, and sometimes publicly, Latin American officials say the Biden administration needs to pay more attention to its own hemisphere, and not simply see it through the lens of migration.

     Bolsonaro supporters storm Brazil’s presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former president has repeatedly sparred with Supreme Court justices, and the room where they convene was trashed by the rioters.
They sprayed fire hoses inside the Congress building and ransacked offices at the presidential palace.
Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., it is likely that few officials were working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday.
The office of Lula’s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to order Torres’ imprisonment.
Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lula’s electoral win since Oct. 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.

     Brazil: Bolsonaro supporters break into Brazilian Congress and presidential palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday breached security barriers set up by the Armed Forces and gained access to key buildings for the three branches of government, including the congressional building, the Supreme Court and the Planalto Presidential Palace.
Other outlets showed Bolsonaro suporters entering the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, where CNN Brasil showed the arrivals of anti-riot police and the Brazilian Armed Forces.
By Sunday evening, several hours after the breaches, the three buildings had been cleared of protesters, CNN Brasil reported.
Rocha posted a video on YouTube Sunday night apologizing for the storming of federal public buildings.
The President of the European Council Charles Michel also condemned “the assault on the democratic institutions of Brazil” and pledged his support to the Brazilian president, as did Spain and Colombia.
