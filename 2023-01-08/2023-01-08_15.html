     Joe Burrow says the Bengals' Super Bowl window is 'my whole career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Take the quarterback's answer Sunday to the question of what the Bengals' Super Bowl window is.
Joe Burrow was asked about a potential Bengals window to win after today‚Äôs game.
Cincinnati could have a challenging road back to the Super Bowl as that 3-seed.
There have been plenty of questions about how wide the Bengals' title window could be.
Given what Burrow has shown so far in his career, it's safe to say he will be in Super Bowl contention often.

     Joe Burrow on Bengals' Super Bowl window: 'The window's my whole career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For as much confidence as Burrow exudes year in and year out, the 26-year-old will give a sensible assessment of his performance on a weekly basis.
"If we didn't win this one, I guess technically we would've won the division, but it wouldn't have felt like it," said Burrow, whose 35 TDs on the season set a new franchise record.
Sunday's victory brought the Bengals to the 12-win mark for just the fourth time in the franchise's history.
On two of those occasions in 1981 and 1988, Cincinnati reached the Super Bowl.
Of course, the Bengals have yet to win a Super Bowl in three total tries.
