(AP Photo/Jeff Dean)CINCINNATI (AP) — Joe Mixon and the Cincinnati Bengals were still flipping out Sunday over the NFL’s plan to determine home-field advantage in the playoffs.
Mixon mocked the NFL’s decision to use a coin flip as a tiebreaker Sunday by celebrating a 1-yard touchdown run against the Baltimore Ravens by taking a coin out of his glove and flicking it.
ADVERTISEMENTCincinnati’s 27-16 win made the coin flip proposal irrelevant.

     Cincinnati Bengals vs. Baltimore Ravens: Live updates from the season finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI, Ohio -- After a rollercoaster week following the postponement and eventual cancellation of Monday night’s matchup against the Bills, the Cincinnati Bengals will close out the regular season at home against the Baltimore Ravens.
Both teams are already headed to the playoffs no matter the outcome, and the Bengals have already clinched the AFC North.
The Ravens defense has always been a formidable group and this season has been no different.
Tee Higgins has 1,022 yards this season while Ja’Marr Chase, despite missing four week with a hip injury, is at 960.
Even Tyler Boyd is north of 700 yards, so the Ravens will have their work cut out for them as well.

Justin Tucker knocked in a short field goal a few plays later to make it a 24-10 ball game.
The offense couldn’t move the chains, and big plays from the Ravens’ offense got Tucker within range for another field goal.
The Bengals will accept their division crown with pride now as a rematch in the wild card round is next for both teams.
