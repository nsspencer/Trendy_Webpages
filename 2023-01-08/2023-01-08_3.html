     Seattle Seahawks Playoff Chances Week 18: Still a Chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks can punch their ticket to the playoffs in Week 18 against the Los Angeles Rams if they win and another game goes their way.
Seahawks Playoff Scenarios To Watch for in Week 18For the Seahawks to secure the seventh seed and a spot in the playoffs, these are the possible scenarios in Week 18.
If both the Seahawks and Packers win, they’ll have the same record.
The Lions, Commanders, and Seahawks would then break their tie on conference record, and the Lions would advance.
If the Commanders lose in a scenario where the Rams and Seahawks tie while the Packers and Lions tie, then it’s no longer a four-way tie.
