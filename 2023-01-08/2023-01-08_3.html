    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions have been eliminated from playoff contention after the Seattle Seahawks came back to beat the Los Angeles Rams.
The win moves the Seahawks to 9-8 on the season and currently into the seventh seed in the NFC.
That said, there is no indication this development will impact the Lions‚Äô motivation in Sunday night‚Äôs game against the Green Bay Packers.
Lions coach Dan Campbell insisted the team will treat this game as a playoff game no matter the actual stakes.
This is a playoff game, and they‚Äôre going to know that.

     RECAP: Lions at Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY ‚Äì The Detroit Lions learned about an hour before their kickoff Sunday night they had been relegated to the role of spoiler against the Packers on Sunday Night Football.
Their playoff chances were ended by Seattle kicker Jason Myers' 32-yard field goal in overtime to give Seattle a win over the Rams.
But Lions head coach Dan Campbell preached all week that whether they were playing for a playoff spot or not, they would fight hard and play to win.
Well, that's exactly what this Lions team did and in doing so got the satisfaction of ending the Packers' season with a 20-16 win.
The win sends Seattle to the playoffs in the final spot in the NFC.

The 2023 draft is particularly strong at some positions the Lions could look to bolster this offseason.
It's a really strong cornerback class, but there's also depth at edge rusher, running back and along the interior offensive and defensive lines.

     Lions eliminated from playoffs, with a little help from Quandre Diggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY, Wis. -- They drove from far and wide to watch their Detroit Lions snap the third-longest playoff drought in the NFL.
The 25-year-old Navy man left his Virginia home around 1 p.m. Thursday to make the drive to Green Bay in time to watch the Seahawks-Rams game from outside Lambeau Field.
He was wearing an Aidan Hutchinson jersey and the Eddie Murphy Lions jacket from ‚ÄúBeverly Hills Cop.‚Äù And only that.
The former Lions safety was sent to Seattle by the former regime over personality clashes with then-coach Matt Patricia.
With that, Detroit is officially eliminated from the playoff chase before kicking off in Green Bay -- yet another gift from the grave of the Quinntricia regime.

     Summary: Over the past four weeks, he‚Äôs averaged only 202 passing yards and thrown just four touchdown passes.
Jones is the flashier play with the steep financial cost and might have the highest ceiling on this slate.
AJ Dillon will come in highly owned, given his affordability, but we don‚Äôt care, as over the past five weeks, he‚Äôs found the endzone six times.
FLEX OPTIONS:We view the Lions‚Äô game plan as ground-oriented, so we‚Äôre not crazy about Jared Goff tonight.
He‚Äôs the most expensive player on the slate, so we‚Äôd much rather roster him at the flex.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions had their hearts broken pregame, but still managed to spoil their divisional rivals chances to get to the playoffs when they beat the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on Sunday Night.
The Packers would add two more Mason Crosby field goals and looked on the verge of extending their 9-3 lead late in the first half when Aaron Jones fumbled as Green Bay was driving.
Jared Goff marched the Lions down the field and Marvin Badgely chipped into the lead as the Packers went to the break up 9-6.
The Lions running back was a member of the Packers for the previous three seasons before Green Bay decided to part ways with him this offseason, and he had his pay back in Week 18.
Rodgers and the Packers had more than enough time to get down the field and score, but as this season has proved, that has been no easy task for Green Bay.
