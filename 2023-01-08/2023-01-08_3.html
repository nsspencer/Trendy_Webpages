Tyron Smith was already at right tackle after making his season debut in Week 15, when the club decided to keep his rookie replacement in his old spot.
There’s a decent chance Dallas could have two 900-yard rushers in the same season for the first time.

     Dallas Cowboys Week 18 Player Props: Zeke to Find Paydirt Yet Again?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Thursday’s 27-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans, the Dallas Cowboys enter the final week of the regular season still with an opportunity to capture the NFC East title as well as the NFC’s No.
Assuming Dallas gets past the Washington Commanders, the Boys need the Philadelphia Eagles to fall to the New York Giants to claim the division crown.
As for the Cowboys’ path to the conference’s top seed, Dallas again needs a victory, an Eagles loss, and the 49ers to lose to the Arizona Cardinals, the latter scenario seeming particularly unlikely.
With Dallas’ playoff scenarios taken care of, I’ve highlighted my top Cowboys player props for Sunday’s finale down below.
Overall, I’m banking on a big game from the Cowboys offense and like Zeke’s touchdown streak to continue.

     Cowboys hope to nail down CB roles in Week 18 before it's too late
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 18 may be a pointless contest for some teams but to the Dallas Cowboys, it’s important for multiple reasons.
The second reason Week 18 is so important is there is still an important roster issue that needs resolution.
Kelvin Joseph, the Cowboys second round pick in 2021, was the natural choice to replace Brown.
Both have seen action outside as of late and both should see plenty of snaps against Washington in Week 18.
But it seems they won’t hesitate to move Bland outside to insure the best possible coverage.
