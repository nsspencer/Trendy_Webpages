     Jay Leno Says Car Engine Fire Felt Like His “Face Was on Fire”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jay Leno is opening up about the November 12 car fire that left him with severe second-degree burns.
“With a steam car, you have gasoline, but you also have a vaporizer, which is heated by a pilot light to turn water into steam,” he told People.
A spark from the engine combined with the gas, setting Leno’s face aflame.
“I was under the car maybe 10 seconds before Dave pulled me out,” Leno said.
Since leaving the hospital, Leno has hit the stage, performing stand-up at the Comedy &amp; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, California.

Yeah,” Leno joked in response before earnestly adding, “Well, I think there’s something to that.”And while Leno initially rejected the idea of going to the hospital, Hoda asked if his wife was in favor of it.
