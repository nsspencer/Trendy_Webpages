     'The Voice': Kane Brown and Blake Shelton Perform Contemplative 'Different Man' in Season 22 Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Voice season 22 finale took place on Tuesday night (Dec. 13) on NBC, and country star Kane Brown joined to perform the title track from his latest album, Different Man, with Blake Shelton.
Shelton then joined, beginning the second verse while sitting on a step offstage and then walking onstage as the crowd cheered.
Brown and Shelton then sang together during the bridge, building the song's momentum as they grappled with how to achieve this dream.
Shelton, of course, represented country well by performing "Hillbilly Bone" with Bryce Leatherwood and "Chasin' That Neon Rainbow" with Brayden Lape.
In the end, Leatherwood went home as the winner, and Blake Shelton collected his ninth win as a coach.
