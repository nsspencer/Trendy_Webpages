     Summary: Young Thug has reportedly been hit with new charges as he awaits his trial in the upcoming Young Slime Life RICO case.
According to WSB-TV, the Atlanta District Attorney’s office has charged the Atlanta rapper with street racing, reckless driving and speeding.
All misdemeanors, the charges stem from an incident in early May in which he was allegedly driving his vehicle at 120 mph on Interstate 85.
Brian Steel, Thugger’s lawyer, said his client is innocent of the charges.
On Thursday (November 17), Fulton County Judge Ural Glanville denied a request from prosecutors to delay the trial.

     Gunna to Be Released After Pleading Guilty in YSL Case – But Says He Hasn’t Flipped on Young Thug
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Young Thug and many others are set to stand trial on those charges in January.
In Wednesday’s statement, Gunna said he was “acknowledging my association with YSL,” but that he had never seen the group as a criminal enterprise.
“When I became affiliated with YSL in 2016, I did not consider it a ‘gang’; more like a group of people from metro Atlanta who had common interests and artistic aspirations,” Gunna wrote.
California recently banned the tactic in that state, but Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has strongly defended using it against Young Thug and Gunna.
Young Thug has similarly been refused release, meaning he will await his trial from a jail cell.
