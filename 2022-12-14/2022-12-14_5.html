     Summary: Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin hit another milestone last night when he netted his 800th career goal.
Though he remains well short of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record of 894 career goals, Ovechkin is now only one goal shy of the league’s second-leading scorer, Gordie Howe.
April 24, 2009After beating two defenders, Ovechkin slips one past the New York Rangers goaltender.
May 2, 2015Despite losing this road playoff game against the New York Rangers, Ovechkin stole the show by rocketing one past the goaltender from his knees.
March 18, 2009Following a spin move and a slide across the ice, Ovechkin shoots one past the Montreal Canadians goaltender to the delight of the home crowd.

     Summary: If part of the reason you watch sports is to see things that will live forever, then Tuesday was a day for you.
Now, whether goals against the Blackhawks these days actually count as NHL goals is a valid debate, but the NHL hasn’t decreed that they shouldn’t.
There has to be such a bloody-mindedness to being consistently the league’s best scorer that Ovechkin has been.
Messi, Messi, MessiOn the other side of the globe, Lionel Messi was doing his thing again.
Great players always say they didn’t truly reach above the clouds until they let the game come to them instead of trying to force it.

     Alex Ovechkin reaches 800 career goals with hat trick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 8 jersey, Alex Ovechkin held three pucks in his right hand as he posed for a picture with the rest of the jubilant Washington Capitals in the visiting locker room at the United Center.
Ovechkin became the third NHL player to reach 800 career goals when he scored three times, touching off a wild celebration for his team and an appreciative Chicago crowd.
“Soon as it happened, kind of relief,” Ovechkin said after Washington’s 7-3 win over the Blackhawks.
The 37-year-old winger then completed his 29th career hat trick when he knocked Anthony Mantha‘s pass over a sprawled Mrazek 6:34 into the third.
“How many guys can score goals at his rate in the season, let alone year after year after year?

     800 goals ago, Alex Ovechkin was a rookie in need of a roommate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He is two goals shy of passing Gordie Howe (801) for second on the NHL’s all-time list and 95 goals from breaking Gretzky’s record.
Ovechkin wanted a North American roommate so his English could improve as quickly as possible, and Hanlon thought Willsie would be an ideal candidate for the job.
Willsie thought the same.
Ovechkin had scored the Capitals’ lone goal in a loss to Dallas and all three goals, including the overtime winner, in a victory over Anaheim.
Fast-forward to the Phoenix game, a Capitals win in which Ovechkin scored a showstopping, highlight-reel goal on his back that became an instant classic.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ovechkin entered the night with 797 career goals and scored two in the first period to pull within one of the milestone.
He joined the 800 club with another goal in the third period, joining Gordie Howe (801) and Wayne Gretzky (894) as the only players in NHL history with at least 800 goals.
He scored 50 goals last season and has 20 already this season in 31 games.
(Thanks to his hot start this season, he’s now averaging 50.3 goals per 82 games, compared to 49.3 for Gretzky.)
After the 1956 season, Robinson decided it was time.
