     Bruins out to extend home dominance against Kings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After three games in seven days out west and a day of cross-country travel, the Boston Bruins were far from surprised with a sluggish start Tuesday night.
Thursday's second game of a five-game homestand sees the Los Angeles Kings visit Boston.
Linus Ullmark stood tall in a 23-save effort as the Bruins extended their season-long home point streak to start the season at 16 games (15-0-1).
The Kings have won three of their last four games at Boston and earned points in five of six, though they would have to put a dent in the Bruins' home dominance this season to keep up those marks.
Before Los Angeles won 3-2 in overtime at Boston on March 7 of last season, the Bruins won 7-0 at L.A. on Feb. 28.
