     Ex-Lakers, Warriors champ goes full Stephen Curry in China

     Summary: By Paolo Songco · 2 min readIn case you forgot about two-time NBA champion Quinn Cook, then let this article remind you of what this man is capable of.
The former Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors guard has been cooking in China of late, and his recent 54-point explosion is a clear testament to this fact.
🔥 pic.twitter.com/GPMRvTYcwW — NBA Retweet (@RTNBA) December 14, 2022For what it’s worth, the current NBA record is 14 triples in a game courtesy of another Warriors superstar in Klay Thompson.
The level of basketball is obviously different out in China, but there’s no denying that Quinn Cook can still ball out.
The former Warriors guard then decided to take his talents to the CBA after failing to secure a new deal with an NBA team this past offseason.

     Warriors' Stephen Curry Injury Update Following Wednesday's Loss To Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins out due to injuries, the Golden State Warriors fell to 2-13 on the road with a 125-119 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night.
However, this loss is the least of the team’s worries right now, as two-time MVP Stephen Curry left the game early due to a left shoulder injury.
Curry stood underneath the team’s basket during a timeout with his hands on his knees before walking to the locker room with team personnel.
After the game, head coach Steve Kerr was asked about Steph Curry and whether or not the team knew any further details yet on the severity of his shoulder injury.
Now 14-15 on the season, the defending NBA champions find themselves with their backs up against the wall, especially if Curry is forced to miss time with this left shoulder injury.

     Stephen Curry’s shoulder injury latest concern for Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Stephen Curry started Wednesday night unsure whether he would play at Indiana because of a sore right knee.
Curry was injured with about two minutes left in the third quarter as the Warriors tried to rally from a 20-point halftime deficit.
But when Pacers forward Jalen Smith dribbled toward the baseline, Curry tried to stop him by sticking his left arm out.
“The trainers told me midway through the fourth quarter that he wasn’t going to return,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.
He accounted for half of the Warriors’ 54 first-half points and finished with seven rebounds, seven assists and two steals.
