     Warriors' Stephen Curry: Questionable Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Curry is questionable for Wednesday's game against the Pacers due to right knee soreness.
Curry appeared in the last two games and averaged 26.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists in 32.0 minutes per game, but he matched his season-low mark of 27 minutes played during Tuesday's loss to Milwaukee.
He briefly exited that game early in the first half but was able to return to action, so it's possible he's still dealing with some residual discomfort.
Look for a clearer update on Curry closer to game time.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jesse Cinquini · 2 min readGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry banged his knees with Giannis Antetokounmpo on a drive during the team’s loss on Tuesday.
With the Warriors set to play a back-to-back against a young yet competitive Indiana Pacers squad, all Golden State fans are dying to know: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight versus the Pacers?
Is Warriors’ Stephen Curry playing vs. PacersThe Warriors have listed Curry as questionable for Wednesday’s matchup in Indiana with right ankle soreness, per a tweet from Anthony Slater, a Golden State beat writer for The Athletic.
The best shooter to ever step foot on a basketball court, Curry is the straw that stirs the Warriors’ offense.
Golden State goes from a historically lethal offense to just a solid one without him.

     Warriors Update Steph Curry's Injury Status vs. Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a bad loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, the Golden State Warriors have to turn right around and take on another Eastern Conference opponent in the Indiana Pacers.
The Warriors recently revealed that Curry's current injury status is questionable for Wednesday night's game vs. Indiana, meaning he has not been ruled in or out.
In desperate need of wins, especially on the road, it is hard to imagine Golden State being able to do much without Curry.
That said, Indiana has some bad losses this year against shorthanded teams, and Golden State would love to hand them another.
