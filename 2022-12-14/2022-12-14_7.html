     Scream 6 trailer takes Ghostface (and Jenna Ortega) to an iconic new location
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scream Queens Jenna Ortega (Wednesday) and Jasmin Savoy Brown (Yellowjackets) will be taunted and terrorized once again by Ghostface in Scream 6.
Not much has changed for the villain’s victims, but the iconic villain is prowling new turf: New York City.
To all my Scream fans, I love you.
I’m forever grateful to you and to what this franchise has given me over the past 25 years.”Though this is a bummer for longtime Scream fans, Scream 6 will feature both familiar franchise faces and some exciting new additions.
Scream veteran Courteney Cox will return as Gale Weathers, Scream 5 stars Melissa Barrera and Mason Gooding are back, and Scream 4 star Hayden Panettiere returns too.

     Can Scream 6 Succeed Where Friday the 13th Failed?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How many times have we been given an amazing trailer, something that promises wall-to-wall scares, only to have a lazy feature hoisted upon us?
The trailer for Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan mostly consists of a single shot of Jason from behind, staring up at the NY skyline.
Makers of perhaps the world’s most film-literate franchise, the producers of Scream 6 surely know about bad movie trailers and especially the disappointment of Friday VIII.
So instead, the teaser for the latest installment steers away from big promises and instead gives us a well-crafted scare sequence.
The tension grows when one of the Ghostfaces turns their head to stare directly at the teens.
