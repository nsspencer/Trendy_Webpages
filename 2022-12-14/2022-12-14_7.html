     Sam Smith Changed ‘Stay With Me’ For Respect For Marriage Act
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yesterday, President Joe Biden held a celebration at the White House to mark the signing into law of the Respect For Marriage Act.
The milestone act protects same-sex marriages on the federal level, making it so any potential Supreme Court decision now can’t deny those rights to LGBTQ+ people.
Sam Smith, Cyndi Lauper, and Joy Oladokun each performed on The White House South Lawn in the joyous moment, but it was something that Sam Smith did during his performance of “Stay With Me” that truly captured the essence of the Respect For Marriage Act.
Instead of, “Guess it’s true I’m not good at a one-night stand,” Smith sang, “Boy, you know I’m no good at a one-night stand.” Elsewhere, Smith also changed the line “this ain’t love, it’s clear to see” to “this is love, it’s clear to see,” which they spoke about in the Instagram post below.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden signed the critical “Respect For Marriage” Act into law on Tuesday, at a ceremony that included performances by Cyndi Lauper and Sam Smith.
What it doesn’t do is require every state to allow queer marriage — that’s where the Supreme Court case comes in.
Now, we’re allowed to love who we love, which sounds odd to say, but Americans can now love who we love.
Lauper opened up her performance commenting, “Well this time, love wins.”You can watch their performances below.
