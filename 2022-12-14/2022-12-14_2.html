     Summary: CNN —Grant Wahl, the American soccer reporter who collapsed and died while covering the World Cup in Qatar last week, died of an aortic aneurysm that ruptured, his wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, said Wednesday.
Wahl, a longtime college basketball and soccer reporter for Sports Illustrated and for his own newsletter, collapsed while covering Friday’s Argentina-Netherlands match and was later declared dead.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an aortic aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta – the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the chest.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said an aortic aneurysm is generally rare and difficult to spot.
He added that he sought help at the clinic at the World Cup media center, believing he had bronchitis.

     What to know about an aortic aneurysm, Grant Wahl's cause of death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grant Wahl's wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, revealed to CBS News on Wednesday that the renowned soccer journalist died at the World Cup in Qatar on Friday due to an aortic aneurysm that ruptured.
An aortic aneurysm can "dissect" or — as in Wahl's case — rupture.
"Though aortic aneurysms do not directly cause death, complications arising from an aneurysm — such as dissection or rupture — cause approximately 15,000 deaths annually" in the U.S., says the Aortic Center at Columbia University.
"Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm," the CDC says.
"Finding an aortic aneurysm before it ruptures offers your best chance of recovery," the Cleveland Clinic says.
