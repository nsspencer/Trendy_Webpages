     Evgeny Kuznetsov on Alex Ovechkin’s 800th career goal: ‘You cant buy those moments. That is the memories.’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin accomplished something on Tuesday night that only two NHL players before him have ever done.
Grabbing one of the assists on the milestone tally was Ovi’s longtime best pal and linemate, Evgeny Kuznetsov.
Kuzy talked about the special achievement after the game and put it into perspective in a way only he can.
When you can make him shy like that, that’s unforgettable.”In the past, Kuznetsov has remarked about being left out of some Ovechkin milestone photo moments.
“I want to pass to Mo (Mantha) but I lost the puck over there and eventually it gets to Mo and Mo pass it to him,” Kuznetsov started.
