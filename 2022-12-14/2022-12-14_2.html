     U.S. soccer journalist Grant Wahl died of an aortic aneurysm while covering World Cup in Qatar, his wife says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Soccer journalist Grant Wahl died of an aortic aneurysm in Qatar, where he was covering the World Cup, his wife said Wednesday, citing an autopsy.
She added that the autopsy revealed "Grant died from the rupture of a slowly growing, undetected ascending aortic aneurysm with hemopericardium.
An aortic aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
He said Wahl told him he got death threats after he refused to remove a T-shirt with a rainbow logo that signified solidarity with LGBTQ rights.
On Wahl's website, Gounder wrote: "While the world knew Grant as a great journalist, we knew him as a man who approached the world with openness and love.

     What to know about an aortic aneurysm, Grant Wahl's cause of death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grant Wahl's wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, revealed to CBS News on Wednesday that the renowned soccer journalist died at the World Cup in Qatar on Friday due to an aortic aneurysm that ruptured.
Gounder said in a note the aortic aneurysm grew slowly and went undetected, and that "no amount of CPR or shocks would have saved him."
An aortic aneurysm can "dissect" or — as in Wahl's case — rupture.
"Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm," the CDC says.
"Finding an aortic aneurysm before it ruptures offers your best chance of recovery," the Cleveland Clinic says.
