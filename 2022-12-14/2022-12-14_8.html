     Summary: By Paolo Songco · 2 min readIn case you forgot about two-time NBA champion Quinn Cook, then let this article remind you of what this man is capable of.
The former Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors guard has been cooking in China of late, and his recent 54-point explosion is a clear testament to this fact.
🔥 pic.twitter.com/GPMRvTYcwW — NBA Retweet (@RTNBA) December 14, 2022For what it’s worth, the current NBA record is 14 triples in a game courtesy of another Warriors superstar in Klay Thompson.
The level of basketball is obviously different out in China, but there’s no denying that Quinn Cook can still ball out.
The former Warriors guard then decided to take his talents to the CBA after failing to secure a new deal with an NBA team this past offseason.
