     Sam Smith and Cyndi Lauper Perform At Signing Ceremony for Respect For Marriage Act

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden signed the critical “Respect For Marriage” Act into law on Tuesday, at a ceremony that included performances by Cyndi Lauper and Sam Smith.

Now, we’re allowed to love who we love, which sounds odd to say, but Americans can now love who we love.
Lauper opened up her performance commenting, “Well this time, love wins.”You can watch their performances below.
