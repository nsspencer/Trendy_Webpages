     Mandy Rose Reportedly Released By WWE Amid Nude Photo And Video Leaks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: WWE.comFormer NXT women’s champion Mandy Rose has reportedly been released by WWE less than 24 hours after suddenly dropping the WWE NXT Women’s Championship to Roxanne Perez.
Perez won the Iron Survivor Challenge at WWE NXT Deadline, where she was scheduled to challenge for the NXT Women’s Championship at New Year’s Evil on January 4, 2023.
They felt like it was outside of the parameters of her WWE deal,” reported Fightful Select.
Rose’s situation transcends the third-party deal conversation, however, given the racy nature of what were supposed to be private photos for pay.
While at the helm of the dominant stable, Rose carried the NXT Women’s Championship for 413 days.
