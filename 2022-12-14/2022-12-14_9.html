     Summary: Vince McMahon, in Deep Trouble, Still Controls World WrestlingVince McMahon, for years the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (NYSE: WWE), was pushed out in July after allegations of sexual misconduct.
For McMahon, none of this changes the fact that he controls WWE through a special class of shares.
According to the WWE proxy, McMahon owns 92.2% of this class, which gives him voting control over the company.
While the stock price of almost every large media company has sold off, WWE shares are up 49%.
Not only does McMahon control WWE, but his alleged behavior also has not kept him from being a billionaire.
