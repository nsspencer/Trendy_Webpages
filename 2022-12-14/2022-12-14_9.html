     Warriors' Stephen Curry: Questionable Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Curry is questionable for Wednesday's game against the Pacers due to right knee soreness.
Curry appeared in the last two games and averaged 26.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists in 32.0 minutes per game, but he matched his season-low mark of 27 minutes played during Tuesday's loss to Milwaukee.
He briefly exited that game early in the first half but was able to return to action, so it's possible he's still dealing with some residual discomfort.
Look for a clearer update on Curry closer to game time.

     Summary: By Jesse Cinquini · 2 min readGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry banged his knees with Giannis Antetokounmpo on a drive during the team’s loss on Tuesday.
With the Dubs set to play a back-to-back against a young yet competitive Indiana Pacers squad, all Golden State fans are dying to know: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight versus the Pacers?
Is Warriors’ Stephen Curry playing vs. Pacers?
The Warriors initially listed Curry as questionable for Wednesday’s matchup in Indiana with right ankle soreness, per Anthony Slater of The Athletic.
The best shooter to ever step foot on a basketball court, Curry is the straw that stirs the Warriors’ offense.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Paolo Songco · 2 min readIn case you forgot about two-time NBA champion Quinn Cook, then let this article remind you of what this man is capable of.
The former Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors guard has been cooking in China of late, and his recent 54-point explosion is a clear testament to this fact.
🔥 pic.twitter.com/GPMRvTYcwW — NBA Retweet (@RTNBA) December 14, 2022For what it’s worth, the current NBA record is 14 triples in a game courtesy of another Warriors superstar in Klay Thompson.
The level of basketball is obviously different out in China, but there’s no denying that Quinn Cook can still ball out.
The former Warriors guard then decided to take his talents to the CBA after failing to secure a new deal with an NBA team this past offseason.
