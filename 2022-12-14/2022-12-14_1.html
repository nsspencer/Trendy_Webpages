     Summary: Actor Stuart Margolin, the two-time Emmy winner known for his performance as Evelyn “Angel” Martin in the “The Rockford Files,” died of natural causes in Staunton, Va. on Monday, family members confirmed.
I knew he was the one for the part.”Margolin and Garner’s off-screen friendship would lead to him being offered a role on another NBC project — “The Rockford Files” — which followed the crime-solving mysteries of private detective and former con artist Jim Rockford.
In the series, Margolin’s character, Angel, is a pathological liar who befriended Jim in prison.
He reprised his role in a number of “Rockford Files” TV movies in the 1990s.
Margolin’s most recent projects include a voice acting role in the short film “Home,” which was released earlier this year, along with “What the Night Can Do,” which Margolin starred in and wrote under the direction of stepson Christopher Martini.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Tommy Cummings Dallas Morning NewsStuart Margolin, a character actor best known as ex-con Angel Martin on The Rockford Files, died Monday.
Margolin, the son of a Dallas lighting wholesaler, was raised in Dallas and attended private school after being expelled from several public schools, including Hillcrest High School in 1955.
Margolin came to court with the “biggest file of traffic violations I’d ever handled,” she told The Dallas Morning News in 1987.
He directed episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Wonder Woman;, Touched by an Angel, The Love Boat; Magnum, P.I., Northern Exposure, Quantum Leap and The Rockford Files.
“I confess I’ve never understood why Rockford likes Angel so much because he’s rotten to the core,” James Garner wrote in his 2011 memoir.

     Stuart Margolin Dead: Emmy-Winning Co-Star of 'The Rockford Files' Was 82
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stuart Margolin, an Emmy award-winning character actor who co-starred in The Rockford Files, has died.
Margolin's connection to Rockford Files star James Garner dated back to the early 1970s when the actor cast him in Nichols as a "sidekick who was a shifty-eyed, backstabbing rat, but also lovable," Garner wrote in his 2011 memoir, The Garner Files.
"We'd made screen tests but couldn't find what we were looking for until one day I saw a clip from Love, American Style," Garner wrote.
"I chose to work with Jim Garner because I thought I'd have more fun, which I never regretted."
"It closed down after a year, and then I was approached by Jim's executive producer and Stephen J. Cannell to be part of [NBC's] The Rockford Files.
