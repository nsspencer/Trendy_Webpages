     Stephen 'tWitch' Boss' Wife Told Cops He Left Unexpectedly, Wouldn't Answer Phone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DJ Stephen "tWitch" Boss' wife was adamant with cops Tuesday morning ... she knew something was terribly wrong, because he'd left home without warning and stopped all communication.
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ when Allison Holker entered a branch of the LAPD Tuesday to report Stephen missing, she stressed how out of character tWitch's disappearance was.
She told cops he just simply left their house -- there was no argument or issue -- and he wouldn't answer any of her calls.
Play video content 12/11/22 Instagram / @allisonholker,sir_twitch_alotWe're told Allison was so insistent on how odd tWitch's behavior was, officers considered listing him as a "critical missing persons" case.
The staffers told us Stephen did not seem visibly upset, and his body was discovered Tuesday after he failed to check out on time.
