     Warriors' Draymond Green Says Fan Threatened His Life During Bucks Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty ImagesBasketball took something of a back seat Tuesday when Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green had a fan removed from Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum during a game against the Bucks.
Green explained after the game that he took such actions because the fan threatened his life, per C.J.
The Bucks released a statement following the game that said they are "investigating the situation and we're conferring with the NBA," per Kendra Andrews of ESPN.
Green finished with just two points on 1-of-3 shooting from the field but impacted the game in other ways with seven assists and six rebounds.
Golden State has dealt with some inconsistency to start the season and fell to just 14-14 overall and 1-3 in the last four.

     Draymond Green gets a Milwaukee Bucks fan ejected from the game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks took care of business last night and beat the Golden State Warriors 128-111 in a convincing fashion.
Bucks' fan gets ejectedMidway through the third quarter, with the Bucks in full control of the game, an incident occurred as Draymond got into a verbal argument with a particular Bucks fan sitting a few rows behind the basket during a Giannis Antetokounmpo free-throw attempt.
After the game, the Warriors star explained what went down.
Maybe it wasn't all that bad, and the Warriors star just got frustrated with his performance (2 points, 6 rebounds, 7 assists) in the blowout loss.
The Bucks fan may have gotten forced into an early exit, but at least his team took home the W.
