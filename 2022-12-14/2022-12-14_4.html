     Henry Cavill Is Not Returning As Superman

     Summary: Henry Cavill isn't coming back as Superman, after all.
Credit: Warner BrosJust weeks after announcing his return as Superman to the DC films, Henry Cavill has been kicked out of the Justice League once again.
Now, Cavill will be neither Superman or the Witcher, which is a real shame given how good he was in both roles.

My turn to wear the cape has passed, but what Superman stands for never will.

     Henry Cavill confirms he's done as Superman as James Gunn announces new origin film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After weeks of fielding rumors about what he (and producing partner Peter Safran) might or might not do with their new leadership of Warner Bros. Discovery’s DC Studios, James Gunn has announced his first concrete project as studio head: He’s writing a Superman movie—without Henry Cavill in the title role.
This is per Gunn’s own social media account, where he revealed that he’s been working on the script for the film for a while now, describing it as a movie “focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life”—hence the lack of Cavill in the lead role.
“But,” Gunn wrote, “We just had a great meeting with Henry and we’re big fans and we talked about a number of exciting possibilities to work together in the future.”AdvertisementIt’s interesting to see Gunn moving into what certainly sounds like “origin story” territory here, since the modern DC movie universe kicked itself off with a Supes origin, Zack Snyder’s 2013 franchise-starter Man Of Steel.
Gunn noted that no director has yet been tapped to handle the film.
(It seems unlikely that he’ll be taking on the job himself, given the demands of his new duties.)

     Henry Cavill Confirms Exit As Superman: “My Turn To Wear The Cape Has Passed”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments after James Gunn informed that he’s penning a new Superman, set in the Man of Steel’s younger days, and that Henry Cavill won’t be playing him, Cavill confirmed the news.
“I have just had a meeting with James Gunn and Peter Safran and it’s sad news, everyone,” writes Cavill, who recently announced his return to the cape after his cameo in Warner Bros/DC’s Black Adam.

Cavill made his debut as Superman in Zack Snyder’s 2013 Man of Steel, which grossed over $668 million at the global box office.
He reprised the caped guy in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, also directed by Snyder.

     James Gunn Writing New ‘Superman’ Film; Henry Cavill Will Not Return, but Eyed to Play Different DC Character
    </h2>

     Summary: Things are heating up in Metropolis, as DC Studios co-head James Gunn has announced he is writing a new feature film about Superman.
In step with the new project, Gunn has also revealed that Henry Cavill will not return as the hero.
In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.
After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,” Cavill wrote.
Additionally, Variety sources said the new Gunn project will not replace the previously announced J.J. Abrams-Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman concept (which is still in active development).
