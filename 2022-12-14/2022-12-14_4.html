Now, Cavill will be neither Superman or the Witcher, which is a real shame given how good he was in both roles.

     James Gunn Writing New ‘Superman’ Film; Henry Cavill Will Not Return, but Eyed to Play Different DC Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things are heating up in Metropolis, as DC Studios co-head James Gunn has announced he is writing a new feature film about Superman.
In step with the new project, Gunn has also revealed that Henry Cavill will not return as the hero.
In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.
After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,” Cavill wrote.
Additionally, Variety sources said the new Gunn project will not replace the previously announced J.J. Abrams-Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman concept (which is still in active development).
