Now, Cavill will be neither Superman or the Witcher, which is a real shame given how good he was in both roles.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things are heating up in Metropolis, as DC Studios co-head James Gunn has announced he is writing a new feature film about Superman.
In step with the new project, Gunn has also revealed that Henry Cavill will not return as the hero.
In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.

Additionally, Variety sources said the new Gunn project will not replace the previously announced J.J. Abrams-Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman concept (which is still in active development).
