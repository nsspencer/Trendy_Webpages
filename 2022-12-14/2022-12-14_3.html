     Summary: Watch : Al Roker Gives Update After Being Hospitalized for Blood ClotsThe Today team pulled off an epic surprise for Al Roker.
As he recovers from his recent health challenges at home, the staff of the NBC morning crew decided to show the longtime Today weatherman just how much they missed him with a sweet holiday surprise.
During the Dec. 14 episode, Today showed a clip of several staff members—including anchors Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, producers, crew and security—singing Christmas carols at his home.
With the help of Al's wife Deborah Roberts, several members of the morning show's staff quietly arrived at Al's house dressed in Santa hats to surprise their friend and colleague.
After Al answered Savannah and Hoda's knock at the door, they all began to sing.
