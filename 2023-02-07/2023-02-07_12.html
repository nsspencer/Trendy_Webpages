     With Curry Hurt, Klay Thompson Erupts For 42 Points As Warriors Beat Thunder 141-114
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson scored 42 points with a season-high 12 3-pointers, Jordan Poole added 21 points and 12 assists starting in Stephen Curry's place, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 141-114 on Monday night.
Thompson sat down for the night to a roaring ovation with 4:41 left to finish 15 for 22 from the floor and 12 of 16 on 3s.
Thompson now has eight games with 10 or more 3-pointers, second in NBA history behind Curry's 22.
Andrew Wiggins scored 18 points in Golden State's first game since reigning NBA Finals MVP Curry injured his left leg during Saturday's win against Dallas — and the Warriors went 26 of 50 from deep without the league's career 3-point leader.

     Summary: The team made three-point shooting the norm, and Sir Charles Barkley isn’t happy about it.
To the point, where former big men like Charles Barkley believe that the game has become awful.
I don’t mind guys shooting threes but your big guys are shooting threes now.
If y’all just gonna have three-point shooting contests, just say it!”A fair assessment from Sir Charles.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson was exceptional for the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, draining an impressive 12 three-point shots and a game-high 42 points en route to a convincing 141-114 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
The Warriors superstar added an eye-opening quote in his post-game press conference after the incredible evening, according to HoopsHype.
“As far as on the court, just to be like water is just to flow,” Thompson mused.
That book helped me so much during the time when I wasn’t playing basketball,” Thompson explained.
That book is incredible.”Press conference legend Klay Thompson: "As far as on the court, just to be like water is just to flow.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even during the Kevin Durant super years, there were two decidedly different Warriors teams: With and without Curry.
This after the Warriors finished off a win over Dallas in the game in which Curry was injured.
On Monday, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson led the way as the Warriors connected on 26 3-pointers, just one off the franchise record.
Curry and Thompson are the only players in history that have recorded multiple games with at least 12 3-pointers (they've each done it twice).
Poole and Thompson aren't going to play like this every night, obviously.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just like they did last week against the Thunder, the Warriors’ best players stepped up with several big-time performances, setting the tone in their critical first game without superstar point guard Stephen Curry.
Klay Thompson handled the bulk of the scoring in this one, finishing the night with 42 points and a season-high 12 made threes.
However, despite his amazing individual scoring night, Thompson gave all the credit to the team’s performance – specifically citing the Warriors’ 43 assists with only 16 turnovers.
Poole was in complete control of the game, balancing his 21 points scoring while getting his teammates involved for a career-high 12 assists.
"I thought that's the best game I've ever seen him play."
