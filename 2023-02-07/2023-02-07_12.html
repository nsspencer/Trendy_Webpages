     Ousmane Dieng sent down the NBA G-League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ousmane Dieng has responded to these NBA G-League stints well, improving after being with Kameron Woods and the OKC Blue each time.
The Oklahoma City Thunder have tried to balance NBA time with G-League time for the 11th overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.
The Oklahoma City Thunder have sent Ousmane Dieng back down to the NBA G-League to play with the OKC Blue; what does the team need to see in this stint?
In the NBA G-League, Dieng is averaging nearly 16 points, eight rebounds, four assists, a block, and almost a steal (0.7) per game while shooting 45 percent from the floor and 34 percent from deep.
In the NBA G-League, Ousmane Dieng has been challenged to play with more “offensive force,” just as 2022 second-round pick Jaylin Williams was in his stint with the Blue both Mark Daigneault and Kameron Woods told me this season.
