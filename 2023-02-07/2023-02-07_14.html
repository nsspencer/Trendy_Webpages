     Explainer: Bard vs ChatGPT: What do we know about Google's AI chatbot?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 7 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) are once again locked in a race to rule the internet zeitgeist after the Google owner launched "Bard" in answer to AI chatbot sensation ChatGPT.
The artificial intelligence service could change how consumers search for information or create content on command and free up time for white-collar workers.
The services that Google's Bard and ChatGPT would offer are similar.
Microsoft and Google plan to embed AI tools to bolster their search services Bing and Google Search, which account for a big chunk of revenue.
Bard draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT has access to data until 2021.

     Google Unveils Bard, Its ChatGPT Rival for AI-Powered Conversation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai tweeted Monday.
2/ Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models.
The power behind Bard is Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications, aka LaMDA.
AI technology already is all around us, helping in everything from flagging credit card fraud to translating our speech into text messages.
But large language models are used for other tasks, too, including stacking boxes and processing genetic data to hunt for new drugs.
