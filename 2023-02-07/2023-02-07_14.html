    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Director Peyton Reed Talks About Bringing MODOK To Live-ActionThe Marvel Universe is filled with strange and unusual characters.
And we're not just talking about your run of the mill weird variety like Deadpool, Spider-Ham, Leap-Frog, or the members of the Great Lakes Avengers.
Now utilizing a weaponized hoverchair and constantly concocting schemes for world domination, MODOK is a reviled villain ... and sometimes the butt of many jokes.
Naturally, it stands to reason that the architects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would want to introduce him at some point.
True Believers got a little taste on Hulu thanks to the short-lived animated series starring Patton Oswalt, but now filmmaker Peyton Reed has found a way to execute MODOK in live-action for "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," and he's beyond excited for this highly anticipated introduction.

     ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ First Reactions Are In
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel Studios kicked off Phase 5 this week with its premiere of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man trilogy, following 2015’s Ant-Man and 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp.
Peyton Reed, who’s back in the director’s chair for Quantumania, told Entertainment Weekly he hopes to bring the gravitas of Avengers films to the latest Ant-Man and the Wasp.
I want to be the big Avengers movie.”According to critics’ early reactions, it looks like Reed has hit the nail on the head.
Variety editor Jazz Tangcay “had an absolute blast” with the film, while Collider editor-in-chief Steven Weintraub called Quantumania a “strong start to Phase 5.” Some critics weren’t nearly as positive, with CNET’s Sean Keane saying the flick has “way too much going on.”Check out the first reactions to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania below.

     Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Post-Credit Count Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is almost ready to open up Phase 5 of the MCU and take fans on a new dive into the dangers of the Quantum Realm.
With the film being given the red carpet premiere treatment in Los Angeles on Monday, word has now been released about how many post-credit scenes the movie will have.
Like many other MCU movies, it seems that Quantumania will deliver two stingers at the end of the movie, one mid-credits and one post-credits for those willing to stick it out through several minutes of cast and crew names.

This clearly is something that wasn’t sustainable, and Phase 4 managed to drag over-hyped fan theories down a few notches.

     Summary: After a somewhat brief hiatus, Marvel is back in cinemas to kick off its Phase Five with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania has Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) in another adventure and paying one more visit to the Quantum Realm.
The Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania isn't without its critics, however.
Perhaps the most intriguing early reactions to the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are the numerous comparisons to Star Wars, which makes sense considering Peyton Reed's time within the galaxy far, far away.
