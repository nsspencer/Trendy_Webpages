     Summary: Watch : Big Time Rush Tease New MusicDon't expect Big Time Rush to have some small plans for the future.
"For the band, we have big dreams with music," Kendall exclusively shared with E!
Formed in 2009, Big Time Rush was originally a musical sitcom series that kicked off on Nickelodeon.
A film adaptation named Big Time Movie premiered in 2012 before the boy band went on hiatus in 2014.
But once the group returned in 2022 with new music and a sold-out tour, the guys realized their dreams were just getting started.
