     Penguins Grades: Team Saving Win? DeSmith &amp; PK Drive Comeback (+)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The headlines were written, the dirt was being shoveled, and the Pittsburgh Penguins’ poor fate seemed to be determined, if not well-earned.
Despite a 1-0 score after 40 minutes, the Penguins were clearly the lesser of two teams against the Colorado Avalanche.
The Penguins won 2-1 in OT at PPG Paints Arena, but how they got there is a drama-filled story complete with a surprise ending culminating with Kris Letang’s OT winner.
The sour and dour feelings of the pre-break Penguins were fermenting like a barrel of whiskey.
Another bad loss, and the Penguins’ season, or this roster, would be even closer to falling apart.

     Summary: Colorado Avalanche: 27-18-3 Pittsburgh Penguins: 24-16-9 Time: 5:00 p.m. MT Watch: Altitude 2, ATTSN-PIT, ESPN+ (Out of Market Only) Listen: Altitude Sports Radio FM 92.5, AM 950 Opponent’s Beat: Pensburgh, @pensburghAfter All-Star festivities that saw Cale Makar blow a tire in the fastest skater competition and the Avalanche trio nearly bring the Central Division back from an early deficit in the three-on-three tournament finale, Colorado gets something even more exciting: A little bit of health!
Bowen Byram is set to return to the lineup in Pittsburgh after three months nursing a lower-body injury, and once he shakes off the rust he should bring a needed mix of speed, skill, and reliable defense to a blueline that has been struggling to close out games.
Valeri Nichushkin will also be back in the lineup, bolstering the Avs forecheck and backcheck game as he always does and hopefully finding a way back on the scoresheet as he has been nearly a point-per-game player when healthy this season.
Of course, the Penguins will also be playing in this game.
We’ll see if that matters.

     Avalanche loses to Pittsburgh 2-1 in overtime loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 40 stellar minutes and 16 more breathless ones for the Avalanche, a bad bounce off Pavel Francouz’s pad brought the Penguins even with 3:38 remaining Tuesday night.
The Penguins went on to win 2-1 on Kris Letang’s overtime goal, handing the Avalanche (27-18-4) one of their most deflating losses of the season after they couldn’t convert a 4-on-3 power play.
But spoiling the highlight play was Pittsburgh netminder Casey DeSmith.
Makar returned to the Avalanche bench with about six minutes remaining and was back on the ice with four minutes left.
Bo Byram’s returnAfter missing 38 games, the Avalanche’s next blueline prodigy returned from a lower-body injury and logged 21 minutes.

     Avalanche vs. Penguins - NHL Game Recap - February 7, 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Penguins' persistence pays off as Kris Letang buries the game-winning goal in overtime vs. the Avalanche.
His wrist shot from the left circle 3:36 into overtime capped a frantic rally as the Penguins stunned the Colorado Avalanche 2-1 on Tuesday night.
The Avalanche controlled long stretches of regulation before Bryan Rust tied it with 3:38 remaining in the third period.
The same couldn't be said for the Penguins, who were dominated for long stretches by the younger, faster Avalanche despite coming off the same 10-day layoff.
Colorado couldn't extend the lead despite numerous opportunities, and the Penguins finally awoke in the third period.

     Summary: They’ve won seven of their last eight games as they claw their way back up into a playoff spot.
Then, the Pens will face the Islanders in Long Island before finally returning to PPG Paints a week from Saturday.
Sid + some Avs soaking up the sunshine ☀️ pic.twitter.com/0szUJA68iD — Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) February 2, 2023Hidden Stat: So far this season, Mikko Rantanen has a 6-0 record when shooting pucks at surfboards in order to send Sidney Crosby plunging into a dunk tank.
Monday practice saw Rickard Rakell return to Crosby’s side on the top line, while Bryan Rust swapped to Evgeni Malkin’s line.
Tristan Jarry and Jan Rutta have not yet returned to practicing with the team, so the Penguins will be starting their second- or third-string goaltender tonight.
