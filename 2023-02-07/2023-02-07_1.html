    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Others not only master their sport but also expand the possibilities — in competition and away from it — for generations to come.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did just that, including for LeBron James, who has laid claim to the N.B.A.
career scoring record that Abdul-Jabbar had held so tight for nearly 39 years.
It is easy to forget because he helped make it easier for others, like James, to trace his path.
Guided by the footsteps of Jackie Robinson and Bill Russell, Abdul-Jabbar pushed forward, stretching the limits of Black athlete identity.

     LeBron James breaks the NBA career scoring record, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn't until nearly nine months after Abdul-Jabbar wrested the record away from Chamberlain that LeBron James was born.
Over his career, James has shot 50.5% from the field and averaged 27.2 points per game.
Add Dirk Nowitzki and Wilt Chamberlain, and you have the only seven NBA players to score more than 30,000 points.
James is one of just seven NBA players, and the only non-point guard, to amass more than 10,000 career assists.
As he pursued Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record, James also recently joined the legendary Lakers center atop another NBA category, when James was selected to his 19th NBA All-Star team.

     LeBron James Breaks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA Points Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LeBron James entered the night’s game against Oklahoma City Thunder just 36 points away from passing Abdul-Jabbar historic record.
Abdul-Jabbar’s old record of 38,387 points stood for a remarkable 34 years (this record just comprises points during regular season games, not the playoffs).
In contrast, however, he’s broken Abdul-Jabbar’s record in just 1,409 games.
Beyond just breaking the NBA’s scoring record, James is really the first person to even come close to Abdul-Jabbar’s total.
Before him, the only player to really sniff the points record was Karl Malone, who was still short by 1,459 points when he retired in 2004 with 36,928.
