     Los Angeles Lakers fans hoping to see some LeBron James history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers fans wearing LeBron James jerseys posed for photos Tuesday in front of a statue of Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar outside Crypto.com Arena.
It was fitting considering James entered the Lakers’ game against the Oklahoma City Thunder needing just 36 points to break the NBA’s all-time scoring record of 38,387 points held by Abdul-Jabbar.
Now, in a Lakers jersey, he’s set to break a scoring record some considered unbreakable.
When he took the court for warm-ups, James sported a T-shirt that read "Built by Black History" along with his once-customary headband.
He also was courtside to watch on Tuesday as James pursued the hallowed record he's held for more than 30 years.

     Summary: Each time LeBron James touched the ball, fans raised their arms and rose to their feet.
AdvertisementNeeding 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar’s mark of 38,387 points, James knocked down the record-setting basket and held his arms wide as he jogged down the court.
As he walked toward center court, James pointed to the baseline next to the Lakers bench where Abdul-Jabbar was sitting.
Sports Say congratulations to LeBron on breaking the NBA scoring record In a career marked by greatness, LeBron James has reached the pinnacle — the most points of any player in NBA history, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
So Lisa kept track of James’ scoring beginning in December and projected last month that Feb. 7 against the Oklahoma City Thunder would be the best bet.

     LeBron cements place in NBA, Lakers pantheon with all-time scoring record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — Lakers fans were slow to warm to LeBron James when he came West in 2018.
Part of that was the shadow of Kobe Bryant — L.A. was his town, these were his fans, and LeBron felt like a mercenary by comparison.
Tuesday night, Lakers fans fully embraced LeBron, and he cemented his place in NBA history and the Lakers’ pantheon.
And it was a shot that forever cemented his legacy with West, Wilt, Shaq, Kobe, Magic and the pantheon of Lakers greats in the hearts of Lakers fans.
