     Summary: A player in Washington state wins the $747 million Powerball prizeEnlarge this image toggle caption Keith Srakocic/AP Keith Srakocic/APDES MOINES, Iowa — Someone in Washington state overcame steep odds Monday night to win an estimated $747 million Powerball jackpot.
Lottery officials said in a statement early Tuesday that a single ticket matched all six numbers and was worth $754.6 million.
Monday night's win was the first Powerball jackpot win since Nov. 19, 2022.
That strategy certainly has worked recently, as someone in Maine won a $1.35 billion Mega Millions prize in January and a California player hit a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot last November.
Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

     Summary: Just one ticket won the huge $754.6 million Powerball jackpot Monday night and it was sold in Washington state, but one ticket sold in Connecticut won $100,000.
The $100,000 winner in Connecticut matched four numbers and the Powerball and also had Powerplay, which increased the prize from $50,000 to $100,000.
It’s not clear where the ticket was sold.
One Powerball ticket sold in Texas won $2 million while three tickets sold in New York and two in Michigan won $1 million, according to a news release from Powerball.
The $754.6 million Powerball jackpot is the fifth highest Powerball jackpot.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Una persona en el estado de Washington ganó la lotería Powerball y se llevará 754,6 millones de dólares.
Los números ganadores del sorteo efectuado el lunes fueron 05, 11, 22, 23, 69 y el adicional Powerball 07.
Debido a que pasó tanto tiempo sin ganador, el premio se fue acumulando hasta convertirse en el noveno más grande en la historia de Estados Unidos.
El premio para el próximo Powerball, que tendrá lugar el miércoles, es de 20 millones de dólares, según el sitio web de la lotería.
La estrategia funcionó recientemente, pues una persona en Maine ganó el premio Mega Millions y se llevó 1.350 millones de dólares en enero y en diciembre en California una persona ganó el Powerball y se llevó un récord de 2.040 millones.

     Summary: Someone in Washington state has won the fifth-largest jackpot in Powerball history – $754.6m – and the ninth-largest US lottery prize ever, according to officials.
Eight days before that, a Powerball ticket holder in California won the $2.04bn jackpot that was the world’s largest ever lottery prize.
The winner of November’s record-breaking Powerball jackpot does not appear to have been publicly identified yet.
That prize was unrelated to a $1.334bn Mega Millions lottery jackpot won in September, which also drew heavy interest from the news media.
To win the Powerball jackpot, players must buy $2 tickets and match all five white balls as well as one red ball.

     What if nobody claims California’s $2.04B Powerball jackpot?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One lucky winner in Washington just scored a $747 million Powerball jackpot, but an even bigger winner in California is still out there.
The Powerball jackpot reached the world record-setting size in November after 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner (and a suspenseful drawing-night delay prompted by technical issues).
In California, as in most states, a lottery jackpot winner has a year to claim their prize.
If the Powerball jackpot were to go unclaimed, it would go from the largest U.S. lottery prize to the largest unclaimed U.S. lottery prize, a list the record-setting $1.337 billion Mega Millions jackpot hit in Illinois last summer nearly joined.
The $2.04 billion jackpot may also stand as the only Powerball jackpot to be hit on Election Day as drawings are held each Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.
