     Three Things to Know: Lakers vs Thunder 2-7-23
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (25-29) return from a five-game road trip to face OKC (25-28) for the first time this season.
Below are three things to know ahead of the matchup:THIRTY SIX TO GOAfter a 27-point night at New Orleans, LeBron James has only 36 points to score to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for 1st on the NBAâ€™s all-time scoring list.
Clearly, 36 points is well within reach for Tuesdayâ€™s game, but is it the most likely scenario?
This season, LeBron is averaging exactly 30.0 points per game, and has scored 36 points in eight of the 43 games heâ€™s played, or 18.6 percent of the time.
A miscommunication on defense by the Lakers allowed CJ McCollum an open short floater with 5.2 seconds remaining.
