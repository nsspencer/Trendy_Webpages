     LeBron sets NBA career scoring mark in Lakersâ€™ loss to OKC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James surpassed the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakersâ€™ bench.
Abdul-Jabbar then joined a clearly emotional James and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on the court after the historic basket.
And while James hit his mark, the Lakers took another discouraging loss.
James scored only two points in the fourth quarter, putting him atop the career scoring list with 38,390 points â€” three ahead of Abdul-Jabbar.
â€¦ One-time Lakers forward Mike Muscala scored 16 points.

     Los Angeles Lakers fans hoping to see some LeBron James history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers fans wearing LeBron James jerseys posed for photos Tuesday in front of a statue of Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar outside Crypto.com Arena.
It was fitting considering James entered the Lakersâ€™ game against the Oklahoma City Thunder needing just 36 points to break the NBAâ€™s all-time scoring record of 38,387 points held by Abdul-Jabbar.
Now, in a Lakers jersey, heâ€™s set to break a scoring record some considered unbreakable.
When he took the court for warm-ups, James sported a T-shirt that read "Built by Black History" along with his once-customary headband.
He also was courtside to watch on Tuesday as James pursued the hallowed record he's held for more than 30 years.

Below are three things to know ahead of the matchup:THIRTY SIX TO GOAfter a 27-point night at New Orleans, LeBron James has only 36 points to score to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for 1st on the NBAâ€™s all-time scoring list.
Clearly, 36 points is well within reach for Tuesdayâ€™s game, but is it the most likely scenario?
This season, LeBron is averaging exactly 30.0 points per game, and has scored 36 points in eight of the 43 games heâ€™s played, or 18.6 percent of the time.
A miscommunication on defense by the Lakers allowed CJ McCollum an open short floater with 5.2 seconds remaining.
