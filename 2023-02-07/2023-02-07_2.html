     Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Attend Lakers-Thunder as LeBron James Pursues Scoring Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Erica Denhoff/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesKareem Abdul-Jabbar is expected to attend Tuesday night's game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder, with LeBron James trailing Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record of 38,387 points by just 35 points.
Abdul-Jabbar is clearly rooting for James to surpass him, tweeting the following on LeBron's birthday in December:"I've been carrying the torch as record holder for 38 years," Abdul-Jabbar told CNN's Don Lemon in late January.
LeBron earned it, and I hope he carries it even longer than I did."
Soon enough, the NBA will have a new all-time scoring leader.
It would be a special moment if the torch was passed in Los Angeles—where both men have played for the Lakers—with Abdul-Jabbar in attendance.
