    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers fans wearing LeBron James jerseys posed for photos Tuesday in front of a statue of Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar outside Crypto.com Arena.
It was fitting considering James entered the Lakers’ game against the Oklahoma City Thunder needing just 36 points to break the NBA’s all-time scoring record of 38,387 points held by Abdul-Jabbar.
Now, in a Lakers jersey, he’s set to break a scoring record some considered unbreakable.
When he took the court for warm-ups, James sported a T-shirt that read "Built by Black History" along with his once-customary headband.
He also was courtside to watch on Tuesday as James pursued the hallowed record he's held for more than 30 years.

     Three Things to Know: Lakers vs Thunder 2-7-23

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (25-29) return from a five-game road trip to face OKC (25-28) for the first time this season.
Below are three things to know ahead of the matchup:THIRTY SIX TO GOAfter a 27-point night at New Orleans, LeBron James has only 36 points to score to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for 1st on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.
Clearly, 36 points is well within reach for Tuesday’s game, but is it the most likely scenario?
This season, LeBron is averaging exactly 30.0 points per game, and has scored 36 points in eight of the 43 games he’s played, or 18.6 percent of the time.
A miscommunication on defense by the Lakers allowed CJ McCollum an open short floater with 5.2 seconds remaining.
