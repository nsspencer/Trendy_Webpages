     Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in G.O.P. response, criticizes Biden agenda as ‘woke fantasies.’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas delivered a scorching admonition of President Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, casting him as the head of a failed administration hijacked by a “radical left” agenda that has delivered high gasoline prices and empty grocery shelves while teaching children to “hate one another on account of their race.”“The Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” Ms. Sanders said.
“Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”Ms. Sanders, who rose to national prominence as press secretary in the Trump White House, was elected to her first public office in November and sworn in just 28 days ago.
She was picked to deliver the Republican response by the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, both of whom described her as an avatar for the future of the Republican Party.

     Summary: Sanders says the choice in the U.S. is 'normal or crazy' in GOP response to BidenEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Drago/AP Al Drago/APArkansas' newly elected governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, delivered the Republican Party's response to President Biden's State of the Union address, telling Americans: "Biden and the Democrats have failed you."
She drew a sharp contrast between the two parties, especially with respect to what she called the "left-wing culture war."
"The dividing line in America is no longer between right and left — it's between normal or crazy," Sanders said in her rebuttal to President Biden's State of the Union address.
She held up former President Donald Trump's achievements as bringing "stability" to America before saying the Democrats "destroyed" that record.
But she said, "The America we love is in danger," echoing her line that now is the time for change and that President Biden and Democrats have failed.

     Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacks ‘left-wing culture war’ in SOTU response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of her first acts as governor, Sanders garnered national attention for a directive banning the term Latinx across the Arkansas government.
In her Tuesday response, Sanders similarly waded into culture war subjects that have animated conservatives in the Biden years, inveighing against “false idols” of the left and other conservative punching bags.
Huckabee also hit the president for his stewardship of the economy and the Biden administration’s handling of immigration policy.
“The dividing line in America is no longer between right or left; the choice is between normal or crazy,” she said.
Hutchinson has at times flirted with a presidential run as a conservative alternative to Trump, while Sanders has tamped down speculation that she is angling for a higher position.

     Sarah Huckabee Sanders will give the official GOP rebuttal to the State of the Union. It's quite the symbolic choice.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Huckabee Sanders will issue the Republican rebuttal to tonight’s State of the Union tonight—a symbolic choice that shows the power of former President Donald Trump’s continued influence over the GOP, even after he basically ensured the party’s failures in last year’s midterm elections.
As one of the former president’s press secretaries, Sanders enjoys the dubious distinction of not just surviving the Trump White House without eliciting the former president’s wrath (a rarity), but thriving afterward.
AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementSanders also happens to be the daughter of former Arkansas governor (and failed presidential candidate) Mike Huckabee, and is, at 40, the youngest governor in the country.
That makes her a relatively youthful choice for the State of the Union rebuttal, a contrast to President Joe Biden, many members of the House and Senate, and Trump himself.

     Summary: Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave a combative speech Tuesday evening in response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, drawing a sharp contrast with Biden as she delivered a series of blistering criticisms of the president.
Sanders called Biden “unfit to serve as commander in chief,” said his “weakness puts our nation and the world at risk” and described the political landscape in dire terms.
Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, served as governor of the state from 1996 to 2007.
Sanders also used the speech to highlight her service in the Trump administration and ties to the former president.
Everyone, including President Biden, should listen carefully.”This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.
