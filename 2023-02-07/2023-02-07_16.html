     Lawyers release photos of Gabby Petito's injuries, say police ignored abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The law firm representing Gabby Petito's family has released photos that show her face bloodied, claiming officers should've taken action before her murder.
Petito had been on a cross-country trip with Laundrie and was reported missing by her family on Sept. 11, 2021.
The attorney representing the Petito family in the complaint said that during the stop, she attempted to tell the Moab Police officers about the injury, but the assault and injury were ignored.
"Our daughter, Gabby, died as a result of intimate partner violence that could have and should have been identified by law enforcement using the lethality assessment," Petito's mother, Nichole Schmidt, said in a statement.
"We believe that if the lethality assessment had been properly used in her situation, together with the recommended support and resources, Gabby would still be alive today.“

     New photo of Gabby Petito released as part of lawsuit against Moab police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MOAB, Utah — More than three months after the family of Gabby Petito filed a $50 million lawsuit against the Moab Police Department, lawyers released a photo of Gabby that they claim shows she was "violently assaulted."
The lawsuit, officially filed in November, claims that if officers had been properly trained, Gabby Petito would still be alive.
In response to the lawsuit, the City of Moab stated that while the murder of Gabby was a "terrible tragedy," officers were not responsible.
Lawyers for the Petito family released the photo that they claim shows Gabby was "violently assaulted and was likely strangled and/or suffocated prior to her interaction with Moab Police."
An investigation in the months after Petito's murder reported that officers made "several unintentional mistakes" in failing to cite Gabby Petito for domestic violence.

The image was described in a lawsuit filed by the family against the Moab City Police Department in Utah district court in November.
This photo of Gabby Petito showing facial injuries was released by the law office representing her family in a suit against the Moab City Police Department.

     Newly released photo appears to show Gabby Petito documenting her injuries before talking to Moab police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Petito family attorneys) A selfie that Gabby Petito took on Aug. 12, 2021, documents what she later described as injuries from a domestic violence assault by her fiancè.
Domestic violence experts, though, say that based on the picture, Petito’s injuries were more serious than police seemed to realize.
They believe Petito was documenting that she was a victim of domestic violence.
The attorneys in the case say Petito never sent the photo to anyone.
In recent years, Strack said, she has seen more victims documenting domestic violence, especially with phones.
