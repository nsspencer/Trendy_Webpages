Klay Thompson handled the bulk of the scoring in this one, finishing the night with 42 points and a season-high 12 made threes.
However, despite his amazing individual scoring night, Thompson gave all the credit to the team‚Äôs performance ‚Äì specifically citing the Warriors‚Äô 43 assists with only 16 turnovers.
Poole was in complete control of the game, balancing his 21 points scoring while getting his teammates involved for a career-high 12 assists.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even during the Kevin Durant super years, there were two decidedly different Warriors teams: With and without Curry.
This after the Warriors finished off a win over Dallas in the game in which Curry was injured.
On Monday, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson led the way as the Warriors connected on 26 3-pointers, just one off the franchise record.
Curry and Thompson are the only players in history that have recorded multiple games with at least 12 3-pointers (they've each done it twice).
Poole and Thompson aren't going to play like this every night, obviously.
