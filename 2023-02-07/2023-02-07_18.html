     Summary: With Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling continuing to openly spout her anti-trans views online, many fans are taking a stance against the release and maintaining a boycott.
“I read my most recent royalty cheques and find the pain goes away pretty quickly,” she wrote.
I read my most recent royalty cheques and find the pain goes away pretty quickly.
Those leaning towards buying Hogwarts Legacy will perhaps take this as a sign that the boycotts are ineffectual so they might as well enjoy the game.
Ironically, Rowling’s own stories taught us that we should stand by our convictions, even in the face of unrepentant individuals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hogwarts Legacy is an upcoming action role-playing game set in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
Does J.K. Rowling make money from Harry Potter Legacy?
Rowling gets royalties from anything that makes use of the Harry Potter IP, and obviously Hogwarts Legacy is steeped in it.
Also, anything that popularizes the world of Harry Potter can only boost sales of other Harry Potter products like the books, movies and theme parks.
So yes, J.K. Rowling will get money from sales of Hogwarts Legacy, to put it simply.

     Summary: JK Rowling's shadow has always loomed over Hogwarts Legacy.
This is the case of Syrona Ryan.
Syrona Ryan is the keeper of the Three Broomsticks, the iconic inn and tavern in Hogsmeade, the small town next to Hogwarts that we were introduced to in Prisoner of Azkaban.
At that point, Syrona assures us that they knew each other before "her transition," clarifying that when she saw herself with that other person years later, even though she had changed, she recognized them instantly.
Controversies aside, Hogwarts Legacy seems to have lived up to the high expectations placed upon it.
