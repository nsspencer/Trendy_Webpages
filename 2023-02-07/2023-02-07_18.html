    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nintendo will broadcast a new Nintendo Direct presentation on Wednesday, Feb. 8, promising new details on upcoming Switch games.
February’s Nintendo Direct will stream live at 5 p.m. EST/2 p.m. PST, on the company’s YouTube channel.
Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct showcase will run “roughly” 40 minutes, Nintendo said, and will focus on upcoming games coming to Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2023.
Also on Nintendo’s slate, but still undated, is Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, a remake of two Game Boy Advance-era Advance Wars games.
Of course, Nintendo also has some other big plans for 2023, including the opening of the Super Nintendo Land theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood on Feb. 17, and the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on April 7.

     Get Ready For A Surprise 40 Minute Nintendo Direct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nintendo dropped the news suddenly this morning: it will host its next Nintendo Direct livestream at 5 p.m.
The livestream will feature “roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023,” it said on Twitter.
Nintendo Directs are concise showcases of gameplay, trailers for new games, and fresh-out-the-oven release dates.
?” the Opera GX Twitter said desperately (and jokingly), because Nintendo posted a link to its livestream.
And you can watch The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom livestream—I mean, the Nintendo Direct livestream—straight from the Nintendo website, or on the company’s Twitch channel, again, tomorrow, February 8, at 5 p.m.
