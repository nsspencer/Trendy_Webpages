     Summary: Klay Thompson was exceptional for the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, draining an impressive 12 three-point shots and a game-high 42 points en route to a convincing 141-114 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
The Warriors superstar added an eye-opening quote in his post-game press conference after the incredible evening, according to HoopsHype.
‚ÄúAs far as on the court, just to be like water is just to flow,‚Äù Thompson mused.
That book helped me so much during the time when I wasn‚Äôt playing basketball,‚Äù Thompson explained.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors shooting guard, Klay Thompson, hit 12 three-pointers in his team's 141-114 thrashing of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.
"Oh man, I was campaigning for it, but we got a quick turnaround on Wednesday and I don't think the basketball gods like when you chase records," Thompson said after the game.
Meanwhile, this was the eighth game that Thompson makes more than 10 three-pointers throughout his career.
"It was a beautiful game to watch him play," Draymond Green said of Thompson according to the Associated Press.
Only Curry, Kobe Bryant, Zach LaVine and Donyell Marshall have managed to score 12 three-pointers in a game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just like they did last week against the Thunder, the Warriors‚Äô best players stepped up with several big-time performances, setting the tone in their critical first game without superstar point guard Stephen Curry.
Klay Thompson handled the bulk of the scoring in this one, finishing the night with 42 points and a season-high 12 made threes.
However, despite his amazing individual scoring night, Thompson gave all the credit to the team‚Äôs performance ‚Äì specifically citing the Warriors‚Äô 43 assists with only 16 turnovers.
Poole was in complete control of the game, balancing his 21 points scoring while getting his teammates involved for a career-high 12 assists.
"I thought that's the best game I've ever seen him play."

     Warriors' Klay Thompson hits 12 3-pointers in 42-point effort vs. OKC, but a zero in his box score stands out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even during the Kevin Durant super years, there were two decidedly different Warriors teams: With and without Curry.
This after the Warriors finished off a win over Dallas in the game in which Curry was injured.
On Monday, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson led the way as the Warriors connected on 26 3-pointers, just one off the franchise record.
Curry and Thompson are the only players in history that have recorded multiple games with at least 12 3-pointers (they've each done it twice).
Poole and Thompson aren't going to play like this every night, obviously.
