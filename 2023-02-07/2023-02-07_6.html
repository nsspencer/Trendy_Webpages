     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks have won eight games in a row and are within one game of the NBA’s best record.
One game after recording yet another triple-double, Giannis Antetokounmpo finished two assists shy of another one.
Three Bucks players finished the night with 20 or more points as a complete team effort was too much for the short-handed Portland Trailblazers to handle.

     Bucks beat Trail Blazers 127-108 for 8th straight win

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Brook Lopez scored 27 points and the Milwaukee Bucks stretched their winning streak to eight games with a 127-108 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.
Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 13 rebounds as the Bucks led the whole way, pushing their advantage to 26 in the second half.
Lillard averaged 38.3 points and 6.8 assists last week for his second straight POTW honor, while Antetokounmpo averaged 41 points and 17.3 rebounds.
“They made some adjustments to their defense this year, to be honest with you,” Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said.
(Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer) has done a really good job.

     Summary: BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - It’s been one month since Bismarck’s Borrowed Bucks closed its doors quite suddenly, and many started to notice the decorations on the walls have been disappearing.
As the lights go down for the last time…“It was just time to be done.”...the party officially ended at Bismarck’s Borrowed Bucks.
Those at Bucks know the good times will be missed, and they wanted to allow everyone to take a final piece of the memories home with them.
Girard has held auctions for both the Sioux Falls and Fargo Borrowed Bucks locations and says they are always a big hit.
“I mean, everybody has memories of Bucks, good or bad, everyone’s got memories of Bucks,” said Girard.

     Bucks' Jrue Holiday: Propels Milwaukee in blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Holiday finished with 20 points (9-20 FG, 2-8 3Pt), eight assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes during Monday's 127-108 win over Portland.
With Giannis Antetokounmpo battling foul trouble early, Holiday and Brook Lopez (27 points) stepped up to help the streaking Bucks roll to an eighth consecutive win.
Due in large part to Antetokounmpo averaging 42.8 points on a whopping 27.4 field-goal and 13.4 free-throw attempts over the previous five games, Holiday and other members of the Bucks' supporting cast had seen their usage tail off of late, so the point guard's strong showing Monday was a welcome sight for fantasy managers who had been disappointed by his recent returns.

     Bucks’ Brook Lopez scores big, but also does the little things in win over Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PORTLAND — On the first play of Monday’s game against the Trail Blazers, Portland center Drew Eubanks knew what to expect.
While Brook Lopez started his career as one of the league’s most dangerous post scorers, times have changed and Lopez adapted his game to fit better with Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo.
When the Bucks’ play broke down because of the Blazers’ surprise zone, the Bucks’ seven-footer decided to make something happen and aggressively drove to the rim, a new wrinkle to his game in his 15th NBA season.
It’s just crazy how things work, that tonight was the night he got to 15,000 points, but he’s so much more than 15,000 points.
And while the postgame questions focused on what Lopez has already done, the 15-year NBA veteran looked toward the future.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drew Bledsoe wasn’t a stranger to a recharge in relevancy over the course of the Tom Brady era in New England.
Eric Bledsoe asked if he took his matchup with Rozier personally, to which the former pled ignorance and pretended he didn’t know who the Celtics sparkplug was.
After Milwaukee evened the series with two straight wins, Rozier and Eric Bledsoe engaged in a shoving match in Game 5.
Boston eventually won that contest and Rozier maintained Drew Bledsoe’s role in the saga by showing love to the former Patriots signal-caller after the Celtics took a series lead.
Bledsoe even held a media availability that night in Boston, a rarity for even the most well-known spectators.

     Milwaukee vs. Portland: Everything Coming Up Roses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Milwaukee is often the bigger team in any game they play, but the size difference in this one was stark.
Jerami Grant (6’8”) has played a fair amount of center lately, but against a massive Milwaukee team the deck was stacked against the home team tonight.
With the aforementioned size advantage in their favor, Portland’s bevy of talented guards put the Bucks’ backcourt stoppers on display.
The offense will get the credit, but the defense blew this game open in the third quarter.
The trade deadline is next week, and Jordan Nwora didn’t play in any meaningful minutes during this game.

     Summary: The game is tied with under a minute remaining before Jrue Holiday puts on his Superman costume for Halloween and slams the phone booth door on the upstarts.
Holiday Hand OffsIf Lopez and Antetokounmpo are the respective towers upon which the defense and offense are built, Holiday is the shadow cast by each.
When Lopez and Antetokounmpo aren’t on the floor to ensure the structural integrity of Milwaukee’s approach, Holiday becomes the determining factor.
Holiday SwitchesOn the offensive end when Antetokounmpo sits, Holiday becomes a tier-one superstar.
And Holiday’s scoring per 100 possessions skyrockets, while his efficiency doesn’t drop at all.
