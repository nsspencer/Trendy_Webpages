     Summary: The team made three-point shooting the norm, and Sir Charles Barkley isn’t happy about it.
To the point, where former big men like Charles Barkley believe that the game has become awful.
I don’t mind guys shooting threes but your big guys are shooting threes now.
If y’all just gonna have three-point shooting contests, just say it!”A fair assessment from Sir Charles.

     Warriors News: Klay Thompson credits team effort for big scoring night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just like they did last week against the Thunder, the Warriors’ best players stepped up with several big-time performances, setting the tone in their critical first game without superstar point guard Stephen Curry.
Klay Thompson handled the bulk of the scoring in this one, finishing the night with 42 points and a season-high 12 made threes.
However, despite his amazing individual scoring night, Thompson gave all the credit to the team’s performance – specifically citing the Warriors’ 43 assists with only 16 turnovers.
Poole was in complete control of the game, balancing his 21 points scoring while getting his teammates involved for a career-high 12 assists.
"I thought that's the best game I've ever seen him play."

     Warriors' Klay Thompson hits 12 3-pointers in 42-point effort vs. OKC, but a zero in his box score stands out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even during the Kevin Durant super years, there were two decidedly different Warriors teams: With and without Curry.
This after the Warriors finished off a win over Dallas in the game in which Curry was injured.
On Monday, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson led the way as the Warriors connected on 26 3-pointers, just one off the franchise record.
Curry and Thompson are the only players in history that have recorded multiple games with at least 12 3-pointers (they've each done it twice).
Poole and Thompson aren't going to play like this every night, obviously.
