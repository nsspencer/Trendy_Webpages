    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:57)Wrexham's fairytale FA Cup run was finally ended by Sheffield United, thanks to two stoppage-time goals that gave the Championship side a 3-1 victory over their non-league opponents in Tuesday's FA Cup fourth-round replay at Bramall Lane.
Paul Mullin canceled out Anel Ahmedhodzic's opener for Sheffield United in the second half and had a chance to put Wrexham ahead with a second penalty but saw his effort saved by Adam Davies.
While Wrexham are left to focus on their bid to return to the Football League, Sheffield United face a fifth-round matchup at home to Premier League giants Tottenham.
As expected after taking the tie back home, Sheffield United largely controlled proceedings from the off.
Robert Lainton in the Wrexham goal was equal to everything the hosts threw at him in the opening half, however.

     Summary: Peeeep peeeep peeeep!
What a marvellous cup tie that was.
Led by the magnificent Paul Mullin, Wrexham had United on the ropes in the game's decisive stages, and would have led had Adam Davies not saved Mullin's second spot-kick.
That miss was the turning point; thereafter, it was the home team that looked likelier to grab a late winner, and so it proved.
Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham are out of the FA Cup, but on the evidence of this tie, one suspects we'll be seeing them back in the Football League soon.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wrexham’s FA Cup adventure came to an end in agonising fashion after Sheffield United scored twice in injury-time to seal a 3-1 fourth-round replay win.
Paul Mullin scored one penalty and saw another saved as the fifth-tier National League side fought back gamely after Anel Ahmedhodzic’s opener.
But Billy Sharp seized on a defensive mistake in the 94th minute and Sander Berge added a third moments later to end Wrexham’s run and spare the Championship promotion-chasers’ blushes.
Sheffield United will play Tottenham Hotspur at home in the fifth round on March 1.
