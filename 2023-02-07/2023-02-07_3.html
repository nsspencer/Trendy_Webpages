     Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Attend Lakers-Thunder as LeBron James Pursues Scoring Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Erica Denhoff/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesKareem Abdul-Jabbar is expected to attend Tuesday night's game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder, with LeBron James trailing Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record of 38,387 points by just 35 points.
Abdul-Jabbar is clearly rooting for James to surpass him, tweeting the following on LeBron's birthday in December:"I've been carrying the torch as record holder for 38 years," Abdul-Jabbar told CNN's Don Lemon in late January.
LeBron earned it, and I hope he carries it even longer than I did."
Soon enough, the NBA will have a new all-time scoring leader.
It would be a special moment if the torch was passed in Los Angeles—where both men have played for the Lakers—with Abdul-Jabbar in attendance.

     Summary: LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar don't have a good relationship, that's a known fact, in fact, it's more accurate to say they don't have a relationship.
That doesn't mean that when the Los Angeles Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder are facing off this Tuesday at Crypto.com Arena the presence of the inventor of the Sky-Hook is not important to the "King".
LeBron James' mother present at Crypto.com ArenaLeBron James practices Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook as he takes on all-time record @michaelcorvoNBAThe Akron, Ohio native started Tuesday night 36 points shy of breaking the mark of 38,387 total points scored in regular season in the NBA held by the legendary former Milwaukee Bucks and Lakers center himself.
Therefore, Kareem's presence was a question mark in the first real chance that the scepter was handed out.
It was ESPN's Dave McMenamin who first confirmed the presence of Abdul-Jabbar, who won five of his six NBA championships as Los Angeles' tall man.
