     Bucks' Jrue Holiday: Propels Milwaukee in blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Holiday finished with 20 points (9-20 FG, 2-8 3Pt), eight assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes during Monday's 127-108 win over Portland.
With Giannis Antetokounmpo battling foul trouble early, Holiday and Brook Lopez (27 points) stepped up to help the streaking Bucks roll to an eighth consecutive win.
Due in large part to Antetokounmpo averaging 42.8 points on a whopping 27.4 field-goal and 13.4 free-throw attempts over the previous five games, Holiday and other members of the Bucks' supporting cast had seen their usage tail off of late, so the point guard's strong showing Monday was a welcome sight for fantasy managers who had been disappointed by his recent returns.

     How Drew Bledsoe Was Bizarrely Roped Into Celtics-Bucks Rivalry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drew Bledsoe wasn’t a stranger to a recharge in relevancy over the course of the Tom Brady era in New England.
Eric Bledsoe asked if he took his matchup with Rozier personally, to which the former pled ignorance and pretended he didn’t know who the Celtics sparkplug was.
After Milwaukee evened the series with two straight wins, Rozier and Eric Bledsoe engaged in a shoving match in Game 5.
Boston eventually won that contest and Rozier maintained Drew Bledsoe’s role in the saga by showing love to the former Patriots signal-caller after the Celtics took a series lead.
Bledsoe even held a media availability that night in Boston, a rarity for even the most well-known spectators.

     Just how underrated is Jrue Holiday?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The game is tied with under a minute remaining before Jrue Holiday puts on his Superman costume for Halloween and slams the phone booth door on the upstarts.
Holiday Hand OffsIf Lopez and Antetokounmpo are the respective towers upon which the defense and offense are built, Holiday is the shadow cast by each.
When Lopez and Antetokounmpo aren’t on the floor to ensure the structural integrity of Milwaukee’s approach, Holiday becomes the determining factor.
Holiday SwitchesOn the offensive end when Antetokounmpo sits, Holiday becomes a tier-one superstar.
And Holiday’s scoring per 100 possessions skyrockets, while his efficiency doesn’t drop at all.
