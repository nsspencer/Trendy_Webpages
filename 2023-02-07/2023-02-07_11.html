Later, Love nailed back-to-back 3-pointers from straight on, as the Tar Heels got within 85-78 with 45.8 seconds left.

     UNC basketball’s frustration continues with tough ACC road loss at Wake Forest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coach Hubert Davis, who said he wanted to keep that conversation private, wasn’t the only one who addressed the team.
There was Caleb Love, throwing a pass to no man’s land that just bounced out of bounds for a turnover.
But with a chance to make it a two possession game, Davis also misfired on a 3-pointer.
That they competed for a stretch to close out the game was of no solace for coach Hubert Davis.
“We have to find a way to fix, to get better, to regroup, to get stronger, to continue for the rest of the season,” Davis said.

     Summary: With less than a month remaining in the regular season, the North Carolina men’s basketball team is running out of time to find its rhythm.
On Tuesday, UNC will head to Winston-Salem to square off against Wake Forest.
The Tar Heels beat the Demon Deacons 88-79 in early January, but will face a series of challenges as they head into their upcoming contest.
While the Tar Heels have recently struggled to contain lead guards, minimizing Wake Forest's backcourt production will be critical if the game comes down to the wire.
The Tar Heels will need to earn a few signature victories to boost their postseason resume, and Tuesday should provide an ample opportunity to get started.
