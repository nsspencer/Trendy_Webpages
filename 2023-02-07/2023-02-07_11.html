    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Director Peyton Reed Talks About Bringing MODOK To Live-ActionThe Marvel Universe is filled with strange and unusual characters.
And we're not just talking about your run of the mill weird variety like Deadpool, Spider-Ham, Leap-Frog, or the members of the Great Lakes Avengers.
Now utilizing a weaponized hoverchair and constantly concocting schemes for world domination, MODOK is a reviled villain ... and sometimes the butt of many jokes.
Naturally, it stands to reason that the architects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would want to introduce him at some point.
True Believers got a little taste on Hulu thanks to the short-lived animated series starring Patton Oswalt, but now filmmaker Peyton Reed has found a way to execute MODOK in live-action for "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," and he's beyond excited for this highly anticipated introduction.

     ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ First Reactions Are In
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel Studios kicked off Phase 5 this week with its premiere of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man trilogy, following 2015’s Ant-Man and 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp.
Peyton Reed, who’s back in the director’s chair for Quantumania, told Entertainment Weekly he hopes to bring the gravitas of Avengers films to the latest Ant-Man and the Wasp.
I want to be the big Avengers movie.”According to critics’ early reactions, it looks like Reed has hit the nail on the head.
Variety editor Jazz Tangcay “had an absolute blast” with the film, while Collider editor-in-chief Steven Weintraub called Quantumania a “strong start to Phase 5.” Some critics weren’t nearly as positive, with CNET’s Sean Keane saying the flick has “way too much going on.”Check out the first reactions to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania below.

     First Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Reactions Pour In
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And right here is where you start paying: in sweat 2023 theater tickets and Disney+ subscription fees.
With a divisive Phase 4 of the MCU wrapped and shipped, it’s almost time to clap our eyes on the first of Marvel Studios’ Phase 5 entries: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Where both 2015’s Ant-Man and 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp were fun, family-friendly capers that Marvel was happy to churn out despite their relatively low box office payoff, Ant-Man 3 has the Quantum Realm on its shoulders as it kicks off a serious and deadly new dynasty.
It’s also handling the job of properly introducing Phase 5 and 6’s big bad: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).
The journey will indeed feature Kang’s first appearance in the MCU, but we’ve already met one of his Variants in Loki.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is almost ready to open up Phase 5 of the MCU and take fans on a new dive into the dangers of the Quantum Realm.
With the film being given the red carpet premiere treatment in Los Angeles on Monday, word has now been released about how many post-credit scenes the movie will have.
Like many other MCU movies, it seems that Quantumania will deliver two stingers at the end of the movie, one mid-credits and one post-credits for those willing to stick it out through several minutes of cast and crew names.

This clearly is something that wasn’t sustainable, and Phase 4 managed to drag over-hyped fan theories down a few notches.
