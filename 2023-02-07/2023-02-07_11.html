     RUMOR: Bucks showing interest in former MVP ahead of trade deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks are not resting on their laurels right now.
NBA insider Marc Stein reports that former league MVP Derrick Rose could be heading to Milwaukee before the NBA trade deadline.
The Bucks have reportedly “expressed trade interest” in the 34-year-old veteran, who has lost his place in the Knicks rotation.
Rose is having a forgettable year thus far after he was put in the dog house by head coach Tom Thibodeau.
Given his extended absence, Rose’s fitness would be a major concern for the Bucks should they decide to bring him to Milwaukee.

     Bucks' Jrue Holiday: Propels Milwaukee in blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Holiday finished with 20 points (9-20 FG, 2-8 3Pt), eight assists and four rebounds in 32 minutes during Monday's 127-108 win over Portland.
With Giannis Antetokounmpo battling foul trouble early, Holiday and Brook Lopez (27 points) stepped up to help the streaking Bucks roll to an eighth consecutive win.
Due in large part to Antetokounmpo averaging 42.8 points on a whopping 27.4 field-goal and 13.4 free-throw attempts over the previous five games, Holiday and other members of the Bucks' supporting cast had seen their usage tail off of late, so the point guard's strong showing Monday was a welcome sight for fantasy managers who had been disappointed by his recent returns.

     Bucks interested in Derrick Rose
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Knicks could keep Rose through the end of the season and use his contract structure to their advantage.
One concept the team has floated, according to league sources, is the possibility of hanging onto Rose just in case a star trade arises heading into the 2023 NBA Draft, which comes before the Knicks have to decide on Rose’s $15.6 million team option for 2023-24.
If a player on a large salary does become available on draft night, the Knicks could pick up Rose’s option and pair him with Fournier to send out $34.5 million in expiring money.

     Summary: Drew Bledsoe wasn’t a stranger to a recharge in relevancy over the course of the Tom Brady era in New England.
Eric Bledsoe asked if he took his matchup with Rozier personally, to which the former pled ignorance and pretended he didn’t know who the Celtics sparkplug was.
After Milwaukee evened the series with two straight wins, Rozier and Eric Bledsoe engaged in a shoving match in Game 5.
Boston eventually won that contest and Rozier maintained Drew Bledsoe’s role in the saga by showing love to the former Patriots signal-caller after the Celtics took a series lead.
Bledsoe even held a media availability that night in Boston, a rarity for even the most well-known spectators.

Holiday Hand OffsIf Lopez and Antetokounmpo are the respective towers upon which the defense and offense are built, Holiday is the shadow cast by each.
When Lopez and Antetokounmpo aren’t on the floor to ensure the structural integrity of Milwaukee’s approach, Holiday becomes the determining factor.
Holiday SwitchesOn the offensive end when Antetokounmpo sits, Holiday becomes a tier-one superstar.
And Holiday’s scoring per 100 possessions skyrockets, while his efficiency doesn’t drop at all.
