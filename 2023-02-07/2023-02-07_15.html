     Biden Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to become head of NHL players union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh listens as U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event in the Rose Garden of the White House September 15, 2022 in Washington, DC.
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will leave his post in the Biden administration to become head of the NHL players' union, sources confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday.
His planned departure to become executive director of the National Hockey League's Players Association was first reported by The Daily Faceoff, a hockey news site.
The Daily Faceoff reported that Walsh was presented last Friday to the executive board of the National Hockey League Players' Association as the top choice to replace Don Fehr as executive director.
Walsh, who is the son of Irish immigrants, at the age of 21 joined the Laborers Union Local in Boston after dropping out of college.

     Marty Walsh to depart from Biden Cabinet for job atop hockey players’ union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That law, AB 5, established a new three-part test that redefined many of the state’s gig workers as employees.
The latter carries significant ramifications for gig work companies, whose profit models are dependent on how they qualify their workforce.
Given Republican control of the House, Walsh would have faced significant congressional oversight from newly installed House Education and Workforce Chair Virginia Foxx.
“The American people deserve to know that Secretary Walsh met his ethics obligations while searching for employment outside of the federal government,” Foxx wrote.
By taking the players’ association gig, Walsh is now in line for a massive pay bump.

     Marty Walsh, U.S. Secretary of Labor, to join NHLPA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh will become the new executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association, sources told ESPN on Tuesday.
Walsh, 55, succeeds Donald Fehr, who led the NHLPA from 2010 and negotiated on the players' behalf through two collective bargaining agreements with NHL owners.
Before joining the Biden administration, Walsh had a labor background, having led the Building and Construction Trades Council in Boston.
Sources told ESPN that there was an appetite from the players to have someone who hadn't been involved in hockey labor talks to bring fresh eyes to the landscape.
While Walsh doesn't have ties to the hockey labor movement, he does have ties to NHL ownership.

     Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to Exit Biden Administration (2)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh is leaving the Biden administration, according to people familiar with the matter.
His exit will cost Biden not only a major ally to organized labor, but one of his top campaigners.
In 2022 alone, Walsh traveled to 39 states to meet with workers and talk about the Biden administration’s agenda.
“Marty was the first labor secretary from—and of—the union movement,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement.
When Walsh will officially step down from his position as Secretary has not yet been announced.

     Labor Secretary Marty Walsh expected to leave Biden administration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is expected to depart the Biden administration soon, according to two people familiar with the matter, marking the first Cabinet secretary departure of President Joe Biden’s presidency.
His departure isn’t expected to be announced until after Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.
Since becoming labor secretary, Walsh says he’s had conversations with different federal agencies about recovery-related programs modeled after his work as mayor.
When Walsh won Boston’s mayoral race in 2013, the then-vice president called Walsh to congratulate him (but first spoke with the wrong Marty Walsh).
Walsh was also a rumored potential Labor pick in 2016 had Hillary Clinton won the presidency.
