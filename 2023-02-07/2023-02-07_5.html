     Isiah Thomas not joining Phoenix Suns under Mat Ishbia despite report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mat Ishbia will not be giving former New York Knicks president of basketball operations Isiah Thomas a role in the Suns’ front office, a spokesperson for Ishbia confirmed to Arizona Sports’ Kellan Olson on Tuesday.
This follows a report from TNT’s Chris Haynes that stated Ishbia intended to give Thomas a prominent role in Phoenix.
A jury ruled in favor of her and that she was entitled to $11.6 million from Madison Square Garden and Knicks owner James Dolan.
Thomas said back in 2021 he was close with Ishbia and that the new Suns owner has helped advise him in the business space.
Ishbia’s transaction of the Suns, valuing the franchise at $4 billion, was approved and finalized by the NBA on Tuesday.

     Isiah Thomas and Phoenix Suns' new owner: Here's what we know about Hall of Famer's connection to Mat Ishbia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New owner of the Phoenix Suns, Mat Ishbia, was recently given complete control of the team after buying both the Suns and WNBA's Mercury from Robert Sarver.
The timing couldn't be more ideal for the Suns, with just two days to go before the trade deadline, allowing the new team owner to be involved in the process.
According to Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes, Ishbia plans on bringing in Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas to have a "prominent role" in the front office.
Knicks team owner James Dolan and Madison Square Garden were responsible for paying the settlement, while Thomas was not found personally liable.
Thomas was replaced by Donnie Walsh as team president in 2008, and by that time he had been the Knicks head coach from 2006-2008.
