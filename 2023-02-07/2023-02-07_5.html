     LeBron James Sets NBA Career Scoring Mark in Lakers 133-130 Loss to OKC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James surpassed the mark held since April 1984 by Abdul-Jabbar, who watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakers' bench.
Abdul-Jabbar then joined a clearly emotional James and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on the court after the historic basket.
And while James hit his mark, the Lakers took another discouraging loss.
James scored only two points in the fourth quarter, putting him atop the career scoring list with 38,339 points.
The young Thunder appeared to feed off the energy created by James' momentous night, even if they couldn't guard him much.
