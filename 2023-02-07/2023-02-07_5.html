     Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacks ‘left-wing culture war’ in SOTU response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of her first acts as governor, Sanders garnered national attention for a directive banning the term Latinx across the Arkansas government.
In her Tuesday response, Sanders similarly waded into culture war subjects that have animated conservatives in the Biden years, inveighing against “false idols” of the left and other conservative punching bags.
Huckabee also hit the president for his stewardship of the economy and the Biden administration’s handling of immigration policy.
“The dividing line in America is no longer between right or left; the choice is between normal or crazy,” she said.
Hutchinson has at times flirted with a presidential run as a conservative alternative to Trump, while Sanders has tamped down speculation that she is angling for a higher position.

     Summary: Huckabee Sanders (R) said the Democrats had failed the public in her official Republican response to the State of the Union address.
Sanders sought to contrast herself, the youngest governor in the nation, with Biden, an octogenarian.
“I’ll be the first to admit President Biden and I don’t have a lot in common.
“At 40, I’m the youngest governor in the country, and at 80 he’s the oldest president in American history.
“While President Biden keeps repeating old mistakes and failing Americans, a rising generation of Republican Governors are fighting for families, advancing new solutions, and winning.

“The youngest governor in America, Sarah is fighting on behalf of parents, small businesses, and ordinary taxpayers.
