Ms Sinema wore a striking yellow dress to the event and was photographed joking with Sen Mitt Romney and standing to applaud a line from President Joe Biden.
The speech was Ms Sinema‚Äôs first State of the Union since leaving the Democratic Party at the start of the year.
Republicans have courted Ms Sinema, angling for her to join their party, while Democrats have thus far remained noncommittal on whether they will support Ms Sinema ‚Äî who has kept her committee assignments with the party ‚Äî or Mr Gallego in 2024.

     Gallego accuses Sinema of not applauding Biden‚Äôs call to negotiate Medicare
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that Rep. Ruben Gallego is accusing Sen. Krysten Sinema of not applauding President Biden‚Äôs Medicare comments.
Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) accused Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) of not applauding President Biden during the State of the Union address when he called for negotiating decreased Medicare drug prices for seniors.
‚ÄúArizonans elected Senator Sinema to lower prescription drug costs and ensure access to healthcare for all.
A spokesperson for Sinema told The Hill that the senator did, in fact, applaud when Biden commented on capping the cost of insulin.
An outspoken Sinema critic, Gallego has entered the race for her Senate seat, which is up for grabs in 2024.
