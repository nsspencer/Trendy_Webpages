     NASCAR driver Kyle Busch apologizes after he was arrested in Mexico for handgun possession
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two-time NASCAR Cup champion Kyle Busch apologizes after he was arrested and detained for bringing a handgun into Mexico while vacationing in January with his wife.
According to the Mexico Prosecutor General’s office, a handgun was found in his bag at the airport as he and his wife Samantha were leaving the country.
He was arrested on Jan. 27 and sentenced to 3.5 years in prison and fined $1,100, but the statement from Mexico Prosecutor General’s office does not explain how Busch’s sentence would be handled.
He admitted in the statement that he was unaware of the Mexican law that forbids the possession of a weapon in the country without approval.
I was not aware of Mexican law and had no intention of bringing a handgun into Mexico."
