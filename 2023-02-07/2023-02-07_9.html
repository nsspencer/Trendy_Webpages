     After blowout loss to Miami, are the Duke Blue Devils in trouble? | Locked on College Basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Duke Blue Devils are 8-5 and in sixth place in the ACC, but fans shouldn't be worried about head coach Jon Scheyer.
MIAMI — Two days after an emotional win over rival North Carolina, the Duke Blue Devils went to Miami and were immediately dispatched by the Hurricanes, falling 81-59 on Monday evening.
"I've seen 'Tar Heel hangover' put out there a good bit and I think that's so accurate," Jackson commented.
"A team that's dominated by so many freshman and [lacking] that senior leadership...you were worried about something like this."
So it's important to not live as much in the moment, but it is fair to ask those questions."

     Duke basketball: Jeremy Roach the key to Blue Devils turning things around, Chris Spatola says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And ESPN's Chris Spatola said that veteran guard Jeremy Roach needed to step up his game for Duke to reach its potential this season.
"The difference for Duke last year and that run to a national championship was not (Paolo) Banchero," said Spatola, the son-in-law of Duke coaching legend Mike Krzyzewski.
"As well as Banchero was playing, Banchero had a good year all year, and he was the No.
In that tournament run, the guy who had the biggest shots late in games was Jeremy Roach, Roddy.
Spatola continued to note Roach was the biggest part of Duke's formula to become a successful team.

Duke got humbled by the Miami Hurricanes, and it was clear from the very beginning that the energy wasn’t there.
Sam Klein was in the building for the game, so we open with his observations and headlines before we get to the good.
We also get into the NET rankings and how this loss actually might have helped Duke in that all-important metric.
After the break, we get into the bad, and there’s a lot to be discussed.

     Summary: After each Duke men’s basketball game this season, check back here for the Player of the Game and more.
Miami got the last word as it took down the Blue Devils Monday night.
One word: MessyMondays are rarely anyone’s day—and apparently, that includes the Blue Devils.
The Blue Devils were able to hold onto the ball, whether that meant preventing one of Miami’s 13 steals or simply losing the rock due to clumsiness.
17 Hurricane points came from wicked-quick fast breaks that served only to reinforce one of the tenets of the game: Duke's defense fell behind.

     Did Hubert Davis Have A Point About Free Throws?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Carolina’s Hubert Davis displayed similar restraint when confronted with Duke’s 11 of 15 foul shooting performance the other night compared to his team’s 2 of 3 free throws.
The Heels had tried 543 foul shots compared to runnerup Wake’s 450 attempts among ACC teams, a difference significantly less than what Davis insisted was the case.
Duke now is the only ACC squad that’s attempted at least 10 free throws in every game, testament to aggressive play on offense and solid work defensively.
Miami beat UNCG while making all four free throws in its second game of the season.
“I’ve never been involved with a game where a team has taken 39 free throws,” Keatts said.

     Summary: Hoping to rebound from a thumping at Miami, Duke next travels to Charlottesville, Va., to face top-10 Virginia.
Even against a strong Hokies defense, Clark was able to put up an impressive stat line of 17 points and four assists.
His defense around the basket dominates opponents and should prove a useful feature of the Blue Devils’ game in the upcoming matchup.
To return to the promise and potential displayed during Duke’s matchup against the Tar Heels, the Blue Devils must continue to rely on their big men.
With only seven games left in the season, it is pivotal that the Blue Devils limit their mistakes and continue to find their identity behind Filipowski and Lively.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 6, 2023; Coral Gables, Florida, USA; Miami Hurricanes guard Nijel Pack (24) and Duke Blue Devils forward Mark Mitchell (25) chase a loose ball during the first half at Watsco Center.
Seeing Miami gain a rebounding edge over his taller Blue Devils, though, didn’t sit well with the Blue Devils’ first-year coach.
“We’ve been a team that’s protected our paint,” Scheyer said in a moment of clarity following his team’s dumbfounding 81-59 loss to No.
The other was Jan. 4 at PNC Arena when N.C. State hammered the Blue Devils, 84-60.
The Blue Devils pointed the fingers directly at themselves for allowing that to happen.
