     Joe Rogan: ‘The idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (JTA) — It’s “ridiculous” to doubt that Jews like money, popular podcaster Joe Rogan said on his show on Saturday.
But Rogan defended the statement on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience.” The show attracts some 11 million listeners per episode, according to an estimate last year in Time magazine, and is the most popular podcast on Spotify’s platform.
“She’s talking about money,” Rogan said about Omar.
You know, the idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous.
“I wasn’t aware of the fact that there are tropes about Jews and money,” she said on CNN last week.

     Summary: Joe Rogan has been accused of “casually spouting antisemitism” on his hit podcast while trying to defend under-fire progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar from the same charge.
He highlighted Omar (D-Minn.) “apologizing for talking about it’s ‘all about the Benjamins,'” he said of the congresswoman’s 2019 message about American support for Israel.
“It’s just about money — she’s just talking about money,” Rogan said on an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” posted on Spotify Saturday.
“That’s not an anti-Semitic statement, I don’t think that is,” Rogan insisted of the term widely denounced as a racist trope.

“Did you see him sitting next to Ilhan Omar, where she’s apologizing for talking about it’s all about the Benjamins?
Benjamins are money.”He continued, “The idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous.
‘Comedian’ or not, Rogan’s comments are no joke.”For centuries, people have used these longstanding tropes to spread vicious lies about the Jewish people.

     Joe Rogan Faces New Criticism for Promoting ‘Antisemitic Tropes About Jews and Money’ on Podcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Rogan has found himself facing new controversy after voicing antisemitic tropes on his massively popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience.”In a recent episode featuring guests Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti, hosts of the “Breaking Points” podcast, Rogan stated that “the idea that Jewish people aren’t into money is ridiculous.
“She’s apologizing for talking about ‘It’s all about the Benjamins,’ which is just about money—she’s talking about money,” Rogan continued on his podcast.
Disturbing that at a time of rising anti-Jewish violence, when growing numbers of Americans believe in antisemitic conspiracy theories, @joerogan would use his immense platform to spew antisemitic tropes about Jews and money.
Rogan, whose show ranked as the most popular podcast of 2022 on Spotify, is no stranger to backlash.
Seventy episodes of “The Joe Rogan Experience” were pulled from Spotify last year for the host’s repeated use of the N-word, a controversy that led to an apology from the podcast host.

     Joe Rogan Sparks Backlash for Pushing Antisemitic ‘Money’ Trope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Conspiracy-peddling podcaster Joe Rogan, who signed a $200 million deal with Spotify in 2020, is once again in hot water—this time for pushing the well-known antisemitic trope that Jewish people are “into money” and greedy.
According to the longtime UFC commentator, there is nothing problematic about observing that Jewish people like money.
“She’s apologizing for talking about ‘It’s all about the Benjamins,’ which is just about money—she’s talking about money,” he stated.
Benjamins are money.”Rogan continued: “The idea that Jewish people aren’t into money is ridiculous.
That’s fucking stupid.”Noting that Omar recently reiterated her apology during an interview alongside Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is Jewish, Rogan doubled down.
