     Massachusetts woman finds frozen shark washed up on Cape Cod beach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A dead, partially frozen shark washed ashore a Cape Cod beach this past weekend amid record-breaking cold temperatures in the Northeast.
"Def not what I was expecting to find on my frozen winter adventure," local photographer Amie Medeiros shared in an Instagram post.
On Saturday, Medeiros captured the images of the frozen encrusted shark amid a brutal cold snap that plunged the Massachusett's peninsula to subzero temperatures on Friday and Saturday.
GIRL DIES IN SHARK ATTACK AFTER TRYING TO SWIM WITH DOLPHINSThe shark which washed ashore at Cold Storage Beach in Dennis, Massachusetts, was pictured resting on one side, mouth agape showcasing razor sharp teeth.
Porbeagle sharks can measure 12 feet and weigh between 300 and 500 pounds.

     Summary: A frozen porbeagle shark washed up on the beach in Dennis, Massachusetts.
A local aquarium scientist went to find the shark days later and said people had taken parts of it.
Local photographer Amie Medeiros captured a picture of the shark on Saturday afternoon, lying sideways while preserved in the ice around it.
John Chisholm, an adjunct scientist at the New England Aquarium who has been tracking sharks washing up onshore, confirmed that it was a porbeagle shark.
In Cape Cod, temperatures reached as low as 30 degrees below zero on Friday night — the day before Medeiros' photo was taken, local outlet CapeCod.com reported.

     Summary: articleA dead, frozen shark was discovered on an ice-covered beach in Cape Cod, Massachusetts over the weekend as the area was hit with freezing temperatures.
A local photographer was at Cold Storage Beach on Saturday when she made the discovery and posted the images on her @capeimagesbyamie Instagram page.
Last week Massachusetts, and much of the Northeast, was hit with freezing temperatures.
@capeimagesbyamie/InstagramThe shark is believed to be a male porbeagle, according to marine biologist John Chisholm at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.
Porbeagles prefer cold, temperate waters, according to Oceana.

     'That's the essence of ice': Frozen shark washes up on Cape Cod beach after polar vortex
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A photo of a frozen shark washed up on a Cape Cod beach over the weekend has captured the attention of social media users.
But the photographer said she was told it's a porbeagle shark, typically found in the North Atlantic, southern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, according to the ocean conservation group Oceana.
Greg Skomal has researched sharks for about 40 years and agreed that it's a porbeagle shark, one of the few species that can withstand such cold water.
Sharks tend to swim into shallow water when something is wrong; they then die on the beach, Skomal said.
A few weeks ago, a different porbeagle shark was swimming in nearby shallow water.

Amie Medeiros found a dead and frozen porbeagle shark Saturday on the shore of Cold Storage Beach in Dennis.
Amie Medeiros“If we didn’t have that sub-zero weather, this shark wouldn’t have frozen, it just would have been a dead stranded shark,” he said.
AdvertisementChisholm said he went to Cape Cod to investigate the porbeagle’s condition and try to determine how it died.
Cold enough to wash a frozen shark onto a Cape Cod beach!” one person tweeted Monday.
