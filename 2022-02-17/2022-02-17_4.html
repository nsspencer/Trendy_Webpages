     Stranger Things Season 4 release date reveal details the Netflix show's endgame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Duffer Brothers’ Netflix series Stranger Things is one of those shows.
Here’s everything we know about the Stranger Things to come, and what it could mean for the show’s story.
According to an open letter released to Netflix’s blog, Season 4 of Stranger Things is so long — nearly twice as long as any previous season — that the release is split into two.
According to Netflix, Season 4 will pick up six months after Season 3’s Battle of Starcourt, with the Hopkins gang separated for the first time.
Hopper was confirmed alive in a previous Stranger Things teaser.

     ‘Stranger Things’ Season 4 release date, new format
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Netflix announced Thursday that “Stranger Things” will end with Season 5, and that the show’s fourth season will debut this summer in two parts.
The news: Netflix said “Stranger Things” will release its fourth season in two parts.
What they’re saying: “Seven years ago, we planned out the complete story arc for ‘Stranger Things,’” creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrote in a letter to fans.
“With nine scripts, over eight-hundred pages, almost two years of filming, thousands of visual effects shots and a runtime nearly twice the length of any previous season, ‘Stranger Things 4’ was the most challenging season yet, but also the most rewarding one.
See you in the upside down pic.twitter.com/9scVCGzekF — Netflix (@netflix) August 6, 2021The bigger picture: “Stranger Things” Season 4 was originally expected to be released in 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic delay the show’s production and changed the release date.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After disappearing for nearly three years, Stranger Things is finally coming back for its fourth season.
All these announcements came directly from Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer, the creators of Stranger Things, in an open letter to fans.
Finally, the Duffers teased that while the season 5 finale will mark the end of one Stranger Things story, it won’t be the end of the larger universe.
“There are still many more exciting stories to tell within the world of Stranger Things; new mysteries, new adventures, new unexpected heroes,” the Duffer brothers said.
While no plans have been announced yet, it certainly seems like this means that Stranger Things spinoffs could be on their way to Netflix in the near future.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Each Stranger Things season so far has featured either eight or nine episodes, but according to series co-creators Matt and Ross differ, the upcoming fourth season is going to be a little different as it starts to bring the story of Eleven and her friends to its impending close.
Today, Netflix shared an open letter from the Duffer Brothers detailing elements of Stranger Things’ fourth season, which they described as “the beginning of the end,” and announcing that the show’s fifth season will be its last.
“Seven years ago, we planned out the complete story arc for Stranger Things,” the brothers explained.
While the streaming platform’s shared even less about Stranger Things’ fifth season, the Duffer Brothers made clear that while it’s going to bring Eleven’s specific story to a close, that doesn’t necessarily mean that this will be the end of the larger Stranger Things franchise.
“There are still many more exciting stories to tell within the world of Stranger Things; new mysteries, new adventures, new unexpected heroes,” the Duffers intoned.

     If you’re a fan of Stranger Things—and chances are you are—there’s good news and bad news.
The bad news is that after season four is done, you’ll only have one more season of watching the Party take on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque denizens of the Upside-Down.
Speaking of, here’s the (predictably vague) official synopsis for season four:“It’s been six months since the Battle of Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins.
First up is one titled “California,” where Will Byers and Eleven moved at the end of season three.
As for the show, the beginning of the beginning of the end begins when the first portion of season four premieres on Netflix on May 27.
