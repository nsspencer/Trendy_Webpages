     Chet Hanks says he didn't have a 'strong male role model' growing up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Chet Hanks is reflecting on growing up the child of famous parents, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.
In a video titled "The Truth About Growing Up As A Hanks" posted on the younger Hanks' YouTube channel, he talked about his upbringing surrounded by wealth and fame.
"My experience was even more complicated because, on top of fame already being toxic, I wasn't even famous," Hanks said.
Hanks, 31, and his brother Truman, 26, are the sons of the Oscar-winning actor and Wilson, his wife.
The elder Hanks also has a son, Colin Hanks, 44, and a daughter, Elizabeth Hanks, 39, from his previous marriage to Samantha Lewes.

     Elvis Trailer: Tom Hanks Got COVID-19 for This?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The trailer for Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis kicks off with a voiceover by an old cartoon wizard.
This is supposed to be an Elvis Presley biopic, but we’re pretty sure that’s Geppetto from the new Pinocchio teaser.
At the one-minute mark of this very long trailer, we see the owner of that voice staring up at a stage where Austin Butler is thrusting his crotch at Baz Luhrmann’s camera.
It’s Tom Hanks, wearing Jared Leto’s sweaty hand-me-down Gucci prosthetics.
He plays Colonel Tom Parker, who was Elvis’s manager and a colonel in the way Colonel Sanders was a colonel.

Starring Austin Butler as “the King” and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker, the picture is positioning itself as the first de-facto “big movie for grown-ups" in summer 2022.
Moreover, in a year when Warner Bros. Is (understandably) leaning hard into four-quadrant IP (the DC flicks, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, etc.

     Austin Butler hip-swivels, convincingly croons, and rocks dark eyeliner in the first trailer for Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, released on Thursday.
As captivating as Butler’s Presley seems to be, though, it’s Tom Hanks who commands the attention with his fat suit and scene-stealing jowls.
He plays Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, and joins the esteemed ranks of actors doing bizarre, unidentifiable accents in recent projects (hello, Julia Garner in Inventing Anna).
“There are some who’d make me out to be the villain of this here story,” Hanks narrates in the trailer.
It was during production on the film in March 2020 that Hanks became one of the first high-profile celebrities to test positive for the coronavirus.
