     Incoming CNN host Jemele Hill attacks Michele Tafoya for caring about 'made-up' critical race theory
    </h2>

     Incoming CNN host and former ESPN anchor Jemele Hill is making no secret of her disdain for former NBC sports reporter Michele Tafoya's views opposing critical race theory.
MICHELE TAFOYA EXPLAINS WHY SHE IS LEAVING NBC TO ‘START GIVING BACK’Tafoya has been a hard line critic of critical race theory being taught in schools, citing experiences her children had being separated from Black schoolmates because of "affinity groups."
Because to me, what matters is your character and your values," Tafoya said at the time.
And so rather than, you know, just banging it out on Twitter or Instagram every day – I thought – I've got to do something.
I have benefited greatly from the American dream, and I feel like for the sake of my kids and because I so love this country, I've got to start giving back," she told Carlson.

     Longtime sideline reporter Michele Tafoya called her final NFL game at Super Bowl LVI this past Sunday.
During her appearance on the right-wing program, she shared her opinion on former NFL quarterback turned political activist Colin Kaepernick.
“This is the worst thing that could possibly happen to the NFL right now, right after Brian Flores comes out and sues the league, she’s does this interview,” one wrote.
“Standing up for justice isn’t a business decision,” another added.
I’m speaking for me.

     Michele Tafoya on critical race theory: 'Breaks my heart' kids taught 'that skin color matters'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former NFL sideline reporter Michele Tafoya weighed in on critical race theory during a Fox News appearance, saying she's disheartened her children are being taught "that skin color matters."
Several GOP-led states have moved in recent years to ban critical race theory from being taught in schools, though there is disagreement over whether it is present in secondary education.
“It breaks my heart that my kids are being taught that skin color matters.
'” Tafoya told host Tucker Carlson on Wednesday night.
She is slated to participate in the Conservative Political Action Conference later this month.

     Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Rams and Bengals was Michele Tafoya’s final game as a sideline reporter with NBC, as she left the network to take part in various non-sports ventures.
On Monday, Tafoya joined SiriusXM's The Megyn Kelly Show, where she addressed, among other topics, comments she had made about former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick on The View in November.
Last fall, Tafoya was asked about whether she believed Kaepernick was “blackballed” by NFL owners.
“If they believed he could win them a Super Bowl he would be on a team right now,” she said then.
Tafoya elaborated on her comments on Monday, with Kelly.
