     Fire devastates historic clubhouse at Oakland Hills Country Club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- A devastating fire Thursday swept through the iconic clubhouse at Oakland Hills Country Club, the suburban Detroit golf course that is one of Michigan's most exclusive clubs and the site of many professional tournaments.
Flames ripped through the roof at the sprawling, multistory clubhouse in Bloomfield Township.
It was built in 1922 and is adorned with irreplaceable golf tournament memorabilia and art.
Firefighters on the scene told reporters that they were instructed where some of the historic memorabilia was located inside the clubhouse and were able to save some of it.
They don't know what was saved and what wasn't, but some of the memorabilia inside the clubhouse included Ryder Cup trophies, PGA Championship trophies and other significant pieces.

In his commentaries on golf architecture, he said, "I rarely find a piece of property so well-suited for a golf course."

     Oakland Hills CC Clubhouse Engulfed in Massive Fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A raging fire Thursday morning destroyed a large part of the clubhouse at famed Oakland Hills Country Club near Detroit.
Firefighters from Bloomfield Township and Southfield fire departments were called around 10 a.m. and local reports say every firefighter from Bloomfield Township was on the scene battling the blaze.
The clubhouse, which was completed in 1922, housed irreplaceable memorabilia of national championships at Oakland Hills and artwork, some of which goes back a century.
"Our thoughts are with our friends at Oakland Hills," John Bodenhamer, chief championships officer for the USGA, which has hosted 10 majors at Oakland Hills, said in a statement to the Detroit News.
Before the fire, Oakland Hills' clubhouse stood as one golf's many grand, classic structures.

     Oakland Hills Country Club suffers major damage in fire

     Fire swept through the iconic clubhouse Thursday at the Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Township, one of Michigan’s most exclusive clubs and the site of many professional tournaments.
In 1999 and 2000, the Oakland Hills clubhouse underwent a $16 million renovation including construction of a new and expanded pro shop and a new first tee facility.
“Our thoughts are with our friends at Oakland Hills.
The South Course reopened last summer following a $12.1 million restoration, with a goal to bring major championships back to Oakland Hills.
A Hall of Champions was installed in 2015 in the second floor hallway featuring displays celebrating every major golf competition held at Oakland Hills.
