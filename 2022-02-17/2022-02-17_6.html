     Handcuffed Woman Jumps Off Carnival Cruise After Hot Tub Disturbance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The United States Coast Guard is continuing to search for a woman who jumped off a Carnival cruise ship while handcuffed following a reported hot tub disturbance on Wednesday (February 16), Daily Mail reports.
Several passengers said security on the cruise ship attempted to detain the woman following a disturbance with a man in the hot tub area of the 10th deck, WAFB reports.
“Security got her out of the hot tub," said Kim Barnette, a passenger on the ship, via WAFB.
The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed it is still undergoing a missing person search for the woman as of Thursday (February 17) morning.
The Coast Guard was called at around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday and sent two sets of helicopter crews to help search for the missing woman.

     Woman Goes Overboard From Cruise Ship, Sparking Coast Guard Search

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Coast Guard Aviation Training Center Mobile HC-144A Ocean Sentry aircrew and Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater MH-60T Jayhawk helicopter aircrew are assisting in the search and rescue effort.
The cruise ship left Cozumel, Mexico, on Tuesday and is expected to dock in its homeport of New Orleans on Thursday.
Wednesday's incident comes after a woman fell overboard from a different Carnival cruise ship in December.
Coast Guard personnel from San Diego joined the Mexican Navy in search for the woman, but suspended the search after 31 hours.
Also in December, a teenager fell to his death on a cruise ship that was headed for Miami.
