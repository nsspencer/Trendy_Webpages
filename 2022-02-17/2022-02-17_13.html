     Shark Attack Horror Sparks Hunt for Great White Responsible Amid Calls for a Cull
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A horrific shark attack near Sydney, Australia has sparked a hunt for the huge great white shark responsible, amid wider calls for a shark cull in the area.
The BBC said authorities are trying to determine how the great white, estimated to be 14 feet long, got past the barriers.
The great white shark is a vulnerable species.
The white shark is also caught as bycatch by commercial fisheries and can also become entangled in meshes that protect beaches.
We have the tools and know-how to modernize and improve beach safety standards that benefit humans and wildlife alike."

     Beaches to reopen as Sydney hunts for shark behind first fatal attack in almost 60 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MELBOURNE, Australia — Still reeling from its first deadly shark attack in almost 60 years, Sydney said its beaches would re-open Friday, as authorities hunted the great white behind the incident.
People walk near the site of a fatal shark attack off Sydney's Little Bay Beach.
It was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 1963, data showed.
“This has been a complete shock for our community,” Dylan Parker, the mayor of Randwick Council which includes Little Bay, told Reuters.
The attack came as unprovoked shark attacks rose for the first time in three years across the world last year, with 73 reported globally, according to research from the International Shark Attack File.

     Australian authorities search for shark involved in Sydney’s first fatal attack in six decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Police said emergency services were called near Buchan Point, off of Little Bay Beach, some 10 miles south of Sydney, on Wednesday afternoon following reports of a shark attack.
A spokesperson for the New South Wales police told The Washington Post in a statement that the search would be paused Thursday evening but would resume in the morning.
“We acknowledge and thank the many first responders and surf life-saving personnel who protect and patrol our beaches,” the statement said.
Unprovoked shark attacks that result in death are rare, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit Shark Research Institute.
It is unknown whether Wednesday’s attack was included in that tally and authorities did not comment on whether the attack was provoked.

     Fatal shark attack closes Sydney beaches as authorities try to catch great white thought to be 10 feet long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sydney authorities on Thursday deployed baited lines to try to catch a giant great white shark that killed an ocean swimmer, as beach communities in Australia's largest city were rocked by the first such attack in decades.
An 800-competitor ocean swimming race scheduled for the area on Sunday has been postponed.
Police believe they've identified the victim, a 35-year-old ocean swimmer who was attacked on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, leaving shocked fishermen and golfers to watch helplessly from nearby cliffs.
It was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 1963.
The department announced it was deploying "six SMART drumlines" around Little Bay Beach, near where the attack occurred in the city's east.
