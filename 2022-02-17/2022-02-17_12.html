     Nick Kristof cannot run for governor in Oregon, state Supreme Court says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Washington, DC (CNN) The Oregon Supreme Court on Thursday said Nick Kristof cannot run for governor because he does not meet residency requirements in the state, a decision that the former New York Times journalist said he would not challenge.
The Oregon Secretary of State last month ruled that Kristof was ineligible to run for governor because he had not lived in the state for three years prior to the upcoming election, citing that Kristof had been a New York resident up until December 2020.
The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the Secretary of State's decision with a unanimous ruling, despite Kristof's attempt to challenge the decision.
"Today, in a mandamus proceeding initiated by relator Nicholas Kristof, the Oregon Supreme Court held 'resident' in Article V, section 2, took its meaning from the legal concept of domicile, that is, the place where a person lives with the intent to remain indefinitely," the Oregon Supreme Court said in a press release accompanying its decision.
Following the release of the decision, Kristof said in a statement he would "respect the court's decision and will not pursue this further."

     “The Supreme Court has spoken.
Though Kristof owned and maintained homes in New York and Oregon, officials said he spent most of his time away from Oregon, Scroggin added.
“My willingness to challenge the status quo is the reason state officials are trying to toss me from the ballot,” Kristof said last month.
Today’s Supreme Court ruling excluding me from the ballot is, of course, very disappointing.
The second was whether the Oregon secretary of state was required to conclude Kristof met that legal standard.

     Ohio Supreme Court: Cincinnati officer cannot sue critics anonymously
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CINCINNATI (Enquirer) - A Hamilton County judge was wrong to allow a Cincinnati police officer to anonymously sue people who accused him of being racist, according to an Ohio Supreme Court ruling issued Thursday, according to our partners at the Enquirer.
“Some people in the crowd interpreted the gesture as a white-supremacy hand signal,” the Supreme Court ruling states.
The defendants have also appealed the restriction of their speech to the Ohio Supreme Court.
What the court said about doxingThe Supreme Court said the threat of “doxing” by itself does not constitute a true threat.
The threats against him presented to the Supreme Court were not severe enough to warrant the anonymous proceedings.

     Oregon Supreme Court upholds decision to keep Kristof from running for governor – Oregon Capital Chronicle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Secretary of State Shemia Fagan was right to keep former New York Times columnist Nick Kristof off the ballot for governor, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
In a 33-page unanimous opinion, the court affirmed Fagan’s early January decision that Kristof hadn’t lived in Oregon long enough to run for governor.
The Oregon Constitution requires candidates for governor to live in the state for three years prior to their election.
Kristof has maintained that he has been a resident of Oregon since childhood, and that maintaining a home in New York didn’t mean he gave up Oregon residency.
“This is the end of the road for my campaign,” Kristof said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Oregon Supreme Court on Thursday said that former New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof can't run for governor.
What it matters: The decision scuttles Kristof's campaign after months of planning and buildup.
Fagan pointed to what she described as "objective evidence" including that Kristof voted in New York as recently as 2020, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.
The Kristof campaign did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.
What he's saying: "While we are disappointed in the decision, we respect its ruling and thank the justices for their thoughtful consideration on this matter," Kristof said in a statement.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPBNick Kristof, the former New York Times columnist who quit his job to run for Oregon governor, is officially out of the race.
“We recognize [Kristof] has longstanding ties to Oregon, that he owns substantial property and operates a farm here, and that the secretary did not question his current Oregon residency,” the opinion reads.
In January, Oregon election officials ruled Kristof did not meet residency requirements established in the state’s constitution and therefore could not run to be governor.
Kristof has suggested, at times pointedly, that the attempts to force him out of the governor’s race have political motives.
Disagreeing, criticizing the decision, challenging the decision in court are all signs of a healthy democracy.

     Nick Kristof can’t run for Oregon governor, Supreme Court rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oregon’s Democratic primary race for governor narrowed significantly Thursday, with the state Supreme Court ruling that former New York Times columnist Nick Kristof can’t run because he does not meet the state’s three-year residency requirement.
The court did not ultimately make its own ruling on whether Kristof is more properly viewed as a resident of New York or of Oregon.
“They’re worried about a future of decline and drift in Oregon and they know something needs to change,” Kristof said.
Kristof grew up in Oregon, has owned property in rural Yamhill County for decades and said he always considered the state home.
The Oregon Constitution states that no one “who shall not have been three years next preceding his election, a resident of this state” can run for governor.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Biden’s statements were also reminiscent of Ronald Reagan’s pledge, during his 1980 Presidential campaign, to nominate “a woman to sit among the highest jurists.” The next year, Reagan nominated the first woman to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O’Connor, whom the Senate unanimously confirmed.
Reagan reportedly also wished to appoint the first Italian American, which he did by nominating Antonin Scalia, in 1986.
Circuit, and Justice Leondra Kruger, of the California Supreme Court—are jurists whose records, experience, and reputations for excellence would put them on any nonpartisan list of top possible nominees to the Supreme Court.
The legal arguments, which the Court has rejected in the past, are not new, but the outcome may be.
Next term, the Court will likely declare that any consideration of a person’s race in university admissions is unlawful.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But most justices and legal experts see them as an invaluable tool for strengthening the law, not weakening it.
Melvin Urofsky, a law professor who wrote a seminal book on Supreme Court dissents, framed them as part of a higher “constitutional dialogue” that precedes and outlasts each justice who takes part in it.
Indeed, a great dissent can help enshrine a Supreme Court justice’s place in history and public memory.
The most salient example to follow for Biden’s nominee might be that of Justice Clarence Thomas.
Every justice uses dissents and concurrences to explain why the court got it wrong in the case at hand.

     Biden’s vow to put a Black woman on the Supreme Court stirs mixed emotions among Black lawyers and judges

     As President Biden prepares to deliver on his promise to nominate the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, Black Americans in the legal profession say they feel conflicting emotions: vindication and pride, exasperation and dread.
“He’s keeping his promise to Black women because Black women put him in the White House.
It’s gratifying to see the president keep his word to Clyburn, and by extension, all Black Americans, says Newman.
Newman counts himself among the Black Americans who believe Thomas’ right-leaning political views are out of step with the majority of their community.
There have been 115 Supreme Court justices in its 232-year history.
