     Yellowstone star Forrie J Smith says he WON'T attend upcoming SAG Awards due to jab mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yellowstone actor Forrie J Smith has revealed he will not be attending next week's SAG Awards because he doesn't believe in vaccines and hasn't had a COVID shot.
Anyone attending the LA Awards, including show star Kevin Costner, 67, must have had their full-COVID vaccine, as well as a booster and a negative COVID test.
Yellowstone is filmed entirely in Montana, which does not have a state vaccine mandate.
Montana has passed a law banning banning employers from discriminating against employees based on COVID vaccine status.
Many social media users pointed out that children in California are still forced to wear face masks in their classrooms.
