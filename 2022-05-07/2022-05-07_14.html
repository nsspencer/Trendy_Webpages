     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostThe Florida Panthers find themselves in a 2-1 series hole after the Washington Capitals shut them down to the tune of a 6-1 win in Game 3 of their first-round Stanley Cup Playoff matchup.
Washington tied it up with 26 seconds to go as T.J. Oshie tipped in a big slap shot from Ovechkin just seven seconds after MacKenzie Weegar took a holding the stick penalty.
Both of the Capitals’ power play goals came off of Ovechkin slap shots — the first being deflected by Oshie and the second being a clean slap shot where he was left wide open.
Florida made a chance to their top power play unit after they went without a quality scoring chance on their first opportunity.

     Summary: Each club has a win as the series shifts to Washington, with Game 3 coming up on Saturday (1 ET, ESPN).
Game 2 was the moment when the Panthers relocated their swagger, jumping their expected goals from 2.17 to 3.77 at 5-on-5, game over game.
They are 0-6 on power-play opportunities, and the last time they didn't have a power-play goal in three straight games was back in January.
Jonathan Huberdeau assisted on Florida's second goal of the game in Game 2, and boosted his career playoff total to 17 points.
But, in Game 2 he scored his first career playoff goal in his 12th career playoff game.
