     Carrie Underwood Fans Are Bombarding Her Instagram After She Rocks a Sequin Tank and Shorts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leave it up to the one and only Carrie Underwood to rock denim, rhinestones, and fringe all at the same time.
The "Ghost Story" singer headlined this year's Stagecoach music festival in California along with artists like Thomas Rhett and Luke Combs.
It's like the Coachella of country music so naturally, Carrie pulled out all the stops to give fans a show they wouldn't forget and she delivered.
She wowed in a bedazzled denim jacket, and later got rid of it to show off a purple, sequin tank and daisy duke style shorts that matched.
Carrie shared this recap from the night with the caption, "I am still on a high from @stagecoach.

     Summary: Jay McCarroll and Matt Johnson are best friends, housemates, and bandmates (the only two people in Nirvanna the Band, in fact).
These two buddies are desperate to perform at the Rivoli, a restaurant and bar on Queen Street in Toronto that hosts live music.
Nirvanna the Band: CastSome of these adventures are parodies or homages, but they aren‚Äôt cheesy or overly earnest.
Matt and Jay have a fantastic chemistry that can only come from years of genuine friendship.
You presumably have a friend like Matt or Jay, so their dynamic is personal to you.

It's like the Coachella of country music so naturally, Carrie pulled out all the stops to give fans a show they wouldn't forget and she delivered.
Like her upcoming album and latest single titled Denim &amp; Rhinestones, the American Idol alum truly embodied her own lyrics in an outfit that did not disappoint.
