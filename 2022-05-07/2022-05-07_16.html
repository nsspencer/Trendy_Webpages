     Warriors' Stephen Curry: Paces team with 30 points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Curry posted 30 points (7-14 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 14-14 FT), two rebounds, six assists and one steal over 35 minutes during Saturday's 142-112 win over Memphis.
Although Curry's three-point stroke was a bit askew, he nailed 50 percent of his shots on a night where the Warriors sank a staggering 63.1 percent from the floor.
The one-two punch of Curry and Klay Thompson accounted for one of the Warriors' most potent offensive performances of the season, and with Gary Payton (elbow) sidelined indefinitely, Curry will continue to log maximum usage throughout the playoffs.

     Under Armour to mint NBA Warriors' Stephen Curry-inspired NFTs

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fashion label Under Armour’s Curry Brand is launching non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to celebrate every time NBA basketball player Stephen Curry makes a three-point shot during the ongoing playoff games.
Starting in June, the brand plans on dropping an additional 20,000 basketball NFTs.
For Under Armour and Stephen Curry, this is not the first move into the NFT space.
In December, Curry Brand launched wearable sneakers that can be used on multiple gaming platforms including Decentraland, The Sandbox, Gala Games and Rumble Kong League.
In September 2021, Curry secured a partnership with crypto exchange FTX to demystify the crypto space, just a day after he turned to Twitter to solicit crypto advice.
