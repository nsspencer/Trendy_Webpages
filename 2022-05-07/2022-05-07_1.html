The Celtics, to their credit, forced the Bucks to sweat in the fourth quarter.
But Brown and Al Horford picked up the slack in a close fourth quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Boston’s 103–101 loss to Milwaukee on Saturday afternoon, Celtics coach Ime Udoka had some harsh words for the officiating during his postgame press availability.
The call in question came in waning moments of the game, as Celtics guard Marcus Smart was fouled on the right wing by Bucks guard Jrue Holiday.
When asked about the play during the postgame presser, Udoka said he thought the officials got it wrong.
It was a foul,” Udoka said.
Game 4 between the Bucks and Celtics will take place on Monday night, with Milwaukee looking to add to its 2–1 series lead.

     Summary: Celtics 5 takeaways as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks hold off Celtics in Game 3 The Celtics nearly stole a game but now have their work cut out for them.
Giannis Antetokounmpo eclipsed Robert Williams and everyone else in Celtics green on Saturday in Milwaukee, the Bucks maintaining control of the series behind their two-time MVP.
Jim Davis/Globe StaffThe Celtics had their chances in Game 3 against the Bucks on Saturday.
Advertisement:After a game like that, it’s easy to project a Celtics win assuming Tatum doesn’t continue to shoot that poorly, and assuming Antetokounmpo doesn’t score 42 again.
The Celtics need to avoid letting Brown get switched onto Antetokounmpo, which is how the Bucks star got a lot of his easiest points in the fourth quarter.

     Summary: After Marcus Smart intentionally misses at the line, the Celtics can't get a shot off in time and the Bucks take Game 3 103-101.
Immediately, Smart attempted to get his shot off with Milwaukee Bucks guard Jrue Holiday giving him no space at all.
He caught the ball, he's turning into a shot," Udoka said, advocating for a shooting foul rather than the call on the floor.
Instead, Smart made the first free throw before intentionally missing the second to try to give the Celtics a chance.
Milwaukee couldn't answer on their ensuing possession and Boston had two chances to push the lead to four but Smart and Brown both missed 3-pointers.
