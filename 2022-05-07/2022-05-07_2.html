     Manchester Cityâ€™s Potential Contract Offer for Paul Pogba Revealed as Manchester United Exit Looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City are 'willing' to offer Paul Pogba a four-year contract if he completes a free transfer from Manchester United this summer.
Last night, a flurry of reports suggested Manchester City are interested in signing Paul Pogba, who is set to leave cross-town rivals Manchester United on a free transfer this summer.
IMAGO / Sportimage Pogba is reportedly earning Â£290,000 a week at United, but is set to walk away from the club this summer.
Alongside City, only Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are noted as having the financial muscle to offer the midfielder a suitable financial package.
Like previous reports have suggested, the reigning Premier League champions cannot offer Pogba anything until the season is complete, but it looks like there is serious interest from the blue side of Manchester.
