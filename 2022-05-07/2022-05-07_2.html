     Summary: He also pounced on an opportunity when Nico Harrison, a marketing executive at Nike, set aside a few dollars for Udoka to launch an A.A.U.
It was something Udoka had talked about doing with his friends for years, and now they could make it happen.
Udoka, though, was going to do things his way, which meant the hard way.
“We were never just going to roll the balls out there,” Udoka said.
“You’d literally be watching him play on TV for the Spurs, and then he’d be in the gym with you the next morning,” Jackson said.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics lost Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks 103-101, despite nearly mounting a 14-point comeback in the fourth quarter.
After the game, Celtics coach Ime Udoka said the late-game foul on Celtics guard Marcus Smart was a "poor call."
"I'll teach my guys to flop a little more," Udoka said.
Udoka said the officials told him Smart was making a sweeping motion on the final shot foul.
"You can't say that's a sweep, he's going into the shot," Udoka said.

     Summary: Celtics 5 takeaways as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks hold off Celtics in Game 3 The Celtics nearly stole a game but now have their work cut out for them.
Giannis Antetokounmpo eclipsed Robert Williams and everyone else in Celtics green on Saturday in Milwaukee, the Bucks maintaining control of the series behind their two-time MVP.
Jim Davis/Globe StaffThe Celtics had their chances in Game 3 against the Bucks on Saturday.
Advertisement:After a game like that, it’s easy to project a Celtics win assuming Tatum doesn’t continue to shoot that poorly, and assuming Antetokounmpo doesn’t score 42 again.
The Celtics need to avoid letting Brown get switched onto Antetokounmpo, which is how the Bucks star got a lot of his easiest points in the fourth quarter.

     Boston Celtics irate over 'bad missed call' late in loss to Milwaukee Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Immediately, Smart attempted to get his shot off with Milwaukee Bucks guard Jrue Holiday giving him no space at all.
He caught the ball, he's turning into a shot," Udoka said, advocating for a shooting foul rather than the call on the floor.
Instead, Smart made the first free throw before intentionally missing the second to try to give the Celtics a chance.
Milwaukee couldn't answer on their ensuing possession and Boston had two chances to push the lead to four but Smart and Brown both missed 3-pointers.
In that stretch, Boston shot 17 free throws compared with zero for Milwaukee.
