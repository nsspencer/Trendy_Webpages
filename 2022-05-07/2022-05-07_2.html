     Warriors Win Game 3 in Blowout Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heart-breaking loss in Game 2, the Golden State Warriors were determined to make a statement Saturday night.
With a 142-112 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State did just that to take a 2-1 series lead in the second round of the Western Conference Playoffs.
Coming out of the break, the Warriors jumped out to a 15-point lead thanks to an 8-0 run fueled by two Klay Thompson three-pointers.
In addition to Thompson, the Warriors got another 25-point-plus game from Poole, who tallied 27 on the night.
With the huge win, the Warriors have a chance to take a 3-1 series lead Monday night when the tip off against Memphis for Game 4 at Chase Center.

     Warriors: 3 overshadowed keys to Golden State's Game 3 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors often play a four-out, one-in offensive system with someone either in the dunkers’ spot or on the block.
But against the Grizzlies this series, and particularly on Saturday, the Warriors went five-out with every player on the perimeter.
If the Grizzlies are going to be flummoxed by such a simple tactic — the zone — the Warriors will gladly go back to it.
‘On-Guard’The Warriors figured something out in Game 1 that has carried forward into Game 2 and beyond.
With Draymond Green ejected from Game 1 for a Flagrant 2 foul, the Warriors had to run the offense through their guards.

     Golden State Warriors find offensive footing, scorch Memphis Grizzlies in Game 3

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (2:21)SAN FRANCISCO -- The Golden State Warriors almost made history on the way to their 142-112 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals.
Heading into Game 3, the Warriors emphasized the need to find their offensive rhythm, starting with better shot selection.
"When we're getting good shots, the chances of Klay getting hot are much greater," Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said.
In Game 3 he finally broke out, scoring 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4-of-6 from 3.
The Warriors look at their scoring onslaught in Game 3 as a blueprint of what they can do.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Warriors' win, Jenkins stirred the pot by insinuating that Warriors rising star Jordan Poole injured Morant on a dirty play that the NBA should review.
Morant didn't take questions from reporters, and though he walked to the Grizzlies' team bus without help, he did so with a clear limp.
To make your own decision on the latest play that has spice doused upon the Warriors' newest rivalry, here's what has both Jenkins and Morant over the edge.
This looks like the play Ja Morant got hurt.
"We've historically been viewed as a pretty soft jump-shooting team, right?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the win, Golden State has the opportunity to take what could be a significant lead in their best-of-seven series against Memphis on Monday night in Game 4.
Golden State has never really played this way.
It's an advantage this Warriors team has never really had.
But Golden State threw it out for 12 possessions in Game 3, and the results were largely positive.
Sure enough, Golden State held Memphis to a reasonable 12 points on those 12 possessions.
