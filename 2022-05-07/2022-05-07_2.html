     Summary: Late in Game 3, Ja Morant suffered an apparent right knee injury after getting tied up with Jordan Poole.
Poole briefly grabbed Morant's knee, and after the game, the Grizzlies were pretty heated about the incident.
Klay Thompson wasn't having it with the Grizzlies' insinuations that Poole tried to hurt Morant.
"That's definitely playoff talk," Thompson said.
We play the game the right way.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dillon Brooks has been suspended for Game 3 between the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors on Saturday evening.
The Memphis Grizzlies are in California to take on the Golden State Warriors for Game 3 of their second-round playoff series on Saturday night, and for the game they will be without one of their best players.
Dillon Brooks was charged with a flagrant 2 foul on Gary Payton II in Game 2, which meant Brooks was ejected from the game in the first half.
The NBA then went the next step and suspended Brooks for Game 3.
While many can argue if suspending Brooks was right or wrong, it's just one game.

     Warriors Win Game 3 in Blowout Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heart-breaking loss in Game 2, the Golden State Warriors were determined to make a statement Saturday night.
With a 142-112 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State did just that to take a 2-1 series lead in the second round of the Western Conference Playoffs.
Coming out of the break, the Warriors jumped out to a 15-point lead thanks to an 8-0 run fueled by two Klay Thompson three-pointers.
In addition to Thompson, the Warriors got another 25-point-plus game from Poole, who tallied 27 on the night.
With the huge win, the Warriors have a chance to take a 3-1 series lead Monday night when the tip off against Memphis for Game 4 at Chase Center.

     Warriors offense carves up Grizzlies on way to 30-point win; Ja Morant leaves with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That sequence summed up the night: The Warriors got the shots they wanted against far too little defensive resistance.
Stephen Curry finished with 30 points on 14 shots, Poole had 27 off the bench, and the Warriors blew out the Grizzlies 142-112.
He limped off the court in the middle of the fourth quarter after tweaking his knee against a Warriors double-team.
As the Grizzlies’ shooting evened out, the Warriors couldn’t seem to miss, hitting 71.1% of their first-half shots.
The Grizzlies’ offense was not the problem, although if Morant is injured shot creation could be an issue next game.

     Summary: (2:21)SAN FRANCISCO -- The Golden State Warriors almost made history on the way to their 142-112 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals.
Heading into Game 3, the Warriors emphasized the need to find their offensive rhythm, starting with better shot selection.
"When we're getting good shots, the chances of Klay getting hot are much greater," Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said.
In Game 3 he finally broke out, scoring 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4-of-6 from 3.
The Warriors look at their scoring onslaught in Game 3 as a blueprint of what they can do.

     Summary: In the early going of Game 3 vs. the Grizzlies on Saturday, the Golden State Warriors' sin was a familiar one: Turnovers.
Golden State finished the game shooting 63 percent, including 53 percent from 3.
When you're putting up 63-53-90 shooting splits as a team and you're taking more shots than your opponent, you're going to win.
If two of them have it going, as Thompson and Poole did on Saturday, the Warriors can beat anyone.
If all three of them have it going at the same time, the Warriors are going to kill teams.
