     Watch New Chelsea Owner Todd Boehly Celebrate After Romelu Lukaku Ends Goals Drought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Chelsea owner Todd Boehly was animated in the executive box at Stamford Bridge on Saturday after witnessing Romelu Lukaku end his goal drought.
The Belgian striker netted twice in three second-half minutes as Chelsea took control of their EPL home clash with Wolves.
After sending Wolves keeper Jose Sa the wrong way to give Chelsea a 1-0 lead on 56 minutes, Lukaku was mobbed by his teammates.

     Summary: Todd Boehly's consortium has signed an agreement to purchase Chelsea from Roman Abramovich.
Chelsea had until May 31 to find a new bidder as the UK Government's licence for the club to operate ran out on that date.
The Premier League is meeting on June 8 to constitute the new season, by which time Chelsea would need to have a licence to be part of the next campaign.
"In addition, the proposed new owners will commit £1.75bn in further investment for the benefit of the Club.
This includes investments in Stamford Bridge, the Academy, the Women's Team and Kingsmeadow and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation."

     Chelsea: Todd Boehly consortium signs £4.25bn agreement to buy club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have confirmed Todd Boehly’s consortium has agreed terms to buy the Premier League club from Roman Abramovich in a £4.25 billion takeover.
Abramovich put the club up for sale in March and was then sanctioned by the UK government following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The club added: “The sale is expected to be complete in late May subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.
And the sale of the club is still subject to the Premier League's owners’ and directors’ test.
The agreement means Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Boehly, who is expected to attend Chelsea’s match against Wolves at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, has won an exceptionally dramatic and public race to buy the Premier League club.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lukaku netted twice in a two-minute span early in the second half in a rare start in the league for the Belgium striker.
Lukaku has struggled in the first season of his second spell at Chelsea after being the club’s headline summer signing at a record fee of $135 million.
And where it was once Abramovich — the owner for 19 years — celebrating Chelsea’s goals, now it was Boehly standing up to applaud Lukaku.
His second goal was more impressive after being fed by Christian Pulisic following a poor pass out from the back by Conor Coady.
Chelsea controlled the match in the first half but was disallowed goals by Timo Werner and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

     Chelsea Soccer Club Bought By Todd Boehly-Led Group For $5 Billion, Ending Abramovich Connection

     Summary: The future of Chelsea Soccer Club looks assured, with the London Club announcing its new owners today.
Following the freezing of the assets of former owner, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his country’s invasion of Ukraine, the Club has been sold to a consortium led by Todd Boehly in a deal worth £4.25billion ($5.24bn).
A statement issued by the club today confirmed:“Terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjoerg Wyss, to acquire the Club.
Todd Boehley is the owner of holding company Eldridge, which also owns MRC (which operates a publishing joint venture with Deadline’s parent company Penske Media Company) and Dick Clark Productions, producers of the Golden Globes.
He is the owner of Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Sparks.

Boehly’s purchase will go through so long as approval is granted by the Premier League and the UK government.

In a three-minute VAR delay Boehly had displayed more emotion than Abramovich had in 19 years.
This was far better, and Saïss, Leander Dendoncker and Hwang Hee-chan all had chances even before Trincão’s remarkable 79th-minute strike.

     Soccer-Chelsea fans wary of money men behind new prospective owners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Oakley, a Chelsea fan since 1969, said he hoped the new owners would continue to plough money into the club, but he wanted more clarity about their plans.
“At the end of the day they’re not in here because they love the club, they’re in here because they love the money,” Oakley said as he approached the stadium ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League match at Wolverhampton Wanderers.
By contrast, Chelsea have been England’s most successful club since Abramovich bought the Londoners in 2003.
Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League in April and are well adrift of Premier League leaders Manchester City.
