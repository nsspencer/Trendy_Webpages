It was something Udoka had talked about doing with his friends for years, and now they could make it happen.
Udoka, though, was going to do things his way, which meant the hard way.
“We were never just going to roll the balls out there,” Udoka said.
“You’d literally be watching him play on TV for the Spurs, and then he’d be in the gym with you the next morning,” Jackson said.

It was then that the Celtics missed not one, not two, but three shots around the rim as the clock drained to 0:00.
Smart missed first, but Robert Williams III cleaned the glass to come down with a rebound to give Boston another chance.

     Celtics Coach Ime Udoka Rips Officiating Following Game 3 Loss to Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Boston’s 103–101 loss to Milwaukee on Saturday afternoon, Celtics coach Ime Udoka had some harsh words for the officiating during his postgame press availability.
The call in question came in waning moments of the game, as Celtics guard Marcus Smart was fouled on the right wing by Bucks guard Jrue Holiday.
When asked about the play during the postgame presser, Udoka said he thought the officials got it wrong.
It was a foul,” Udoka said.
Game 4 between the Bucks and Celtics will take place on Monday night, with Milwaukee looking to add to its 2–1 series lead.

     Celtics coach Ime Udoka on officiating of Game 3: 'I'll teach my guys to flop a little more'

     Summary: The Boston Celtics lost Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks 103-101, despite nearly mounting a 14-point comeback in the fourth quarter.
After the game, Celtics coach Ime Udoka said the late-game foul on Celtics guard Marcus Smart was a "poor call."
"I'll teach my guys to flop a little more," Udoka said.
Udoka said the officials told him Smart was making a sweeping motion on the final shot foul.
"You can't say that's a sweep, he's going into the shot," Udoka said.

     Summary: Celtics 5 takeaways as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks hold off Celtics in Game 3 The Celtics nearly stole a game but now have their work cut out for them.
Giannis Antetokounmpo eclipsed Robert Williams and everyone else in Celtics green on Saturday in Milwaukee, the Bucks maintaining control of the series behind their two-time MVP.
Jim Davis/Globe StaffThe Celtics had their chances in Game 3 against the Bucks on Saturday.
Advertisement:After a game like that, it’s easy to project a Celtics win assuming Tatum doesn’t continue to shoot that poorly, and assuming Antetokounmpo doesn’t score 42 again.
The Celtics need to avoid letting Brown get switched onto Antetokounmpo, which is how the Bucks star got a lot of his easiest points in the fourth quarter.

     Why the Boston Celtics need far more from Jayson Tatum to overcome Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics were seething at the way the Milwaukee Bucks had extracted the 103-101 victory to take a 2-1 series lead.
That's not a shooting motion," said Bucks guard Jrue Holiday, who committed the foul -- no one was paying attention to where Jayson Tatum was.
The Bucks are elated they're up despite missing Khris Middleton, out with a knee injury -- and it's because of Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Bad shooting games happen, of course, but can't happen for Tatum if the Celtics' playoff run is going to lead to the Finals.
Tatum is better than what he showed Saturday, and the Celtics need the lesson learned.

     5 takeaways from Bucks' Game 3 escape vs. Celtics in Eastern Conference semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE – Five takeaways from the Milwaukee Bucks’ 103-101 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 3 Saturday at Fiserv Forum to take a 2-1 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal series:1.
That meant two free throws, not three, with the Celtics down 103-100, now with 4.6 seconds left.
Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer took it a step further, saying that Smart was making a rip-through move designed to snooker the refs.
But Wesley Matthews in particular and his Milwaukee cohorts busted their butts denying and pestering Tatum, normally the Celtics’ biggest scoring threat.
Through three games, the Celtics have shot 69 free throws and been called for 69 fouls.
