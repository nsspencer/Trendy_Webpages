     Summary: Man United's Worst Ever Premier League Season Confirmed As Brighton Close In On Club RecordManchester United were thrashed 4-0 at Brighton on Saturday to guarantee that the 2021/22 season will end as their worst in Premier League history.

As well as being their worst EPL season in terms of points won, United have also conceded more goals than ever before.
But while this has been United's worst season in terms of points for more than 30 years, it is on course to be Brighton's best ever campaign.
After thrashing United, Brighton have 47 points with two matches remaining.
