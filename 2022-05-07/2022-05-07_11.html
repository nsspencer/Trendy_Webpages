     Carla Esparza tops Rose Namajunas for strawweight title in low-action fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of the most bizarre title fights in UFC history, Esparza (19-6) upset Namajunas (11-5) via split decision in the co-main event of UFC 274 inside Footprint Center.
According to UFC Stats, Namajunas landed just 38 strikes in the five-round fight.
Esparza landed 30.
That was a key difference when they fought the first time back in 2014, in a fight in which Esparza took Namajunas down and submitted her.
After the first round, each fighter was credited with a total of three strikes landed, and the action never picked up.

     Carla Esparza Beats Rose Namajunas by Decision at UFC 274 to Win Strawweight Title
    </h2>

     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCSeven years after becoming the first women's strawweight champion in UFC history, Carla Esparza has reclaimed the title with a split decision victory over Rose Namajunas at UFC 274 on Saturday night.
Esparza put herself in the record books for the longest gap between title reigns in UFC history with her victory.
In that first encounter, Esparza defeated Namajunas by submission in the finale to become the inaugural UFC women's strawweight champion.
Per ESPN's Kelsey Puckett, Esparza was even prepared to postpone her wedding date after getting the opportunity to fight for the title.
Esparza joins Namajunas as the only women's strawweight fighters with multiple title reigns in the division.

     UFC 274 results, highlights: Carla Esparza earns strawweight title with decision over Rose Namajunas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rose Namajunas entered UFC 274 looking not only to retain her strawweight title but also to avenge a 2014 loss to Carla Esparza.
By the end of five rounds, the two women had unofficially combined for less than 70 combined strikes.
Still, the takedowns were a show of aggression that was more than Namajunas had offered at any point in the fight.
"But I felt like I was the aggressor in the fight and I was going after it and going after it."
It's unlikely the UFC gives Namajunas a rematch in the near future, given the fight drew comparisons to some of the worst in UFC history.

     Summary: Carla Esparza knew there was a chance that her title fight against Rose Namajunas might coincide with her upcoming wedding but even she couldn’t have predicted the actual timing.
“Planning a wedding, just with itself is super stressful and it’s a lot of work and getting ready for a fight is the same, especially a title fight.
She knows the risks involved because superficial wounds are almost expected, especially when dealing with a five-round title fight.
I think going into every fight, just like when you’re fighting, you have to silence the crowd around you.
“Some people have suggested [to wear the title] and I think it would be hilarious and really cool,” Esparza said.
