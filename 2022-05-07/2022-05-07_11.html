     Game 3 Injury Report: Warriors vs. Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Five Questions: Grizzlies vs Warriors Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two hotly contested games in Memphis, the Grizzlies are heading to the Bay for game three against the Golden State Warriors.
Before game three, Brady Klopfer (@BradyKlopferNBA) of SB Nation’s Golden State of Mind offered some insight into the very intriguing game three matchup.
Ja Morant had 47 points in the last game, how can the Warriors slow him down in game three without Gary Payton II?
The Warriors are going to have to take some tips from how other teams — including the Grizzlies — guard Curry.
It’s possible that with Brooks out, the Grizzlies resort to shooters who handle the Warriors defense a little bit better.
