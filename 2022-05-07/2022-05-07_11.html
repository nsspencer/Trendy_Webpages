     Todd Boehly Expected to Attend Chelsea vs Wolves After Signing Takeover Purchase Agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Todd Boehly is set to be in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon when Chelsea face Wolves in the Premier League.
The part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers took a major step to taking over the reigns in west London on Friday night after it was confirmed by the club that the purchase agreement had been signed.
Chelsea released a club statement in the early hours of Saturday morning making the Boehly agreement official.
This includes investments in Stamford Bridge, the Academy, the Women’s Team and Kingsmeadow and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation.
It will be the first time he attends a game since the purchase agreement was signed.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the transaction is not quite completed as it’s pending regulatory approvals, this is essentially the first game of the new era, the first game since 2003 with an owner other than Roman Abramovich.
Incidentally, Tuchel’s first game was also a home game against Wolves.
That ended 0-0, so let’s try to do better this time around.
Lukaku and Pulisic both start!
Here we go!

     Chelsea vs Wolves: Premier League gambling guide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going a full week without playing a match was probably the best thing that could’ve happened to Chelsea.
Still, Chelsea is winless in its last three contests against the team from the West Midlands, with the previous two matches finishing in dreadfully dull 0-0 draws.
Here is your Chelsea gambling guide for Premier League game against WolvesAnyone who has actually been following me over the past few matches will know I’m cold.
I think I have to back this trend to continue, so I’ll be watching the Chelsea first goal prop at -295 odds.
For my final pick, I’m strictly following the odds and actively going against my better judgement by taking Chelsea on the moneyline at -280.

     Summary: Player ratings (1-10; 10 = best, players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating)Chelsea celebrate after Romelu Lukaku scored his first goal against Wolves.
Could have done more to stop Trincao cutting in for Wolves' goal.
Was dispossessed in the buildup to Wolves' goal then got in Rudiger's way as Trincao cut inside.
MF Ruben Loftus-Cheek, 7 -- Moved the ball well throughout and was unfortunate to have a goal ruled out for offside.
Capitalised on Wolves' mistake and slipped Lukaku through for the second goal.
