     Deaths of 3 Americans at Sandals resort in the Bahamas are under investigation, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Three Americans died of unknown causes Friday at a Sandals resort on the Bahamas' Great Exuma island, and police are investigating, officials said.
Two men and a woman died at the resort, and a fourth American -- a woman -- was airlifted to a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas' capital, Bahamian Acting Prime Minister Chester Cooper said Friday.
Though police are investigating, Cooper has been "advised that foul play is not suspected," he said.
But Sandals Resorts, operators of more than a dozen all-inclusive centers in the Atlantic and Caribbean, said three guests died Friday at Sandals Emerald Bay resort on Great Exuma.
Details about what led to the deaths, why the fourth American was taken to the hospital, whether that person was at the resort, the condition of that person and the Americans' names weren't released.
