    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the transaction is not quite completed as it’s pending regulatory approvals, this is essentially the first game of the new era, the first game since 2003 with an owner other than Roman Abramovich.
Incidentally, Tuchel’s first game was also a home game against Wolves.
That ended 0-0, so let’s try to do better this time around.
Lukaku and Pulisic both start!
Here we go!

     Todd Boehly Expected to Attend Chelsea vs Wolves After Signing Takeover Purchase Agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Todd Boehly is set to be in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon when Chelsea face Wolves in the Premier League.
The part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers took a major step to taking over the reigns in west London on Friday night after it was confirmed by the club that the purchase agreement had been signed.
Chelsea released a club statement in the early hours of Saturday morning making the Boehly agreement official.
This includes investments in Stamford Bridge, the Academy, the Women’s Team and Kingsmeadow and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation.
It will be the first time he attends a game since the purchase agreement was signed.

     Chelsea vs Wolves LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That constitutes £2.5bn to buy the shares of the club, along with a further £1.75bn committed to future spending in several areas including the women’s team, the academy and club infrastructure.
Details are still emerging over the full implications of the bid but a 10-year block on the sale of shares indicates this will be a long-term purchase, while the deal could go through around the end of the current Premier League season.
Conor Coady then struck deep into time added on to snatch a 2-2 draw for Wolves away at Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, heading home a cross from substitute Chiquinho in almost the last action of the game.
Wolves had trailed for much of the game after Chelsea’s out-of-form striker Romelu Lukaku scored twice in two second-half minutes before Francisco Trincao pulled one back and Coady claimed a point.
