    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Man United's Worst Ever Premier League Season Confirmed As Brighton Close In On Club RecordManchester United were thrashed 4-0 at Brighton on Saturday to guarantee that the 2021/22 season will end as their worst in Premier League history.
United's previous worst Premier League campaign came in 2013/14 when they lost 12 games, drew seven and won 19 to finish with 64 points.
As well as being their worst EPL season in terms of points won, United have also conceded more goals than ever before.
But while this has been United's worst season in terms of points for more than 30 years, it is on course to be Brighton's best ever campaign.
After thrashing United, Brighton have 47 points with two matches remaining.

     Manchester City’s Potential Contract Offer for Paul Pogba Revealed as Manchester United Exit Looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City are 'willing' to offer Paul Pogba a four-year contract if he completes a free transfer from Manchester United this summer.
Last night, a flurry of reports suggested Manchester City are interested in signing Paul Pogba, who is set to leave cross-town rivals Manchester United on a free transfer this summer.
IMAGO / Sportimage Pogba is reportedly earning £290,000 a week at United, but is set to walk away from the club this summer.
Alongside City, only Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are noted as having the financial muscle to offer the midfielder a suitable financial package.
Like previous reports have suggested, the reigning Premier League champions cannot offer Pogba anything until the season is complete, but it looks like there is serious interest from the blue side of Manchester.

     Summary: Could Paul Pogba be trading sides of Manchester?
According to the Daily Mail, Manchester City are interested in signing Pogba when his contract at Manchester United expires at the end of the year.
CBS Sports insider Fabrizio Romano adds that there is nothing advanced in the saga yet and that PSG are a team that is also courting Pogba.
The leader would be his teammate if the move to City came to fruition in de Bruyne with 56.
Of course, there is a risk that comes with adding Pogba to the team, but most of those are mitigated by him being added on a free transfer.
