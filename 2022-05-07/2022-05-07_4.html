     Mickey Gilley, Country Music Star Whose Club Inspired ‘Urban Cowboy,’ Dies at 86
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mickey Gilley, the hit singer and piano player whose Texas nightclub was the inspiration for the movie “Urban Cowboy” and the glittering country music revival that accompanied it, died on Saturday at a hospital in Branson, Mo.
His publicist, Zach Farnum, confirmed his death.
A cause of death was not immediately available.
A honey-toned singer with a warm, unhurried delivery, Mr. Gilley had 17 No.
But he was ultimately best known as the proprietor, with Sherwood Cryer, of Gilley’s, the Pasadena, Texas, honky-tonk that became one of the most storied nightspots in country music.
