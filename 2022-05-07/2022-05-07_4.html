    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Venezuelan jockey won his first graded stakes Saturday afternoon, and it just happened to be the Kentucky Derby.
It only happened because a late scratch opened the last spot in the field for the also-eligible Rich Strike.
Rich Strike left the starting gate as an 80-1 shot, and crossed the finish line as the second-longest longshot winner in the Derby’s history.
“I started to push just a little bit, you know, because (Rich Strike) is a little bit lazy.
I said, ‘I got a shot.’”Joel Rosario, aboard Epicenter, thought he had the race won when Leon passed him on the inside in the stretch run.
