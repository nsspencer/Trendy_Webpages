     Trump says he has 'transformed the face of the Republican Party' as he stumps for Oz in PA Senate primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President Donald Trump spoke Friday in Pennsylvania in support of senatorial candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.
Trump, who officially endorsed Oz in the Republican primary earlier this month, boasted during his speech that he "transformed" the GOP.
"Tuesday's primary results are just the latest proof that we have transformed the face of the Republican Party," said Trump.
TIFFANY TRUMP PLANNING NOVEMBER MAR-A-LAGO WEDDING TO FIANCE MICHAEL BOULOS: REPORTTrump went on to accuse previous incarnations of the Republican Party of forgetting average, working people in the U.S."We are now the working people's party, but we're really the party of everyone.
The senator's assessment comes days after Ohio senatorial candidate JD Vance – a former critic of Trump – won the Republican primary with the former president's endorsement.

     Scoop: McCormick attacks Trump-backed Dr. Oz in new ad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dave McCormick, who privately lobbied hard to win former President Trump’s blessing, is going after Trump for backing Dr. Oz in the country's hottest current race — the Pennsylvania GOP race for U.S. Senate.
Why it matters: Trump slammed McCormick Friday night at a rally in Pennsylvania.
Now McCormick is punching back in an ad you're seeing first on Axios — ridiculing the endorsement of Oz.
The big picture: Trump attacked McCormick for the first time Friday, at a rainy, muddy rally last night outside Pittsburgh.
Trump spent more time criticizing McCormick than he did praising Oz, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.

     Trump fans repeatedly boo Dr Oz and turn their backs on him at rally
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr Mehmet Oz, a Senate candidate endorsed by Donald Trump, received less than a warm welcome at the former president’s rally as the audience repeatedly booed him.
Even when Mr Trump spoke, calling the candidate his “friend,” the crowd’s reaction was resoundingly negative.
Last month, Mr Trump chose Dr Oz as his favored candidate in this year’s GOP primary for Pennsylvania’s next senator.
Again.”At Friday’s rally, when Dr Oz took the stage, the response was tepid at best.
“President Trump endorsed me ‘cause he said I was smart, tough, and I will never let you down,” Dr Oz said, his hair slicked back from the rain.

She wrote, "Now that he lost President Trump's endorsement, he's resorted to sad and desperate attacks that are no different than the tropes used against Catholics and Jews.

     Oz's Ties to Turkey Attacked in Pennsylvania's Senate Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mehmet Oz’s rivals in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for U.S. Senate are escalating their attacks on the celebrity heart surgeon’s connections to his parents’ native country of Turkey, raising it as a possible national security issue.
Trump is holding a rally with Oz in western Pennsylvania on Friday evening, coming off a big win in Ohio's Republican Senate primary.
Oz, who was born in the United States, holds Turkish citizenship, served in Turkey’s military and voted in its 2018 election, but says he would renounce his dual citizenship in Turkey if he is elected.
Senate historians have been unable to find a U.S. senator who maintained dual citizenship.
“I think we need to be careful about categorizing any American as a national security risk simply because of their ties to a foreign country,” Laufman said in an interview.

"President Trump's very popular in Pennsylvania — and with good reason, because his America First policies absolutely were great for Pennsylvanians and for Americans.
"We can always count on Dr. Oz to stand up for the United States and against communist China."

     Meadows texts reveal just how tight the Fox News-Trump embrace is
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, less conventionally, Trump’s White House was also getting guidance from some of Fox News’ best-known personalities, in a level of coordination rarely, if ever, seen in top-level politics.
The texts, revealed by CNN, show how the lines between Fox News and the Trump White House had become jarringly blurred in Trump’s final months.
The implications of a Fox News-Trump White House alignment are “scary”, said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, a media watchdog.
It’s not like the White House was coordinating with all the hosts back in the day,” Carusone said.
In this case, it was like a free-for-all.”The interaction between Fox News and Trump’s White House appears to have flowed both ways.
