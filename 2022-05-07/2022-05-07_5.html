     Summary: Liverpool had to come from behind to secure a point against Antonio Conte's side at Anfield after Son Heung-Min gave Spurs the lead in the second half before Luis Diaz equalised with a deflected strike.
Pep Guardiola's men can put Champions League heartbreak behind them on Sunday when they take on Eddie Howe's side at the Etihad Stadium to move three points ahead of Liverpool.
PLAYER RATINGS: Thiago Alcantara good but team-mate doesn't make impact vs SpursHAVE YOUR SAY: Rate the Liverpool players after Spurs drawFormer Liverpool defender Carragher took to Twitter to say: "Good game and a draw was a fair result, that point could still turn out to be important!
I always felt both teams would drop points so prove me right please Man City!"

     Son Heung-Min strikes heavy blow to Liverpool's quadruple dreams as stubborn Spurs frustrate Klopp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Chasing the perfect season, Liverpool required a perfect run-in.
Tottenham Hotspur had other ideas.
A dogged defensive display earned Spurs a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday, a result that took Liverpool top of the Premier League on goal difference.
Yet come the final day of the campaign, it may well be looked back on as the day that the title slipped away to Manchester City.
Should it be successful, Liverpool's dreams of becoming the first side ever to win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup will be extinguished.

     Summary: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said he “doesn’t like” the defensive style of Antonio Conte’s Tottenham Hotspur side.
Tottenham were always likely to be Liverpool’s toughest opponent in their title run-in, and so it proved to be.
“I think they're world-class, and I think they should do more for the game.
I think the game against Liverpool they had 36, 38 per cent possession.
Fine, absolutely fine.

     Liverpool 1-1 Tottenham: Tactical Breakdown | Jurgen Klopp Takes Jibe At Antonio Conte
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Liverpool's disappointing 1-1 draw against Tottenham, LFCTR take a look at the tactical breakdown in a match that has all but ended our race for the title.
IMAGO / PA ImagesAlong with a Rodrigo Bentancur andPierre-Emile Hojbjerg, the back five made sure they left a mark on the Liverpool players when making tackles.
Jurgen Klopp's tactics of heavy metal football and quick transition are just exceptional.
Liverpool played the hands of Tottenham, as they could stand up and clear the ball for another 90 minutes.
We saw clearly what Tottenham's approach to the game was and that's where Jurgen Klopp should've changed the way the team attacked.

     Jurgen Klopp gives verdict on Liverpool's quadruple chances after Tottenham stalemate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Reds could only manage a 1-1 stalemate with Spurs on Saturday night as Luis Diaz hit back following Son Heung-min's opener in the second half.
In contrast, the Reds were in European action on Tuesday and booked their spot in the Champions League final with an entertaining but taxing victory over Villarreal.
That is why the quadruple is so unlikely, there is a reason nobody has done it in this country.
Do Liverpool still have any chance of winning the quadruple this season?
Liverpool travel to Villa - who are managed by Anfield legend Steven Gerrard - on Tuesday night for their third-last league encounter of the season.

     Summary: Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was critical of Tottenham's tactics after their 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday, saying: "I don't like this kind of football."
Heung-Min Son's goal early in the second half had threatened to bring a first Premier League home defeat of the season for Klopp's side, before Luis Diaz levelled things up late on.
In November, not many people could believe Tottenham could fight to the end for the Champions League.
I want to get the points because it is important to have hope of the Champions League.
We are still in the race for the Champions League."
