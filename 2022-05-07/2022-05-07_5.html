     Dillon Brooks' Status For Grizzlies-Warriors Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dillon Brooks has been suspended for Game 3 between the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors on Saturday evening.
The Memphis Grizzlies are in California to take on the Golden State Warriors for Game 3 of their second-round playoff series on Saturday night, and for the game they will be without one of their best players.
Dillon Brooks was charged with a flagrant 2 foul on Gary Payton II in Game 2, which meant Brooks was ejected from the game in the first half.
The NBA then went the next step and suspended Brooks for Game 3.
While many can argue if suspending Brooks was right or wrong, it's just one game.

     Summary: Late in Game 3, Ja Morant suffered an apparent right knee injury after getting tied up with Jordan Poole.
Poole briefly grabbed Morant's knee, and after the game, the Grizzlies were pretty heated about the incident.
Klay Thompson wasn't having it with the Grizzlies' insinuations that Poole tried to hurt Morant.
"That's definitely playoff talk," Thompson said.
We play the game the right way.

     Warriors Win Game 3 in Blowout Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heart-breaking loss in Game 2, the Golden State Warriors were determined to make a statement Saturday night.
With a 142-112 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State did just that to take a 2-1 series lead in the second round of the Western Conference Playoffs.
Coming out of the break, the Warriors jumped out to a 15-point lead thanks to an 8-0 run fueled by two Klay Thompson three-pointers.
In addition to Thompson, the Warriors got another 25-point-plus game from Poole, who tallied 27 on the night.
With the huge win, the Warriors have a chance to take a 3-1 series lead Monday night when the tip off against Memphis for Game 4 at Chase Center.

     Summary: Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive is no stranger to big-time playoff games.
Well, Golden State Warriors playoff games, anyway.
And it's also entirely possible Ranadive wanted to check out how Brown, a Warriors assistant coach, operates in-person.
It's unclear if Brown would even take the Kings job, given how many coaches they've cycled through in recent years.
Alternatively, Ranadive might've just wanted to catch a good basketball game.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Stephen Curry scored 30 points, Klay Thompson had 21 and nine rebounds and the Golden State Warriors shut down Ja Morant’s supporting cast to embarrass the Memphis Grizzlies 142-112 on Saturday night for a 2-1 lead in the Western Conference semifinals.
Still bothered by Dillon Brooks’ hard foul in Game 2 that sidelined Gary Payton II, Draymond Green and Golden State kept cool from the opening tip — methodically running away with it.
Klay Thompson scored 21 points and had nine rebounds in Game 3.
Jordan Poole scored 27 points off the bench and Andrew Wiggins added 17 points for Golden State, which used a 10-0 run out of halftime to take command for good.
Curry missed his initial two shots then scored his first points of the game by making a big 3 with 0.9 left in the first as the Warriors trailed 28-26.

     Summary: (2:21)SAN FRANCISCO -- The Golden State Warriors almost made history on the way to their 142-112 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals.
Heading into Game 3, the Warriors emphasized the need to find their offensive rhythm, starting with better shot selection.
"When we're getting good shots, the chances of Klay getting hot are much greater," Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said.
In Game 3 he finally broke out, scoring 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4-of-6 from 3.
The Warriors look at their scoring onslaught in Game 3 as a blueprint of what they can do.
