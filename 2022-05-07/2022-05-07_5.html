     Mickey Gilley, musician whose club inspired the Travolta film ‘Urban Cowboy,’ dies at 86
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mickey Gilley, a musician who scored more than three dozen top-10 country hits and whose honky-tonk club inspired the 1980 film “Urban Cowboy” and the “cowboy chic” fashion trend that followed, died Saturday.
The Natchez, Miss., native, the son of Arthur Fillmore Gilley and Irene (Lewis) Gilley, grew up in Ferriday, La., and his cousins included musician Jerry Lee Lewis and televangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
(Gilley would later joke that “my cousin Jimmy Lee makes more money than both Jerry Lee and I put together.”)“The only reason I got into the music industry was because of Jerry Lee,” Gilley told The Times in 1994.
“Branson is the most amazing and exciting thing that’s happened to me in my lifetime,” Gilley told The Times in 1994.
“Of course, ‘Urban Cowboy’ and [Gilley’s club] were important, but I wasn’t in control of those situations.
