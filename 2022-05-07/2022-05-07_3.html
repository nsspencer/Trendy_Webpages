     Jordan Poole defends himself against Ja Morant injury insinuation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One moment from the Warriors' blowout win over the Memphis Grizzlies could determine how the remainder of the series plays out.
A reporter then handed Poole a phone with the video of the play, to which Poole watched and claimed it was nothing more than a "basketball play."
"Yeah it was a basketball play," Poole added.
I hit the ball and I was going for the ball and obviously, you don't want to see anybody get hurt.
When asked about Morant's now-deleted Tweet claiming that Poole "broke the code" on that play, the Warriors' guard offered a simple response.

     Jordan Poole denies intentionally injuring Ja Morant's knee after Grizzlies point guard limps off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja Morant appears to hurt his knee and shows his frustration on the bench by slamming down a cushion.
"We're going to ride for our own," Memphis forward Jaren Jackson Jr. said when asked about the team's feeling regarding the play with Poole.
That's not my type game."
When pressed about whether he thought Poole's grab was intentional, Jenkins said, "I don't know what goes through you guys' head.
Grizzlies point guard De'Anthony Melton said Morant has shaken off injuries before and he hopes the star will be ready to play in Game 4 on Monday.

     Ja Morant Injury Reignites Conversation On ‘The Code’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the game, Morant walked to the team bus with a pronounced limp, though without crutches.
Poole poked the ball loose from behind, then reached again with his right hand, but caught Morant’s knee instead.
“It was a basketball play,” Poole said, explaining the sequence.
Morant put up 34 points and seven assists before the injury, assembling another highlight reel of acrobatic layups while going 4-for-7 from the arc.
You know, `the code’—we're gonna talk about `the code’ all series at this point.”More NBA Coverage:

     Jordan Poole definitely grabbed and yanked Ja Morant's knee; whether he intended to hurt him isn't the point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Poole knocked the ball loose, and as Morant and Wiggins scrambled for possession, Poole pretty clearly grabbed Morant's right knee and pulled it backward.
You can't watch that video and arrive at any conclusion other than Poole definitely grabbed hold of Morant's knee and pulled it backward.
Had Poole grabbed Morant's jersey and yanked him back, it just would've been a foul.
Is Morant hurt?
Was Poole trying to hurt Morant?
