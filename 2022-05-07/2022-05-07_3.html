     Warriors Win Game 3 in Blowout Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heart-breaking loss in Game 2, the Golden State Warriors were determined to make a statement Saturday night.
With a 142-112 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State did just that to take a 2-1 series lead in the second round of the Western Conference Playoffs.
Coming out of the break, the Warriors jumped out to a 15-point lead thanks to an 8-0 run fueled by two Klay Thompson three-pointers.
In addition to Thompson, the Warriors got another 25-point-plus game from Poole, who tallied 27 on the night.
With the huge win, the Warriors have a chance to take a 3-1 series lead Monday night when the tip off against Memphis for Game 4 at Chase Center.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive is no stranger to big-time playoff games.
Well, Golden State Warriors playoff games, anyway.
And it's also entirely possible Ranadive wanted to check out how Brown, a Warriors assistant coach, operates in-person.
It's unclear if Brown would even take the Kings job, given how many coaches they've cycled through in recent years.
Alternatively, Ranadive might've just wanted to catch a good basketball game.

     Five Questions: Grizzlies vs Warriors Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two hotly contested games in Memphis, the Grizzlies are heading to the Bay for game three against the Golden State Warriors.
Before game three, Brady Klopfer (@BradyKlopferNBA) of SB Nation’s Golden State of Mind offered some insight into the very intriguing game three matchup.
Ja Morant had 47 points in the last game, how can the Warriors slow him down in game three without Gary Payton II?
The Warriors are going to have to take some tips from how other teams — including the Grizzlies — guard Curry.
It’s possible that with Brooks out, the Grizzlies resort to shooters who handle the Warriors defense a little bit better.
