     Summary: Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive is no stranger to big-time playoff games.
Well, Golden State Warriors playoff games, anyway.
And it's also entirely possible Ranadive wanted to check out how Brown, a Warriors assistant coach, operates in-person.
It's unclear if Brown would even take the Kings job, given how many coaches they've cycled through in recent years.
Alternatively, Ranadive might've just wanted to catch a good basketball game.

     Warriors Win Game 3 in Blowout Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heart-breaking loss in Game 2, the Golden State Warriors were determined to make a statement Saturday night.
With a 142-112 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State did just that to take a 2-1 series lead in the second round of the Western Conference Playoffs.
Coming out of the break, the Warriors jumped out to a 15-point lead thanks to an 8-0 run fueled by two Klay Thompson three-pointers.
In addition to Thompson, the Warriors got another 25-point-plus game from Poole, who tallied 27 on the night.
With the huge win, the Warriors have a chance to take a 3-1 series lead Monday night when the tip off against Memphis for Game 4 at Chase Center.

     Warriors offense carves up Grizzlies on way to 30-point win; Ja Morant leaves with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That sequence summed up the night: The Warriors got the shots they wanted against far too little defensive resistance.
Stephen Curry finished with 30 points on 14 shots, Poole had 27 off the bench, and the Warriors blew out the Grizzlies 142-112.
He limped off the court in the middle of the fourth quarter after tweaking his knee against a Warriors double-team.
As the Grizzlies’ shooting evened out, the Warriors couldn’t seem to miss, hitting 71.1% of their first-half shots.
The Grizzlies’ offense was not the problem, although if Morant is injured shot creation could be an issue next game.

     Warriors vs. Grizzlies: Golden State rides historic true-shooting night to a blowout victory in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the early going of Game 3 vs. the Grizzlies on Saturday, the Golden State Warriors' sin was a familiar one: Turnovers.
Golden State finished the game shooting 63 percent, including 53 percent from 3.
When you're putting up 63-53-90 shooting splits as a team and you're taking more shots than your opponent, you're going to win.
If two of them have it going, as Thompson and Poole did on Saturday, the Warriors can beat anyone.
If all three of them have it going at the same time, the Warriors are going to kill teams.

     Summary: What we learned as Warriors demolish Grizzlies in Game 3 originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaSAN FRANCISCO -- Home sweet home.
The Grizzlies started the game on fire, with their first 18 points all coming from 3-pointers as the Warriors fell into an early hole.
The Warriors then turned the ball over just twice in the third quarter and led by 21 points going into the fourth quarter.

This is the exact version of Klay the Warriors were looking for, and he returned for a huge Game 3 win.
