     3 adjustments for the Milwaukee Bucks after first two games vs. Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics are two games into their second round series thus far, and it is still anybody’s to take, as it is tied up 1-1.
Both the Bucks and Celtics have felt the wrath of the other’s elite defense, as neither team has cracked 110 points in two games.
As the series shifts back to Milwaukee, here are three adjustments the Bucks should make to regain the upper hand.
The Bucks must get out and run after every defensive rebound, and convert on their opportunities when Boston turns it over.
And if Giannis does have the ball at the top of the key, the Bucks must run actions alongside that.
