     Watch Klay Thompson's One-Legged Three-Pointer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson hit an incredible three-pointer in Game 3 between the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors.
The Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies are facing off in Game 3 of their second-round playoff series on Saturday night at Chase Center, and during the game Klay Thompson hit an incredible three-pointer.
The five-time NBA All-Star hit the shot off one leg, which was very impressive.
Prior to those two seasons without making the playoffs they had won three NBA Championships and made five straight NBA Finals.
Ironically, Thompson had missed the last two seasons due to injuries, so he has still made five straight trips to the NBA Finals.

     Warriors And Grizzlies Game 3 Injury Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies have announced their injury reports for Game 3 of their second-round playoff series on Saturday night in San Francisco.
The Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies are facing off for Game 3 of their second-round playoff series on Saturday night in San Francisco, and for the game the two teams have announced their injury reports.
The Warriors won the first game, and then the Grizzlies responded in the second game with a 106-101 win.
The Grizzlies will be without Dillon Brooks for Game 3, because he was suspended for his flagrant 2 foul on Gary Payton II in Game 2.
Draymond Green also picked up a flagrant 2 foul in the series (Game 1) and was ejected, but the call was questionable.

     Otto Porter Jr. finding shot could be Warriors key vs. Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another option that's a bit of a wild-card but could make sense is bringing Otto Porter Jr. in off the bench.
But unlocking one specific part of his game could give the Warriors a major edge: His shot.
The Warriors went 5-10 in games Porter played after the All-Star break.
In the Warriors' Game 2 loss Tuesday night in Memphis, Porter was a game-high plus-17 in 21 minutes off the bench.
He isn't just missing contested shots, he's missing wide-open ones.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN's Stephen A. Smith called out Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson on Saturday during a mid-day NBA Countdown segment, yell-talking his way through a take that essentially amounted to "Klay has been bad."
"If Klay Thompson doesn’t show up, that does not help the Golden State Warriors," Smith said.
Klay Thompson is at 13.5 points.
Klay Thompson is shooting 29 percent from the field and 22 percent from three point range.
Since Game 4 of an otherwise spectacular Nuggets series, Thompson has seriously struggled.

     Five Questions: Grizzlies vs Warriors Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two hotly contested games in Memphis, the Grizzlies are heading to the Bay for game three against the Golden State Warriors.
Before game three, Brady Klopfer (@BradyKlopferNBA) of SB Nation’s Golden State of Mind offered some insight into the very intriguing game three matchup.
Ja Morant had 47 points in the last game, how can the Warriors slow him down in game three without Gary Payton II?
The Warriors are going to have to take some tips from how other teams — including the Grizzlies — guard Curry.
It’s possible that with Brooks out, the Grizzlies resort to shooters who handle the Warriors defense a little bit better.

     Warriors-Grizzlies: If Golden State can't stop Ja Morant, should it hunt him more on defense in Game 3?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So far, the Warriors have played it pretty straight with Morant, who nuked them for 47 points in Game 2.
They're not doubling him very often on the offensive end, just as they're not singling him out very often on the defensive end.
Here it's Morant's man, Poole, screening for Curry, forcing Morant to defend Curry one on one.
Here Draymond Green sees Morant on Andrew Wiggins and leads him right into a post-up.
Over the course of a game, these energy savings add up to a fresh Morant at the end, when he completely took over in Game 2 and pretty much single-handedly defeated Golden State.
