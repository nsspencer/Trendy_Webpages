    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speaking during his press conference following our defeat away at Brighton, the German pointed to the positives on the horizon.
Rangnick was optimistic about the impact incoming manager Erik Ten Hag will have and also added that he can “fully trust the board” to make the changes needed for better results next term.
“This has to be done at the end of the season,” he said.
“I’m still very positive that with Erik Ten Hag we have a top manager next season and I’m also pretty sure the board has already made some changes and there will be more changes to come in the summer.

     Man United's worst EPL season ever confirmed by Brighton loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Man United's Worst Ever Premier League Season Confirmed As Brighton Close In On Club RecordManchester United were thrashed 4-0 at Brighton on Saturday to guarantee that the 2021/22 season will end as their worst in Premier League history.
United's previous worst Premier League campaign came in 2013/14 when they lost 12 games, drew seven and won 19 to finish with 64 points.
As well as being their worst EPL season in terms of points won, United have also conceded more goals than ever before.
But while this has been United's worst season in terms of points for more than 30 years, it is on course to be Brighton's best ever campaign.
After thrashing United, Brighton have 47 points with two matches remaining.

     Summary: Manchester United's abysmal Premier League campaign hit a new low on Saturday night as they fell to a 4-0 loss at the hands of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.
With the loss, Man United are officially out of contention for a spot in the Champions League, and it couldn't have been in worse fashion.
United looked afraid to be out there and, in a general sense, didn't appear to care about any sort of intensive attacking moves.

Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't the only Manchester United player who had a bad day in the office on Saturday against Brighton.
