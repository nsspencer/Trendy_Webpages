    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An arrest warrant was issued in Texas for former NFL star Earl Thomas after he allegedly violated a protective order by sending threatening messages to a woman about her and her kids.
The warrant was issued April 27 and charged Thomas, 33, with a third-degree felony, the Austin American-Statesman reported, citing court records.
Thomas allegedly violated a protective order that was issued in May 2021 that limited him to communicating with the woman through a co-parenting phone application.
But the woman told authorities Thomas refuses to download the app.

     Earl Thomas Has Arrest Warrant Issued in Texas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of Friday afternoon, Thomas had not been booked into the Travis County jail.
The arrest warrant comes shortly after the 33-year-old Thomas told ESPNâ€™s Adam Schefter on April 22 that he wants to pursue a return to the NFL.
Trey Dolezal, who represents Thomas in his ongoing divorce, told the paper that the arrest warrant stems from Thomas reaching out to his wife to see their children.
Nina Thomas filed for divorce from Earl Thomas in November 2020.
She was charged with first-degree felony burglary of a residence with intent to commit aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
