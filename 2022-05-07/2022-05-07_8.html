     Watch New Chelsea Owner Todd Boehly Celebrate After Romelu Lukaku Ends Goals Drought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Chelsea owner Todd Boehly was animated in the executive box at Stamford Bridge on Saturday after witnessing Romelu Lukaku end his goal drought.
The Belgian striker netted twice in three second-half minutes as Chelsea seemingly took control of their EPL home clash with Wolves.
After sending Wolves keeper Jose Sa the wrong way to give Chelsea a 1-0 lead on 56 minutes, Lukaku was mobbed by his teammates.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lukaku netted twice in a two-minute span early in the second half in a rare start in the league for the Belgium striker.
Lukaku has struggled in the first season of his second spell at Chelsea after being the club’s headline summer signing at a record fee of $135 million.
And where it was once Abramovich — the owner for 19 years — celebrating Chelsea’s goals, now it was Boehly standing up to applaud Lukaku.
His second goal was more impressive after being fed by Christian Pulisic following a poor pass out from the back by Conor Coady.
Chelsea controlled the match in the first half but was disallowed goals by Timo Werner and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

     Chelsea Soccer Club Bought by Todd Boehly-Led Group in $5 Billion Deal, Ending Abramovich Era

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A consortium led by Todd Boehly has struck a deal reportedly worth £4.25 billion ($5.24 billion) to acquire top English Premier League soccer club Chelsea FC, one of the highest price tags ever agreed for a sports club in history.
He is also an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Sparks.
“Chelsea Football Club can confirm that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjoerg Wyss, to acquire the Club,” Chelsea FC said in a statement early Saturday, local time.
Chelsea FC has been up for sale since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to the U.K. government imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs, including club owner Roman Abramovich.
Chelsea won the Champions League in 2021, and under Ambramovich has won 19 major league trophies to date.

     Chelsea: Todd Boehly consortium signs £4.25bn agreement to buy club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have confirmed Todd Boehly’s consortium has agreed terms to buy the Premier League club from Roman Abramovich in a £4.25 billion takeover.
Abramovich put the club up for sale in March and was then sanctioned by the UK government following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The club added: “The sale is expected to be complete in late May subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.
And the sale of the club is still subject to the Premier League's owners’ and directors’ test.
The agreement means Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Boehly, who is expected to attend Chelsea’s match against Wolves at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, has won an exceptionally dramatic and public race to buy the Premier League club.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Chelsea’s frailties quickly became apparent after Wolves substitute Francisco Trincao scored in the 79th minute, triggering a nervous finale for the Blues.
They seemed to have just about held but in the 97th minute Wolves defender Conor Coady headed home with almost the last touch of the match.
Television cameras showed Boehly in an executive box celebrating Chelsea’s goals earlier in the game but looking on, apparently mystified, as the Blues threw away their lead.
Coach Thomas Tuchel highlighted his side’s lack of discipline, which allowed Wolves back into the game on Saturday, but dismissed suggestions that the ownership uncertainty was to blame for his side’s recent stumbling form.
“We still hope for a positive outcome and of course that this situation is solved,” Tuchel said.
