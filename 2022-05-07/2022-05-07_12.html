     Summary: Watch Sam Kerr Win WSL Title For Chelsea With Two Amazing Volleys In Final Day Win Over Man UnitedChelsea survived a final-day wobble to win their third consecutive FA Women's Super League title thanks to two moments of Sam Kerr magic.
Kerr and Co needed to match or better the result achieved by Arsenal away at West Ham.
But Kerr got Chelsea level against United within 47 seconds of the restart courtesy of a fine left-footed strike into the top corner.
Chelsea's players mobbed Kerr - who had now scored 30 goals in all competitions this season - in celebration.
But that result was only enough to see the Gunners finish the season on 55 points, one behind champions Chelsea.

     Revealed: Thomas Tuchel's Home Premier League Win Record Since Chelsea Appointment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel's Premier League win record at Stamford Bridge has been revealed - and it is not what many would expect.
The German tactician arrived in west London back in January 2021, succeeding former Blues manager and club legend Frank Lampard.
Squawka took to Twitter to reveal that the former Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund manager has a 48.1% win rate in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge as Blues manager.
This statistic comes following a poor run of form at home for Chelsea, with the west London side having won just one game at Stamford Bridge since March.
The Blues have also won just two of the last seven Premier League outings, putting their race for third place in serious jeopardy as Arsenal look to close the gap.

     Summary: Arsenal, who beat West Ham United 2-0, finished second on 56 points, one behind Chelsea, and Manchester City grabbed the final Champions League spot by beating Reading to finish third.
Birmingham City were the only side relegated from the 12-team division, and they will be replaced next season by Liverpool.
Arsenal had needed Chelsea to drop points to have any chance of snatching the title, and their win over West Ham was in vain.
Manchester City thumped Reading 4-0 to secure the third Champions League spot at the expense of Manchester United, who finished fourth.
Birmingham's 11-year spell as a top-flight club ended in midweek when a 6-0 thrashing by Manchester City condemned them to the drop, and they signed off with a 1-0 win over Aston Villa.

Kerr’s double, sandwiching a close-range effort from Guro Reiten, took her season tally to 20 and secured Chelsea a third consecutive title.
The problem was that, in Manchester United, Chelsea were playing a team with a chance of reaching the Champions League for the first time.
