     George Pérez Dies: Acclaimed Comic Book Artist For ‘Crisis On Infinite Earths’ Was 67
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George Pérez, whose work for Marvel and DC made him one of the most acclaimed comic book artists over the last five decades, died today at age 67 of complications from pancreatic cancer.
Pérez worked on many top titles during his long career, including launching the New Teen Titans in 1980 with writer Marv Wolfman (they created Cyborg, Raven and Starfire and had Dick Grayson become Nightwing).
Perez is also credited with rebooting Wonder Woman in 1987, and for two separate runs with the Avengers series.
Born in the South Bronx of New York City on June 9, 1954, Pérez went to work as a studio assistant at Marvel before he turned 20.
Pérez’s first published comic book work came in 1974, Deathlok in Astonishing Tales #25 in 1974.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George Pérez, the legendary comic book artist for Marvel and DC, has died after battling pancreatic cancer.
The announcement came on Free Comic Book Day, a day dedicated to making a handful of comic titles free at locations around the country.
According to the statement, it was a day Pérez "absolutely loved."
Pérez retired from comic book production almost three years ago after his vision began failing.
Studios offered him the chance to be creative again after beginning to feel unfulfilled with his former homes, Marvel Comics and DC Comics.

     R.I.P. legendary comics artist George Pérez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A legendary comics artist and writer whose work defined the looks of many of both DC and Marvel’s biggest comics from the mid-’70s onward, Pérez was celebrated for runs on Avengers, New Teen Titans, Superman, Wonder Woman, and more.
In 1975, he moved into the big leagues when he took over art duties on Avengers.
Pérez ultimately only drew half of the series, before duties were returned to Silver Surfer artist Ron Lim.
Even so, Pérez was still, well, George Pérez.
Pérez continued to produce comic art up through the mid-2010s, until health issues forced him to finally formally retire in 2019.
