     Summary: PHOENIX -- Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone's return to the Octagon will have to wait.
The 39-year-old veteran was scheduled to return from a one-year layoff on Saturday, in a lightweight bout against Joe Lauzon at UFC 274 inside Footprint Center.
Cerrone (36-16) was pulled from the bout hours before, however, because of food poisoning.

     Summary: Joe Lauzon’s highly-anticipated fight with Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone at UFC 274 has been canceled after Cerrone had to withdraw with a non-COVID related illness.

“Because he was throwing up, he couldn’t keep food down.
He felt terrible.
It was to be Lauzon’s first fight since October 2019, when the Bridgewater resident defeated Jonathan Pearce 1:33 into the first round at UFC Boston at TD Garden.

     UFC 274: Donald Cerrone withdraws from bout with Joe Lauzon with non-COVID illness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The planned UFC 274 lightweight battle between Donald Cerrone and Joe Lauzon has been scrapped hours before the fighters were set to make their cage walk.
UFC commentator Jon Anik confirmed the news during the preliminary broadcast for the event, stating that Cerrone had a non-COVID illness.
Cerrone, who is tied for the most wins in UFC history, was looking for his first win since May 4, 2019.
The fight was originally planned for UFC Fight Night on June 25 but was moved to the UFC 274 card.
Cerrone had said the fight demanded a bigger stage than the UFC Apex but his illness could potentially push it back to the original date.
