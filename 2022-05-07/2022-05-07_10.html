     Alba last-gasp goal lifts Barcelona to 2-1 victory at Betis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APBARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Winding down a difficult season, Barcelona pulled out a 2-1 victory at Real Betis after Jordi Alba struck a last-gasp winner on Saturday.
Barcelona strengthened its hold on second place in the Spanish league behind newly crowned champion Real Madrid, which clinched the title last weekend.
The loss for Betis dealt a blow to its hopes of qualifying for the Champions League with a top-four finish.
Atlético Madrid, in fourth, was three points ahead of Betis in fifth before it hosts Real Madrid in a derby on Sunday.
The cup rewarded Betis with a Europa League spot next season that it wants to upgrade to a Champions League ticket.

     Barcelona clinch Champions League berth with win over Betis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sports Desk, May 7 (EFE).- Jordi Alba’s goal in stoppage time powered Barcelona 2-1 over Real Betis on Saturday, a result that ensures the Blaugrana will finish no lower than fourth in LaLiga and can count on competing in the 2022-2023 Champions League.
Barça are now second with 69 points, 11 better than fifth-place Betis, who have just three games left in a season that saw Real Madrid run away with the title.
Betis, the 2022 Copa del Rey winners, may yet get into the top four, but it will have to be at the expense of Sevilla (64 points) or Atletico Madrid.
The home side equalized just three minutes later as former Barcelona man Marc Bartra headed in Nabil Fekir’s free kick.
The match was in the 94th minute when Betis suffered a defensive lapse that allowed Alba to win it for Barcelona.

     Summary: Barcelona qualify for Champions LeagueBarcelona qualified for next season’s Champions League with their 2-1 win over Real Betis on Saturday, something that at one point earlier in the campaign looked like being a real challenge.
The Brazilian, who was only making his fourth appearance of the season, came in for the ill Marc-Andre ter Stegen and put in a fine performance in the Barcelona goal.
It was not the cleanest strike Fati will ever hit but it was enough to trundle past Rui Silva in the Betis goal.
pic.twitter.com/qGtM3GHVdM — OptaJose (@OptaJose) May 7, 2022Xavi was full of praise for the teenager after the game, making it clear just how highly he rates the attacker.
Barca have scored 14 times in the final five minutes and those goals have accounted for 17 of their 69 points.
