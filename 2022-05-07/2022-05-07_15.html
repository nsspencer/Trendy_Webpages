     Watch Arcade Fire Perform ‘The Lightning I, II’ and ‘Unconditional (Lookout Kid)’ on ‘SNL’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arcade Fire were the musical guests on last night’s episode of Saturday Night Live, where they performed two songs from their sixth LP WE.
After performing lead single ‘The Lightning I, II’, vocalist Win Butler returned to the mic to speak out in support of abortion rights: “A woman’s right to choose forever and ever and ever.
Amen.” The Canadian group later delivered a performance of ‘Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)’, which ended with the singer telling his mom he loved her.
This was Arcade Fire’s fifth time appearing on SNL; they previously performed on the show in 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2018.
The band recently announced a world tour in support of the album.
