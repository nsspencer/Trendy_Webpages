Jennifer Grey is letting the world know her truth and within that truth, all the details fans have been questioning for years.
Back on August 5, 1987, she and Ferris Bueller co-star Matthew Broderick were in a fatal car crash in Ireland that ended up killing two people, including a mother and a daughter, instantly.
Broderick was convicted of careless driving and the incident left Grey with survivor’s guilt, which led to her career hiatus.
In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Grey recalled the incident, saying, “The car accident in Ireland was, I would say, top three traumas of my life, maybe top one.
