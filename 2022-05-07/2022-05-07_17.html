     3 takeaways from the Florida Panthers’ Game 3 loss to the Washington Capitals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostThe Florida Panthers find themselves in a 2-1 series hole after the Washington Capitals shut them down to the tune of a 6-1 win in Game 3 of their first-round Stanley Cup Playoff matchup.
Washington tied it up with 26 seconds to go as T.J. Oshie tipped in a big slap shot from Ovechkin just seven seconds after MacKenzie Weegar took a holding the stick penalty.
Both of the Capitals’ power play goals came off of Ovechkin slap shots — the first being deflected by Oshie and the second being a clean slap shot where he was left wide open.
Florida made a chance to their top power play unit after they went without a quality scoring chance on their first opportunity.
It did not help, as they finished the game 0-3 on the power play with a combined four shots, four scoring chances and just one high-danger chance.

     Summary: Capitals contain, frustrate Panthers to win Game 3 handilyScrolling through social media, you’d think that the Capitals just eliminated the Panthers from the playoffs.
While the Panthers broke through in a Game 2 win, the Capitals did a good-to-great job locking things down in both Game 1 and 3.
Interestingly, the Panthers generated the same Fenwick For advantage in both Game 2 and Game 3 (41-27).
The difference was that the Capitals limited the quality of the Panthers’ chances, as Washington generated nine high-danger chances to eight for Florida.

     The underdog Capitals are putting the top-seeded Panthers to the test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not so much the 6-1 drubbing the Washington Capitals placed around the neck of the Florida Panthers, but the yoke that now rests on the Panthers’ shoulders.
The hockey intellectuals didn’t have the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Panthers either trailing in this series or being run off the ice.
“When we stepped into playoff hockey after being so far ahead — us, at that time, slowed down a little bit before the playoffs,” Oshie said.
But playing the role of the 2010, 2016 and 2017 Washington Capitals just might be the 2022 Florida Panthers.
Maybe that’s easier to do when the hockey-watching world looked at a 5-1 Panthers win and thought it was akin to a market correction.
