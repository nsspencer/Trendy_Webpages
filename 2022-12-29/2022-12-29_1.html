     Summary: Hilton had another nice catch early in this game on third-and-7 at the Titans' 37-yard line.
But on first down at the Cowboys' 21-yard line, Donovan Wilson sacked Joshua Dobbs for a 4-yard loss to halt the momentum.
Instead, the Cowboys took a 17-6 lead after a Dalton Schultz touchdown catch following the pass interference.
Roughing the passer on Titans – After Hilton had extended the drive with a catch-and-run for 28 yards on third down, it was more penalty yards against the Titans.
From there, the Cowboys continued the drive and padded their lead with another touchdown catch by Schultz, his second of the game.

     Summary: In fact, I went around the locker room after the game and heard the players singing a little different tunes.
Others said, "We know we didn't play our best ball."
They didn't play their best game of the season – by far.
It was a weird game all week long because of those odd circumstances for both teams, and that's exactly what you got on the field – a weird game with weird plays.
The Cowboys won the game and now have 12 regular-season wins for the second straight year.

     Game Recap: Cowboys Defeat Titans, 27-13
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Throw in Titans quarterback Joshua Dobbs making his first career start and this had the makings of a Dallas blowout.
Turnovers, dropped passes and lapses in the defensive secondary kept the shorthanded Titans within reach until the final quarter.
But while the pair combined for 32 runs, the sledding was tough against the Titans front, Dallas averaging only 2.7 yards per carry.
First QuarterThe Cowboys got things going on their second possession when they took over at their own 29-yard line.
To get there, the Cowboys went 47 yards in eight plays, Prescott connecting on all four of his pass attempts for 28 yards.
