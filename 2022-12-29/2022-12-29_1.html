     Greta Thunberg vs. Andrew Tate: Twitter 'Loss' Sees Wikipedia Edit Go Viral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A tweet claiming to show an altered Wikipedia entry showing controversial martial artist-turned-influencer Andrew Tate was knocked out in a kickboxing match with climate activist Greta Thunberg has gone viral on social media.
He said: "Whatever the temptation, Wikipedia vandalism is a very bad thing, so don't do it.
Not even to Andrew Tate's page, because it's not alpha behavior."
Former victims of Wikipedia vandalism include former President Donald Trump, whose page was deleted entirely in July 2015.
As of Thursday afternoon, Tate has not responded to the tweet or the supposed alteration to his Wikipedia page.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greta Thunberg had a response ready when influencer Andrew Tate tried to brag about his carbon emissions.
In a Twitter post shared on Dec. 27, Tate — who has been banned from many social media platforms for misogynistic content — decided, unprompted, to let Thunberg know how many cars he owns.
In a reply that has since racked up over 2.5 million likes, Thunberg wrote, "yes, please do enlighten me.
Initially, all Tate — who has been open about his desire to attract "haters" on social media — had to say to Thunberg's reply was, "How dare you?!"
Over the past few years, he has garnered a horde of followers as his popularity on social media has skyrocketed.

     Men’s Rights Influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate Detained in Romania on Human Trafficking Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Men’s rights internet personalities and brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate were detained on Thursday by Romanian prosecutors on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organized crime group, according to Reuters.
Andrew had a small stint as a professional kickboxer before he was invited to star on the 2016 U.K. version of Big Brother.
Editor’s picks“The media is spinning a false image of me, on repeat, and instagram bowing to pressure is a massive shame,” Tate said.
At the time no arrests were made, but authorities said the investigation was ongoing; police reported finding one American woman and one Romanian woman in the villa.
Before he moved to Romania, several other women accused him of abuse, and he implied that he was moving to Romania for its lax approach to law enforcement.

     Andrew Tate Mocked After Pizza Tweet to Thunberg May Have Led to Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate has reportedly been detained in Romania in connection to a human-trafficking investigation.
Tate's arrest was announced a day after an exchange between Tate and 19-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg went viral on Twitter.
"His ridiculous video yesterday featured a pizza from a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry's Pizza, confirming he was in the country."
It is unclear at this time if the pizza box did indeed help lead Romanian authorities to Tate's location.
Mikael Thalen, tech reporter for the Daily Dot, wrote on Twitter that "No evidence so far proves Andrew Tate was located due to his tweet showing a Romanian pizza box."
