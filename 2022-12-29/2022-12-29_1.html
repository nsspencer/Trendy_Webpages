     Misogynist Influencer Andrew Tate’s Rough Week Capped by Romanian Rape Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inquam Photos/Octav Ganea via REUTERSJust a day after being roasted by teen activist Greta Thunberg, far-right influencer Andrew Tate was arrested Thursday in Romania on human trafficking and rape allegations.
Reuters also obtained photos of Tate’s arrest, showing the online personality in a black leather jacket and hoodie being perp-walked by police in tactical gear.
The official footage showed heavily armed cops storming luxury homes and compiling cash, guns, bars of gold and expensive cars.
Romania TV reported that one of the Romanian suspects was a former Bucharest policewoman who is dating one of the Tates.
Adding insult to injury, Tate’s sad attempt to clap back at Thunberg on Thursday may have actually led police to his front door.
