    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have been arrested by authorities at their villa residence in Romania and taken into custody, according to reports by Romanian media.
The news outlet Libertatea initially reported that Romanian police carried out the raid in connection with the kidnapping of two girls.
The two British men have been detained for 24 hours, and are being investigated on rape and human trafficking allegations.

     MAGA blow hard Andrew Tate arrested for rape and human trafficking
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MAGA influencer and former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate — along with his brother Tristan and two other suspects — was detained on Thursday under suspicion of human trafficking and rape.
During the exchange, Tate bragged to Thunberg about his 33 cars and "their emissions," a taunt which the young activist dismissed with one KO of a reply.
Reporter Alejandra Caraballo speculated on Thursday that Tate's return to Twitter may have aided in his arrest.
"Romanian authorities needed proof that Andrew Tate was in the country so they reportedly used his social media posts," says Caraballo.
"His ridiculous video yesterday featured a pizza from a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry's Pizza, confirming he was in the country.

     Misogynist Influencer Andrew Tate’s Rough Week Capped by Romanian Rape Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just a day after being roasted by teen activist Greta Thunberg, misogynist MAGA influencer Andrew Tate was arrested Thursday in Romania on human trafficking and rape allegations.
Reuters also obtained photos of Tate’s arrest, showing the online personality in a black leather jacket and hoodie being perp-walked by police in tactical gear.
The official footage showed heavily armed cops storming luxury homes and compiling cash, guns, bars of gold and expensive cars.
Romania TV reported that one of the Romanian suspects was a former Bucharest policewoman who is dating one of the Tates.
Then in August, he was kicked off Facebook and Instagram, and shut down a money-making program for his followers: Hustler’s University.

     Andrew Tate Reportedly Arrested in Romania in Rape Investigation the Day After Posting Greta Thunberg Clapback Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Tate, a controversial media personality and former professional kickboxer, has reportedly been arrested in Romania by anti-terrorism authorities.
Andrew and Tristan Tate are being investigated for human trafficking and rape and will reportedly be taken to DIICOT (Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism) for questioning.
Earlier this week, Andrew Tate tagged 19-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in a tweet, bragging about his 33 cars.
On Wednesday, Tate responded to Thunberg in a video, in which he eats pizza from a box labeled “Jerry’s Pizza,” a Romanian restaurant chain.
The Tate brothers started a webcam business in which they sold “fake sob stories” to male callers.

     Andrew Tate, Brother Arrested in Connection to Human-Trafficking Case in Romania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate has been arrested in Romania in connection with human trafficking, rape and forming an organized crime group, officials confirmed to multiple news outlets.
While the suspects were not identified in the press release, a lawyer for Andrew, 36, confirmed to Sky News he and his brother, Tristan Tate, were detained.
The two British-Americans were arrested alongside two Romanian suspects, according to the press release.
The American woman told investigators she met Tristan through a social media network and convinced her to buy a plane ticket to Romania.
He is known now as a divisive figure who espouses misogynistic views, which have gotten him removed from social media platforms.
