     Titans expected to start QB Josh Dobbs; Malik Willis to serve as backup against the Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tennessee Titans have two of their quarterbacks on the sideline for their Week 17 matchup Thursday night.
Veteran starter Ryan Tannehill was already on the shelf due to a recent ankle injury, but now rookie quarterback Malik Willis is also expected to sit out against the Dallas Cowboys.
The team will start recently signed quarterback Joshua Dobbs, according to a report from CBS Sports.

     Summary: Joshua Dobbs gave the Tennessee Titans more than they'd been getting at quarterback, but that still wasn't enough to end the losing streak.
The Titans lost 27-13 to the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday at Nissan Stadium, their sixth straight loss.
Henry was one of seven Titans starters who sat out Thursday's game who otherwise might have been able to play had this game affected the Titans' playoff picture.

     Titans to start QB Joshua Dobbs vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans officially placed Tannehill on injured reserve Thursday, meaning he will have to miss at least four games before he could return.
Two of those starters who were ruled out -- linebackers Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham -- were placed on injured reserve Thursday.
Dupree missed five games earlier this season after injuring a hip before a pectoral injury landed him on injured reserve.
He missed six consecutive games with an elbow injury after being placed on injured reserve in November.
The Titans activated Cunningham from injured reserve last week only to have him reinjure the elbow against the Houston Texans.

     Dobbs to Start vs. Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – Quarterback Josh Dobbs will make his first NFL start when the Tennessee Titans play host to the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football, sources confirmed to All Titans.
The decision to start Dobbs – a former University of Tennessee star – over rookie quarterback Malik Willis is a surprise, even though tonight’s game is meaningless in the Titans’ pursuit of the AFC South crown.
There are at least a couple of ways to look at the decision to start Dobbs, who was signed off the Detroit Lions’ practice squad on Dec. 21.
Willis might start that game or conceivably back up Tannehill if Tannehill is able to return from the ankle injury.
In four seasons at the University of Tennessee, Dobbs completed 614-of-999 passes (61 percent) for 7,138 yards (11.6 yards per completion).

     QB Josh Dobbs Sparked the Titans, But It Wasn't Enough in a 27-13 Loss to the Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – The Titans put a new quarterback – Josh Dobbs – in the saddle against the Cowboys.
But in the end, Dobbs and the Titans just didn't have enough firepower – and they made too many mistakes -- in a 27-13 loss at Nissan Stadium.
The former University of Tennessee star kept the football for a souvenir following his touchdown, since it was his first career touchdown pass.
Then, on the final play of the half, the Titans got a 29-yard field goal from Bullock to make it 10-6 at the break.
Another Maher field goal, this one from 45 yards out with 6:24 left, made it 27-13.
