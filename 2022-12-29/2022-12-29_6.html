     Summary: The Cheez-It Bowl in Orlando features two iconic college football programs squaring off for the fifth time in the postseason as No.
13 Florida State faces Oklahoma.
Oklahoma did get back on the winning side of the Bedlam series against rival Oklahoma State and fell just seven points short of eventual Big 12 champion Kansas State.
Oklahoma historically travels well but I'm expecting a very pro-Nole crowd as Florida State feels the tide truly turning with its first bowl win against Oklahoma since 1965.
