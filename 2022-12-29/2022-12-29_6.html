     Three Takeaways From Oklahoma's 35-32 Loss to Florida State in the Cheez-It Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 13-ranked Florida State Seminoles, but allowed a field goal in the final minute of the game to fall 35-32 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando.
Defense Holds Out as Long as PossibleSlowing down a Florida State offense that entered the Cheez-It Bowl averaging 475.7 yards per game was always going to be a struggle.
Florida State scored on four of its five drives in the second half as Oklahoma’s defense again waned down the stretch.
On the ensuing drive, Venables used his second timeout ahead of a fourth-and-6 conversion attempt in Florida State territory.
With under three minutes remaining, Florida State head coach Mike Norvell slowed down the pace.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bowl season is underway, and the Florida State Seminoles and the Oklahoma Sooners will compete for postseason bragging rights in the Cheez-It Bowl at Camping World Stadium at 5:30 p.m.
With a combined 1,169 yards of offense in their previous games, we can expect a fast-paced contest.
The Seminoles were able to grind out a solid win over the Florida Gators four weeks ago, winning 45-38.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma fought the good fight in their overtime game against the Texas Tech Red Raiders four weeks ago but wound up with a less-than-desirable result, falling 51-48.
Those burned by picking them against the spread four weeks ago might want to keep in mind that the team has not yet dropped back-to-back games against the spread this season.
