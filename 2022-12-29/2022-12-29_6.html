     Summary: USA TODAY SportsWith Ryan Tannehill out with an ankle injury, the Titans are looking at someone other than third-round rookie Malik Willis to play for them at quarterback.
According to multiple reports, Josh Dobbs is expected to start for Tennessee against Dallas on Thursday night.
Dobbs just joined the Titans on Dec. 21, signing with the club off of the Lions’ practice squad.
Originally a Steelers fourth-round pick in 2017, Dobbs has been around the league for a while but has never made a start.
While he’s appeared in eight games with three starts, Willis has not looked ready to play as a rookie.

     Titans to start QB Joshua Dobbs vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans officially placed Tannehill on injured reserve Thursday, meaning he will have to miss at least four games before he could return.
Two of those starters who were ruled out -- linebackers Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham -- were placed on injured reserve Thursday.
Dupree missed five games earlier this season after injuring a hip before a pectoral injury landed him on injured reserve.
He missed six consecutive games with an elbow injury after being placed on injured reserve in November.
The Titans activated Cunningham from injured reserve last week only to have him reinjure the elbow against the Houston Texans.

     Dobbs to Start vs. Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – Quarterback Josh Dobbs will make his first NFL start when the Tennessee Titans play host to the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football, sources confirmed to All Titans.
The decision to start Dobbs – a former University of Tennessee star – over rookie quarterback Malik Willis is a surprise, even though tonight’s game is meaningless in the Titans’ pursuit of the AFC South crown.
There are at least a couple of ways to look at the decision to start Dobbs, who was signed off the Detroit Lions’ practice squad on Dec. 21.
Willis might start that game or conceivably back up Tannehill if Tannehill is able to return from the ankle injury.
In four seasons at the University of Tennessee, Dobbs completed 614-of-999 passes (61 percent) for 7,138 yards (11.6 yards per completion).
