     Summary: Bowl season is underway, and the Florida State Seminoles and the Oklahoma Sooners will compete for postseason bragging rights in the Cheez-It Bowl at Camping World Stadium at 5:30 p.m.
With a combined 1,169 yards of offense in their previous games, we can expect a fast-paced contest.
The Seminoles were able to grind out a solid win over the Florida Gators four weeks ago, winning 45-38.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma fought the good fight in their overtime game against the Texas Tech Red Raiders four weeks ago but wound up with a less-than-desirable result, falling 51-48.
Those burned by picking them against the spread four weeks ago might want to keep in mind that the team has not yet dropped back-to-back games against the spread this season.

However, the lights finally began to turn on for Florida State as the frame progressed.
However, running back Trey Benson was stuffed on back to back plays and Florida State turned the ball over on downs just over midfield.
The kick traveled wide left and Florida State took advantage of the swing to start getting back into the game.
Florida State used some trickiness on offense to free up Markeston Douglas over the middle for a 17-yard touchdown catch.
