     Pelé dies at 82: Global soccer icon brought three World Cups to Brazil, beautiful game to America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brazilian soccer legend Pelé, arguably the greatest player to have ever lived, has died at age 82.
In January, he was discharged from the hospital after two days of cancer treatment while he had a colon tumor removed last year, undergoing chemotherapy ever since, according to Reuters.
Last week, the hospital said that Pelé would remain there as his cancer was causing liver and heart complications.
The only player to have won three World Cups, Pelé spent most of his career with Brazilian giants Santos, scoring 618 goals in 636 games.
Pelé is also the youngest player to ever score in a World Cup and the youngest to ever appear in the final.

     Brazilian Football Legend Pele Dies at 82
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brazilian football legend Pele, who burst onto the world scene as a goal-scoring teenager and led his national team to an unprecedented three World Cup titles, died Thursday at the age of 82.
The Albert Einstein hospital, where Pele was being treated, said in a statement that he died of multiple organ failure.
By 16, he was part of Brazil’s national team, and in 1958 he made his World Cup debut at age 17.
"Pele helped transform the domestic landscape of the sport of soccer," the New York Cosmos said in a statement.
Neymar, a fellow Brazilian and star for Paris Saint-Germain, said that before Pele, soccer was just a sport.

     How Did Pelé Die? His Doctors Found a ‘Suspicious Lesion’ in His Body Just 1 Year Before He Died
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pelé earned the nickname O Rei—”The King” in Portuguese—after he won his first FIFA World Cup with Brazil’s national team in 1958.
He won his second FIFA World Cup in 1962 followed by his third in 1970.
It was like a dream, and then all my dreams came true because my Brazil won the World Cup.
When I was 17, it was my first World Cup, no responsibility, no nerves.
Pelé died on December 29, 2022, at Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil.
