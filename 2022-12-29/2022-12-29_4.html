     Former Celtics: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith showing promise with new teams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics have no regrets after moving on from Aaron Nesmith and Romeo Langford in trades over the past year that has netted them key contributors in Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon.
Langford had a career-high 23 points for the Spurs in 28 minutes, helping San Antonio take down the Knicks 122-115.
Langford went 11-of-16 from the field in the outing while getting the start, going an incredibly efficient 11-of-16 from the field and making his only 3-point shot.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” Langford told reporters after his outing.
The Celtics will face off against Langford next Saturday when they visit the Spurs in San Antonio and will look for a win against Nesmith in February.

     Paul George Blasts Refs After Clippers vs. Celtics Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers lost a close game to the Boston Celtics on Thursday night, and while there isn't much shame in losing to the NBA's best team on the road, this is one the Clippers could have gotten.
In the fourth quarter, Paul George was called for a change on what looked to be a clear flop by both Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown.
The Clippers challenged the play, but the official ruling was upheld after the officiating crew determined George committed an offensive foul on the play.
For George to react in this way, he clearly feels as if the wrong call was made, and he has a real case.
This was a frustrating loss for the Clippers, but they were truly right there with the best team in the NBA, and can feel somewhat good about that.

     Why Celtics’ Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown should be ‘appreciated,’ says Damon Stoudamire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics have raved about Stoudamire in his two wins, including their win over the Clippers on Thursday.
But Stoudamire said he’s been surprised by how “humble” the Celtics’ star duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have been ever since he got to Boston.
“I’ve never seen a star like (Tatum), he’s kind of a throwback,” Stoudamire said.
Tatum and Brown proved last season they can work alongside each other, turning around their brutal start into a Finals appearance.
“He’s a bully to me, like when I say a bully, I say it from the standpoint of a good way,” Stoudamire said of Brown.

     Summary: BOSTON — The Celtics led for the majority of Thursday’s game against the Clippers, but the visitors just wouldn’t go away armed with two stars.
But the C’s still found a way to come away with the 116-110 win at TD Garden to win their fourth straight game.
But the Clippers stormed back in the third quarter, hitting 7-of-11 of their 3-pointers to force Thursday to be a close game.
That’s when the Celtics pulled away in the fourth quarter.
Shooting differenceThe Celtics’ season has been largely dependent on the 3-pointer this season, and that was again the case Thursday.

     Summary: Even from atop the NBA standings, the Boston Celtics remember the losses.
Three weeks after absorbing their worst one of the season in Los Angeles, the Celtics turned back the Clippers in Boston 116-110 on Thursday night, getting 29 points apiece from Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.
The Celtics (26-10) have the league's best record, but things didn't go so well on a West Coast road trip earlier this month.
The Celtics led 67-62 when Marcus Morris Sr. sank a 3, and then Zubac made a turnaround hook shot in the lane to tie it.
By the end of the quarter, the Clippers led 85-84.

The Clippers won Zubac’s nearly 30 minutes — in which he posted 13 points and 11 rebounds — by 10 points.

     Summary: While legendary Boston Celtics point guard Dennis Johnson had won a title (and even that season’s finals Most Valuable Player Award) with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979, doubters questioned his ability to play the game at a high level — apart from his athleticism — before he was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1983.
Larry Legend said as much in a speech praising just how wrong he was about DJ’s potential ahead of his being the floor general for Boston’s 1984 and 1986 titles.
