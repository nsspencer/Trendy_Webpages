     Former Celtics: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith showing promise with new teams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics have no regrets after moving on from Aaron Nesmith and Romeo Langford in trades over the past year that has netted them key contributors in Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon.
Langford had a career-high 23 points for the Spurs in 28 minutes, helping San Antonio take down the Knicks 122-115.
Langford went 11-of-16 from the field in the outing while getting the start, going an incredibly efficient 11-of-16 from the field and making his only 3-point shot.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” Langford told reporters after his outing.
The Celtics will face off against Langford next Saturday when they visit the Spurs in San Antonio and will look for a win against Nesmith in February.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics have raved about Stoudamire in his two wins, including their win over the Clippers on Thursday.
But Stoudamire said he’s been surprised by how “humble” the Celtics’ star duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have been ever since he got to Boston.
“I’ve never seen a star like (Tatum), he’s kind of a throwback,” Stoudamire said.
Tatum and Brown proved last season they can work alongside each other, turning around their brutal start into a Finals appearance.
“He’s a bully to me, like when I say a bully, I say it from the standpoint of a good way,” Stoudamire said of Brown.

     Summary: BOSTON — The Celtics led for the majority of Thursday’s game against the Clippers, but the visitors just wouldn’t go away armed with two stars.
But the C’s still found a way to come away with the 116-110 win at TD Garden to win their fourth straight game.
But the Clippers stormed back in the third quarter, hitting 7-of-11 of their 3-pointers to force Thursday to be a close game.
That’s when the Celtics pulled away in the fourth quarter.
Shooting differenceThe Celtics’ season has been largely dependent on the 3-pointer this season, and that was again the case Thursday.

Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown scored 29 apiece to lead the Celtics, while Kawhi Leonard (26) and Paul George (24) kept things close for the Clippers.
Morant added 19 points, but it was Dillon Brooks who continued to exceed expectations, dropping 25 in the win.

This year, both the Clippers and Celtics have championship aspirations that could see them meet for a third time five months from now in the NBA Finals.
And in this game in Boston, Tatum and George had a sequence in the second quarter where they were trading baskets.
Tatum and Brown have been going off as of late, but the team hasn’t been solely reliant on their brilliance.
An NBA Finals matchup would bring out the best in all four of Leonard, George, Tatum and Brown.

     Summary: While legendary Boston Celtics point guard Dennis Johnson had won a title (and even that season’s finals Most Valuable Player Award) with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979, doubters questioned his ability to play the game at a high level — apart from his athleticism — before he was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1983.
Larry Legend said as much in a speech praising just how wrong he was about DJ’s potential ahead of his being the floor general for Boston’s 1984 and 1986 titles.
