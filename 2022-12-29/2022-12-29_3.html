     Summary: The Boston Celtics will be without their head coach for the second straight game Thursday night.
Joe Mazzulla has been ruled out for Boston's matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers at TD Garden after missing Tuesday's game against the Houston Rockets due to eye irritation.
Mazzulla suffered corneal abrasions during a recent pickup game, per the Celtics.
The 34-year-old head coach looked noticeably uncomfortable during his pregame interview Tuesday night and was ruled out shortly before tip-off, as assistant coach Damon Stoudamire took over as interim head coach.

     Paul George Blasts Refs After Clippers vs. Celtics Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers lost a close game to the Boston Celtics on Thursday night, and while there isn't much shame in losing to the NBA's best team on the road, this is one the Clippers could have gotten.
In the fourth quarter, Paul George was called for a change on what looked to be a clear flop by both Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown.
The Clippers challenged the play, but the official ruling was upheld after the officiating crew determined George committed an offensive foul on the play.
For George to react in this way, he clearly feels as if the wrong call was made, and he has a real case.
This was a frustrating loss for the Clippers, but they were truly right there with the best team in the NBA, and can feel somewhat good about that.

The Celtics (26-10) have the league's best record, but things didn't go so well on a West Coast road trip earlier this month.
