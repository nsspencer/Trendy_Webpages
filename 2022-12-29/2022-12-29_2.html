    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this article LUV Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTwatch nowSouthwest Airlines' holiday meltdown will "certainly" hit its fourth-quarter results, executives said Thursday, adding that it will take several weeks to work through affected travelers' reimbursement requests.
The systemwide chaos stranded hundreds of thousands of customers over the holiday week and drew scrutiny from Washington.
Travelers at Baltimore Washington International airport deal with the impact of Southwest Airlines canceling more than 12,000 flights around the Christmas holiday weekend across the country and in Baltimore, Maryland, December 27, 2022.
Southwest's operation unraveled over the holiday week after brutal winter weather swept across the U.S.
When most airlines had recovered at the end of last week, Southwest's problems worsened.

     How Southwest's mass flight cancellations have forced its passengers to improvise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kruskol had planned to fly with Southwest Airlines to Charlotte, North Carolina on Christmas Eve, to visit his daughters and meet his 8-week-old granddaughter for the first time.
His 7:40 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to Denver was delayed about half an hour, he said, but otherwise went smoothly.
He snagged a standby spot on a flight to Burbank departing close to 1 a.m., took a Lyft to his car and drove home.
Other Southwest passengers are driving insteadSome travelers preemptively changed their plans after getting wind of the cancellations.
Kruskol said the airline told him his checked bag likely went on to North Carolina, but he spent Christmas Day at the beach in Oxnard, California.
