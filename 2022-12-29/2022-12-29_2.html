     MAGA blow hard Andrew Tate arrested for rape and human trafficking
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MAGA influencer and former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate — along with his brother Tristan and two other suspects — was detained on Thursday under suspicion of human trafficking and rape.
During the exchange, Tate bragged to Thunberg about his 33 cars and "their emissions," a taunt which the young activist dismissed with one KO of a reply.
Reporter Alejandra Caraballo speculated on Thursday that Tate's return to Twitter may have aided in his arrest.
"Romanian authorities needed proof that Andrew Tate was in the country so they reportedly used his social media posts," says Caraballo.
"His ridiculous video yesterday featured a pizza from a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry's Pizza, confirming he was in the country.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate has reportedly been detained in Romania in connection to a human-trafficking investigation.
Tate's arrest was announced a day after an exchange between Tate and 19-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg went viral on Twitter.
"His ridiculous video yesterday featured a pizza from a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry's Pizza, confirming he was in the country."
It is unclear at this time if the pizza box did indeed help lead Romanian authorities to Tate's location.
Mikael Thalen, tech reporter for the Daily Dot, wrote on Twitter that "No evidence so far proves Andrew Tate was located due to his tweet showing a Romanian pizza box."
