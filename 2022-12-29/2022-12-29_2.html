     Andrew Tate Mocked After Pizza Tweet to Thunberg May Have Led to Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate has reportedly been detained in Romania in connection to a human-trafficking investigation.
Tate's arrest was announced a day after an exchange between Tate and 19-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg went viral on Twitter.
"His ridiculous video yesterday featured a pizza from a Romanian pizza chain, Jerry's Pizza, confirming he was in the country."
It is unclear at this time if the pizza box did indeed help lead Romanian authorities to Tate's location.
Mikael Thalen, tech reporter for the Daily Dot, wrote on Twitter that "No evidence so far proves Andrew Tate was located due to his tweet showing a Romanian pizza box."

     Misogynist Influencer Andrew Tate’s Rough Week Capped by Romanian Rape Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just a day after being roasted by teen activist Greta Thunberg, misogynist MAGA influencer Andrew Tate was arrested Thursday in Romania on human trafficking and rape allegations.
Reuters also obtained photos of Tate’s arrest, showing the online personality in a black leather jacket and hoodie being perp-walked by police in tactical gear.
Romania TV reported that one of the Romanian suspects was a former Bucharest policewoman who is dating one of the Tates.
In April of this year, his home in Romania was raided in connection with a human-trafficking investigation.
Then in August, he was kicked off Facebook and Instagram, and shut down a money-making program for his followers: Hustler’s University.
