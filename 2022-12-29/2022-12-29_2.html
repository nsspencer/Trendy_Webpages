     Former Vols QB Josh Dobbs expected to make first NFL start with Titans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE — A person familiar with the situation said Josh Dobbs, not rookie Malik Willis, will be the starting quarterback for the Tennessee Titans when they host the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night.
Both the Cowboys and the Titans are chasing division titles with two regular-season games remaining, but their paths are different.
Dobbs will make his first NFL start after entering the league as a fourth-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2017.
An earlier version of this story stated that injured quarterback Ryan Tannehill could return if the Tennessee Titans reached the divisional round of the playoffs.
The Titans must reach the AFC title game for Tannehill to return this season.

     Titans to start QB Joshua Dobbs vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans officially placed Tannehill on injured reserve Thursday, meaning he will have to miss at least four games before he could return.
Two of those starters who were ruled out -- linebackers Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham -- were placed on injured reserve Thursday.
Dupree missed five games earlier this season after injuring a hip before a pectoral injury landed him on injured reserve.
He missed six consecutive games with an elbow injury after being placed on injured reserve in November.
The Titans activated Cunningham from injured reserve last week only to have him reinjure the elbow against the Houston Texans.

     Dobbs Steps In, Pumps Up Passing Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – In turning to recently signed quarterback Josh Dobbs over rookie Malik Willis, the Tennessee Titans hoped to pump some life into a sputtering passing attack.
It was the sixth-highest passing total of the season for the Titans (7-9), who lost their sixth straight game.
A sixth-year pro making his first NFL start, Dobbs looked like a clear step up from Willis, a third-round pick in this year's draft.
“He played his game,” Woods said.
Given the numbers Dobbs and Willis have posted this season, it seems clear a second straight start for Dobbs would be in the works.

     Summary: National Football League Josh Dobbs, in loss to Cowboys, shows he’s Titans’ best QB option to win AFC South 5 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkNASHVILLE, Tenn. — Josh Dobbs joined the Titans eight days ago, signed off the Lions' practice squad to Tennessee’s 53-man roster.
Thursday essentially served as a tryout for Dobbs, a journeyman backup who was a 2017 fourth-round pick out of Tennessee.
The Titans had to be 100 percent sure that Dobbs couldn’t give them a better chance than Willis to reach the playoffs.
"There are little things situationally that I’m already aware of that I know I can get better [at]," Dobbs said.
"Shoot, we’re throwing routes out there on the field that we haven’t even thrown out there in practice because of a short week," Dobbs said.

     QB Josh Dobbs Sparked the Titans, But It Wasn't Enough in a 27-13 Loss to the Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – The Titans put a new quarterback – Josh Dobbs – in the saddle against the Cowboys.
But in the end, Dobbs and the Titans just didn't have enough firepower – and they made too many mistakes -- in a 27-13 loss at Nissan Stadium.
The former University of Tennessee star kept the football for a souvenir following his touchdown, since it was his first career touchdown pass.
Then, on the final play of the half, the Titans got a 29-yard field goal from Bullock to make it 10-6 at the break.
Another Maher field goal, this one from 45 yards out with 6:24 left, made it 27-13.
