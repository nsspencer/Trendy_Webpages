     Summary: ARLINGTON, TEXAS - NOVEMBER 07: Micah Parsons #11 of the Dallas Cowboys celebrates after sacking Denver Broncos quarteback Teddy Bridgewater in the third quarter at AT&amp;T Stadium on November 07, 2021 in Arlington, Texas.
(Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images) Richard Rodriguez/Getty ImagesDallas Cowboys star Micah Parsons is playing through an injury on Thursday Night Football.
Parsons was seen with a wrap on his left hand earlier this week, and was limited in practice leading up to tonight's game against the Tennessee Titans.
When the second-year standout took the field for warmups in Nashville a short time ago, he did so wearing what appeared to be a protective cast/club on his left hand.
We'll see if Parsons is limited at all by the injury tonight.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After practicing in a limited capacity on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, Dallas Cowboys star linebacker Micah Parsons is sporting a club on his left hand for the Week 17 matchup versus Tennessee.
The club provides extra protection for his hand, which is damaged due to a laceration, not a fracture, according to Cowboys sideline reporter Kristi Scales.
Dallas ruled Parsons active tonight and, per Scales, they won’t put him on a pitch count.
A win versus the Titans is key for momentum, however, unless the Eagles lose this week, it doesn’t make a dent in the NFC East title race.
Although Parsons is playing, the Cowboys’ leading rusher, Tony Pollard, will not play.
