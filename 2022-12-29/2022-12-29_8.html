     Brazilian soccer legend Pelé dies at age 82
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pelé, the soccer legend who inspired a nation on and off the field, died Thursday after battling colon cancer.
However, urban legend says that his school friends gave it to him after he mispronounced the name of his favorite soccer player, Vasco da Gama's goalkeeper, Bile.
The world was officially introduced to the phenom at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden.
Pelé helped Brazil to win two more World Cup trophies — at the 1962 World Cup in Chile and the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.
Pelé held the records for youngest player to play in a World Cup final, youngest goal scorer and youngest hat-trick scorer in World Cup history.

     Brazilian Football Legend Pele Dies at 82
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brazilian football legend Pele, who burst onto the world scene as a goal-scoring teenager and led his national team to an unprecedented three World Cup titles, died Thursday at the age of 82.
The Albert Einstein hospital, where Pele was being treated, said in a statement that he died of multiple organ failure.
By 16, he was part of Brazil's national team, and in 1958 he made his World Cup debut at age 17.
Two more goals in the tournament's final match helped Pele lead Brazil to the championship.
Neymar, a fellow Brazilian and star for Paris Saint-Germain, said that before Pele, soccer was just a sport.

     Pelé, who rose from a Brazilian slum to become the world’s greatest soccer player, dies at 82
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pelé is the idol.”AdvertisementThe soccer player who rose from an impoverished slum to become the most famous — and, for a time, the best-paid — athlete in the world died Thursday at age 82.
Two years later he would become the youngest man to play — and score — in a World Cup.
“His great secret was improvisation,” said Tostão, a former World Cup teammate.
He was the eldest of three children born to Celeste Arantes and Joao Ramos do Nascimento, a minor league soccer player whose career was cut short by a knee injury.
“Pelé is the greatest player of all time,” said German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer.
