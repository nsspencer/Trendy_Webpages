     Summary: HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama actor who played small roles in movies including “Forrest Gump” and “Sweet Home Alabama” has died at age 87.
Bob Penny spent three decades as a college English professor, mostly at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
He acted in some commercials on the side, which led to small parts in movies and TV shows after Penny retired from teaching in 1990.
He played a bumbling, small-town lawyer in “Sweet Home Alabama,” and had roles in “My Cousin Vinny” and “Mississippi Burning.” An obituary from Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville says Penny died on Christmas Day.
