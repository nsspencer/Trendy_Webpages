     GMA Host T.J. Holmes Files For Divorce Amid Affair Scandal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In what may be one of the more unsurprising developments in the whole messy Good Morning America affair saga, T.J. Holmes has officially filed for divorce from his second wife, Marilee Fiebig.
Both Holmes and Robach had reportedly been separated from their respective spouses since August as the romantic relationship between the morning show anchors began to heat up.
Revelations that Holmes previously had affairs with two other GMA staffers resurfaced, including one with producer Natasha Singh.
Celebrating their tenth wedding anniversary, Holmes had weirdly gushed about how Fiebig had remained married to him "despite my best efforts" in a 2020 Instagram post.
I gave her plenty of reasons, excuses and opportunities to walk her fine a— out of the doooooooor.
