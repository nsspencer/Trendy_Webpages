    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans officially placed Tannehill on injured reserve Thursday, meaning he will have to miss at least four games before he could return.
Two of those starters who were ruled out -- linebackers Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham -- were placed on injured reserve Thursday.
Dupree missed five games earlier this season after injuring a hip before a pectoral injury landed him on injured reserve.
He missed six consecutive games with an elbow injury after being placed on injured reserve in November.
The Titans activated Cunningham from injured reserve last week only to have him reinjure the elbow against the Houston Texans.

As for the Cowboys (11-4), NFL Network reported running back Tony Pollard is expected to be inactive for Thursday's contest.
Dobbs, 27, was signed by the Titans off the Detroit Lions' practice squad on Dec. 21.
