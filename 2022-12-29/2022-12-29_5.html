     Summary: 20 Texas Longhorns had yet to maximize their unofficial home-field advantage during Thursday's matchup with the No.
And thanks to running back Jonathon Brooks, Texas got itself back into a game that was in danger of slipping away.
Brooks and the rest of Texas' running game had combined for just 12 carries for 27 yards prior to his touchdown.

     A few more nuggets leading up to tonight's Texas-Washington Alamo Bowl showdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12 Washington is a 10-win team with a six-game winning streak that includes wins over No.
8 in Heisman Trophy balloting, one spot ahead of Texas running back Bijan Robinson, who was No.
But, according to Las Vegas, the favorite (by 3.5 points) in tonight’s Alamo Bowl is the 8-4 Texas Longhorns, who will be without bowl opt-outs Robinson, second-leading rusher Roschon Johnson and second-leading tackler DeMarvion Overshown.
Underdog status is something the Huskies have embraced this week.
We've been not predicted to win in Vegas against multiple teams - more than three teams this year - and we're fine with that.

     No. 20 Texas vs. No. 12 Washington: Offensive storylines for the Longhorns in the Alamo Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12 Washington Huskies are nearing game time at the Alamodome in San Antonio for Thursday’s Alamo Bowl with a nine-win season on the line for Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian and the Longhorns.
That’s why I think this game is obviously very important to all of us in our organization.
During bowl preparation, Ewers refocused on the fundamentals, particularly in regards to his connection with star sophomore wide receiver Xavier Worthy.
For much of the season, Texas majored in 12 personnel with two tight ends on the field.
The seven freshman offensive linemen received regular work in practice on the two-deep chart with Hutson and left tackle Kelvin Banks starting every game.

     Summary: Texas had an inconsistent campaign in Steve Sarkisian's second year, but returned to a bowl game for the first time since 2020.
However, the bowl game gives one final opportunity to build momentum as another touted recruiting class comes to Austin in 2023.
The dynamic passing offense produced a pair of 1,000-yard receivers and exploded for more than 376 yards passing per game.
Alamo Bowl prediction, picksVegas oddsmakers have overvalued Texas all year, and that should be even more true after three of Texas' most important players opted out for the bowl game.
