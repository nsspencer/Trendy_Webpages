     Titans make shocking Malik Willis-Josh Dobbs decision for Week 17 vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Owen Crisafulli · 2 min readThe Tennessee Titans will have a shot to win the AFC South in Week 18 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, regardless of what happens in Week 17.
Still, it would seem like he’d benefit from getting some more reps in an NFL game with Tannehill out for Week 17.
The Titans coaching staff doesn’t agree, and will be turning the ball over to their third-stringer in Dobbs rather than Willis against the Cowboys.
A former Tennessee Vols legend, Dobbs replaces Malik Willis against the Cowboys tonight.”This is a pretty wild update for the Titans, as it shows they aren’t too concerned with what happens in Week 17.
Given the short week and the stakes in Week 18, this game doesn’t mean much for Tennessee, so don’t be surprised if the Cowboys end up destroying them in this one.

     Titans to start Josh Dobbs vs. Cowboys; What does that say about Malik Willis’s future?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First off, huge congrats to our very own Justin Melo for breaking the news that Josh Dobbs is getting the start tonight for the Tennessee Titans.
The decision to start Dobbs is surprising.
Mike Vrabel clearly thinks that Dobbs gives the Titans a better chance to win next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
If Vrabel hasn’t seen Willis develop enough since that day, he might already be ready to say Willis isn’t his QB of the future.
Some people are saying they are starting Dobbs tonight because they don’t want Willis to take the hits behind this offensive line.

The team will start recently signed quarterback Joshua Dobbs, according to a report from CBS Sports.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tennessee Titans will have a lot of familiar faces on the shelf as they take on the Dallas Cowboys to open up Week 17 of the NFL season.
With Ryan Tannehill sidelined, the prevailing assumption was that rookie quarterback Malik Willis would get the starting nod under center as he's done throughout the season when Tannehill has been out.
The club is now expected to start Joshua Dobbs at quarterback against Dallas, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms.
Meanwhile, Dobbs first entered the NFL in 2017 as a fourth-round draft choice of the Steelers out of the University of Tennessee.
Thursday's matchup with the Cowboys is mostly inconsequential to Tennessee as it relates to its playoff hopes this season.
