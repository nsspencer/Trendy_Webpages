    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix's EPS missed largely due to a loss related to euro-denominated debt, but its margins of 7% still topped Wall Street's expectations.
During the company's prerecorded earnings call, Netflix said that it has seen comparable engagement from its new ad tier members as it has seen with its regular consumers.
Going forward, Netflix will no longer give subscriber guidance, although it will still report those numbers in future earnings reports.
"We believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering.
Netflix says this growth will be driven by more paid memberships and more money per paid membership.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But they’ve both managed incredibly well, ensuring Netflix continues to improve and developing a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue and earnings growth,” Hastings wrote.
The streaming-video company reported that it added 7.7 million subscribers in the final three months of the year; analysts had expected 4.58 million, according to FactSet.
In October, Netflix executives predicted the company would add a net 4.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter as it bounces back from a lull in growth.
“2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish,” executives wrote in their letter to shareholders Thursday.
Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar expected Netflix to add roughly half the new subscribers executives had forecast, 2.7 million, based on a drop in app downloads.

     Netflix Shocker: Reed Hastings to Exit Co-CEO Role, Will Remain as Executive Chairman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix and led Hollywood’s charge into streaming-first strategy over the past decade, is exiting his role as co-CEO of the media giant but will stay on as executive chairman, the company said Thursday.
As part of the succession, COO Greg Peters will become co-CEO alongside Ted Sarandos, who has held that title since July 2020.
“It was a baptism by fire, given COVID and recent challenges within our business,” Hastings wrote in a post on Netflix’s site.
The departure marks the end of an era for Netflix, though Hastings, as executive chairman, will continue to play a role in the company’s future, just as Jeff Bezos does at Amazon.
Netflix, and Hastings, also pioneered what’s now standard practice among streaming platforms: withholding most viewership data.
