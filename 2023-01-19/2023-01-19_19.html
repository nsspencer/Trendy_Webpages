     Michael Reinsdorf talks Bulls' global brand, Pistons rivalry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS --- As Michael Reinsdorf walked into Accor Arena Thursday night, the Chicago Bulls’ president and chief executive officer couldn’t help but think back to 1997.
So to have our first real regular-season game in Europe it does get me excited, and I think the players are excited,” Reinsdorf said.
“It doesn’t feel like your typical regular-season game in mid-January against the Pistons, that’s for sure.’’Reinsdorf said he noticed the numerous fans wearing Bulls jerseys.
I think this is a great opportunity for the NBA,” Reinsdorf said.
But as MJ said, I don’t think the Bulls could have won those six championships if they didn’t have to go through the Pistons first.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From the Derrick Rose era to the team's recent resurgence, the Bulls have been a global phenomenon.
Reinsdorf was in attendance for the Bulls' game against the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, where he witnessed his team's continued popularity despite their last championship coming in 1998.
Jordan himself played for the Bulls' team that came to France in 1997 and won the McDonalds' Championship.
“But we can’t shy away from the fact back in the 90s, we won six championships in eight years, and we were one of the first global teams in sports.
I think this is a great opportunity for the NBA,” Reinsdorf said.

     Recapping the Chicago Bulls: Zach LaVine leads a dominant performance in Paris, fueling a 126-108 rout of the Detroit Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Halfway around the world, the Chicago Bulls finally delivered a win with a quality that had been missing all season — domination.
This Bulls season has been filled with up-and-down insanity — squandered leads, intense comebacks, razor-thin margins that force buzzer-beaters.
That was not the case on the international stage against the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in the NBA Paris Game.
Coach Billy Donovan often holds the former Pistons star out of games against opponents that place Drummond at a stark speed disadvantage.
Former NBA star Tony Parker spoke before the game, and former Bulls star Joakim Noah was recognized.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: title thus far, but since the calendar has flipped to 2023, a new name has surfaced as being the focal point for Chicago.
As a surprise to most, Nikola Vucevic has been the most outstanding and essential player on the Bulls this year.
While that performance put the nation on notice, Bulls fans know he’s been playing his best basketball for over a month now.
His fourth-quarter shooting is another priceless improvement for Chicago; his clutch shooting is now among the best on the team.
If he continues this pace of play, does he deserve an extension this offseason, or should Chicago let him walk?

     Summary: Before the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 126-108 on Thursday in Paris and before the team’s charter even left Chicago, center Nikola Vučević began imagining the possibilities.
26 years apart 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/BouctHjpyp — Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) January 19, 2023With all the might of the NBA behind them, the Bulls and Pistons put on quite a show for the people in France.
“The trip was great for us going forward, obviously going into the second half of the season,” Bulls guard Zach LaVine told reporters after the game.
With only nine games remaining on the Bulls’ schedule before the Feb. 9 trade deadline, the team has reached a critical stage.
The Bulls (21-24) will return from France only three games under .500., a record they haven’t held since Nov. 7.

     COLUMN: It’s time for the Chicago Bulls to ‘blow up’ their roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers’ Joel Embiid looks to shoot as Chicago Bulls’ Nikola Vucevic (9) and Zach LaVine defend during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 6, 2021, in Chicago.
Before the All-Star break last season, the Chicago Bulls remained at the top of the Eastern Conference but fell apart after the All-Star break due to covid protocols and Lonzo Ball’s injury.
This season the Bulls have played below average, and Lonzo Ball hasn’t returned from his injury.
As of right now, the Bulls have a record of 20-24 which is very concerning because they have a roster with three all-stars.
The front office should make trades at the deadline to correct what this roster lacks or blow it up and wait until the offseason.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls will have an interesting decision to make about what they're going to do with Nikola Vucevic's contract.
He could possibly be cheaper than what he's making right now because he hasn't necessarily been the same type of player since he came over from Orlando.
Vucevic said he isn't too worried about his contract right now.
"I think right now with Vučević, those talks on an extension have not really gained any traction," Wojnarowski said.
During the final season of his contract (this season), the 32-year-old is making $22 million.
