     First Image From Ted Lasso Season 3 Sees Ted Squaring Up To Nate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We've been waiting for something, anything from Ted Lasso Season 3, since Jason Sudeikis' cheery (if sometimes angsty) football boss hasn't graced our screens since October 2021.
The Lasso team has been hard at work on the third season and now we have our first look, as Ted squares up to Nick Mohammed's Nate as Anthony Stewart Head's Rupert Mannion looks on.
And yes, we're getting Star Wars vibes.
You'll likely recall that Season 2 wrapped up with Nate, having felt shunned by Ted all season, going down a dark path and ending up managing West Ham a bitter rival of Ted's AFC Richmond.
Hired by Rupert to run the team, Nate promises to offer even more of a challenge to his old boss.

     'Ted Lasso' Season 3 Will Premiere This Spring. Here's a First Look
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ted Lasso, one of the feel-goodest shows in the history of feel-good shows, drop-kicked a first look at season 3 on Wednesday.
Apple also gave a season 3 release date of this spring.
Scheming former AFC Richmond owner Rupert (Anthony Head), who now owns Richmond competitor West Ham United, hovers in the background dressed in black, channeling a proper Bond villain.
Ted Lasso debuted on Apple's subscription service in August 2020 and quickly became a hit among viewers who took to its quirky characters and hopeful messages about the power of vulnerability and believing in yourself.
Season 3, said to be the show's final season, co-stars Brett Goldstein, Hannah Waddington, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Nick Mohammed, Toheeb Jimoh and others.
