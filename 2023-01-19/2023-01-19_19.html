    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix's EPS missed largely due to a loss related to euro-denominated debt, but its margins of 7% still topped Wall Street's expectations.
During the company's prerecorded earnings call, Netflix said that it has seen comparable engagement from its new ad tier members as it has seen with its regular consumers.
Going forward, Netflix will no longer give subscriber guidance, although it will still report those numbers in future earnings reports.
"We believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering.
Netflix says this growth will be driven by more paid memberships and more money per paid membership.
