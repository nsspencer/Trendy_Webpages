     Rating agencies expect U.S. debt ceiling agreement despite gridlock risks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Rating agencies Moody's and Fitch expect the U.S. Congress will likely reach an agreement on a new debt limit before the Treasury drains resources to stave off a debt default, but warned that an extended political gridlock could ultimately impact the United States' top credit rating.
That has not always been the case, however: A protracted standoff in 2011 prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time, sending financial markets reeling.
Rating agencies Moody's and Fitch both have a triple-A rating for the United States - the highest credit quality status they can assign to a borrower.
S&amp;P Global's sovereign rating for the United States is 'AA+', the second highest rating by the agency.
Should the government be unable to pay some of its obligations, he added, "that would not be consistent with what we would expect from a triple-A rating."

     U.S. begins ‘extraordinary’ steps to avoid debt ceiling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After raising the debt limit for decades, Republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default.
But the White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and President Biden has pledged to oppose any attempt to cut entitlements.
The White House has few options to act unilaterally to avoid a debt ceiling crisis.
The White House briefly considered that idea during the 2021 debt ceiling crunch but ultimately decided against it.

     U.S. hits debt limit and Treasury Department begins ‘extraordinary measures’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nation reached its debt limit Thursday, beginning the uncertain process known as extraordinary measures, in which the U.S. Treasury Department uses accounting maneuvers to avoid defaulting on the debt.
If disagreements about how to address the debt limit last too long, the Treasury Department will exhaust extraordinary measures and the nation would default on the debt for the first time.
“We’re not getting rid of anything, and you can’t scare the bejesus out of people saying we’re going to get rid of Social Security, we’re going to privatize.
She wrote to lawmakers again Thursday, telling them the country had in fact reached its debt limit and she had begun using some of the extraordinary measures to keep paying all of the country’s bills in full and on time.
Such programs include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

     Stop the Charade: The Federal Budget Is Its Own ‘Debt-Ceiling’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Be that as it may, the important point right now is that both (a) the 1974 budget regime trumps the 1917 budget regime, and (b) the current budget trumps any putative ‘debt ceiling’ imposed after that budget became law.
But it also carries over straightforwardly to the debt ceiling non-issue, in a manner that complements the later-in-time rule.
We must, then, instead view the most recent budget as having implicitly repealed any prior ‘debt ceiling’ legislation that would render compliance with the budget impossible.
The so-called ‘debt ceiling,’ by contrast, says nothing directly about any of these thousands of budget line-items.
The last-enacted budget – which, again, is the law – must accordingly be viewed as implicitly repealing any ‘ceiling’ legislation interpreted as conflicting with it.

     Biden and Republicans seem set for debt ceiling fight, reviving fraught political battles of years past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mint Images/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Another spending fight looms between the White House and Congress, reviving similar stalemates in 2011 and 2013 under President Barack Obama.
Then, as now, Congress was divided — a Republican House and a Democratic Senate — and the White House had a Democratic president.
“This has become a political football because it’s so easy to pass back and forth and get points for hitting the other side,” said one House Democratic aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly.
Two years later, Obama was again celebrating a breakthrough with Congress over the government’s spending and debt limit.
Since then, the debt limit has either been paused or increased eight times, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, with Congress largely choosing to simply extend the debt limit rather than hold a vote on raising it.

     EXPLAINER: What Is the Debt Ceiling and Why Does It Matter?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Is the Debt Ceiling Anyway?
Political Posturing Dominates the Debate NowRepublicans have linked any increase or extension in the debt ceiling to cuts in federal spending.
With only days to spare, Republicans agreed to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for a package of future spending cuts.
“The August 2011 debt ceiling showdown was perhaps the closest brush the United States has had with the X-date,” Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese says.
The issue raised its head two years later and the resulting standoff between the parties led to a government shutdown in late 2013, followed by an agreement to suspend the debt ceiling and then further deals over the next two years were negotiated to both fund the government and get around the debt ceiling.
