     U.S. hits debt limit and Treasury Department begins ‘extraordinary measures’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nation reached its debt limit Thursday, beginning the uncertain process known as extraordinary measures, in which the U.S. Treasury Department uses accounting maneuvers to avoid defaulting on the debt.
If disagreements about how to address the debt limit last too long, the Treasury Department will exhaust extraordinary measures and the nation would default on the debt for the first time.
“We’re not getting rid of anything, and you can’t scare the bejesus out of people saying we’re going to get rid of Social Security, we’re going to privatize.
She wrote to lawmakers again Thursday, telling them the country had in fact reached its debt limit and she had begun using some of the extraordinary measures to keep paying all of the country’s bills in full and on time.
Such programs include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

     U.S. begins ‘extraordinary’ steps to avoid debt ceiling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After raising the debt limit for decades, Republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default.
But the White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and President Biden has pledged to oppose any attempt to cut entitlements.
The White House has few options to act unilaterally to avoid a debt ceiling crisis.
The White House briefly considered that idea during the 2021 debt ceiling crunch but ultimately decided against it.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US economy could be headed for a crisis manufactured by a handful of House Republicans.
Some House Republicans have chosen to do so anyway.
Some House Republicans now appear to be hoping for similar spending cuts in exchange for a debt ceiling hike, escalating the risk of a default.
“We are not going to be negotiating over the debt ceiling,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said on Tuesday.
As of now, it remains unclear how the latest debt ceiling standoff will resolve itself.

     Biden and Republicans seem set for debt ceiling fight, reviving fraught political battles of years past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mint Images/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Another spending fight looms between the White House and Congress, reviving similar stalemates in 2011 and 2013 under President Barack Obama.
Then, as now, Congress was divided — a Republican House and a Democratic Senate — and the White House had a Democratic president.
“This has become a political football because it’s so easy to pass back and forth and get points for hitting the other side,” said one House Democratic aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly.
Two years later, Obama was again celebrating a breakthrough with Congress over the government’s spending and debt limit.
Since then, the debt limit has either been paused or increased eight times, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, with Congress largely choosing to simply extend the debt limit rather than hold a vote on raising it.
