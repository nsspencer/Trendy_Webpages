     Summary: Andy Murray’s heroics do not disguise the reality that tennis needs to changeEven before his brother has taken to the court for his second-round match against Thanasi Kokkinakis, Jamie Murray offered up an argument that is increasingly hard to refute.
They are comments that should not be ignored and now the moment has come tennis for authorities to listen to these sentiments.
Time for tennis to move to only one 1 match at the night sessions at grand slams.
One of those is the five-set obsession that tennis traditionalists will never want to change.
Yet change should be embraced rather than feared and this is a moment when tennis needs to look at itself and ask some serious questions.
