     Summary: Andy Murray’s late-night heroics leave McEnroe in aweAndy Murray’s heroics during his second-round match against Thanasi Kokkinakis at the Australian Open has left John McEnroe in awe.
Former world number one McEnroe, who works as a pundit for Eurosport, was particularly impressed with the level Murray was able to play at, considering the five-setter finished at 4am the following morning.
For starters, it was insane that matches at that level are played 4-430am in the morning,” McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, said.
“I would say to Andy Murray that you make our sport shine.
His desire to compete, to go out and just give what he’s got,” McEnroe continued.
