    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At 4:15 on Friday morning in Melbourne, after Andy Murray had put the finishing touches on his highly improbable, five-set, five-hour-and-45-minute comeback win over Thanasi Kokkinakis, he was asked the obvious question:How in God’s name did you do that?
Murray started to talk about the usual things: How well Kokkinakis served, how the match had its ups and downs, how he played better as it went on, etc.
Then he stopped and cut to the chase:“And I have a big heart,” Murray said.

    </h2>

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andy Murray’s heroics do not disguise the reality that tennis needs to changeEven before his brother has taken to the court for his second-round match against Thanasi Kokkinakis, Jamie Murray offered up an argument that is increasingly hard to refute.
They are comments that should not be ignored and now the moment has come tennis for authorities to listen to these sentiments.
Time for tennis to move to only one 1 match at the night sessions at grand slams.
One of those is the five-set obsession that tennis traditionalists will never want to change.
Yet change should be embraced rather than feared and this is a moment when tennis needs to look at itself and ask some serious questions.

     Andy Murray wins another five-set epic, beating Thanasi Kokkinakis in wild 4 a.m. finish at the Australian Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Andy Murray produced yet another Herculean effort at the Australian Open, coming back from two sets and a break down against home favorite Thanasi Kokkinakis in a match that went on past 4 a.m. in Melbourne.
After a grueling five-setter against Matteo Berrettini in the opening round, most viewers wondered whether Murray would have anything left in the tank for round two.
Thanasi Kokkinakis wasn't able to serve the match out in the third set.
When asked in his on-court interview how he had turned the match on its head, Murray was almost at a loss for words.
“Thanasi was playing … serving unbelievable, hitting his forehand huge and I don’t know how I managed to get through it.
