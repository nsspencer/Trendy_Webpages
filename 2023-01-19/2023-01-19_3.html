     Alec Baldwin Will Be Charged With Involuntary Manslaughter in Rust Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin and prop armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed will both be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western drama Rust.
“If any one of these three people—Alec Baldwin, Hannah Gutierrez Reed or David Halls—had done their job, Halyna Hutchins would be alive today.
A vigil in Albuquerque, New Mexico from Oct. 23, 2021, just days after the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.
Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun—or anywhere on the movie set.
After the DA’s announcement, he issued this statement: “Hannah is, and has always been, very emotional and sad about this tragic accident.

     Summary: Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed are each being charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, meaning they're "charged in the alternative."
Prosecutors say they want a jury to decide not only if the pair is guilty, but which type of involuntary manslaughter should apply to the events around Hutchins' death.
Under the basic involuntary manslaughter charge, prosecutors would need to show that underlying negligence played a role in the shooting death.
The other charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act — which would require prosecutors to establish that factors beyond simple negligence contributed to Hutchins' death.
But she did not commit involuntary manslaughter."

Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be charged “in the alternative,” meaning the jury will decide which definition of involuntary manslaughter they are guilty of, if they are found guilty.

Baldwin has said he was told by people “within the state” it’s “highly unlikely” he would be charged.

     What is involuntary manslaughter? Here's what Alec Baldwin faces in the 'Rust' shooting charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Mexico state law classifies involuntary manslaughter as a fourth degree felony.
“The big difference between involuntary manslaughter and murder, often seen in cases involving firearms, is that there is no criminal intent,” Winder said, referring to New Mexico state law.
CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams says prosecutors decided to charge Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins’ death due to negligence.
Shortly after announcing the involuntary manslaughter charges, Mary Carmack-Altwies, New Mexico’s first judicial district attorney, outlined why the on-set shooting could result in criminal charges regardless of whether it was an accident.
Secondly, the incident happened on a movie set, and “most normal people do not know what the norms are on a movie set,” he said.
