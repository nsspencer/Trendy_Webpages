     Dallas Mavericks’ Wood to miss multiple games with broken thumb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Dallas Mavericks forward Christian Wood will miss multiple games with a broken left thumb.
The injury to Wood’s non-shooting hand occurred during the Mavericks’ 130-122 loss to Atlanta on Wednesday night, the team said Thursday.
The Dallas Mavericks announced today that Christian Wood has sustained a fracture of his left thumb.
Finney-Smith missed 14 games with a right adductor strain, and Green, also known for his defense, was sidelined 20 games with a right elbow sprain.
The Mavericks have lost six of eight games since a seven-game winning streak that was the longest since the franchise’s only championship season of 2010-11.

     Mavericks injury update: Wood out, Hardaway back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks took one step back and one step forward with their injury issues.
The team announced Thursday that center Christian Wood has a fracture in his left thumb and will be reevaluated in one week.
Wood has already been confirmed out for the Heat game and will likely miss Sunday’s game against the Clippers and Tuesday’s game against the Wizards.
Exactly one week from today would be Thursday, Jan. 26, the day the Mavericks go on the road to play the Suns.
With Maxi Kleber still out recovering from his surgery on a torn hamstring, the Mavericks big man rotation is seriously strained.

     Christian Wood injury update: Mavericks big man fractures thumb, will be re-evaluated next week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More bad news for the reeling Dallas Mavericks: Big man Christian Wood fractured his left thumb during the second quarter of their 130-122 loss against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night and he will be re-evaluated next week, the team announced on Thursday.
Wood continued to play after the injury occurred.
He played virtually all of the fourth quarter and finished with 22 points on 9-for-17 shooting, nine rebounds, four assists, one steal and two blocks.
In 17 games as a starter this season, he has averaged 20.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.3 blocks in 33.1 minutes per game.
The injury also means that Luka Doncic and Spencer Dinwiddie will have to shoulder even more of the load offensively.

     Mavericks’ Christian Wood fractures left thumb; out until at least next week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mavericks have been hit with another injury to a key player: This time it’s starting forward Christian Wood, who fractured his left (non-shooting hand) thumb during the second quarter of Wednesday’s home loss to Atlanta.
The Mavericks announced Wood’s injury a couple of hours after Thursday’s practice at their training facility in the Design District.
Wood, acquired in a trade from Houston last summer, is Dallas’ second-leading scorer (18.4 points per game) and rebounder (8.4 average).
Wood played the second half with a light wrap around his thumb and hand to stabilize the thumb, finishing with 22 points and nine rebounds.
With the Feb. 9 trade deadline looming, the Mavericks and Wood have had preliminary contract extension discussions.
