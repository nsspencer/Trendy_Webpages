     Summary: The Toronto Raptors got a season's best 29 points from Scottie Barnes but struggled in the clutch in an embarrassing loss to the Minnesota TimberwolvesIt's been a season full of squandered opportunities for the Toronto Raptors.
LeBron James and Anthony Davis, for example, didn't make the trip north in early December and the Raptors ran away with that out.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First, there’s the record: Minnesota entered Thursday’s contest against Toronto at a disappointing two games below .500.
Then there’s the glass-half-full view, which shows Minnesota is still in contention for home-court advantage in a potential first-round Western Conference playoff series.
The middle of the Western Conference resembles a rock fight, with the teams in the Nos.
But that’s the reality for Western Conference teams this season.
Because as bad as the Wolves, and many other Western Conference teams, have been thus far this season, everything is somehow still in front of them.
