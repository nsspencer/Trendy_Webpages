Bruce Brown finished with 16 points for a Denver team playing the second game of a back-to-back.
Nuggets coach Michael Malone remained in the NBA’s health and safety protocol for a second straight game.

     Summary: The scheduling gods did the Timberwolves no favors in following up a 9 p.m. Central start in Denver on Wednesday with a 7 p.m. home tip against Toronto.
With the teams tied 126-126, D'Angelo Russell drew a foul on his patented rip-through move and hit both free throws to give the Wolves a 128-126 lead with 9.9 seconds remaining.
They trailed by as much as 18 in the game and were down as much as 14 in the fourth quarter when a Russell (25 points) shooting barrage helped them tie the game.
A three from Anthony Edwards tied it up 124-124 with 3 minutes, 56 seconds remaining while the Wolves clamped down defensively in the final minutes.
Scottie Barnes led Toronto with 29 points.

     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves (22-24) will host the Toronto Raptors (20-25) at the Target Center in Minneapolis.
The Minnesota Timberwolves have been a solid team gearing toward playoff contention, but have lost three of their last five matchups.
Meanwhile, the Toronto Raptors have also had an up-and-down year, snatching three wins out of the last five games played.
This Raptors team has heart, and it all starts at the top with their leaders Fred VanVleet and Pascal Siakam.

     Summary: The Timberwolves trailed by 14 points midway through the fourth quarter before a flame-throwing session from D’Angelo Russell brought the Wolves all the way back, and Minnesota closed the deal late for a 128-126 victory.
Then Anthony Edwards buried a three-ball to complete the comeback and knot the game with four minutes to play.
If I’m missing shots, I’m going to try to find it and try to still affect the game in a winning way.

LeBron James and Anthony Davis, for example, didn't make the trip north in early December and the Raptors ran away with that out.

     Summary: First, there’s the record: Minnesota entered Thursday’s contest against Toronto at a disappointing two games below .500.
Then there’s the glass-half-full view, which shows Minnesota is still in contention for home-court advantage in a potential first-round Western Conference playoff series.
The middle of the Western Conference resembles a rock fight, with the teams in the Nos.
But that’s the reality for Western Conference teams this season.
Because as bad as the Wolves, and many other Western Conference teams, have been thus far this season, everything is somehow still in front of them.
