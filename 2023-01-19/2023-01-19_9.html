     Summary: Edu BuenoOlympiacos and Real Madrid go head-to-head tonight at Athens's legendary Peace and Friendship Stadium.
It's first versus second at the start of this round of games, the best offense against the top defense.
It's set to be their fourth away game on the bounce, the three so far all going in our team's favour (KK Crvena Zvezda, Alba Berlin and Coviran Granada).
If we count the Maccabi game, we've won our last three European encounters.
At home, only KK Crvena Zvezda, Valencia Basket and Monaco have got the better of them.
