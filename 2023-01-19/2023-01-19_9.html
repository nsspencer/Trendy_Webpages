Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis (who return to play Micheal Kelso and Jackie Burkhart) came equipped with a trunk, stool, and the multicolored round pillow in the basement set.
A couple of the owls from the old set are shown on the living room bookshelves.
Courtesy of NetflixStepheneson-Fong sourced many items from vintage stores with the hardest item to find being the living room coffee table.
Other very ‘90s updates to the Forman house include a plaid-patterned sofa with floral throw pillows in the living room.

     Review: Don't expect 'That '70s Show' magic in Netflix's 'That '90s Show'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suffice it to say, like many of the unnecessary TV remakes, reboots and revivals of the past few years, "’90s" does not capture the "’70s" magic.
The jokes don't land, the actors are miscast and all the Kutcher and Kunis cameos in the world can't make a bad script good.
Like "’70s," "’90s" is about a group of teenagers in Wisconsin and their antics while their parents aren't around.
The original series clearly understood life in the ’70s – and more importantly, how audiences of the era it aired in (1998-2006) viewed life in the ’70s.
As much as these kids try, they can't capture the lightning in a bottle that Kutcher, Kunis, Grace and Prepon did.

     Summary: Eric, Hyde, Jackie, Kelso, Donna, and Fez, a team of basement-dwellers forever laughing about whatever mischief they caused.
That '70s Show tracked the life of Eric Forman, a typical Wisconsin teenager, and his rowdy friends and family.
That '70s Show became a handbook for my fast-approaching freshman year, and one of my favorite television shows.
At its worst, That '70s Show, like many other sitcoms of the early-aughts, capitalized on tired jokes based on stereotypes.
When I felt uneasy about starting high school, That '70s Show was there to remind me that everyone goes through it.

Even though Masterson’s Steven Hyde was a main character on That ’70s Show, the character isn’t addressed on the show.
