    </h2>

     Lakers are scared about running LeBron James ‘into the ground’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since his introductory press conference, Darvin Ham has oft-stated that his top priority as Los Angeles Lakers head coach is to healthily manage LeBron James’ workload.
Following another frustrating crunch-time loss at home on Wednesday — 116-111, to the Sacramento Kings — Ham expressed real “concern” over the 38-year-old’s minutes a few games past the season’s halfway mark.
Since turning 38 on Dec. 30, LeBron has averaged 38 minutes and 25 field goal attempts per game.
Before the Kings clash, Ham shared that Davis, Reaves, and Walker remain on track in their recovery.
But, as we’ve seen with LeBron, the Lakers are going to have to squeeze out a few more wins in order to afford AD that luxury.
