     Report: Warriors' Trade Deadline Plans Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having hovered around .500 for most of the season, the Golden State Warriors are in a unique spot.
Had the Warriors started this season the way they started last season, there would be very limited trade talk as the deadline approaches.
Choosing to stay put at last year's deadline, the Warriors showed immense belief in their roster, and it paid off.
In a recent report from The Athletic's Anthony Slater, it was revealed that Golden State is not expected to make a big splash at this year's trade deadline, and instead will nibble on the fringes, if anything.
"Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything."

     Celtics beat Warriors in OT, win NBA Finals rematch 121-118
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum scored 34 points with a career-high 19 rebounds, following Al Horford‚Äôs overtime 3-pointer with one of his own on Thursday night to help the Celtics pull away from Golden State in an NBA Finals rematch and beat the Warriors 121-118.
Jaylen Brown added 16 points and nine rebounds, making a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime.
Boston scored the first four points of overtime but Draymond Green hit a pair of free throws and Curry sank a 3-pointer to give the Warriors the lead.
The Warriors won the finals in Game 6 in Boston, and then won the first rematch of the regular season on Dec. 10 in San Francisco.
Although the Celtics have come out to the best record in the NBA this season, the losses to Golden State still rankle them.

     Warriors trade rumors: James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody likely staying put at deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In other words, James Wiseman and Moses Moody, and Jonathan Kuminga, who is more solidified in the rotation at this point, are unlikely to be dealt.
From Slater:Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
... [Jonathan] Kuminga, [James] Wiseman and [Moses] Moody remain likely to be with the Warriors beyond the deadline.
For these reasons, the Warriors do profile as more of a buyout team than a trade team.
It would really have to be worth it to move him, and a deal like that likely isn't out there.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA Finals were a blessing for this Boston Celtics squad.
Yet, against the Warriors, the weight of that fateful Finals still weighed heavily, and throughout the 48-minute contest, Boston began to crumble as Golden State slowly amped up the pressure.
All because the Warriors won the mind games...again.
Worryingly, things look strikingly similar heading into Thursday's game, where the Celtics will be hoping to even up the season series 1-1.
The Celtics have a chance to break the curse the Warriors have hanging over them.

     Summary: Most other years, while contending, they‚Äôve remained quiet at the NBA trade deadline, only occasionally nibbling on the fringes.
The best doppelg√§nger for this current Warriors season is actually two years ago.
The day of the 2021 trade deadline, they were 22-22, which is exactly their current record.
Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
Inherently, trade deadline rentals negatively impact the long term for a bump in the immediate.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ¬© Daniel Dunn | 2023 Jan 17It sure seems like the Warriors need to do something at the deadline.
Past the halfway point of the season, the issues that plagued Golden State at the beginning of the year continue to nag them.
At 22-22, it‚Äôs hard to imagine Golden State as currently constructed being in position to repeat.
In order to land either, however, it is likely Golden State would have to part with a draft pick and probably Wiseman.
Golden State would rather do that, according to Slater, but trading for one would likely come at an even heftier price.

     Summary: After looking overwhelmed early in the G League season, he started to grasp the Santa Cruz Warriors‚Äô read-and-react system, post gaudier stats and reinforce management‚Äôs belief in him.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really learning how he can have an impact,‚Äù Santa Cruz head coach Seth Cooper said.
But after averaging 16.8 points on 52.6% shooting (34.8% from 3-point range) over his past eight G League games, Santos appears ahead of schedule.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been around some talented players who just didn‚Äôt have the drive it takes to be truly great,‚Äù Santa Cruz center Jayce Johnson said.
Still, Santos can‚Äôt fret over when he‚Äôll trade his team-provided Santa Cruz hotel room for a penthouse apartment in San Francisco.
