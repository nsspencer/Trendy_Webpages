     Meet The New Cast Of 'That '90s Show': See Their Instagrams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That '90s Show picks up 16 years later, in 1995, and follows the shenanigans of a new generation of ‘90s kids.
The original ensemble cast included Topher Grace as Eric Forman, Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti, Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart, Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso, and more.
Sadly, none of these original cast members are returning as main characters in the reboot, but they'll all make at least one an appearance in the new series.
That being said, That '90s Show is about to introduce a *lot* of new faces, some of whom will play the children of the original characters from That '70s Show.
And now that all 10 episodes of season 1 have arrived on Netflix, you'll want to brush up on your cast list before your binge.

     'That '90s Show' review: Netflix revival is high in nostalgia but only half-baked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet while there’s smoke here, there’s not much heat, as an uninspired next-generation crowd offsets encores by most of the original cast, leaving “That ’90s Show” feeling at best half-baked.
Before it’s over, the audience will also be treated to a reintroduction to Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), who has his own amusing career trajectory.
Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in "That '90s Show."
That might be because instead of charting a new path, the show essentially uses those characters as cutouts to simply recreate aspects of the original series, including the swerving camera and smoke-filled basement epiphanies.

     That ’90s Show Recap: Kiss From a Goober
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith and Rupp are still hitting those marks decades later, and the younger cast of That ’90s Show may well have similarly grabby performances in them.
This sparks the revelation that Leia has never been kissed — like in that great ’90s movie My Girl.
Gwen (who has no trouble locating a rando to snog) then proposes an alternate solution: Leia should just kiss Jay.
Leia attempts to engineer a romantic moment with Jay, who surprises her, and defies his “man-whore” reputation, by deferring their romantic connection.
(Although summed up, it’s not much we couldn’t glean from Kelso and Jackie’s appearance back in the pilot: Jackie left Fez for Kelso.)
