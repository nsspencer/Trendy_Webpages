     Lakers News: LeBron James Injury Status Revealed Ahead of Friday’s Memphis Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 38-year-old All-Star Los Angeles Lakers power forward LeBron James has been playing while banged-up pretty much throughout the 2022-23 NBA season.
He is often listed as merely "probable" to suit up on injury reports preceding the 20-25 Lakers' regular season contests.
Ahead of a game against one of the West's best tomorrow, however, his status is a bit murkier than that.
Jovan Buha of The Athletic reveals that the 18-time All-Star has been listed by LA as merely "questionable" to suit up Friday against a tough 31-13 Memphis Grizzlies club.
He has also had other foot issues this season, and has thus far missed 10 games due to his various ailments.

     Lakers: What Were Rob Pelinka And Rich Paul Discussing Courtside Last Night?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, in the midst of a dispiriting 116-111 home loss to the Sacramento Kings, superagent Rich Paul got into a bit of an animated conversation courtside with LA team vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka.
In addition to being a close friend and business partner of Los Angeles Lakers All-Star power forward LeBron James, Paul is also the CEO of Klutch Sports, perhaps the most powerful agency currently operating in the NBA.
Notably, possible future trade pieces Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley are very much not represented by Rich Paul.
It certainly seems like Rich Paul is giving Pelinka the business a little bit.
Was Rich Paul actually talked about the Laker Girls?
