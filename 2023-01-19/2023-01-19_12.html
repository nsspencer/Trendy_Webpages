     A debt-ceiling crisis years in the making
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Democrats, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, the episode demonstrated why they should never negotiate with hostage-takers.
Why it matters: Every debt-ceiling standoff begins with both sides digging in their heels — and ends with one of them blinking.
The venerable political analyst Charlie Cook agrees, writing that the certainty of avoiding calamity through compromise is "lower than we have ever seen before."
What's happening: The Trump era's political incentives — including online fundraising that relies on hyperbole and bluster — have encouraged House Republicans to adopt a politics of grievance and intransigence.

     U.S. begins ‘extraordinary’ steps to avoid debt ceiling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After raising the debt limit for decades, Republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default.
But the White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and President Biden has pledged to oppose any attempt to cut entitlements.
The White House has few options to act unilaterally to avoid a debt ceiling crisis.
The White House briefly considered that idea during the 2021 debt ceiling crunch but ultimately decided against it.

     Summary: Per the U.S. Constitution, Congress needs to approve all borrowing, so Congress implemented the debt ceiling over a century ago to avoid approving each new debt.
Since then, lawmakers have raised the debt ceiling dozens of times.
“There’s a lot of disagreement these days.”How’s how the debt ceiling fight could impact you.
We’ve had these debt ceiling standoffs, the treasury has done these extraordinary measures before, and the standoffs have always gotten resolved,” Swanson says.

     Rating agencies expect U.S. debt ceiling agreement despite gridlock risks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Rating agencies Moody's and Fitch expect the U.S. Congress will likely reach an agreement on a new debt limit before the Treasury drains resources to stave off a debt default, but warned that an extended political gridlock could ultimately impact the United States' top credit rating.
That has not always been the case, however: A protracted standoff in 2011 prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time, sending financial markets reeling.
Rating agencies Moody's and Fitch both have a triple-A rating for the United States - the highest credit quality status they can assign to a borrower.
S&amp;P Global's sovereign rating for the United States is 'AA+', the second highest rating by the agency.
Should the government be unable to pay some of its obligations, he added, "that would not be consistent with what we would expect from a triple-A rating."

     Biden and Republicans seem set for debt ceiling fight, reviving fraught political battles of years past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mint Images/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Another spending fight looms between the White House and Congress, reviving similar stalemates in 2011 and 2013 under President Barack Obama.
Then, as now, Congress was divided — a Republican House and a Democratic Senate — and the White House had a Democratic president.
“This has become a political football because it’s so easy to pass back and forth and get points for hitting the other side,” said one House Democratic aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly.
Two years later, Obama was again celebrating a breakthrough with Congress over the government’s spending and debt limit.
Since then, the debt limit has either been paused or increased eight times, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, with Congress largely choosing to simply extend the debt limit rather than hold a vote on raising it.

     Stop the Charade: The Federal Budget Is Its Own ‘Debt-Ceiling’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Be that as it may, the important point right now is that both (a) the 1974 budget regime trumps the 1917 budget regime, and (b) the current budget trumps any putative ‘debt ceiling’ imposed after that budget became law.
But it also carries over straightforwardly to the debt ceiling non-issue, in a manner that complements the later-in-time rule.
We must, then, instead view the most recent budget as having implicitly repealed any prior ‘debt ceiling’ legislation that would render compliance with the budget impossible.
The so-called ‘debt ceiling,’ by contrast, says nothing directly about any of these thousands of budget line-items.
The last-enacted budget – which, again, is the law – must accordingly be viewed as implicitly repealing any ‘ceiling’ legislation interpreted as conflicting with it.
