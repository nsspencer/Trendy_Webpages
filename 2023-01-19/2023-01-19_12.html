Here’s what you should know:Roman took over the Ravens offense in 2019 after initially being hired in 2017 as a tight ends coach.
pic.twitter.com/itERSCJP81 — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) January 19, 2023BackstoryDuring Roman’s first season at the helm of Baltimore’s offense, the Ravens led the league in points per game (33.2) and average rushing yards (206).
During the 2020 season, Baltimore was seventh in points per game (29.3) then slid to 17th the following year (22.8).
After a strong offensive start in 2022, the Ravens offense felt like it was stuck in neutral.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "NFL Live" crew runs down the list of coaches who might fit as the Baltimore Ravens' new offensive coordinator.
-- Greg Roman has decided to step down as the Baltimore Ravens' offensive coordinator Thursday amid fan outrage and player frustration.
Roman's downfall was the inability to put together a passing game to complement a record-setting run game and his questionable playcalling in the red zone.
The Ravens totaled the third-fewest passing yards (194.1) in the past three seasons.
Entering his 16th NFL season, Ravens coach John Harbaugh will look for his seventh offensive coordinator.

     Ravens, offensive coordinator Greg Roman part ways after six seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roman, 50, had been the Ravens' offensive coordinator since 2019 (he also was an assistant from 2017-2018), helping usher in a scheme that suited Lamar Jackson well that season, with the Ravens finishing first in yards and points scored and helping Jackson win the MVP award.
That game, the Ravens scored 10 points -- and they would not cross the 17-point mark for the remainder of the season.
In the first 11 games of the season with a healthy Jackson, the Ravens scored 20 points or more nine times.
Following the Ravens' late-season collapse in 2021, there was speculation that Roman could be out.
Prior to first joining the Ravens in 2017 as an assistant, Roman had been the Bills' offensive coordinator for two years before being fired midseason in 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens will have a new offensive coordinator in 2023, as Greg Roman is leaving to seek other opportunities, his agency Athletes First announced.
"Greg has led the development and success of a record-setting offense in Baltimore for several seasons," Harbaugh said.
In 2019, the Ravens had 3,296 rushing yards, breaking the New England Patriots' mark for most rushing yards in a season, a record that stood for 41 years.
However, this season, the Ravens offense ran into more troubles.
Roman's innovative rushing scheme once again excelled, as Baltimore was second in the league with 160 rushing yards per game, but the passing attack finished 28th.
