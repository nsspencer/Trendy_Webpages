     Warriors' Stephen Curry on joining Team USA for 2024 Olympics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry has pretty much done it all in the NBA throughout his decorated tenure with the Golden State Warriors.
Steph might finally get a chance to win the elusive medal in the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Paris, France.
It’s not official yet, but you can be sure that coach Kerr is going to include his superstar in the lineup.
Curry has not played in the Olympics yet, and it’s very likely that he gets his chance next summer.
Let’s just hope he doesn’t sustain any sort of injury at that time because at this point, that seems to be the only factor that’s standing in the way of Steph leading the charge for Team USA at the 2024 Olympic Games.

What are the chances we see you in Paris in 2024?

They all say it’s not even close in terms of the vibe and the atmosphere and the buildup and the adrenaline and all that.
