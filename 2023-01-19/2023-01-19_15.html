     Warriors' Stephen Curry makes history with buzzer beater vs Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is no limit to the range of Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry.
That is his 5th made shot from 45+ feet in his career.
When it comes to draining shots from the perimeter, it’s becoming more and more difficult to argue against the case of Stephen Curry — if there is even a debate about it.
Curry still has a number of good years left in him, so he should be able to add hundreds more to that record.
The Warriors defeated Jayson Tatum and the Celtics in six games in the 2022 NBA Finals and again when the two teams met for the first time this season last December.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are the enemy in Boston these days, but they still have the respect of past Celtics legends.
That includes Basketball Hall of Famer Sam Jones, who passed away on Dec. 30 at age 88.
Jones probably would have preferred Curry didn't win his fourth championship at the Celtics' expense, but his family still honored his wish, presenting Curry with the signed game ball Thursday night.
That's a pretty cool gesture from the family of Jones, who like Curry grew up in North Carolina and like Curry was an excellent shooter, earning the nickname "Mr.
Curry is a lock to join Jones in the Hall of Fame one day -- although he won't be catching the Celtics legend in the rings department.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry has pretty much done it all in the NBA throughout his decorated tenure with the Golden State Warriors.
Steph might finally get a chance to win the elusive medal in the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Paris, France.
It’s not official yet, but you can be sure that coach Kerr is going to include his superstar in the lineup.
Curry has not played in the Olympics yet, and it’s very likely that he gets his chance next summer.
Let’s just hope he doesn’t sustain any sort of injury at that time because at this point, that seems to be the only factor that’s standing in the way of Steph leading the charge for Team USA at the 2024 Olympic Games.

     Summary: Celtics Watch: Steph Curry sinks incredible half-court shot against Celtics Steph Curry's shot gave Golden State a 55-54 lead over Boston at the half.
Steph Curry hit another half-court shot, this time against the Celtics, on Thursday night at TD Garden.
And the 34-year-old point guard further cemented his title on Thursday night at TD Garden, sinking a 46-foot halfcourt shot against the Celtics to close out the first half and put the Warriors up by 1.
But Curry stripped the ball away from the Celtics star just past half court, lobbing up a Hail-Mary attempt that swished through the basket.
But Boston will need to tighten things up against the Warriors in the second half, with the Celtics relinquishing 15 points off of turnovers.

     Summary: Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history, and there is not a single player who is close.
Not only does Steph have the most three-pointers in NBA history, but he now has tied the record for the most half-court makes in NBA history.
With his insane half-court three against the Boston Celtics on Thursday night, Curry tied Jamal Crawford for the most half-court threes in NBA history.
The stat was categorized by made shots from at least 45 feet, and Curry tied Crawford with his 8th career shot from that deep.
Nobody has ever done it like Steph Curry, and nobody ever will.

The end of the half featured the most entertaining of those back-and-forths, as Stephen Curry put an exclamation point on the half by poking the ball away from Jayson Tatum, gathering it in, and hoisting a 46-footer from beyond halfcourt that, naturally, found nothing but net.
STEPH AT THE BUZZER FROM HALF-COURT 🤯 WARRIORS LEAD AT THE HALF ON TNT pic.twitter.com/optksxdfib — NBA (@NBA) January 20, 2023It’s a preposterous play, but the shot itself is one that everyone in the arena and watching at home expected to go in as soon as it left his fingers because, well, that’s what Steph does.
The shot gave Golden State the lead, but also made a little history, as Curry matched Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph (??!)
for the most 45-plus foot shots since the league started tracking that data in the mid-90s with the fifth such make of his career.
