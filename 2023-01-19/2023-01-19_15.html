     Scream 6 Trailer Honors Franchise’s Most Iconic Kill with Easter Egg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And now it’s “New York, new rules” for Scream 6, as the previous film’s surviving crop of tormented teens leaves Woodsboro for the Big Apple.
Now the first full trailer confirms the next chapter will go back to the start of the slasher series.
If you were watching the trailer closely, you might’ve noticed that Scream 6 homages the franchise’s most iconic kill.
A change of scenery has drawn Ghostface(s) closer, with the trailer’s most talked-about scene being an Easter egg hunt for the Scream movies that have come before.
When trying to guide the younger survivors, Gale tells us this unknown warehouse is a “shrine” to the previous killers.

     Summary: Embattled “Heroes” alum Hayden Panettiere — who played Kirby Reed in 2011’s “Scream 4″ — is using the stab series to launch a career comeback after years of personal struggles.
Hayden Panettiere is back as Kirby Reed in the sixth film of the “Scream” franchise.
The trailer ends with Gooding and Savoy’s characters, as well as Sam and Tara, spotting Ghostface on a No.
I’m not watching this without Neve Campbell.
Not including her in Scream 6 because y’all refused to pay Neve Campbell her worth is absurd,” a fan proclaimed.

     Summary: Scream 6 promises two things: a New York setting — a fresh backdrop for the franchise, now that Scream survivors Mindy, Chad, and Tara have moved far away from Woodsboro, California to attend college — and new rules.
But this Ghostface promises he’s “something different.”The new Scream 6 trailer does show plenty of familiar Scream series elements, including the killer(s) Ghostface, and — returning from 2022’s soft reboot Scream 5 — stars Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Jenna Ortega, and Melissa Barrera scrambling for survival on the mean streets and bodega floors of New York.

It’s a surreal shot, as Ghostface has always used a knife and never a gun except for in the reveal scenes.
From that, we move to another stellar New York City shot, then a voiceover of Sam saying, “There’s a darkness inside of me.
The end takes us back to the teaser trailer, with the characters in a subway at what looks like Halloween.

     Summary: One of the most exciting reveals in the new Scream 6 trailer that dropped today has to be a first glimpse at the franchise return of Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere).
A Scream 4 fan favorite and one of the growing collective of women who have survived their dalliances with Ghostface, Kirby (and Panettiere) seem more than primed for a comeback.
In fact, Scream 6 executive producer Kevin Williamson says she would have been back sooner, but the production team just couldn’t seem to locate Panettiere.
“I called up my producer in Nashville and said, ‘Do you know Hayden Panettiere, by any chance?

     Summary: Williamson has remained quiet about exactly what Kirby's role will be in "Scream VI," which is probably for the best.
"There's so much speculation about what her participation is in the movie and I love it," Williamson said.
It's tough to predict Kirby's role in "Scream VI" because her place in the franchise is sort of unusual.
Things are complicated even more by the fact that Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) basically took over Kirby's role as the self-aware horror buff of the group.
"Scream VI" releases in theaters on March 10, 2023.
