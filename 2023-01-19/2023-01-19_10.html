     Summary: U.S. hits its debt limit and now risks defaulting on its billsEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in a letter to Congress on Thursday, said the U.S. has reached its debt limit, and has begun resorting to "extraordinary measures" so the government can continue paying its bills.
Yellen had already previously warned the U.S. would reach its debt limit on Thursday but had said the Treasury Department was preparing a contingency plan to avoid a default on the country's debt.
Raising the debt limit used to be a routine exercise for Congress but it has become increasingly fraught.
A potentially huge political fight looms this year as some House Republicans have vowed to block any increase in the debt limit in order to extract spending cuts.
"The period of time that extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty," Yellen wrote.

     The Debt Ceiling, Explained—What Happens If The U.S. Doesn’t Raise It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesKey FactsThe debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow through the U.S. Treasury in order to pay its existing legal financial obligations.
Some of the financial obligations include Social Security, Medicare benefits, military salaries, tax refunds and interest on the national debt.
The U.S. debt ceiling is $31.3 trillion.
So far, President Biden has said that he will not negotiate, and Congress must raise the debt ceiling with no strings attached.
Key BackgroundIn 2011, former President Obama found himself in a standoff with congressional Republicans over the debt ceiling.

     US government hits debt ceiling as Biden and House Republicans face off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These include a “debt issuance suspension period” lasting from today until 5 June, as well as suspending investments into two government employee retirement funds.
An artificially imposed cap, the debt ceiling has been increased roughly 80 times since the 1960s.
Biden insists on a “clean” increase to the debt limit so that existing financial commitments can be sustained and is refusing to even start talks with Republicans.
“There should be no political brinkmanship with the debt limit,” said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York.
What happens if these measures are exhausted without a debt limit deal is unknown.

     U.S. begins ‘extraordinary’ steps to avoid debt ceiling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After raising the debt limit for decades, Republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default.
But the White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and President Biden has pledged to oppose any attempt to cut entitlements.
The White House has few options to act unilaterally to avoid a debt ceiling crisis.
The White House briefly considered that idea during the 2021 debt ceiling crunch but ultimately decided against it.
