    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS --- As Michael Reinsdorf walked into Accor Arena Thursday night, the Chicago Bulls’ president and chief executive officer couldn’t help but think back to 1997.
So to have our first real regular-season game in Europe it does get me excited, and I think the players are excited,” Reinsdorf said.
“It doesn’t feel like your typical regular-season game in mid-January against the Pistons, that’s for sure.’’Reinsdorf said he noticed the numerous fans wearing Bulls jerseys.
I think this is a great opportunity for the NBA,” Reinsdorf said.
But as MJ said, I don’t think the Bulls could have won those six championships if they didn’t have to go through the Pistons first.

REPLENISHED – After playing with only one big man for four straight games, forcing Hamidou Diallo and Kevin Knox to serve as makeshift centers, the Pistons inched toward a full complement of players.
Duren came off the bench after starting 15 straight games beginning on Dec. 9.
Nerlens Noel, who started three straight games before missing Sunday’s loss to New York with left foot soreness, was listed as questionable prior to tipoff with foot soreness.

26 years apart 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/BouctHjpyp — Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) January 19, 2023With all the might of the NBA behind them, the Bulls and Pistons put on quite a show for the people in France.
“The trip was great for us going forward, obviously going into the second half of the season,” Bulls guard Zach LaVine told reporters after the game.
With only nine games remaining on the Bulls’ schedule before the Feb. 9 trade deadline, the team has reached a critical stage.
The Bulls (21-24) will return from France only three games under .500., a record they haven’t held since Nov. 7.

“It might be the only time we get to play in Paris,” LaVine said.
DeRozan returned from missing three games with a right quad strain---“it was definitely good,” he said---and posted 26 points, nine rebounds and five assists.
“It was a great experience overall.”Then LaVine, in a nod to the budding sommelier in him, smiled.
“I’m definitely coming back to Paris again, maybe for a wine trip,” he said.

     COLUMN: It’s time for the Chicago Bulls to ‘blow up’ their roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers’ Joel Embiid looks to shoot as Chicago Bulls’ Nikola Vucevic (9) and Zach LaVine defend during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 6, 2021, in Chicago.
Before the All-Star break last season, the Chicago Bulls remained at the top of the Eastern Conference but fell apart after the All-Star break due to covid protocols and Lonzo Ball’s injury.
This season the Bulls have played below average, and Lonzo Ball hasn’t returned from his injury.
As of right now, the Bulls have a record of 20-24 which is very concerning because they have a roster with three all-stars.
The front office should make trades at the deadline to correct what this roster lacks or blow it up and wait until the offseason.

“I never looked at it that way because I just hate missing games more than anything, man,” DeRozan said following Thursday’s morning shootaround.
“That’s always been my mentality.”The thought process begs the obvious question: How much longer does DeRozan plan to play?
“Just to spend time with my daughters and my son, that’s kind of been special for me,” DeRozan said when asked for his favorite off-court element to this special trip.
That’s kind of been the best experience for me, for sure."
