     Summary: Edu BuenoOlympiacos and Real Madrid go head-to-head tonight at Athens's legendary Peace and Friendship Stadium.
It's first versus second at the start of this round of games, the best offense against the top defense.
It's set to be their fourth away game on the bounce, the three so far all going in our team's favour (KK Crvena Zvezda, Alba Berlin and Coviran Granada).
If we count the Maccabi game, we've won our last three European encounters.
At home, only KK Crvena Zvezda, Valencia Basket and Monaco have got the better of them.

     Summary: Real Madrid have been suffering considerably at the hands of their opponents of late, looking a yard off the pace and a step slower to every ball.
Real Madrid did not undergo a strenuous preseason in July and August, but fitness coach had planned for a second preseason after the World Cup, albeit with specific plans for each player.
The result in theory will mean that Real Madrid will arrive at the crunch period of the season at peak fitness.
Pintus has regularly come up with the goods for Real Madrid, but the inherent risk is that Real Madrid find themselves too far behind in La Liga and out of the Copa del Rey by the time they are fit again.
In the next four weeks, they face Villarreal, Athletic Club, Real Sociedad, Valencia, Real Mallorca, two World Club Cup games, Elche and Osasuna, before travelling to Anfield to face Liverpool.
