That '70s Show tracked the life of Eric Forman, a typical Wisconsin teenager, and his rowdy friends and family.
That '70s Show became a handbook for my fast-approaching freshman year, and one of my favorite television shows.
At its worst, That '70s Show, like many other sitcoms of the early-aughts, capitalized on tired jokes based on stereotypes.

     Summary: There’s one character you won’t be seeing or hearing about on Netflix’s reboot of That 70’s Show, entitled That 90’s Show, and that’s Steve Hyde, originally portrayed in the first iteration by Danny Masterson.
Even though Masterson’s Steven Hyde was a main character on That ’70s Show, the character isn’t addressed on the show.
Netflix hasn’t addressed Masterson’s absence from the reboot.
However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused.
