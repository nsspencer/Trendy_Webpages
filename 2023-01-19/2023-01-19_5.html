     Report: Warriors' Trade Deadline Plans Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having hovered around .500 for most of the season, the Golden State Warriors are in a unique spot.
Had the Warriors started this season the way they started last season, there would be very limited trade talk as the deadline approaches.
Choosing to stay put at last year's deadline, the Warriors showed immense belief in their roster, and it paid off.
In a recent report from The Athletic's Anthony Slater, it was revealed that Golden State is not expected to make a big splash at this year's trade deadline, and instead will nibble on the fringes, if anything.
"Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything."

     Celtics overcome costly mistakes down the stretch to outlast Warriors in overtime thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics outlasted the Golden State Warriors Thursday night in overtime, 121-118, to grab their eighth-straight win, but it certainly wasn't easy.
Down the stretch of regulation and overtime Boston made several errors that almost lost them the game, something All-Star guard Jayson Tatum called attention to immediately following the win.
But they should know by now that you can't do that against this Warriors team.
The most egregious mistakes came at the end of overtime, as the Celtics clung to a 121-113 lead with 38 seconds left.
After the game, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla spoke about what his team learned from this win.

     Summary: BOSTON -- The Golden State Warriors returned here Thursday night for the first time since they beat the Celtics in Game 6 to claim the 2022 NBA championship.
But, on a night when little went right for the home team, the Celtics did something they ultimately couldn't in last year's Finals: find a way to win.
It didn't feel like the Celtics would be able to say anything about this game being a step in a positive direction for most of the night.
And it takes a mindset to be a really, really good team in the NBA.
I think even though you play really, really well and we win, we're still going to have some of those moments.

     Summary: Most other years, while contending, they’ve remained quiet at the NBA trade deadline, only occasionally nibbling on the fringes.
The best doppelgänger for this current Warriors season is actually two years ago.
The day of the 2021 trade deadline, they were 22-22, which is exactly their current record.
Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
Inherently, trade deadline rentals negatively impact the long term for a bump in the immediate.

     Summary: In other words, James Wiseman and Moses Moody, and Jonathan Kuminga, who is more solidified in the rotation at this point, are unlikely to be dealt.
From Slater:Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
... [Jonathan] Kuminga, [James] Wiseman and [Moses] Moody remain likely to be with the Warriors beyond the deadline.
For these reasons, the Warriors do profile as more of a buyout team than a trade team.
It would really have to be worth it to move him, and a deal like that likely isn't out there.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After looking overwhelmed early in the G League season, he started to grasp the Santa Cruz Warriors’ read-and-react system, post gaudier stats and reinforce management’s belief in him.
“He’s really learning how he can have an impact,” Santa Cruz head coach Seth Cooper said.
But after averaging 16.8 points on 52.6% shooting (34.8% from 3-point range) over his past eight G League games, Santos appears ahead of schedule.
“I’ve been around some talented players who just didn’t have the drive it takes to be truly great,” Santa Cruz center Jayce Johnson said.
Still, Santos can’t fret over when he’ll trade his team-provided Santa Cruz hotel room for a penthouse apartment in San Francisco.
