     Report: Warriors' Trade Deadline Plans Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having hovered around .500 for most of the season, the Golden State Warriors are in a unique spot.
Had the Warriors started this season the way they started last season, there would be very limited trade talk as the deadline approaches.
Choosing to stay put at last year's deadline, the Warriors showed immense belief in their roster, and it paid off.
In a recent report from The Athletic's Anthony Slater, it was revealed that Golden State is not expected to make a big splash at this year's trade deadline, and instead will nibble on the fringes, if anything.
"Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In other words, James Wiseman and Moses Moody, and Jonathan Kuminga, who is more solidified in the rotation at this point, are unlikely to be dealt.
From Slater:Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
... [Jonathan] Kuminga, [James] Wiseman and [Moses] Moody remain likely to be with the Warriors beyond the deadline.
For these reasons, the Warriors do profile as more of a buyout team than a trade team.
It would really have to be worth it to move him, and a deal like that likely isn't out there.

     Celtics beat Warriors in OT, win NBA Finals rematch 121-118
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Up on the podium, his father needed no reminder of what Thursday night’s game against the Golden State Warriors meant for the Celtics and their fans.
The victory snapped a four-game losing streak against Golden State — the last three games of the finals and the first regular-season rematch, which the Warriors won in San Francisco in December.
Boston got sloppy down the stretch to give Golden State a chance at the buzzer, but Poole’s half-court shot wasn’t close.
Although the Celtics have come out to the best record in the NBA this season, the losses to Golden State still rankle them.
Tatum struggled against the Warriors in June and scored 18 points on 6-for-21 shooting at Golden State on Dec. 10.

     Summary: Golden State still hasn’t beaten a team at.500 or better on the road this season, and it let an incredible opportunity slip away because of self-inflicted wounds.
Fouled Out: Golden State 1 (Thompson), Boston None.
Golden State had great success with this strategy at times last season, but this time around it didn’t exactly yield favorable results defensively.
The Celtics outscored Golden State 52-30 in the paint and outrebounded them 63-47 (18 offensive).
While the backcourt trio of Curry, Thompson and Poole did light up the scoreboard, it obviously came with a cost.

     Summary: Report: Warriors expected to 'nibble' at trade deadline originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaThe Warriors' struggles through the first half of the season have a fraction of Dub Nation hoping the front office will make a miraculous move at the Feb. 9 trade deadline.
“Sources with knowledge of the Warriors’ thinking, who were granted anonymity so that they could speak freely, indicate [the Warriors’ 2020 to 2021] strategy profiles as the most likely path for these current Warriors," Slater wrote.
"Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything."
The Warriors have plenty of roster issues to address as their young players have struggled to make a consistent impact.
A few intriguing names expected to be floating out on the trade market at the deadline include San Antonio Spurs center Jakob Poeltl and Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso.

     Summary: Most other years, while contending, they’ve remained quiet at the NBA trade deadline, only occasionally nibbling on the fringes.
The best doppelgänger for this current Warriors season is actually two years ago.
The day of the 2021 trade deadline, they were 22-22, which is exactly their current record.
Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
Inherently, trade deadline rentals negatively impact the long term for a bump in the immediate.
