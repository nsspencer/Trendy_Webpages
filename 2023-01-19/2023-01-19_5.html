     Netflix's That '90s Show is a Lackluster Throwback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the whole approach loses its own innocence and whatever waning cuteness it can conjure by feeling too much like a stubborn repeat.
And how are those juicy references to the ‘90s?
As for the original cast, you can nearly clock how long the studio audience applauds and cheers for them when they pop back into Red and Kitty’s time capsule of a kitchen.
The late ’90s were good to these actors, and the original's success gives Smith and Jo Rupp more time to lead in this second go around.
"That '90s Show" is now playing on Netflix.

     ‘That ’90s Show’ Updates a Familiar Formula, With Mixed Results: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are a few quibbles one might make about “That ‘90s Show,” the first of which announces itself somewhat plainly.
Inasmuch as “That ‘90s Show” succeeds, it does so by establishing a warm and sunny central dynamic among its new central cast of teens.
(It does so to such an extent that we can forget that the central characters are, in fact, part of Generation X, but never mind that.)
(That show’s comic density and curiosity about how its format could be stretched made it feel truly new.)
Some things are eternal, but it can be nice to infuse an old story with some new spirit.

     Summary: That '90s Show Patrick Wymore/NetflixThat '90s Show was never going to have an easy road to success.
That '90s Show is, interestingly enough, a perfect encapsulation of both the good and the bad that comes with the current revival craze.
But once Eric and Donna leave town and the show switches gears to focus on Leia and her friends, That '90s Show struggles to create any momentum.
All of this is filtered through Leia, who's the "good girl" of the group, coming of age in the same way her father did.
Sure, That '90s Show is an easy watch, another harmless sitcom added to Netflix's library.

     'That '90s Show' review: Netflix revival is high in nostalgia but only half-baked
    </h2>

     Summary: Yet while there’s smoke here, there’s not much heat, as an uninspired next-generation crowd offsets encores by most of the original cast, leaving “That ’90s Show” feeling at best half-baked.
Before it’s over, the audience will also be treated to a reintroduction to Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), who has his own amusing career trajectory.
Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in "That '90s Show."
That might be because instead of charting a new path, the show essentially uses those characters as cutouts to simply recreate aspects of the original series, including the swerving camera and smoke-filled basement epiphanies.
“That ’90s Show” premieres January 19 on Netflix.

     That ’90s Show Recap: Kiss From a Goober
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith and Rupp are still hitting those marks decades later, and the younger cast of That ’90s Show may well have similarly grabby performances in them.
This sparks the revelation that Leia has never been kissed — like in that great ’90s movie My Girl.
Gwen (who has no trouble locating a rando to snog) then proposes an alternate solution: Leia should just kiss Jay.
Leia attempts to engineer a romantic moment with Jay, who surprises her, and defies his “man-whore” reputation, by deferring their romantic connection.
(Although summed up, it’s not much we couldn’t glean from Kelso and Jackie’s appearance back in the pilot: Jackie left Fez for Kelso.)

     That ’90s Show Recap: The Same Old Thing That We Did Last Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s particularly true of “Free Leia,” which has room to develop its comic conflict and promptly squanders it as if this were an episode of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law or something.
But all this episode really provides are the bones: A couple of amusing video-store farce scenes, a rushed non-conflict that leaves absolutely no doubt that Leia’s friends really don’t mind her dorkiness, and an equally fast resolution.
It’s moves like these that make “Free Leia” feel less like a summer repeat of the pilot and more like the show is already serving up leftovers.
Then again, it is kind of cute to see the gang fawn over Red’s closet full of old work shirts.
And the gang really does watch Free Willy with better results than poor Homer Simpson.

     That ’90s Show Series-Premiere Recap: Hello Again, Wisconsin!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At least That ’90s Show might actually include some TLC at some point — if Netflix ponies up for the music licensing.
That ’90s Show is the sequel series to That ’70s Show, a sitcom that does admittedly feel like a good candidate for a quarter-century-later revival.
Those two NBC powerhouses brought ’90s singleton-coms to their apex, and the multi-camera sitcom waned by comparison in their absence.
Really, “That ’90s Pilot” is about introducing new ’90s analogs to the original cast, which (apart from the invaluable Smith and Rupp) will not be sticking around full time.
One of the pilot’s better jokes puts a number on Eric: “Eric’s having a hard time with Leia,” Donna says.
