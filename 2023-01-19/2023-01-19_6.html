    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers can’t buy a whistle in the most critical moments of close ballgames.
The latest example comes from the Lakers’ 116-111 loss to the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday at Crypto.com Arena.
Kendrick Nunn hit a contested three-pointer on De’Aaron Fox to put Los Angeles within one point with about eight seconds remaining.
Here’s footage of the sequence:Here's the non-call on Fox, which was immediately followed by a clear-path foul on Max Christie that sealed the win for the Kings.
I'm sure this will make the Lakers and Lakers fans feel so much better.

     Summary: EL SEGUNDO — The common thread between the last two games between the Lakers and the Sacramento Kings is De’Aaron Fox – and what is or isn’t a foul.
If the role is reversed and I do that to Fox, they’re gonna call it a foul.
They squandered a number of possessions in the final 6½ minutes of Wednesday’s game from a 101-all tie.
Juan Toscano-Anderson pointed to some of his own mistakes late: He fouled Fox with 12 seconds remaining, putting the Lakers in a four-point hole.
James is well ahead so far of his next closest Western competitor, Golden State’s Steph Curry with 5.1 million votes.
