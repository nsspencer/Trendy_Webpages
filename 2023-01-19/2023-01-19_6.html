     Lakers News: LeBron James Injury Status Revealed Ahead of Friday’s Memphis Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 38-year-old All-Star Los Angeles Lakers power forward LeBron James has been playing while banged-up pretty much throughout the 2022-23 NBA season.
He is often listed as merely "probable" to suit up on injury reports preceding the 20-25 Lakers' regular season contests.
Ahead of a game against one of the West's best tomorrow, however, his status is a bit murkier than that.
Jovan Buha of The Athletic reveals that the 18-time All-Star has been listed by LA as merely "questionable" to suit up Friday against a tough 31-13 Memphis Grizzlies club.
He has also had other foot issues this season, and has thus far missed 10 games due to his various ailments.

Despite another excellent game from LeBron James, the Lakers once again came up just short, falling by five points and dropping their fourth game in the last five.
Their last three losses have come by a combined 10 points and LeBron James believes it is a case of the team simply having no room for error with the pieces they are missing right now.
“We’re definitely a ballclub that has zero room for error,” LeBron said after Wednesday’s loss.
LeBron feels like had a couple of bounces gone the Lakers’ way, the result would have been different.
