     How ‘That ’90s Show’ Explains Danny Masterson’s Absence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s one character you won’t be seeing or hearing about on Netflix’s reboot of That 70’s Show, entitled That 90’s Show, and that’s Steve Hyde, originally portrayed in the first iteration by Danny Masterson.
Even though Masterson’s Steven Hyde was a main character on That ’70s Show, the character isn’t addressed on the show.
Netflix hasn’t addressed Masterson’s absence from the reboot.
However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused.

     Summary: But the whole approach loses its own innocence and whatever waning cuteness it can conjure by feeling too much like a stubborn repeat.
And how are those juicy references to the ‘90s?
As for the original cast, you can nearly clock how long the studio audience applauds and cheers for them when they pop back into Red and Kitty’s time capsule of a kitchen.
The late ’90s were good to these actors, and the original's success gives Smith and Jo Rupp more time to lead in this second go around.
"That '90s Show" is now playing on Netflix.

     'That '90s Show' review: Netflix revival is high in nostalgia but only half-baked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet while there’s smoke here, there’s not much heat, as an uninspired next-generation crowd offsets encores by most of the original cast, leaving “That ’90s Show” feeling at best half-baked.
Before it’s over, the audience will also be treated to a reintroduction to Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), who has his own amusing career trajectory.
Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in "That '90s Show."
That might be because instead of charting a new path, the show essentially uses those characters as cutouts to simply recreate aspects of the original series, including the swerving camera and smoke-filled basement epiphanies.
“That ’90s Show” premieres January 19 on Netflix.

It's a perfect return, followed by even more flawless cameos.
Chong’s second cameo, wandering around lost in the forest, was also a callback to his many adventures in That '70s Show.

     That ’90s Show Recap: Kiss From a Goober
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith and Rupp are still hitting those marks decades later, and the younger cast of That ’90s Show may well have similarly grabby performances in them.
This sparks the revelation that Leia has never been kissed — like in that great ’90s movie My Girl.
Gwen (who has no trouble locating a rando to snog) then proposes an alternate solution: Leia should just kiss Jay.
Leia attempts to engineer a romantic moment with Jay, who surprises her, and defies his “man-whore” reputation, by deferring their romantic connection.
(Although summed up, it’s not much we couldn’t glean from Kelso and Jackie’s appearance back in the pilot: Jackie left Fez for Kelso.)

    </h2>

     Summary: That '90s Show Patrick Wymore/NetflixThat '90s Show was never going to have an easy road to success.
That '90s Show is, interestingly enough, a perfect encapsulation of both the good and the bad that comes with the current revival craze.
But once Eric and Donna leave town and the show switches gears to focus on Leia and her friends, That '90s Show struggles to create any momentum.
All of this is filtered through Leia, who's the "good girl" of the group, coming of age in the same way her father did.
Sure, That '90s Show is an easy watch, another harmless sitcom added to Netflix's library.

     That ’90s Show Recap: Somewhat Online
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nascent online culture makes its way to Point Place in “Step By Step,” which does not reference the weirdly smutty family sitcom from ABC that aired for a disturbing majority of the ’90s.
Kitty is setting up the Forman family’s first computer, and she is (somewhat improbably, given the year and her age) focused primarily on using it to connect to the internet.
Still, as forward-thinking as Kitty may be in this regard (the Simpsons didn’t even have a computer yet in 1995!
When Donna arrives on the scene, Ozzie still doesn’t feel quite ready, so Leia maintains the confusion.
• ’90s reference watch: Yes, Friends and America Online, but really, much of this episode could take place now, or at least some time in the late 2000s, without much updating beyond swapping out AOL for broadband.
