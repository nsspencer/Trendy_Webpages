    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry did Stephen Curry things Thursday night at TD Garden.
The Golden State Warriors superstar made his presence felt with four 3-pointers in the first half of the NBA Finals rematch vs. the Boston Celtics.
With two seconds left on the clock, Curry swiped the ball from C's star Jayson Tatum and heaved it from halfcourt.
Well, that was insane pic.twitter.com/N4jH7WLoWt â€” Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) January 20, 2023Curry's ridiculous shot gave Golden State a 55-54 lead at halftime.
Since the start of the 2022 NBA Finals, Curry is averaging 31.3 points per game vs. Boston.

     Warriors' Stephen Curry makes history with buzzer beater vs Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is no limit to the range of Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry.
That is his 5th made shot from 45+ feet in his career.
When it comes to draining shots from the perimeter, itâ€™s becoming more and more difficult to argue against the case of Stephen Curry â€” if there is even a debate about it.
Curry still has a number of good years left in him, so he should be able to add hundreds more to that record.
The Warriors defeated Jayson Tatum and the Celtics in six games in the 2022 NBA Finals and again when the two teams met for the first time this season last December.

     Steph Curry Swished A Halfcourt Shot To End The Half In Boston
    </h2>

     Summary: Thursday night brought about the final regular season rematch from last yearâ€™s NBA Finals, as the Golden State Warriors traveled to Boston to face the Celtics, and the first half of action did not disappoint.
The end of the half featured the most entertaining of those back-and-forths, as Stephen Curry put an exclamation point on the half by poking the ball away from Jayson Tatum, gathering it in, and hoisting a 46-footer from beyond halfcourt that, naturally, found nothing but net.
STEPH AT THE BUZZER FROM HALF-COURT ðŸ¤¯ WARRIORS LEAD AT THE HALF ON TNT pic.twitter.com/optksxdfib â€” NBA (@NBA) January 20, 2023Itâ€™s a preposterous play, but the shot itself is one that everyone in the arena and watching at home expected to go in as soon as it left his fingers because, well, thatâ€™s what Steph does.
The shot gave Golden State the lead, but also made a little history, as Curry matched Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph (??!)
for the most 45-plus foot shots since the league started tracking that data in the mid-90s with the fifth such make of his career.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are the enemy in Boston these days, but they still have the respect of past Celtics legends.
That includes Basketball Hall of Famer Sam Jones, who passed away on Dec. 30 at age 88.
Jones probably would have preferred Curry didn't win his fourth championship at the Celtics' expense, but his family still honored his wish, presenting Curry with the signed game ball Thursday night.
That's a pretty cool gesture from the family of Jones, who like Curry grew up in North Carolina and like Curry was an excellent shooter, earning the nickname "Mr.
Curry is a lock to join Jones in the Hall of Fame one day -- although he won't be catching the Celtics legend in the rings department.

     Summary: Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history, and there is not a single player who is close.
Not only does Steph have the most three-pointers in NBA history, but he now has tied the record for the most half-court makes in NBA history.
With his insane half-court three against the Boston Celtics on Thursday night, Curry tied Jamal Crawford for the most half-court threes in NBA history.
The stat was categorized by made shots from at least 45 feet, and Curry tied Crawford with his 8th career shot from that deep.

     Summary: Celtics Watch: Steph Curry sinks incredible half-court shot against Celtics Steph Curry's shot gave Golden State a 55-54 lead over Boston at the half.
Steph Curry hit another half-court shot, this time against the Celtics, on Thursday night at TD Garden.
And the 34-year-old point guard further cemented his title on Thursday night at TD Garden, sinking a 46-foot halfcourt shot against the Celtics to close out the first half and put the Warriors up by 1.
But Curry stripped the ball away from the Celtics star just past half court, lobbing up a Hail-Mary attempt that swished through the basket.
But Boston will need to tighten things up against the Warriors in the second half, with the Celtics relinquishing 15 points off of turnovers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON â€” The Celtics looked like they were about to take a two-point lead into halftime of their matchup against the Warriors on Thursday night.
With time running out in the second quarter of the NBA Finals rematch, Celtics star Jayson Tatum was streaking up the floor hoping to get one final shot off.
As the 24-year-old crossed half court, however, he was stripped by Curry, who fired up a desperation heave before the final second ticked off the clock.
Steph Gonna STEPHHHHH pic.twitter.com/6R3Q7z1vro â€” Golden State Warriors (@warriors) January 20, 2023The outcome of the heave was almost expected, as the NBAâ€™s greatest shooter ever has been known to sink similar shots.
The emphatic three put the Warriors up, 55-54, heading into the break.
