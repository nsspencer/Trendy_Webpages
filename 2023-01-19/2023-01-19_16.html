     New autopsy report shows Leslie Jordan died from sudden cardiac dysfunction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leslie Jordan died of "sudden cardiac dysfunction" caused by arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, according to a new report by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner obtained by NBC News.
Jordan died in a car accident at age 67 on Oct. 24.
The medical examiner's report stated that beloved ‚ÄúCall Me Kat‚Äù star veered his car into another vehicle and then collided into a building.
The report noted that the presence of more than 70% occlusion of any coronary artery greatly increases the risk of a sudden cardiac event.
The episode also featured the sitcom's star, Mayim Bialik, honoring Jordan by wearing the late actor‚Äôs rainbow-striped sneakers during filming.
