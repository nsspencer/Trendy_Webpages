    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CENTENNIAL, Colo. (KCNC) - Authorities in Colorado say a man was hospitalized after he ate rat poison in his to-go order from Taco Bell.
“That hospital said they had a patient who had possibly consumed rat poison in his food from the same restaurant.
Right now, what we’re looking at is if the rat poison was actually put into his food at the restaurant,” Bartmann said.
She says they don’t store rat poison at the location.
Sheriff’s investigators say the amount of rat poison in the man’s to-go order was significant, but they’re not ruling out any possibility of how it ended up there.
