     Scream 6 Trailer Honors Franchise’s Most Iconic Kill with Easter Egg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And now it’s “New York, new rules” for Scream 6, as the previous film’s surviving crop of tormented teens leaves Woodsboro for the Big Apple.
Now the first full trailer confirms the next chapter will go back to the start of the slasher series.
If you were watching the trailer closely, you might’ve noticed that Scream 6 homages the franchise’s most iconic kill.
A change of scenery has drawn Ghostface(s) closer, with the trailer’s most talked-about scene being an Easter egg hunt for the Scream movies that have come before.
When trying to guide the younger survivors, Gale tells us this unknown warehouse is a “shrine” to the previous killers.

     Scream 6 trailer promises a Ghostface that’s ‘something different’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scream 6 promises two things: a New York setting — a fresh backdrop for the franchise, now that Scream survivors Mindy, Chad, and Tara have moved far away from Woodsboro, California to attend college — and new rules.
But this Ghostface promises he’s “something different.”The new Scream 6 trailer does show plenty of familiar Scream series elements, including the killer(s) Ghostface, and — returning from 2022’s soft reboot Scream 5 — stars Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Jenna Ortega, and Melissa Barrera scrambling for survival on the mean streets and bodega floors of New York.

The trailer ends with Gooding and Savoy’s characters, as well as Sam and Tara, spotting Ghostface on a No.
I’m not watching this without Neve Campbell.
Not including her in Scream 6 because y’all refused to pay Neve Campbell her worth is absurd,” a fan proclaimed.
