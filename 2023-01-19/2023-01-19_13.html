     Updated Brooklyn Nets vs Phoenix Suns Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both the Phoenix Suns and Brooklyn Nets are in need of a win, but the Suns are a lot more desperate.
Fortunately for the Brooklyn Nets, it looks like they'll have more help than the Phoenix Suns.
After losing three games straight, the Nets are fortunately getting Kyrie Irving back - he's been upgraded to available for tonight's game.
The Phoenix Suns, however, remain incredibly shorthanded.
Both the Phoenix Suns and Brooklyn Nets have lost three games straight, but the Suns have lost 9 out of the last 10 games.

     Phoenix Suns update: Chris Paul (hip) out Thursday vs. Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Paul will sit Thursday night against Brooklyn (27-16) with a sore right hip after being listed as questionable Wednesday.
Missing Phoenix's last five games, Paul hasn’t played since the first half of the Jan. 6 loss to Miami at Footprint Center.
With Paul and Shamet out, Saben Lee or Duane Washington Jr. will likely get the start.
A Corona del Sol graduate, Lee is on a 10-day contract that ends Friday while Washington Jr. is a two-way player.
Kevin Durant is out for the Nets with a right MCL sprain while Kyrie Irving is listed as probable with a sore right calf.

     B/R Grades Suns' Top-Earning Players Thus Far
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the Phoenix Suns are healthy, they're one of the best teams in the league.
Their typical starting lineup of Chris Paul-Devin Booker-Mikal Bridges-Cam Johnson-Deandre Ayton has played just six games together thus far.
The trio of Booker-Ayton-Paul has missed a combined 41 games thus far, and that's heavily played into the Suns having lost their last nine-of-ten games.
"Booker hasn't played since Christmas Day with a groin injury, with the Suns falling to just 2-8 overall since.
"Instead, Ayton's 17.0 points per game over the last month are actually down slightly from his overall average (17.3 points).

     Phoenix Suns find right level of energy, pick up much-needed win vs. Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — The Phoenix Suns need to be opportunists the rest of the season.
So when a Brooklyn Nets team without Kevin Durant sleepwalked defensively through the first half and more on Thursday in Phoenix, the Suns had to pounce.
They did, doing enough damage in the first three quarters to hold off a Nets comeback for a 117-112 win.
That was the Suns’ main source of offense throughout the night and Ayton did a wonderful job most of the evening.
“Mikal is just finding different ways to grow his game,” Williams said.
