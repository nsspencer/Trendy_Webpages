    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — "Will &amp; Grace" actor Leslie Jordan, who was found without a pulse after a car crash in Hollywood last year, died of sudden cardiac dysfunction, officials said Thursday.
Jordan, 67, experienced sudden heart failure due to arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the Los Angeles County medical examiner said.

The medical examiner's report stated that beloved “Call Me Kat” star veered his car into another vehicle and then collided into a building.
The report noted that the presence of more than 70% occlusion of any coronary artery greatly increases the risk of a sudden cardiac event.
