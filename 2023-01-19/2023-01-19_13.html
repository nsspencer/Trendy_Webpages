     Summary: U.S. hits its debt limit and now risks defaulting on its billsEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in a letter to Congress on Thursday, said the U.S. has reached its debt limit, and has begun resorting to "extraordinary measures" so the government can continue paying its bills.
Yellen had already previously warned the U.S. would reach its debt limit on Thursday but had said the Treasury Department was preparing a contingency plan to avoid a default on the country's debt.
Raising the debt limit used to be a routine exercise for Congress but it has become increasingly fraught.
A potentially huge political fight looms this year as some House Republicans have vowed to block any increase in the debt limit in order to extract spending cuts.
"The period of time that extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty," Yellen wrote.

     Summary: For Democrats, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, the episode demonstrated why they should never negotiate with hostage-takers.
Why it matters: Every debt-ceiling standoff begins with both sides digging in their heels — and ends with one of them blinking.
The venerable political analyst Charlie Cook agrees, writing that the certainty of avoiding calamity through compromise is "lower than we have ever seen before."
What's happening: The Trump era's political incentives — including online fundraising that relies on hyperbole and bluster — have encouraged House Republicans to adopt a politics of grievance and intransigence.

     Summary: The nation reached its debt limit Thursday, beginning the uncertain process known as extraordinary measures, in which the U.S. Treasury Department uses accounting maneuvers to avoid defaulting on the debt.
If disagreements about how to address the debt limit last too long, the Treasury Department will exhaust extraordinary measures and the nation would default on the debt for the first time.
“We’re not getting rid of anything, and you can’t scare the bejesus out of people saying we’re going to get rid of Social Security, we’re going to privatize.
She wrote to lawmakers again Thursday, telling them the country had in fact reached its debt limit and she had begun using some of the extraordinary measures to keep paying all of the country’s bills in full and on time.
Such programs include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

     Summary: After raising the debt limit for decades, Republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default.
But the White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and President Biden has pledged to oppose any attempt to cut entitlements.
The White House has few options to act unilaterally to avoid a debt ceiling crisis.
The White House briefly considered that idea during the 2021 debt ceiling crunch but ultimately decided against it.

     Biden and Republicans seem set for debt ceiling fight, reviving fraught political battles of years past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mint Images/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Another spending fight looms between the White House and Congress, reviving similar stalemates in 2011 and 2013 under President Barack Obama.
Then, as now, Congress was divided — a Republican House and a Democratic Senate — and the White House had a Democratic president.
“This has become a political football because it’s so easy to pass back and forth and get points for hitting the other side,” said one House Democratic aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly.
Two years later, Obama was again celebrating a breakthrough with Congress over the government’s spending and debt limit.
Since then, the debt limit has either been paused or increased eight times, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, with Congress largely choosing to simply extend the debt limit rather than hold a vote on raising it.

     Stop the Charade: The Federal Budget Is Its Own ‘Debt-Ceiling’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Be that as it may, the important point right now is that both (a) the 1974 budget regime trumps the 1917 budget regime, and (b) the current budget trumps any putative ‘debt ceiling’ imposed after that budget became law.
But it also carries over straightforwardly to the debt ceiling non-issue, in a manner that complements the later-in-time rule.
We must, then, instead view the most recent budget as having implicitly repealed any prior ‘debt ceiling’ legislation that would render compliance with the budget impossible.
The so-called ‘debt ceiling,’ by contrast, says nothing directly about any of these thousands of budget line-items.
The last-enacted budget – which, again, is the law – must accordingly be viewed as implicitly repealing any ‘ceiling’ legislation interpreted as conflicting with it.

     EXPLAINER: What Is the Debt Ceiling and Why Does It Matter?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Is the Debt Ceiling Anyway?
Political Posturing Dominates the Debate NowRepublicans have linked any increase or extension in the debt ceiling to cuts in federal spending.
With only days to spare, Republicans agreed to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for a package of future spending cuts.
“The August 2011 debt ceiling showdown was perhaps the closest brush the United States has had with the X-date,” Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese says.
The issue raised its head two years later and the resulting standoff between the parties led to a government shutdown in late 2013, followed by an agreement to suspend the debt ceiling and then further deals over the next two years were negotiated to both fund the government and get around the debt ceiling.
