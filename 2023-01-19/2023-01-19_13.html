     Why Isn't Danny Masterson In 'That '90s Show?'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you have been itching to head back to Wisconsin in the late 90s to hang out (down the street) in the Forman’s basement, then you are in luck!
Netflix’s That ’70s Show spinoff, That ’90s Show, dropped this week on the streamer, featuring both new and returning members of the Foreman clan.
But one key player from the original series won’t appear, and that’s Hyde, the edgy stoner portrayed by Danny Masterson.
Throughout Masterson’s accusations and ties to Scientology, he has not been cast in any projects, including That ’90s Show.
The series does not even attempt to address where Hyde’s character would have ended up after the series ended, and we likely will never know.

     Why Hyde Isn’t in ‘That ’90s Show’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spoiler alert: The following article contains spoilers for “That ’90s Show” Season 1.
While all major players from “That ’70s Show” reunite in some form or another on Netflix’s spinoff series, “That ’90s Show,” there is one notable omission — that of Danny Masterson’s Hyde (first name Steven), the original Fox sitcom’s resident troublemaker and burnout.
“That ’90s Show,” for clear reasons, has opted not to deal with the question of Hyde’s absence.
While there are several, ongoing references to the original series and its characters’ teenage shenanigans, there is no mention of the character by anyone.
Original series creators Bonnie and Terry Turner developed the series alongside their daughter Lindsey Turner and showrunner-executive producer Gregg Mettler.

     Is Danny Masterson In 'That '90s Show'? Why Hyde Doesn't Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once Wilmer Valderrama later reprises his role as Fez, there is only one noticeably absent original star: Danny Masterson, who played Steven Hyde for the sitcom’s entire eight-season run.
Though the That ‘70s Show spinoff doesn’t directly address why Hyde doesn’t return to Point Place, there’s an obvious reason Masterson did not participate in the series.
When Netflix announced the cast of That ‘90s Show in February 2022, the actor was awaiting trial on three rape charges.
Two of the women testified that they reported the allegations to church officials but were dissuaded from reporting the assaults to police.
“We are pleased that Danny Masterson will not be permitted to simply escape criminal accountability,” they said.
