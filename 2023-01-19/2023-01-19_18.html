     Rat poison found in man’s Taco Bell meal, authorities say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CENTENNIAL, Colo. (KCNC) - Authorities in Colorado say a man was hospitalized after he ate rat poison in his to-go order from Taco Bell.
“That hospital said they had a patient who had possibly consumed rat poison in his food from the same restaurant.
Right now, what we’re looking at is if the rat poison was actually put into his food at the restaurant,” Bartmann said.
She says they don’t store rat poison at the location.
Sheriff’s investigators say the amount of rat poison in the man’s to-go order was significant, but they’re not ruling out any possibility of how it ended up there.

     A Taco Bell customer in Colorado who became ill after eating claims he ate a taco laced with rat poison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Taco Bell customer fell "violently ill" and claimed he ate a taco laced with rat poison.
A day after the incident, deputies closed the Taco Bell location down and ordered the restaurant to discard its entire food inventory, Bartmann said.
While investigators saw a "green-ish, grey-ish" substance in the taco the customer ate, they have not confirmed what it was, he said.
Investigators obtained surveillance video footage from the Taco Bell where the customer bought his food, and are currently reviewing it.
A spokesperson from Taco Bell told Insider that "the safety of customers and team members is a priority."
