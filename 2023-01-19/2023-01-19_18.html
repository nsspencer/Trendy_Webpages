     COLUMN: It‚Äôs time for the Chicago Bulls to ‚Äòblow up‚Äô their roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers‚Äô Joel Embiid looks to shoot as Chicago Bulls‚Äô Nikola Vucevic (9) and Zach LaVine defend during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 6, 2021, in Chicago.
Before the All-Star break last season, the Chicago Bulls remained at the top of the Eastern Conference but fell apart after the All-Star break due to covid protocols and Lonzo Ball‚Äôs injury.
This season the Bulls have played below average, and Lonzo Ball hasn‚Äôt returned from his injury.
As of right now, the Bulls have a record of 20-24 which is very concerning because they have a roster with three all-stars.
The front office should make trades at the deadline to correct what this roster lacks or blow it up and wait until the offseason.

     Summary: Before the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 126-108 on Thursday in Paris and before the team‚Äôs charter even left Chicago, center Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá began imagining the possibilities.
26 years apart üá´üá∑ pic.twitter.com/BouctHjpyp ‚Äî Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) January 19, 2023With all the might of the NBA behind them, the Bulls and Pistons put on quite a show for the people in France.
‚ÄúThe trip was great for us going forward, obviously going into the second half of the season,‚Äù Bulls guard Zach LaVine told reporters after the game.
With only nine games remaining on the Bulls‚Äô schedule before the Feb. 9 trade deadline, the team has reached a critical stage.
The Bulls (21-24) will return from France only three games under .500., a record they haven‚Äôt held since Nov. 7.

     Recapping the Chicago Bulls: Zach LaVine leads a dominant performance in Paris, fueling a 126-108 rout of the Detroit Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Halfway around the world, the Chicago Bulls finally delivered a win with a quality that had been missing all season ‚Äî domination.
This Bulls season has been filled with up-and-down insanity ‚Äî squandered leads, intense comebacks, razor-thin margins that force buzzer-beaters.
That was not the case on the international stage against the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in the NBA Paris Game.
Coach Billy Donovan often holds the former Pistons star out of games against opponents that place Drummond at a stark speed disadvantage.
Former NBA star Tony Parker spoke before the game, and former Bulls star Joakim Noah was recognized.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls will have an interesting decision to make about what they're going to do with Nikola Vucevic's contract.
He could possibly be cheaper than what he's making right now because he hasn't necessarily been the same type of player since he came over from Orlando.
Vucevic said he isn't too worried about his contract right now.
"I think right now with Vuƒçeviƒá, those talks on an extension have not really gained any traction," Wojnarowski said.
During the final season of his contract (this season), the 32-year-old is making $22 million.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: title thus far, but since the calendar has flipped to 2023, a new name has surfaced as being the focal point for Chicago.
As a surprise to most, Nikola Vucevic has been the most outstanding and essential player on the Bulls this year.
While that performance put the nation on notice, Bulls fans know he‚Äôs been playing his best basketball for over a month now.
His fourth-quarter shooting is another priceless improvement for Chicago; his clutch shooting is now among the best on the team.
If he continues this pace of play, does he deserve an extension this offseason, or should Chicago let him walk?
