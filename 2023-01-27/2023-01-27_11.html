     Summary: Legendary college basketball announcer Billy Packer died Thursday at the age of 82 after calling 34 Final Fours during his career.
BILLY PACKER, VOICE OF THE FINAL FOUR AND LEGENDARY COLLEGE BASKETBALL BROADCASTER, DEAD AT 82"I think Billy will go down in history as one of the greatest analysts in the history of sports television.
I think that when you start looking at the pantheon of great analysts, you’ve got John Madden and you’ve got Billy Packer.
He’s going to be very much missed, but he loved college basketball, and he looked after it as a guardian of this sport.
And then college basketball just sort of took off with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, and that became, I think, the catalyst for college basketball fans to just go crazy with March Madness."

For what it’s now worth — almost nothing — Oklahoma State defeated Saint Joe’s by two in their regional final.

ASSOCIATED PRESSWell, you’d have thought Packer had accused Saint Joe’s of sedition, treason, tyranny and conspiracy to poison cheesesteaks.
Born Anthony William Paczkowski and the son of Lehigh’s basketball coach, Packer called 34 NCAA Tournament finals.

     Remembering Billy Packer: Jim Nantz and more on working with the longtime voice of the Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I faithfully watched Jim Thacker and Billy Packer call the ACC Game of the Week.
You can’t help but become a college basketball fan — and Packer is lights-out with informing the audience on why things are happening.
“I only apologized to those people who have those sensibilities,” Packer told the Washington Post at the time.
But how college basketball got here, and how that sport grew, owes a lot to Billy Packer.
I get five more minutes with Billy.’ I would give anything for five more.”(Photo of Billy Packer and Jim Nantz, in 1999: Bob Stowell / Getty Images)
