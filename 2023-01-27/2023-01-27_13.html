     Joe Cornish Talks Netflix Ghost Hunter Series ‘Lockwood &amp; Co’ &amp; Updates On ‘Attack The Block 2’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Cornish’s teen ghosthunter drama Lockwood and Co. launches on Netflix globally today.
The original Attack the Block, now over a decade old, followed Boyega and a gang of inner city kids battling against extra-terrestrial aliens in a London tower block.
“The first Attack the Block was made in complete secrecy so we had time to make it as good as it needed to be.
They followed that with whimsical and popular radio shows on the BBC and XFM, before Cornish broke through globally after directing Attack the Block in 2011.
However, most attention is currently on Lockwood and Co. and Attack the Block 2, news of which Deadline broke back in 2021.
