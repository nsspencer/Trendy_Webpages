     Trump Responds to Paul Pelosi Attack Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President Donald Trump shared his first reaction on Saturday to newly released police footage that showed the attack on Paul Pelosi last fall.
Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked in the couple's San Francisco home in late October by suspect David DePape.
DePape's comments indicated at the time that he had been targeting Nancy Pelosi, who was in Washington, D.C., at the time.
As the situation unfolds, DePape begins to swing the hammer at Pelosi, knocking him to the ground as police rush in.
"With Paul Pelosi, that's a terrible thing, with all of them it's a terrible thing," Trump said.

     Court Releases Body Cam Video, 911 Call of Brutal Attack on Paul Pelosi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A court on Friday released graphic video and audio recordings from the night Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer in the family's San Francisco home last year.
DePape reportedly told Paul Pelosi he would wait for her.
The recording of Pelosi's call to 911, made just after 2:20 a.m., lasts less than three minutes.
"There's a gentleman here waiting for my wife to come back, Nancy Pelosi," he calmly tells the dispatcher.
Within minutes, at least two San Francisco police officers knocked on Pelosi's door, which, in the video, either Pelosi or DePape slowly opens.

     A San Francisco judge released footage of the attack on Paul Pelosi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SCOTT SIMON, HOST:A California court yesterday released video of a man last October attacking Paul Pelosi, spouse of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The video shows Paul Pelosi and David DePape holding a hammer, then DePape yanking it away and hitting Pelosi on the head.
PAUL PELOSI: Hey.
Speaking at the U.S. Capitol Friday, Nancy Pelosi said her husband is making progress recovering from his fractured skull.
And he drew a parallel between the attack on Paul Pelosi, the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol and other right-wing violence, like the racist, deadly shooting at a Buffalo, N.Y., grocery store last year.

     Newly released video of the attack on Paul Pelosi shows a struggle for a hammer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The body-camera footage shows suspect David DePape wrest the tool from 82-year-old Paul Pelosi and lunge toward him with the hammer over his head.
The San Francisco District Attorney's Office had refused to make the exhibits available to journalists.
The San Francisco public defender's office, which is representing DePape, 43, said they planned to issue a statement later Friday.
Paul Pelosi was asleep at the couple's home when DePape allegedly broke in.
When the door opens, Paul Pelosi says, "Hi, guys, how are you?"

     Paul Pelosi attacker trafficks in conspiracy theories in call to TV station after video release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “When Trump came into office, what they did went so far beyond spying on a rival campaign.
It is just crazy,” DePape said in an audio recording of his interview with a San Francisco police officer in October.
Without evidence, DePape claimed that Democrats were on an “endless f**king crime spree” when it came to Trump.
“Not only were they spying on a rival campaign, they were submitting fake evidence to spy on a rival campaign, covering it up, persecuting the rival campaign,” DePape said of what he believed Democrats were doing to Trump.
The video and audio were released by a court Friday, over the objections of DePape’s attorneys who argued it would “irreparably damage” his right to a fair trial.
