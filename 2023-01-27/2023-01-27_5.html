     Bengals vs. Chiefs: predict the outcome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals will soon be at Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs for the fourth time in two seasons.
This will be the exact same situation for Cincinnati as last year: a Super Bowl on the line in front of a hostile Kansas City crowd.
But the QB widely regarded to be the best in the league (maybe ever) is hobbled.
Meanwhile, the Chiefs are more than a little upset with the Bengals, who came into their home and erased a 21-3 lead last January.

     Bengals vs. Chiefs: Behind enemy lines Q&amp;A before AFC title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals again find themselves staring down a matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs for a chance to advance to the Super Bowl.
Sunday’s AFC title game is a repeat of last year’s affair at the same Arrowhead Stadium featuring the same key players.
This time, though, the Bengals don’t enter as longshot underdogs — they’re riding a 10-game winning streak, among other notables.
And things are a little more complex than expected from the Kansas City side with quarterback Patrick Mahomes nursing an ankle injury and tight end Travis Kelce a surprise late addition to the injury report.
With so much intrigue, we sought out Chiefs expert Charles Goldman of Chiefs Wire for a Q&amp;A session on some of the game’s most notable talking points.

     Summary: The Chiefs will try to counter that with a secondary that often employs three rookie cornerbacks and a rookie safety.
“Hopefully we’ve grown enough that we can match what they put out there,” Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said.
Bengals 24, Chiefs 23Four downsTight spot: The Bengals will be tasked with trying to at least slow down Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who had a career-high 110 receptions and 12 TDs this season.
In the past four postseasons, Kelce has played in 10 games and has 77 receptions for 964 yards and 12 TDs.
Conversely, Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones, who often looks unblockable and had 15 .5 sacks in the regular season, is still searching for his first career postseason sack.

     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsIt’s been a wild couple of days for bettors tracking the Cincinnati Bengals versus Kansas City Chiefs odds.
Bengals vs Chiefs First TD Scorer Pick and PredictionRemember, betting on first TD scorer is different than anytime TD scorer in the person you bet on needs to score the first touchdown of the game, not the first touchdown for their team and not a TD at any point in the game.
He had four rushing TDs this year and has recorded at least one rushing TD in playoffs every years he’s played.
Because Mahomes is dealing with an ankle injury, I anticipate the Chiefs to play out of the shotgun more often.
If that’s the case, he should be on the field when the Chiefs get close to the end zone early in the game.
