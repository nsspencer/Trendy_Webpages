     Tua Tagovailoa still in protocol, to miss Pro Bowl Games, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI -- Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa remains in the concussion protocol and will not participate in next week's Pro Bowl Games, a source told ESPN on Friday.
According to the source, Tagovailoa's time in the protocol has been deliberate as he meets with multiple doctors and specialists.
The third-year quarterback set career highs in passing yards and touchdowns this season while leading the NFL in passer rating.
Tagovailoa missed the better part of six games after suffering concussions in Week 4 and Week 16.
The NFL altered its concussion protocol as a result of that joint review.

     Jalen Hurts, Tua Tagovailoa &amp; Mac Jones: Was this the best QB room in college football's history?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite that, Alabama wasn't known for having many quarterbacks enter the league and shine, but perhaps to see the evolution of their 2018 QB room might chance that idea.
Was Alabama's 2018 quarterback room the best ever?
In 2018, the Alabama Crimson Tide's quarterback room had Jalen Hurts, Tua Tagovailoa and Mac Jones in their depth chart, the three would eventually lead the team offensively, get nominated to the Heisman Trophy and would end up being NFL starters, even Hurts on the brink of reaching a Super Bowl this season.
The three would also end up winning at least one National Championship with Alabama.
This Miami Hurricanes QB room could compete to be the bestThe Miami Hurricanes QB room in 1982 was full of great players as well, with Jim Kelly, Vinny Testaverde and Bernie Kosar.

MORE: Revisiting Tagovailoa Week 3 controversy vs. Bills, later head injuriesThe repeated concussions, plus a back injury that many observers believed was a concussion, have raised questions about whether Tagovailoa would return in 2023.
Dolphins general manager Chris Grier told reporters after the season ended that the team was moving forward with the expectation Tagovailoa would return.
You know, as parents, we don’t ever want to see our children hurt," Tagaovailoa's mother, Diane Tagovailoa, told KHON.

     Summary: The people closest to Tua Tagovailoa might say they support him publicly, but there has to be some part of them that wants to scream, “Intervention!
Here look at this: Tagovailoa needs to take a step away from the game, at least this offseason, and really weigh his options going forward.
AdvertisementThe Dolphins haven’t had a franchise QB since Dan Marino, and all of South Florida wants this just as much as Tua, maybe more.
We know how close the bond is in locker rooms, and no doubt those guys want him back.
My guess is Tagovailoa also would like to return and likely feels like he has an obligation to do so.

     Summary: Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells wrote the Miami Dolphins are at risk relying on him.
It’s only the second week of the Dolphins offseason and if it seems conversation already is funneling to one player that’s because it is.
So, in writing for The33rdTeam.com, Parcells said of the Dolphins: “They had a good year.
Tua Tagovailoa looks good from time to time, but he was hurt in college and he’s been hurt a couple of times in the pros.
But he’s Tua 1.0.
