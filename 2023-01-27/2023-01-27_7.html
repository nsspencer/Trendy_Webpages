     Bengals vs. Chiefs: Behind enemy lines Q&amp;A before AFC title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals again find themselves staring down a matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs for a chance to advance to the Super Bowl.
Sunday’s AFC title game is a repeat of last year’s affair at the same Arrowhead Stadium featuring the same key players.
This time, though, the Bengals don’t enter as longshot underdogs — they’re riding a 10-game winning streak, among other notables.
And things are a little more complex than expected from the Kansas City side with quarterback Patrick Mahomes nursing an ankle injury and tight end Travis Kelce a surprise late addition to the injury report.
With so much intrigue, we sought out Chiefs expert Charles Goldman of Chiefs Wire for a Q&amp;A session on some of the game’s most notable talking points.

     Summary: Despite the Bengals’ success and Patrick Mahomes’ injury, sportsbooks still have the Chiefs as slight 1.5-point favorites.
With such a narrow spread, it’s hard to write a game script for either team’s success.
This year, Kansas City been much more methodical and we saw it happily utilize Kelce in a death-by-a-thousand paper-cut strategy.
Kansas City will look to make life easier for its quarterback by leaning on the running game.
If Kansas City inches its way down the field via Kelce and Pacheco, it will also be burning clock.

     'Burrowhead' explained: How Mike Hilton’s bold Joe Burrow quote became bulletin board material for Bengals vs. Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/9P8fTJkgcg — TopFanTV (@TopFanTV) January 24, 2023The trash talk from Hilton marked one of the latest additions to a growing NFL rivalry between Joe Burrow's Bengals and Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs.
What is Joe Burrow's record at Arrowhead Stadium?
Part of what makes "Burrowhead" a bold proclamation is that Burrow has played in Arrowhead Stadium just once.
And when defensive tackle Chris Jones finished his press conference Friday, he told the media in attendance he would "see you all at Burrowhead Stadium."
However Sunday's contest plays out, there will certainly be a lot said afterward about "Burrowhead Stadium."
