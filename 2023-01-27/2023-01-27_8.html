     NBC Universal Reportedly Cancels Jay Leno's Garage Television Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NBC Universal has canceled Jay Leno's reality television series after seven seasons, The Hollywood Reporter reports.
The Hollywood Reporter doesn't mention whether the cancellation of Leno's television show will affect the identically named YouTube channel, which follows a simpler format that usually includes one car that Jay showcases.
The television show was a bit more complex than Leno's YouTube series.
In addition to showcasing the comedian's massive collection of cars, the show hosted famous guests like president Joe Biden and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
The news of the show's cancelation comes just one week after Leno, 72, suffered multiple broken bones due to a motorcycle crash.

     Jay Leno breaks bones in motorcycle wreck months after fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — Two months after undergoing surgery for serious burns, Jay Leno is now contending with a number of broken bones after being knocked off a motorcycle.
The comedian and former "Tonight Show" host told a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist Thursday that he broke his collarbone and two ribs and cracked his kneecaps on Jan. 17.
The November garage fire and January wreck both stemmed from his passion for working on vintage vehicles.
He told the Review-Journal's John Katsilometes he was testing a 1940 motorcycle when he noticed the scent of leaking gas.
Leno took over NBC’s “Tonight” when longtime host Johnny Carson retired in 1992.
