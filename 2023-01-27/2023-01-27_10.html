Wing: Jrue Holiday, Grayson Allen, Pat Connaughton, Jordan NworaHoliday often takes the task of defending the opposing team’s best player, regardless of position.
The three will spend some time on the opposing team’s best wing when Holiday isn’t on him.
Big: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis, Serge Ibaka, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Thanasis AntetokounmpoThe Bucks love to keep Antetokounmpo on their opponent’s weakest big.
They’ll do the same with Lopez when possible, and the two seven-footers make it very difficult for opposing teams around the rim.

     Milwaukee vs. Indiana: Bucks — Blistering, Bumpy — Beat Pacers
    </h2>

     Summary: The Indiana Pacers aren’t as dangerous without potential All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton, but they made the Bucks work for all 48 minutes to secure Milwaukee’s 141-131 victory.
From the jump, Giannis Antetokounmpo had the appearance of a guy who Indiana would struggle to slow down, much less stop.
Antetokounmpo would finish with 41 points (16-29 from the floor), 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.
Eventually, the lead got down to a mere 7 points as Indy instituted Hack-A-Giannis for a solid two minutes.
With Milwaukee in a scoring rut and the Pacers threatening to go off, Holiday was tasked with keeping Buddy Hield grounded no matter the cost.

Myles Turner led the Pacers with 24 points and Buddy Hield added 22 as Indiana lost for the ninth time in 10 games.

     ‘Atrocious’ and ‘embarrassed’: Pacers give up 85 in first half, fall to Giannis and Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pacers kept up with the Bucks' torrid pace for the game's first nine minutes, matching Milwaukee almost bucket-for-bucket and trailed just 30-27.
The Pacers slowed down at that point, though, and the Bucks didn't until after halftime.
And on the flip side, the Pacers didn't establish nearly enough presence to make the Bucks' lives difficult.
The Pacers didn't quitIf there's one thing the Pacers can say for themselves about what they've done well in Tyrese Haliburton's absence, it's that they haven't laid down when they've been down big.
The Pacers didn't take the foot off the pedal in the fourth quarter and remarkably came within seven points.
