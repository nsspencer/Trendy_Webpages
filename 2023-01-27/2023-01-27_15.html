     Paul George Reveals What 'Saved' the Clippers During Rough Stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers won their fourth-straight game on Thursday night, defeating the San Antonio Spurs by a final score of 138-100.
With injuries and poor play being the story for much of this Clippers season, there has been very little championship buzz like there was all summer.
This was confirmed by Paul George after Thursday’s win when he was asked how the team has turned things around over the last week.
That saved us.”According to Paul George, the Clippers never once chirped at each other during that rough stretch, which really helped pull them out of it.

     Summary: Like Tuesday’s game against the Lakers, they started the game shooting over 64% from the floor.
This six-game road trip will provide quite a few opportunities.
In fact, Morris—along with Preston and Wall—is traveling on the road trip.
The only other roster consideration for the road trip is Moses Brown, who is nearing his 50-game cap.
If he comes on the road trip, his time on the main roster will be over very soon.

     Summary: For our young Spurs, Thursday night against the Clippers was not one of those nights.
At their best, this team is overmatched nightly from a talent perspective — and the boys were decidedly not at their best.
It’s a tough stretch for these young Spurs, but they’re going to shake it off.
The best thing they can show us right now is how strong they really are.

     Surging Clippers' 6-game road trip includes some stiff tests
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet, the players will say the mood in the locker room never faltered.
They remained upbeat through a six-game losing streak, driven by the knowledge that the season wasn’t going to be perfect.
In his past three games, the guard has scored 21 points, 27 points and 35 points on Thursday night in a 138-100 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.
The Clippers’ current four-game winning streak and the upbeat chatter and laughter in the locker room can be linked directly to the return of their two stars.
George said the trip certainly will challenge the Clippers, who will face Milwaukee and Giannis Antetokounmpo for the first time this season next Thursday.

     ‘Things do feel different.’ Paul George powers revived Clippers to another win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guard Norman Powell, wing Paul George and forward Marcus Morris Sr. were the most vocal, said people familiar with the locker-room discussions.
Despite a litany of defensive mistakes, the Clippers held off San Antonio last Friday.
On Thursday the Clippers closed the week that has, for now, revived their season by beating San Antonio again, 138-100 to improve to 27-24.
Clippers guard Terance Mann, right, defends against San Antonio Spurs guard Tre Jones (33) during the first half Thursday.
By that point the Clippers had scored 100 points, and the win improved them to 18-2 when crossing the triple-digit barrier first.
