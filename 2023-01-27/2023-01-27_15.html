Not much is known about the victims, but the Los Angeles Times reported that all three who were killed were women in their mid-20s to early 30s.
This is at least the sixth mass shooting in California this month.
This shooting in Beverly Crest comes exactly a week after 11 people were killed during a mass shooting at a dance studio in Monterey Park.

     Summary: Police say at least 3 people are dead, 4 hurt in the latest California mass shootingEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Vogel/AP Richard Vogel/APLOS ANGELES — Three people were killed and four others wounded in a shooting at a multimillion dollar short-term rental home in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood early Saturday, police said.
This is at least the sixth mass shooting in California this month.
Frank Preciado of the Los Angeles Police Department said earlier Saturday that the three people killed were inside a vehicle.
Last Saturday, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran gunned down patrons at a ballroom dance hall in predominantly Asian Monterey Park, where tens of thousands attended Lunar New Year festivities earlier that evening.
He drove to another dance hall but was thwarted by an employee.
