     Lil Yachty Shares The Bizarre 'Say Something' Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lil Yachty‘s new album, Let’s Start Here is already proving to be a buzzy project.
On the heels of Let’s Start Here, which was released yesterday (January 27), Lil Yachty has shared the trippy new visual for “Say Something.”On the song, Yachty croons, reeling over an unrequited love.
It’s hard to explain exactly what’s going on in the “Say Something” video.
In the clip, Yachty is seen sitting in a diner with a woman played by model Anok Yai.
Warning: Lil Yachty’s video for “Say Something” contains depictions of suicidal ideation which some may find triggering.

     Lil Yachty Releases Wild New Psychedelic Rock Album 'Let's Start Here.': Stream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So now Yachty has naturally followed that song with a full-on bugged-out psychedelic rock album.
Yachty spent months recording his new LP Let’s Start Here.
Lil Yachty co-produced every track on Let’s Start Here., and I’m guessing he created the album cover with the AI model DALL-E mini.
Let’s Start Here.
There have been rumblings that Yachty was working on a rock album, but the end product is a whole lot more fully realized than I’d imagined.

     Lil Yachty Says ‘I Love You’ Too Fast and Ruins the Vibe in ‘Say Something’ Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hopeless romantics always run the risk of tarnishing their favorite things with the memories of relationships that didn’t exactly work out for them.
In the video for his latest Let’s Start Here single “Say Something,” Lil Yachty learns this the hard way after he jumps the gun on a date and says “I love you” to a girl he’s known for two weeks.
“Mm, mm, don’t ever in your life say that to me again,” she responds.
This is my favorite dinner, my favorite fries.” Rejecting the reminder that it’s only been 14 days since they started hanging out, Yachty adds: “But this is different.
Leaving the dinner, where his favorite booth is now forever tarnished, Yachty drags his giant heart across the parking lot before slowly spiraling towards insanity.
