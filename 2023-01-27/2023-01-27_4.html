     PHOTO: Sunderland striker Ross Stewart on crutches after FA Cup injury blow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ross Stewart was pictured using crutches and a protective boot as Sunderland headed back north after the FA Cup draw at Fulham.
The striker was stretchered off in the first half after suffering a major Achilles injury at Craven Cottage.
“It looks like an Achilles injury for Ross,” Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray said after the game.
“Ross has got a big, protective boot on – it’s an Achilles injury.
I’ve just speaking to the doctors there and because he’s not hopping about and screaming in pain, it could potentially be a complete tear which would be a long, long time.

     Summary: [1/3] Soccer Football - FA Cup - Fourth Round - Manchester United v Reading - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - January 28, 2023 Manchester United's Casemiro celebrates with Bruno Fernandes and Antony after the match REUTERS/Phil NobleMANCHESTER, England, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Manchester United's Brazil midfielder Casemiro scored twice as they beat second-tier Reading 3-1 to reach the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday but Marcus Rashford was denied a record.
The former Real Madrid player extended United's lead four minutes later with a fizzing shot from 25 metres.
Reading, managed by former title-winning United midfielder Paul Ince, scored a consolation through Amadou Salif Mbengue.
There was some criticism when five-times Champions League winner Casemiro joined United in August with several pundits describing the move as a panic buy.
You don't win what he's won without being a top player," United skipper Harry Maguire said.

     Summary: Marco Silva has suggested that any of his players who do not take their FA Cup fourth round tie seriously against Sunderland on Saturday would be dropped for Fulham’s trip to Chelsea next week.
Fulham have only reached the fifth round of the FA Cup once in the past decade, and they last reached the quarter-finals in 2010.

“We don’t have one reason not to be serious tomorrow,” he said.

     Summary: This richly entertaining game was all the better for both teams taking the FA Cup seriously.
Nobody needs to tell Fulham that Sunderland, who lie a point off a playoff spot in the Championship, are moving in the right direction.
Fulham finished with 22 shots on goal and, as Silva argued, more ruthlessness would have carried them into the fifth round.
