    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2-seeded 49ers on Sunday afternoon in the NFC Championship Game.
Eagles 23, 49ers 20Dave Zangaro (14-4)For a couple months, it felt like the Eagles and 49ers were on a collision course.
This could be the most violent game of the 2022 season and having that game at the Linc in the NFC Championship Game is extremely exciting.
I was in the building for that NFC Championship Game against the Vikings and it mattered.
Eagles 27, 49ers 17Adam Herman (16-2)I'd be lying if I said I wasn't anxious about picking the Eagles to beat the 49ers Sunday afternoon in the NFC Championship Game.

     Summary: Neither team has faced an offense like their opponentsEagles offense vs 49ers defenseOn the Eagles first possession, FOX will show a graphic that the 49ers run defense was 2nd in the league in the regular season.
No one really faces an offense like the Eagles this year until they actually face the Eagles.
49ers offense vs Eagles defenseBut just as the 49ers haven’t faced an offense like the Eagles, neither have the Eagles faced an offense like the 49ers, because there isn’t one.
The league continues to slowly shift towards “positionless” skill players on offense, and the 49ers run the most notable one.
Recent winner Justin Herbert had a late season game with a 43.7 passer rating throwing 2 INTs and 0 TDs.
