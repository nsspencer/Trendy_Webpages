     Summary: Manchester City got the better of Premier League title rivals Arsenal, thanks to Nathan Ake's second-half goal that secured a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Friday's heavyweight FA Cup fourth round tie.
Mikel Arteta's side have a five point lead over City and a game in hand, with the two teams to meet again in the league on Feb. 15.
City will go into that game having beaten Arsenal in their last six meetings in all competitions.
Despite changing more than half their team, it was Arsenal that had the better of the opening 45 minutes.
As the second half got going, though, City began to crank up the pressure.

     Summary: Full-time: Manchester City 1-0 ArsenalIt has indeed petered out for Arsenal and it's Manchester City who are through to the FA Cup fifth round thanks to Nathan Aké's goal!
Will Arsenal be disappointed to be out of the FA Cup?
City controlled possession and never really looked in danger of surrendering their advantage, apart from a five-minute flurry from the Gunners as full-time approached.
Gabriel Martinelli was in the thick of the action in that spell but Arsenal failed to create any opportunities to level.
The ‘master’ defeats the ‘pupil’ but will that still be the case come the end of the season?
