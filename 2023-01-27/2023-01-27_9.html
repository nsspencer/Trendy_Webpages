     Barcelona winger Demb√©l√© out after left thigh injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareBARCELONA, Spain ‚Äî Barcelona winger Ousmane Demb√©l√© will be sidelined for an undetermined time after he injured a muscle in his left leg on Saturday in the 1-0 win at Girona in the Spanish league.
Demb√©l√© has been enjoying his best season at Barcelona.
Demb√©l√© walked off the field in the 25th minute and watched the rest of the match, which included his replacement Pedri scoring the winner.
The 25-year-old Demb√©l√© joined Barcelona in 2017 when the club broke its own club record for transfers to acquire him from Borussia Dortmund in a deal, including add-ons, worth 147 million euros (then $175 million).
Barcelona leads the Spanish league.

     Barcelona could be without injured Ousmane Dembele for Europa League clash with Manchester United
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ousmane Dembele is a major doubt for the first leg of Barcelona‚Äôs Europa League clash with Manchester United after he sustained a thigh injury against Girona on Saturday.
Dembele, 25, pulled up midway through the opening half of Barcelona‚Äôs 1-0 La Liga victory holding his left leg.
But sources close to the club were more cautious, with Barcelona later indicating the forward could miss between 20 days and one month.
Dembele has been in fine form for Barcelona in recent weeks and his absence will come as a considerable blow to head coach Xavi.

     Substitute Pedri earns Barcelona 1-0 win at Girona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GIRONA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pedri celebrated his 100th match for Barcelona as he came off the bench and scored from close range in the second-half to give the LaLiga leaders a hard-fought 1-0 win at Girona on Saturday.
With forwards Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres suspended and midfielder Pedri recovering from muscle discomfort, Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez opted to rotate his side on a chilly afternoon at Montilivi.
Despite having almost 70% of possession in the first half, Barcelona struggled to break the deadlock against Girona‚Äôs low block.
Barcelona finished the match with only three shots on target, having made the most of their only clear opportunity.
"I believe that in these games you have to win it in any way possible," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde told DAZN.
