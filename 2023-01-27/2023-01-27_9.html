     Summary: CNN —Although we’re almost past the point of having the stench of death surround movies when they head directly to streaming, that assessment applies to “Shotgun Wedding,” which loads both barrels with Jennifer Lopez, late-replacement Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Coolidge and still fires blanks.
The movie arrives in the US via Amazon, but even that invitation is worth declining.

     How ‘Shotgun Wedding’ Made Jennifer Lopez the Perfect Dress Built for Action
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For most of Jennifer Lopez’s action rom-com, “Shotgun Wedding,” she’s wearing a wedding dress, and the challenge was finding the perfect color for her to wear in the new Amazon Prime film.
Lopez’s wedding dress needed to be a character.
For a sequence that involves riding a golf cart, Travers says the dress needed to “envelop and overwhelm her.
It’s a bit of a superhero suit that looks like a wedding dress,” Travers says of the ideal fabric used for the custom-made dress.
His challenge for her was finding the perfect dress for a character who spends a large part of the film held captive in the infinity pool.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At one point, you will consider calling off the wedding, and sometimes, you will in fact call off the wedding.
Join me as I outline and attempt to make some sense of the J.Lo wedding industrial-complex canon and, in the process, our own desperate attempts at immortality.
Yes, Charlie, who is on the beach constantly, would rather have a small wedding on the beach..Jane fuckin’ Fonda.
