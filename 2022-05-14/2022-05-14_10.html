     Selena Gomez makes 'SNL' debut with hopes to find love: 'At this point, I will take anyone'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Selena Gomez made her "Saturday Night Live" hosting debut with hopes that she doesn't go home alone.
During her monologue Saturday night, Gomez said she was excited to host the show, something she always watched with her mom.
Plus she had come a long way from starting her acting career on kids' show "Barney" to starring alongside "SNL" legends Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Hulu series "Only Murders In The Building."
But, she said she was mostly excited to host the show because she is single and looking for love.
"I love you, you love me, we're a happy family," she said before breaking into song and encouraging the crowd to join in on the famous "Barney" song.
