     PSG wear special rainbow flag numbering on shirts as Ligue 1 acknowledges International Day Against Homophobia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain lined up against Montpellier with special rainbow-coloured numbers on Saturday as the club and all of French football lent their support to the International Day Against Homophobia.
The Ligue 1 champions were given few problems in their penultimate clash of the season, securing a comfortable 4-0 victory.
Why did PSG wear the numbers?
Saturday marked the second straight year in which French clubs, including PSG, have marked the International Day Against Homophobia.
In May 2021 every side in Ligue 1 and 2 came out with rainbow numbers, part of the LFP's "Gay or straight, we all wear the same jersey” campaign.

     Pundit Explains Why Messi at PSG Should be Considered a Failure So Far
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of them is Lionel Messi, who is also receiving criticism from the French media.
The latest to go after the 34-year-old is French football pundit Mathieu Bodmer, who labeled the arrival of the Argentine a failure thus far.
But here, we are talking about Lionel Messi.
“Today, he is almost 35 years old; we will never see the same Lionel Messi again.
We know that PSG attaches great importance to marketing, and, there, his arrival is not at all a failure.

Lionel Messi dropped one of his finest performances for Paris Saint-Germain to date on Saturday night.
It’s no secret that the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner hasn’t found life to be plain-sailing at the Parc des Princes, but you wouldn’t have known that was the case based on his performance against Montpellier.
And it was the trait that Messi has been criticised for the most this season that he excelled in during the Ligue 1 clash this weekend: goalscoring.
