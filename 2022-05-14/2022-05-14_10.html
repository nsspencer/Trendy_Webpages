     PSG wear special rainbow flag numbering on shirts as Ligue 1 acknowledges International Day Against Homophobia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain lined up against Montpellier with special rainbow-coloured numbers on Saturday as the club and all of French football lent their support to the International Day Against Homophobia.
The Ligue 1 champions were given few problems in their penultimate clash of the season, securing a comfortable 4-0 victory.
Why did PSG wear the numbers?
Saturday marked the second straight year in which French clubs, including PSG, have marked the International Day Against Homophobia.
In May 2021 every side in Ligue 1 and 2 came out with rainbow numbers, part of the LFP's "Gay or straight, we all wear the same jersey” campaign.

     Herrera Details Why Messi Will Be Better Next Season for PSG
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi scored a brace against Montpellier Hérault, and the 34-year-old is attempting to finish a tough first season with Paris Saint-Germain on a high note and hope it spills over to 2022-23.
Nonetheless, PSG midfielder Ander Herrera spoke with Prime Video Sport France (via Canal Supporters), where he discussed the two-goal performance and made a prediction for next season regarding Messi.
We are very optimistic after a season of adaptation for him,” Herrera said.
“We will see the best Messi next season.
Nonetheless, many hope that a summer where he doesn’t need to uproot his entire family nor adjust to a new league will help play a role in him having a better second season.

Lionel Messi dropped one of his finest performances for Paris Saint-Germain to date on Saturday night.
It’s no secret that the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner hasn’t found life to be plain-sailing at the Parc des Princes, but you wouldn’t have known that was the case based on his performance against Montpellier.
And it was the trait that Messi has been criticised for the most this season that he excelled in during the Ligue 1 clash this weekend: goalscoring.
