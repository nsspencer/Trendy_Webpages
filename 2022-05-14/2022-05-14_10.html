     ‘SNL’ Video: Steve Martin Joins Selena Gomez for Bio of Prank Inventor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A pair of Only Murders stars were in the building — Rockefeller Center’s Studio 8H, that is — when Steve Martin joined Saturday Night Live host Selena Gomez for a pre-taped bit.
In an episode of a PBS-type series called American Inventors, Gomez served as host Taylor Gosh, who introduced a profile of Archie Gizmo, the inventor of the infamous Whoopie Cushion.
Cue Steve Martin’s appearance in a separately taped segment that elicited cheers from the studio audience watching.
The Whoopie Cushion, though, would not be the only gag for which Dina served as Archie’s muse.
Watch Gomez and Martin’s American Inventors segment below, then weigh in and grade this season’s penultimate episode.

     ‘SNL’: Selena Gomez Spoofs ‘Old Enough’; Sends Boyfriend Out Like Toddler On Errands
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Selena Gomez ended up with bags of onions and makeup multiple shades darker than her skin tone in a hilarious SNL sketch that spoofed Old Enough.
The original Old Enough is a 90s series that hails from Japan shot documentary-style as filmmakers follow toddlers on errands for their parents, which recently began streaming in the U.S. via Netflix.
Gomez plays Kelsey and her long-term boyfriend Matt is played by Mikey Day.
Instead of shallots, however, Matt had a bigger surprise in store for his lady love.
Kelsey dumps him after 3 years together but nobody can take away the pride he feels after taking on the big city.
