     Summary: Screenshots of the broadcast circulating online appeared to show the shooter, at one point, holding a gun and standing over a body.
Shonnell Harris, an operation manager at the Tops, told The Buffalo News that she was stocking shelves when she heard loud noises and saw people running toward the back of the store.
“He had army fatigue stuff on,” she told The Buffalo News.
Eventually, the gunman returned to the front of the store, where he was confronted by Buffalo police in the vestibule.
Then the police tackled him, witnesses told The Buffalo News.

     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."
