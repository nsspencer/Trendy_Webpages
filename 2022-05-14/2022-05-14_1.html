     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos Governor Kathy Hochul delivers remarks from Buffalo following mass shooting at supermarket.
"The social media platforms that profit from their existence need to be responsible for monitoring and having surveillance, knowing that they can be, in a sense, an accomplice to a crime like this.
They've created the platform for this hate to be spewed," said Hochul.Hochul also said there is "a feeding frenzy on social media platforms, where hate festers more hate.
These outlets must be more vigilant in monitoring social media content.

     Did Buffalo Shooter Put Names of Waukesha Parade Victims on Rifle?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A screenshot from that video showed white writing along the black barrel guard.
It appears that one line was the misspelled name of Virginia Sorenson, a member of the “Dancing Grannies” parade troupe who was killed in the city of Waukesha, Wisconsin’s annual Christmas parade.
Buffalo authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the writing on the rifle, which also included the N-word.
Sorenson, 79, was killed with five others when 39-year-old Darrell Brooks allegedly barreled through the parade in an SUV.
They used the posts to suggest the attack on mostly white parade-goers was the targeted work of a Black extremist.

     Gunman Kills 10 in Buffalo Supermarket in ‘Racially Motivated Hate Crime’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He had apparently traveled more than 200 miles to attack the supermarket, located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.
— Buffalo Police Dept (@BPDAlerts) May 14, 2022The Associated Press reports that the supermarket was located in a predominately black neighborhood outside downtown Buffalo.
Buffalo police did not confirm those reports, but said they were investigating to see if the attack was racially motivated.
The Buffalo shooting is the latest racially motivated mass killing inspired by white supremacy theories.
Among the “deplorable” set — those for whom this “great replacement theory” has true cultural currency —Saturday’s mass shooting is drawing a mix of defensiveness, denial and deflection.

     Gunman Kills 10 at Buffalo Supermarket in Racist Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Buffalo grocery store, where four employees were shot, the savagery and planning were evident: Mr. Gendron was armed with an assault weapon and wore body armor, the police said.
He wrote he had been “passively preparing” for the Buffalo attack for several years, purchasing ammunition and gear, while infrequently practicing shooting.
In an arraignment on Saturday evening, Mr. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, a charge that could lead to life imprisonment without parole.
In his manifesto, Mr. Gendron seemed enthusiastic about broadcasting his attack, saying the livestream let “all people with the internet” watch and record the violence.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
