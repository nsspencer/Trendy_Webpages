     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."

     Live Updates: Gunman Kills 10 at Buffalo Supermarket in Racist Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Buffalo grocery store, where four employees died, the savagery and planning was evident: Mr. Gendron was armed with an assault weapon and wore body armor, the police said.
He wrote he had been “passively preparing” for the Buffalo attack for several years, purchasing ammunition and gear, while infrequently practicing shooting.
In an arraignment on Saturday evening, Mr. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, a charge that could lead to life imprisonment without parole.
In his manifesto, Mr. Gendron seemed enthusiastic about broadcasting his attack, saying the livestream let “all people with the internet” watch and record the violence.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
