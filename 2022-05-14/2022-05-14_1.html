     Highlights: Liverpool Beat Chelsea In Another Wembley Shootout To Win Their Eighth FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Highlights: Liverpool Beat Chelsea In Another Wembley Shootout To Win Their Eighth FA CupLiverpool won the FA Cup for the eighth time in their history on Saturday by beating Chelsea in a tense final at Wembley Stadium.
These two teams had met 76 days earlier in the EFL Cup final, which ended goalless before going all the way to a penalty shootout.
Liverpool scored from their first four penalties, but Cesar Azpilicueta fired wide for Chelsea.
Liverpool's eighth FA Cup triumph took them joint level with Chelsea and Tottenham as the third most successful teams in the competition's 150-year history.

     Liverpool's FA Cup win completes the double, but can they shake off fatigue to win two more this season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

It is why Liverpool fans are dreaming.
Just as in the League Cup final, a scoreless 120 minutes belied the quality of the match.
Liverpool fans can celebrate a first FA Cup triumph since 2006.
Once again Chelsea, still under UK government sanctions, suffered the cruelest of defeats, becoming the first team to lose three consecutive FA Cup finals.

When asked about the win, Klopp was quick to mention Chelsea as he sympathised with Thomas Tuchel.
It was penalty shoot-out, so yeah."

It's another victory for Jurgen Klopp over Thomas Tuchel as well, after Liverpool bested Chelsea on penalties in the EFL Cup final in February.
And it's also Chelsea's third straight FA Cup final loss, a record in the 150 year history of the competition.
First he needed to distance himself from his agent on Friday after comments about transfer rumors, and then he only touched the ball 15 times in the FA Cup final on Saturday.
But, as the Champions League final is the more likely prize, rotation could be incoming as Klopp looks to protect his players.

The 22-year-old was an unlikely omission from Chelsea's teamsheet when the two sides were announced for the Wembley showdown.
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel later confirmed Havertz was missing after picking up a knock.
“He (Havertz) has hamstring problems.
There was some good news for Tuchel, however, as Mateo Kovacic shook off an ankle injury to start for Chelsea.
