    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool has officially claimed victory over Chelsea in the 2022 Emirates FA Cup final, and from a shootout nonetheless.
Similar to their League Cup final penalty shootout win over Chelsea, the Reds reigned victorious again.
Fireworks and confetti erupted inside Wembley Stadium Saturday as Liverpool soared with a 6-5 aggregate score against their counterparts Chelsea, deeming them the winner of the 2022 FA Cup.

     Player Ratings: Chelsea 0-0 (5-6 pens) Liverpool | FA Cup Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Third time was not the charm for Chelsea after slumping to defeat to Liverpool 0-0 (5-6 pens) at Wembley in the FA Cup final on Saturday afternoon.
The Blues could not banish the memories of the Carabao Cup final in February as they yet again tasted defeat from 12 yards against Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool.
But the best chances actually came via Christian Pulisic and Marcos Alonso, serving a timely reminder of the Blues' threat on the counter.
The roles were reversed after the break, with the World Champions hot off the blocks with a string of big chances, including a free kick from Alonso that hit the bar.
Here's how Absolute Chelsea rated the Blues' performance in the FA Cup Final...Edouard Mendy - 8/10Big save early doors from Luis Diaz to keep the Blues in the hunt.

     Liverpool win FA Cup for eighth time after beating Chelsea on penalties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time this season Chelsea and Liverpool went toe-to-toe in a Wembley final and, as in the Carabao Cup at the end of February, the margins were bone-jarringly tight.
The ball simply would not go in and nor would it for Liverpool and, in particular, Díaz.
It was the Chelsea substitute goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga who had cracked last time, lifting his kick high over the crossbar.
With the FA Cup, Jürgen Klopp had completed the set of trophies with Liverpool.
The atmosphere pulsed and it was Liverpool who laid down the early marker, with Díaz prominently involved down the left.

     Summary: This also makes Chelsea the first club ever to lose three straight FA Cup finals.
It's another victory for Jurgen Klopp over Thomas Tuchel as well, after Liverpool bested Chelsea on penalties in the EFL Cup final in February.
And it's also Chelsea's third straight FA Cup final loss, a record in the 150 year history of the competition.
First he needed to distance himself from his agent on Friday after comments about transfer rumors, and then he only touched the ball 15 times in the FA Cup final on Saturday.
But, as the Champions League final is the more likely prize, rotation could be incoming as Klopp looks to protect his players.
