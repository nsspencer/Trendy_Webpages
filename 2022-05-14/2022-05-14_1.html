    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."

     10 people killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket, police say. The 18-year-old suspect is in custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Ten people were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday by a suspect in tactical gear who was livestreaming the attack, law enforcement officials said during a news conference.
The US Department of Justice is investigating the mass shooting "as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism," according to a statement from US Attorney General Merrick Garland.
Investigators are reviewing a purported manifesto posted online in connection with the mass shooting, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.
The archive and CNN define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter.
-- In August 2012, another place of worship was the scene of a mass shooting.

     Gunman Kills 10 at Buffalo Supermarket in Racist Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Buffalo grocery store, where four employees were shot, the savagery and planning were evident: Mr. Gendron was armed with an assault weapon and wore body armor, the police said.
He wrote he had been “passively preparing” for the Buffalo attack for several years, purchasing ammunition and gear, while infrequently practicing shooting.
In an arraignment on Saturday evening, Mr. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, a charge that could lead to life imprisonment without parole.
In his manifesto, Mr. Gendron seemed enthusiastic about broadcasting his attack, saying the livestream let “all people with the internet” watch and record the violence.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
