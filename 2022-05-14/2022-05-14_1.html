     Mass Shooting in Buffalo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Follow our live coverage of the mass shooting in Buffalo.
A gunman embracing a white supremacist ideology opened fire yesterday afternoon at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, killing 10 people and wounding three more.
The mass shooting was the deadliest in the United States this year and among a spate of racist attacks in recent years.
He was arrested at the store and pleaded not guilty in a brief court appearance.
The view is known as “replacement theory” and was once linked to the far-right fringe, but it has become increasingly mainstream.

You hear about a lot of these things all the time,” her son told The Washington Post.

     Summary: Ten people were killed and three others injured in a "racially motivated" shooting at a Buffalo grocery store Saturday afternoon when a white 18-year-old gunman opened fire.
John Flynn, Erie County's district attorney, said the suspect would face a variety of charges, including hate crime charges.

     Summary: Gramaglia said the gunman initially shot four people outside the store, three fatally.
Gramaglia said Buffalo police entered the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule.
The alleged gunman was identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, a community about 200 miles (320km) south-east of Buffalo in New York state.
Hours after the shooting the neighbourhood, one of the poorest in Buffalo, with poorly lit streets and run-down housing, was still attracting onlookers.
“I thought they were shooting a movie.” Lewis said he saw Gendron enter the supermarket, where the shooting continued.
