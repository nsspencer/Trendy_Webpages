    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Ten people were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday by a suspect in tactical gear who was livestreaming the attack, law enforcement officials said during a news conference.
The suspect, a White male, is in custody in the shooting, which occurred Saturday afternoon at a Tops Friendly Markets store.
Investigators are reviewing a purported manifesto posted online in connection with the mass shooting, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.
The archive and CNN define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter.
-- In August 2012, another place of worship was the scene of mass shooting.
