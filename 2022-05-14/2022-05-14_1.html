    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Highlights: Liverpool Beat Chelsea In Another Wembley Shootout To Win Their Eighth FA CupLiverpool won the FA Cup for the eighth time in their history on Saturday by beating Chelsea in a tense final at Wembley Stadium.
These two teams had met 76 days earlier in the EFL Cup final, which ended goalless before going all the way to a penalty shootout.
Liverpool scored from their first four penalties, but Cesar Azpilicueta fired wide for Chelsea.
Liverpool's eighth FA Cup triumph took them joint level with Chelsea and Tottenham as the third most successful teams in the competition's 150-year history.

     Liverpool's FA Cup win completes the double, but can they shake off fatigue to win two more this season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

Just like in the League Cup final in February, the FA Cup showpiece ended 0-0 through 120 minutes before Liverpool prevailed again.
“It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final.
After the ceremony to mark 150 years of the FA Cup, the 141st final was more tense than turgid, just like in the League Cup final.
And for only the second time — after Arsenal’s 2005 meeting with Manchester United in Cardiff — an FA Cup final ended 0-0 after extra time.

     Summary: Third time was not the charm for Chelsea after slumping to defeat to Liverpool 0-0 (5-6 pens) at Wembley in the FA Cup final on Saturday afternoon.
The Blues could not banish the memories of the Carabao Cup final in February as they yet again tasted defeat from 12 yards against Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool.
But the best chances actually came via Christian Pulisic and Marcos Alonso, serving a timely reminder of the Blues' threat on the counter.
The roles were reversed after the break, with the World Champions hot off the blocks with a string of big chances, including a free kick from Alonso that hit the bar.
