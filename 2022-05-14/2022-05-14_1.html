     Payton Gendron, 18, arraigned on murder charge for Buffalo mass shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 14 (UPI) -- The man arrested for killing 10 people and injuring three others in what authorities have called a "racially motivated" mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, has been arraigned in a court and charged with murder.
Payton Gendron, 18, appeared before Judge Craig Hannah at a court in Buffalo for less than five minutes Saturday night, hours after the shooting.
Gendron surrendered to police Saturday afternoon after storming a Tops grocery store while wearing tactical gear and live-streaming the attack on Twitch.
Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said during a press conference earlier Saturday that 11 of the 13 total victims were Black.
Pages from a manifesto Gendron is believed to have written ahead of the mass shooting have since circulated online.

     Gunman Kills 10 at Buffalo Supermarket in Racist Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Buffalo grocery store, where four employees were shot, the savagery and planning were evident: Mr. Gendron was armed with an assault weapon and wore body armor, the police said.
He wrote he had been “passively preparing” for the Buffalo attack for several years, purchasing ammunition and gear, while infrequently practicing shooting.
In an arraignment on Saturday evening, Mr. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, a charge that could lead to life imprisonment without parole.
In his manifesto, Mr. Gendron seemed enthusiastic about broadcasting his attack, saying the livestream let “all people with the internet” watch and record the violence.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
