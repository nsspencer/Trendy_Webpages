     Why the FA Cup final kick-off time has changed for today's Liverpool v Chelsea game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's Liverpool v Chelsea in the FA Cup final today, but despite the importance of the fixture the game's kick-off time has been moved forward because of another big event.
This is different to previous years, with the 2021 and 2020 FA Cup finals kicking off at 5.15pm and 5.30pm respectively.
This year's FA Cup final kick-off time has been changed due to the Eurovision Song Contest, which takes place tonight.
Eurovision will be broadcast from 6.15 to 7.15pm on BBC Two with the FA Cup final on BBC One until 7.15pm, assuming there is no extra time and penalties.
If the game is over in normal time, it will be concluded not long after 6.30pm, but if extra time and penalties are needed, the FA Cup final will impact the coverage of Pointless Celebrities which is planned between 7.15pm to 8pm.

It has been less than three months since the sides last met in a cup final, as Liverpool prevailed on penalties to win the Carabao Cup and set in motion their quest for an unprecedented quadruple.
Chelsea will also be desperate to avoid becoming the first team in FA Cup history to lose three consecutive finals, after they were beaten by Leicester and Arsenal in 2021 and 2020 respectively.
Liverpool, meanwhile, have not appeared in an FA Cup final since 2012, where they lost to Chelsea, and you have to go back to their Steven Gerrard-inspired win in 2006 for their last triumph in this competition.

     Liverpool face major FA Cup final dilemma as one of £43m Jürgen Klopp duo must miss out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool take on Chelsea in the FA Cup final today, and Jürgen Klopp has some big decisions to make.
In the Carabao Cup final against the same opponents, Livepool opted to start with Joël Matip, before introducing Ibrahima Konaté in extra time.
He has played in some big games recently, not least the semi-final of the FA Cup — in which he scored against Manchester City.
I would save Matip for the Champions League final and rest him ahead of the FA Cup final.
Let Konaté get a taste of the big occasion from the off, having come on and played the last half an hour of the Carabao Cup final.
