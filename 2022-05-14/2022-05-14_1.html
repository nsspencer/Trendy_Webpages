     Buffalo Live Updates: Investigators Begin Building Case Against a Suspect Motivated by Hate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Gendron wrote in his manifesto that he had selected the area because it held the largest percentage of Black residents near his home in the state’s Southern Tier.
Mr. Gendron said that he had watched Mr. Tarrant’s livestream of the attack and read his writings.
Buffalo officials said that Mr. Gendron had “traveled hours from outside” the neighborhood to unleash gunfire at unsuspecting shoppers at an outlet of the regional grocery chain Tops Friendly Markets.
Around May 2020, during a period of pandemic boredom, Mr. Gendron said that he had begun to frequent 4chan, an anonymous forum, including its Politically Incorrect message board.
He had been “passively preparing” for the attack in Buffalo for several years, purchasing ammunition and gear, while infrequently practicing shooting, he wrote.

     At least 10 dead, 3 hurt in Buffalo supermarket shooting; Gov. Kathy Hochul blames 'white supremacist'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."

     Buffalo shooting: teenager accused of killing 10 in ‘racist’ supermarket attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gramaglia said Buffalo police entered the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule.
The alleged gunman was identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, a community about 200 miles (320km) south-east of Buffalo in New York state.
The gunman is believed to have livestreamed the shooting through a camera fixed to his helmet, officials told AP.
Hours after the shooting the neighbourhood, one of the poorest in Buffalo, with poorly lit streets and run-down housing, was still attracting onlookers.
“I thought they were shooting a movie.” Lewis said he saw Gendron enter the supermarket where the shooting continued.
