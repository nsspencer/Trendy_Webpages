     Live Updates: Gunman Kills 10 at Buffalo Supermarket in Racist Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Gendron was armed with an assault weapon and wore body armor, the police said, and he had a video camera affixed to his helmet that streamed the shooting live online.
A law enforcement official said investigators were reviewing a manifesto believed to have been posted online by Mr. Gendron.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
When Buffalo police officers arrived and confronted Mr. Gendron, he put a gun to his neck, but two patrolmen persuaded him to drop his weapon and surrender, Mr. Gramaglia said.
Officials said the camera that the gunman wore was used to broadcast the attack live on Twitch, a livestreaming site owned by Amazon that is popular with gamers.
