     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Officials said the suspected gunman, a white 18-year-old man, traveled several hours to carry out the attack, which he livestreamed on social media.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual — this white supremacist — who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Ten people were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday by a suspect in tactical gear who was livestreaming the attack, law enforcement officials said during a news conference.
The US Department of Justice is investigating the mass shooting "as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism," according to a statement from US Attorney General Merrick Garland.
Investigators are reviewing a purported manifesto posted online in connection with the mass shooting, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.
The archive and CNN define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter.
-- In August 2012, another place of worship was the scene of mass shooting.
