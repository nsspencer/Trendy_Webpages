     Summary: Screenshots of the broadcast circulating online appeared to show the shooter, at one point, holding a gun and standing over a body.
Shonnell Harris, an operation manager at the Tops, told The Buffalo News that she was stocking shelves when she heard loud noises and saw people running toward the back of the store.
“He had army fatigue stuff on,” she told The Buffalo News.
Eventually, the gunman returned to the front of the store, where he was confronted by Buffalo police in the vestibule.
Then the police tackled him, witnesses told The Buffalo News.

     At least 10 dead, 3 hurt in Buffalo supermarket shooting; Gov. Kathy Hochul blames 'white supremacist'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Law enforcement officials have called the shooting a "racially motivated hate crime."
Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.
Kathy Hochul called the gunman a "white supremacist" who terrorized New York's second-largest city in a "cold-hearted," "military-style execution" as people were buying groceries.
"This individual – this white supremacist – who just perpetrated a hate crime on an innocent community, will spend the rest of his days behind bars.
"It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community."

     Buffalo shooting: teenager accused of killing 10 in ‘racist’ supermarket attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gramaglia said Buffalo police entered the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule.
The alleged gunman was identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, a community about 200 miles (320km) south-east of Buffalo in New York state.
The gunman is believed to have livestreamed the shooting through a camera fixed to his helmet, officials told AP.
Hours after the shooting the neighbourhood, one of the poorest in Buffalo, with poorly lit streets and run-down housing, was still attracting onlookers.
“I thought they were shooting a movie.” Lewis said he saw Gendron enter the supermarket where the shooting continued.

     10 people killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket, police say. The 18-year-old suspect is in custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Ten people were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday by a suspect in tactical gear who was livestreaming the attack, law enforcement officials said during a news conference.
The US Department of Justice is investigating the mass shooting "as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism," according to a statement from US Attorney General Merrick Garland.
Investigators are reviewing a purported manifesto posted online in connection with the mass shooting, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.
The archive and CNN define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter.
-- In August 2012, another place of worship was the scene of a mass shooting.
