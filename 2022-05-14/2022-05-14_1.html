     PHN Penguins Wrap-up: The Penalty Kill, Power Play, &amp; Who Starts Game 7?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Who will start in goal for the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 7?
The goal doomed the Penguins, who now must play Game 7 at Madison Square Garden Sunday at 7 p.m.After Game 6, Domingue’s save percentage is now below .900 (.898).
The Penguins penalty kill has been little more than a speed bump for the New York Rangers power play.
And the Penguins power play was ineffectual, including a 5v3 for over one minute that yielded zero shots.
Dan Kingerski breaks down Game 6 and the Pittsburgh Penguins significant issues for Game 7 from PPG Paints Arena.

     The Penguins’ hopes boil down to Tristan Jarry

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Who is your favorite third string goalie to lead his team to the Stanley Cup?
Hell, who’s the best third string goalie to win a whole NHL playoff series?
Unfortunately for Domingue and the Penguins, the health and time needed to get Tristan Jarry back has not allowed for a quick conclusion to the feel good story.
Simply hoping for the best is never an ideal strategy, but it beats playing a third string goalie, which will likely yield predictable results after a while.
Coming into the series, not too many people liked the Pens’ chances, even if they had Jarry (..and Crosby...and Dumoulin..and Rickard Rakell).

     Summary: But recent Penguins playoff flameouts have one thing in common: losing the goaltending battle.
3 goalie for a reason, and despite some admirable work for the situation he was immersed into he has also statistically been the worst goalie in the playoffs.
Last season, the Penguins also had the worst goalie in the playoffs as measured to goals saved above expected, Tristan Jarry (minus-7.9).
In the 2020 playoff “bubble,” at least Matt Murray wasn’t the NHL’s worst goalie.
That year, at least, Murray was good (1.9 goals saved above expected) – but New York’s Robin Lehner was spectacular (plus-6.1)3.

In both games, the Penguins came out of the gates with an effective game plan that put them in the lead 2-0.
The first periods of Game 5 and Game 6 provided a road map to victory for the Penguins.
It may be as simple as Domingue not being confident in his high blocker side, but it cost the Penguins in Game 6.
That is something the Penguins were unable to do after he left the second period in Game 5 and the entire second period in Game 6.

A victory would be the franchise’s 16th Game 7 win – an NHL record the team currently shares with Montreal.
Carolina won Game 5 to retake momentum but was unable to eliminate the Bruins on Thursday night.
“We had plenty of opportunities to finish the game and finish the series,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said.
“But if you told us that we’ve got to win one game to advance, we’d certainly take the opportunity.
