It's another victory for Jurgen Klopp over Thomas Tuchel as well, after Liverpool bested Chelsea on penalties in the EFL Cup final in February.
And it's also Chelsea's third straight FA Cup final loss, a record in the 150 year history of the competition.
First he needed to distance himself from his agent on Friday after comments about transfer rumors, and then he only touched the ball 15 times in the FA Cup final on Saturday.
But, as the Champions League final is the more likely prize, rotation could be incoming as Klopp looks to protect his players.
