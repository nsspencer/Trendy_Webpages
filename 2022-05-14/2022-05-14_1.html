     Summary: Highlights: Liverpool Beat Chelsea In Another Wembley Shootout To Win Their Eighth FA CupLiverpool won the FA Cup for the eighth time in their history on Saturday by beating Chelsea in a tense final at Wembley Stadium.
These two teams had met 76 days earlier in the EFL Cup final, which ended goalless before going all the way to a penalty shootout.
Liverpool scored from their first four penalties, but Cesar Azpilicueta fired wide for Chelsea.
Liverpool's eighth FA Cup triumph took them joint level with Chelsea and Tottenham as the third most successful teams in the competition's 150-year history.

     Summary: Liverpool continue to make heroes during a never-to-be-forgotten season, to accumulate silverware, to hint at something historic.
It was the kick which won the FA Cup.
He had scored the decisive penalty for Senegal in their victories in the Africa Cup of Nations final and the World Cup playoff.
The Liverpool half of the stadium exploded, red flares lighting the scene, and Klopp could celebrate the addition of the FA Cup to his CV.
It was their third FA Cup final in succession and their third defeat, an unwanted new record.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

     Summary: Just as in the League Cup final earlier this year at Wembley, Jurgen Klopp's men needed penalties to see off Chelsea and lift some silverware at the same stadium.
It is why Liverpool fans are dreaming.
Just as in the League Cup final, a scoreless 120 minutes belied the quality of the match.
Liverpool fans can celebrate a first FA Cup triumph since 2006.
Once again Chelsea, still under UK government sanctions, suffered the cruelest of defeats, becoming the first team to lose three consecutive FA Cup finals.

     Summary: As match winner Alisson put it, "This gives us more confidence in the Premier League and also the Champions League final.
Klopp's "mentality monsters" have come through quite the examination, physical and emotional, by Chelsea over this season's two domestic cup finals.
With less than a quarter of the match played Thiago Silva was hobbling, Edouard Mendy stretching his legs in discomfort.
Up the other end Alisson would soon join him, while Caoimhin Kelleher was not required to reprise his EFL Cup final heroics it was only going to be a matter of time before someone tapped out.
This time, Tuchel opted against breaking the glass that held Kepa Arrizabalaga back from the shootout after the spot kick specialist was unable to make a save in the EFL Cup final.

“It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final.
After the ceremony to mark 150 years of the FA Cup, the 141st final was more tense than turgid, just like in the League Cup final.

     Summary: Third time was not the charm for Chelsea after slumping to defeat to Liverpool 0-0 (5-6 pens) at Wembley in the FA Cup final on Saturday afternoon.
The Blues could not banish the memories of the Carabao Cup final in February as they yet again tasted defeat from 12 yards against Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool.
But the best chances actually came via Christian Pulisic and Marcos Alonso, serving a timely reminder of the Blues' threat on the counter.
The roles were reversed after the break, with the World Champions hot off the blocks with a string of big chances, including a free kick from Alonso that hit the bar.
