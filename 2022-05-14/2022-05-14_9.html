     Lightning defeat Maple Leafs in Game 7, advance to second round of playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tampa Bay Lightning advanced to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs Saturday night, winning 2-1 over the Toronto Maple Leafs to capture the series in seven games.
It wasn't pretty but we locked it down," Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman said.
He came back for a shift in the second period before staying on the bench for the remainder of the game.
Captain John Tavares scored a goal in the second period but it was disallowed because of an interference penalty on defenseman Justin Holl.
The Lightning will face the Florida Panthers in the second round.

     Tampa Bay Lightning advance with Game 7 win vs. Toronto Maple Leafs but lose Brayden Point to injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two-time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning kept their three-peat hopes alive and the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered another Game 7 disappointment with a 2-1 home loss Saturday night.
The Maple Leafs have not won a playoff series since 2004 and this might have been their best shot as they finished with a franchise-record 115 points.
The Maple Leafs beefed up their defense with Mark Giordano and Ilya Lyubushkin before the deadline.
The Maple Leafs won 5-0 in Game 1, but the Lightning continued their playoff trend of following a loss with a win (now 17-0).
Toronto led by a goal in the third period of Game 6, but Tampa Bay forced overtime on a 5-on-3 power play.

     More Game 7 heartache for Maple Leafs as Nick Paul powers Lightning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick Paul pulled off similar heroics for the Lightning in Game 7 against the Maple Leafs.
That would end up being all that Andrei Vasilevskiy and the Bolts needed, ending another Maple Leafs season in First Round heartbreak.
Nick Paul the difference-maker for Lightning over Maple Leafs in Game 7Being that Nick Paul’s spent his career with the Senators before being traded to the Lightning, it’s not that shocking that he scored his first career playoff goal in Game 7.
Disallowed Tavares goal (Holl interference) creates some Game 7 controversyNo doubt, one of the lingering controversies of Maple Leafs – Lightning Game 7 was a disallowed goal.
Personally, the Maple Leafs lost to the Lightning in a very close series that went to Game 7.

     Maple Leafs Lose 10th Straight Series-Clinching Game As Lightning Advance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Maple Leafs were once again unable to push through and finally flip a long, ugly narrative of playoff failures for a franchise that has now lost its last seven series, including six over the last six years.
The goal was the first surrendered by Vasilevskiy and the Lightning in their last six series-deciding games.
William Nylander then missed high on a breakaway and the Tampa goaltender robbed Matthews with the Maple Leafs buzzing.
The Maple Leafs, however, just couldn’t find a way through with Campbell on the bench for an extra skater to complete another chapter of playoff disappointment.
The Lightning were playing in just their second Game 7 since the start of the 2020 playoffs after defeating the New York Islanders 1–0 on home in the semifinals last June.

     Unheralded Nick Paul steals show in Game 7 as Tampa Bay Lightning eliminate Toronto Maple Leafs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tampa Bay could have let the chance at a third straight Stanley Cup slip away.
Tampa Bay rose.
That set a tone for Tampa Bay as the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions topped the Maple Leafs 2-1 and advanced to face the Florida Panthers in the second round.
Toronto originally had two chances to send Tampa Bay packing after leading the series 3-2 following Game 5.
There's some recent bad blood there already after Tampa Bay eliminated Florida in the first round of last year's postseason.
