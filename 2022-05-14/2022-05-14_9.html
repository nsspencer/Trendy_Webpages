     Watch: Mbappe and Messi combine for an incredibly sexy PSG goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch: Mbappe and Messi combine for an incredibly sexy PSG goalLionel Messi hasn’t enjoyed the best season for PSG but he combined with Kylian Mbappe to score an incredibly sexy goal during their Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on Saturday night.
Messi joined the French club from Barcelona last summer but has failed to produce his best form despite PSG romping to the French title.
But Messi, despite his advancing years, remains a player of immense quality and demonstrated just this during PSG’s trip south to face Montpellier.
Taking the ball in his stride, Messi sat the goalkeeper down before rolling it into an unguarded net to double the Parisen’s advantage.
Maybe PSG fans should enjoy watching Mbappe and Messi together while they still can.

     PSG wear special rainbow flag numbering on shirts as Ligue 1 acknowledges International Day Against Homophobia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain lined up against Montpellier with special rainbow-coloured numbers on Saturday as the club and all of French football lent their support to the International Day Against Homophobia.
The Ligue 1 champions were given few problems in their penultimate clash of the season, securing a comfortable 4-0 victory.
Why did PSG wear the numbers?
Saturday marked the second straight year in which French clubs, including PSG, have marked the International Day Against Homophobia.
In May 2021 every side in Ligue 1 and 2 came out with rainbow numbers, part of the LFP's "Gay or straight, we all wear the same jersey” campaign.

Lionel Messi dropped one of his finest performances for Paris Saint-Germain to date on Saturday night.
It’s no secret that the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner hasn’t found life to be plain-sailing at the Parc des Princes, but you wouldn’t have known that was the case based on his performance against Montpellier.
And it was the trait that Messi has been criticised for the most this season that he excelled in during the Ligue 1 clash this weekend: goalscoring.
