     School fight: 12-year-old facing criminal charges after middle school altercation, authorities say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KENOSHA, Wis. (Martin Law Office/CNN) - A 12-year-old Wisconsin girl is charged with disorderly conduct after being involved in a violent school fight earlier this year.
The girl’s attorney said she was offered a diversion, with a penalty similar to probation, but that was untenable because she is not guilty.
The fight happened on March 4 at Lincoln Middle School in Kenosha.
The officer has since resigned from the school district but remains on the Kenosha police force.
A civil suit has been filed against the officer, the interim police chief and the school district, according to the girl’s attorney.

The girl’s mother, Claudia Hernandez-Santos, was arrested in January and charged with assault on a child resulting in death.
According to court records, Claudia Hernandez-Santos told police she believed her daughter was possessed because she would “wake up and scream or cry periodically”.
Claudia Hernandez-Santos told police that the family waited two hours before calling police after the child became unresponsive.
The grandfather told the Mercury News last week that he had performed the ceremony on the child to “liberate her of her evil spirits”.

     Summary: At a meeting in sun-dappled Vienna this week, the framework for the future of the Champions League was finally approved.
Under pressure from the biggest leagues, who complained of too many matches, the number of group stage games was reduced to eight from a proposed 10.
And in the other notable change, two of the extra four places in the event will not now go to clubs with historically strong track records in European competition but who failed to qualify on merit.
It’s also a reminder that for all their fighting and sniping and suing, UEFA and the dirty dozen need one another more than they care to admit.
It is the big clubs, after all, who drive the billion-dollar television contracts, the multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals, the big ratings for all those midweek classics in UEFA’s showcase competition.
