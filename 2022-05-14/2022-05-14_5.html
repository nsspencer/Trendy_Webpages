     ‘We Lost Our Miracle Baby,’ Britney Spears Shares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A month after announcing on Instagram that she was pregnant, the pop star Britney Spears has posted an update saying that she suffered a miscarriage, writing: “We have lost our miracle baby.”“Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along,” said the message, which was posted to Ms. Spears’s Instagram account on Saturday afternoon and attributed to her and her partner, Sam Asghari.
“However we were overly excited to share the good news.”When Ms. Spears, 40, let it be known that she was pregnant, her announcement was seen by many not only as glad tidings, but also as a declaration of agency after being freed from a conservatorship that had governed her life since she was in her 20s.
That arrangement began in 2008, amid concerns over her mental health and potential substance abuse, when a judge in California granted oversight of her personal life and finances to her father, James P. Spears.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Britney Spears announced that she has lost her baby, posting the news in a statement on her Instagram account Saturday.
Spears, 40, said last month that she was expecting a child with fiancé Sam Asghari after deciding to take a pregnancy test after she found herself gaining weight.
But in a statement Saturday, she said the couple has lost their "miracle baby."
Fans expressed their delight that Spears was expecting a child when the news initially broke, as she revealed a desire for more children less than a year ago.
“I wanted to take the IUD out so I could start trying to have another baby,” she said in June.
