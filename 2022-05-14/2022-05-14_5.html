     Eurovision 2022 Final—Russian Hackers Say They Can Stop Ukraine Kalush Orchestra Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra is favorite to win the Eurovision 2022 final AFP via Getty ImagesThe same Russian threat actors that this week targeted Italian parliamentary and military websites and threatened to disrupt U.K. National Health Service (NHS) services, could now have the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 final in their crosshairs.
The Killnet threat group has threatened to “send 10 billion requests” to the Eurovision online voting system and “add votes to some other country.”What is Killnet?
Killnet threatens to disrupt Eurovision 2022 final votingIn an apparent attempt to prevent or disrupt the online voting for current Eurovision favorites from Ukraine, the Kalush Orchestra, Killnet has hinted it could target Eurovision servers.
Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine, and the Kalush Orchestra has stated that a win would be a morale booster for the people of Ukraine.
Bizarrely, the Killnet group seems to be distancing itself from those threats to the Eurovision final in the same message that it makes them.

     Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra the favorite to win Eurovision Song Contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN) It tells you plenty about the Eurovision Song Contest that Norway's participants -- two grown men in wolf costumes who sing about bananas and the imminent consumption of their grandparents -- are flying relatively under the radar this year.
The continent's garish and much-loved singing competition returns in Turin, Italy on Saturday, but only one group is commanding the spotlight in the build-up: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra.
But getting Kalush Orchestra to the Eurovision stage took some doing, and their journey is deeply interwoven with the war at home.
"All members of the group are somehow involved in the defense of the country," Psyuk told CNN via email.
But winning would be uniquely significant for Kalush Orchestra, and it's hard to imagine a more popular victor in the tournament's history.
