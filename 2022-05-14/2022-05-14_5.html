     Record-Setting Liverpool Captain Jordan Henderson On "Special" FA Cup Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Henderson made Liverpool Football Club history at Wembley Stadium as his side beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final.
Liverpool's victory, which came 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match had ended 0-0, saw them win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006.
Those six trophies have all come in six different competitions, with the FA Cup adding to previous triumphs in the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Premier League and EFL Cup.
The Anfield club had already been without Fabinho, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury in Tuesday's Premier League win at Aston Villa.
And then Wolves at the weekend to finish the Premier League season off and then the Champions League final.

     Liverpool's FA Cup win completes the double, but can they shake off fatigue to win two more this season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

     Liverpool wins FA Cup final after beating Chelsea in nerve-racking penalty shootout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as in the League Cup final earlier this year at Wembley, Jurgen Klopp's men needed penalties to see off Chelsea and lift some silverware at the same stadium.
It is why Liverpool fans are dreaming.
Just as in the League Cup final, a scoreless 120 minutes belied the quality of the match.
Liverpool fans can celebrate a first FA Cup triumph since 2006.
Once again Chelsea, still under UK government sanctions, suffered the cruelest of defeats, becoming the first team to lose three consecutive FA Cup finals.
