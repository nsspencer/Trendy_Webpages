     Summary: To a generation of 21st-century cricket fans, Andrew Symonds was a real-life action hero.
He was a gifted athlete, a born entertainer and a reluctant celebrity.
Symonds was born in Birmingham in 1975, two days after the first Cricket World Cup kicked off in London.
But with critics calling for his head, Symonds showed his mettle on the biggest stage of all, the MCG and the 2005 Boxing Day Test against South Africa.
Soon after, Symonds was axed from the Australian side after he missed a team meeting to go fishing.
