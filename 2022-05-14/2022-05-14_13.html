    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A COUP to boot "cancer-stricken" Vladimir Putin from power is already underway, Ukriane's spy chief has claimed.
General Budanov believes the war will be over within months and will see Putin - who he says is seriously ill with cancer - removed from power.
It comes after a top oligarch reportedly claimed Putin is "very ill with blood cancer" in the audio recording obtained by New Lines Magazine.
"There are hardmen in Russia who would have removed him if they had lost Ukraine to Nato and the EU.
"He's acted and now the whole thing has gone badly wrong and he is vulnerable again and he is in trouble."

     Does Putin Have Cancer? Rumors Intensify Over Russian Oligarch's Remarks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was scrutiny over a video recorded meeting between Putin and Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu which showed the president tightly clutching his table, appearing restless and tense.
He reportedly said in the 11-minute exchange in March that the Russian leader was "very ill with blood cancer."
Earlier this month, a Telegram social media channel purportedly run by a former Russian Foreign Intelligence Service lieutenant general claimed Putin is about to undergo cancer surgery.
There seems to be no let-up in the claims about Putin's health.
However the truth about Putin's condition may never be known.

The Russian oligarch says in the recording that Mr Putin had surgery on his back linked to his blood cancer shortly before ordering the invasion of Ukraine - which he has called a “special military operation”.
