     School fight: 12-year-old facing criminal charges after middle school altercation, authorities say
    </h2>

     Summary: KENOSHA, Wis. (Martin Law Office/CNN) - A 12-year-old Wisconsin girl is charged with disorderly conduct after being involved in a violent school fight earlier this year.
The girl’s attorney said she was offered a diversion, with a penalty similar to probation, but that was untenable because she is not guilty.
The fight happened on March 4 at Lincoln Middle School in Kenosha.
The officer has since resigned from the school district but remains on the Kenosha police force.
A civil suit has been filed against the officer, the interim police chief and the school district, according to the girl’s attorney.
