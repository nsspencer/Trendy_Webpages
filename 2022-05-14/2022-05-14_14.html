    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To a generation of 21st-century cricket fans, Andrew Symonds was a real-life action hero.
He was a gifted athlete, a born entertainer and a reluctant celebrity.
Symonds was born in Birmingham in 1975, two days after the first Cricket World Cup kicked off in London.
But with critics calling for his head, Symonds showed his mettle on the biggest stage of all, the MCG and the 2005 Boxing Day Test against South Africa.
Soon after, Symonds was axed from the Australian side after he missed a team meeting to go fishing.

     Summary: But Symonds, far from being hurt, felt a breeze of relief.
Then 34, he joined Surrey, where later he found happiness, where the laid-back soul of county cricket helped him rediscover the lost joy of playing cricket.
For him, an unabashed hitter of the cricket ball, playing cricket was all about finding that joy.
Here, as well in the past, Symonds was just being Symonds.
The crux of Symonds the cricketer was his own tussle with the changing times, a battle he was doomed to lose.

     Flamboyant Australia cricketer Andrew Symonds dies in car crash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australian cricket was reeling Sunday after swashbuckling former all-rounder Andrew Symonds was killed in a car crash -- another tragic blow after the recent deaths of fellow greats Shane Warne and Rod Marsh.
Symonds' fatal crash comes just months after the deaths of fellow Australian greats Warne and Marsh, who both died unexpectedly from heart attacks.
He was widely considered one of the most skilled all-rounders Australian cricket has seen, bowling both off-spin and medium pace, while playing many match-winning hands with his explosive middle-order batting.
- Utterly devastated' -"Horrendous news to wake up to," tweeted former Australian teammate Jason Gillespie.
Despite the animosity, Symonds and Harbhajan eventually made up and played together in the Indian Premier League.
