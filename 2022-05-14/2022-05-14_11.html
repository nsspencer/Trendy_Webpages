     Summary: Watch: Mbappe and Messi combine for an incredibly sexy PSG goalLionel Messi hasn‚Äôt enjoyed the best season for PSG but he combined with Kylian Mbappe to score an incredibly sexy goal during their Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on Saturday night.
Messi joined the French club from Barcelona last summer but has failed to produce his best form despite PSG romping to the French title.
But Messi, despite his advancing years, remains a player of immense quality and demonstrated just this during PSG‚Äôs trip south to face Montpellier.
Taking the ball in his stride, Messi sat the goalkeeper down before rolling it into an unguarded net to double the Parisen‚Äôs advantage.
Maybe PSG fans should enjoy watching Mbappe and Messi together while they still can.

Marseille have won it nine times while Monaco, who are actually based in a foreign country making it a cross-border competition, eight-time champions.
