     Summary: Jermell Charlo is the undisputed champion at 154 lbs after stopping Brian Castano in the 10th round of an outstanding, action-packed rematch in tonight’s Showtime Championship Boxing main event from Carson, Calif.Charlo (35-1-1, 19 KO) and Castano (17-1-2, 12 KO) had an even better fight than their excellent draw 10 months ago, with both coming in promising more action and that they were not looking to leave it up to the judges this time, and delivering on those promises.
Charlo takes the WBO belt from Castano with the win, unifying it with the WBC, WBA, and IBF titles to become the first male undisputed champion in the junior middleweight division in the four-belt era (which started, it’s agreed, in 2007).
We’ll have much more shortly on the front page from this fight, but for now, let’s take a look at some great highlights from this one, including the finish.

     Summary: The fight got off to a delayed start after Castano arrived late to Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson California.
If the delay in the start of the fight had any impact on Charlo, he did not let it show.
As Castano found more success, Charlo responded with some heavy left hook counters and the action ramped up dramatically with both men landing brutal power shots.
Asked about the delay to start the fight, Charlo brushed off the situation affecting him in any way.
"You know, I'm just getting in there in the fight," Charlo said.
