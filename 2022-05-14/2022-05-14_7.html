     ‘We Lost Our Miracle Baby,’ Britney Spears Shares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A month after announcing on Instagram that she was pregnant, the pop star Britney Spears has posted an update saying that she suffered a miscarriage, writing: “We have lost our miracle baby.”“Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along,” said the message, which was posted to Ms. Spears’s Instagram account on Saturday afternoon and attributed to her and her partner, Sam Asghari.
“However we were overly excited to share the good news.”When Ms. Spears, 40, let it be known that she was pregnant, her announcement was seen by many not only as glad tidings, but also as a declaration of agency after being freed from a conservatorship that had governed her life since she was in her 20s.
That arrangement began in 2008, amid concerns over her mental health and potential substance abuse, when a judge in California granted oversight of her personal life and finances to her father, James P. Spears.

     Summary: Britney Spears has announced that she has “lost” her pregnancy a month after revealing she was expecting her first child with her partner, the actor Sam Asghari.
“It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that we have lost our miracle baby early in the pregnancy,” she and Asghari posted on Instagram.

During a bombshell hearing last June, Britney Spears alleged that she was not allowed to get married, have children, or have an IUD removed due to the conservatorship.
