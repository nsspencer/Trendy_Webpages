     Maple Leafs lose in first round of playoffs: 'We're getting sick and tired of feeling like this'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Maple Leafs lost Game 7 on home ice Saturday, 2-1, to the Tampa Bay Lightning.
"We're getting sick and tired of feeling like this," said Leafs forward Mitch Marner.
The Leafs haven't won a playoff series since 2004.
That came in the first round against the Ottawa Senators, where they won in seven games.
But the streak of 18 years and counting without a playoff series win continues.

     Maple Leafs Lose 10th Straight Series-Clinching Game As Lightning Advance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Maple Leafs were once again unable to push through and finally flip a long, ugly narrative of playoff failures for a franchise that has now lost its last seven series, including six over the last six years.
The goal was the first surrendered by Vasilevskiy and the Lightning in their last six series-deciding games.
William Nylander then missed high on a breakaway and the Tampa goaltender robbed Matthews with the Maple Leafs buzzing.
The Maple Leafs, however, just couldn’t find a way through with Campbell on the bench for an extra skater to complete another chapter of playoff disappointment.
The Lightning were playing in just their second Game 7 since the start of the 2020 playoffs after defeating the New York Islanders 1–0 on home in the semifinals last June.

     Tampa Bay Lightning advance with Game 7 win vs. Toronto Maple Leafs but lose Brayden Point to injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two-time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning kept their three-peat hopes alive and the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered another Game 7 disappointment with a 2-1 home loss Saturday night.
Surprisingly, Point came out for the second period.
The Maple Leafs won 5-0 in Game 1, but the Lightning continued their playoff trend of following a loss with a win (now 17-0).
Toronto led by a goal in the third period of Game 6, but Tampa Bay forced overtime on a 5-on-3 power play goal.
In Game 7, a John Tavares goal was taken away in the second period because of an interference call to Justin Holl.

     Summary: Tampa Bay could have let the chance at a third straight Stanley Cup slip away.
Tampa Bay rose.
That set a tone for Tampa Bay as the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions topped the Maple Leafs 2-1 and advanced to face the Florida Panthers in the second round.
Toronto originally had two chances to send Tampa Bay packing after leading the series 3-2 following Game 5.
There's some recent bad blood there already after Tampa Bay eliminated Florida in the first round of last year's postseason.

• The Maple Leafs have scored zero power-play goals in their past seven games when attempting to clinch a playoff series.
