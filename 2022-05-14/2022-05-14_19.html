     Summary: If you haven’t yet experienced the pure joy that is Netflix’s Old Enough!

Host Selena Gomez sends her 34-year old man-child boyfriend of three years (played by Mikey Day) on a a series of quick errands and, to his credit, he does almost as well as his pint-sized Japanese counterparts.
Gomez has the low-key exasperation of a woman twice her age and it’s a constant delight.

     ‘SNL’: Selena Gomez Spoofs ‘Old Enough’; Sends Boyfriend Out Like Toddler On Errands
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Selena Gomez ended up with bags of onions and makeup multiple shades darker than her skin tone in a hilarious SNL sketch that spoofed Old Enough.
The original Old Enough is a 90s series that hails from Japan shot documentary-style as filmmakers follow toddlers on errands for their parents, which recently began streaming in the U.S. via Netflix.
Gomez plays Kelsey and her long-term boyfriend Matt is played by Mikey Day.
Instead of shallots, however, Matt had a bigger surprise in store for his lady love.
Kelsey dumps him after 3 years together but nobody can take away the pride he feels after taking on the big city.

     This 33-year-old left the U.S. for Georgia and lives on $1,592 a month: 'Now, I'm semi-retired'

     Summary: Swigunski had only planned to visit Georgia, a small country that sits between eastern Europe and western Asia, for 30 days.
If he was living in the U.S., Swigunski adds, "I would have to be working a lot more … now, I'm semi-retired."
Swigunski lives in a two-bedroom apartment with a private Italian garden that he found through a local realtor.
A private chef might sound like a luxurious expense, but Swigunski says it's actually saved him a lot of money.
