     Jordan Henderson Becomes First Liverpool Captain to Lift Six Different Trophies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Jordan Henderson became Liverpool’s captain in 2015, he took on the difficult responsibility at a club that had won just one one major trophy since 2010.
And for Henderson, it was an opportunity for the midfielder to lift his sixth trophy as the club’s captain, becoming the first Liverpool captain to do so.
Henderson, who joined Liverpool in 2011, has captained teams that have won the Champions League, Premier League, EFL Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in addition to Saturday’s FA Cup win at Wembley Stadium in London.
“It’s a big moment for us, we haven’t been in this final for some time so to win it was special,” Henderson said.
While Henderson and Liverpool will celebrate the win, three pivotal matches remain, including the Champions League final at end of May and two Premier League matches in hopes of overtaking Manchester City’s three-point cushion atop the league table.

“It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final.
After the ceremony to mark 150 years of the FA Cup, the 141st final was more tense than turgid, just like in the League Cup final.

It's another victory for Jurgen Klopp over Thomas Tuchel as well, after Liverpool bested Chelsea on penalties in the EFL Cup final in February.
And it's also Chelsea's third straight FA Cup final loss, a record in the 150 year history of the competition.
First he needed to distance himself from his agent on Friday after comments about transfer rumors, and then he only touched the ball 15 times in the FA Cup final on Saturday.
But, as the Champions League final is the more likely prize, rotation could be incoming as Klopp looks to protect his players.
