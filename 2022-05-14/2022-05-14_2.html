Fireworks and confetti erupted inside Wembley Stadium Saturday as Liverpool soared with a 6-5 aggregate score against their counterparts Chelsea, deeming them the winner of the 2022 FA Cup.
This is Liverpool’s first FA Cup victory since 2006 when they defeated West Ham.
The Reds have won 19 League titles, seven FA Cups, a record nine League Cups, as well as 15 FA Community Shields.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Henderson made Liverpool Football Club history at Wembley Stadium as his side beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final.
Liverpool's victory, which came 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match had ended 0-0, saw them win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006.
Those six trophies have all come in six different competitions, with the FA Cup adding to previous triumphs in the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Premier League and EFL Cup.
The Anfield club had already been without Fabinho, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury in Tuesday's Premier League win at Aston Villa.
And then Wolves at the weekend to finish the Premier League season off and then the Champions League final.

- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

“It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final.
