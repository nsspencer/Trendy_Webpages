     Liverpool Defeats Chelsea in 2022 Emirates FA Cup Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool has officially claimed victory over Chelsea in the 2022 Emirates FA Cup final, and from a shootout nonetheless.
Similar to their League Cup final penalty shootout win over Chelsea, the Reds reigned victorious again.
Fireworks and confetti erupted inside Wembley Stadium Saturday as Liverpool soared with a 6-5 aggregate score against their counterparts Chelsea, deeming them the winner of the 2022 FA Cup.
This is Liverpool’s first FA Cup victory since 2006 when they defeated West Ham.
The Reds have won 19 League titles, seven FA Cups, a record nine League Cups, as well as 15 FA Community Shields.

     Jordan Henderson Becomes First Liverpool Captain to Lift Six Different Trophies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Jordan Henderson became Liverpool’s captain in 2015, he took on the difficult responsibility at a club that had won just one one major trophy since 2010.
And for Henderson, it was an opportunity for the midfielder to lift his sixth trophy as the club’s captain, becoming the first Liverpool captain to do so.
Henderson, who joined Liverpool in 2011, has captained teams that have won the Champions League, Premier League, EFL Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in addition to Saturday’s FA Cup win at Wembley Stadium in London.
“It’s a big moment for us, we haven’t been in this final for some time so to win it was special,” Henderson said.
While Henderson and Liverpool will celebrate the win, three pivotal matches remain, including the Champions League final at end of May and two Premier League matches in hopes of overtaking Manchester City’s three-point cushion atop the league table.

     Record-Setting Liverpool Captain Jordan Henderson On "Special" FA Cup Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Henderson made Liverpool Football Club history at Wembley Stadium as his side beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final.
Liverpool's victory, which came 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match had ended 0-0, saw them win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006.
Those six trophies have all come in six different competitions, with the FA Cup adding to previous triumphs in the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Premier League and EFL Cup.
The Anfield club had already been without Fabinho, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury in Tuesday's Premier League win at Aston Villa.
And then Wolves at the weekend to finish the Premier League season off and then the Champions League final.

     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.
