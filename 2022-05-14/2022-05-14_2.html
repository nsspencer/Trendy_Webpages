     Summary: Liverpool has officially claimed victory over Chelsea in the 2022 Emirates FA Cup final, and from a shootout nonetheless.
Similar to their League Cup final penalty shootout win over Chelsea, the Reds reigned victorious again.
Fireworks and confetti erupted inside Wembley Stadium Saturday as Liverpool soared with a 6-5 aggregate score against their counterparts Chelsea, deeming them the winner of the 2022 FA Cup.
This is Liverpoolâ€™s first FA Cup victory since 2006 when they defeated West Ham.
The Reds have won 19 League titles, seven FA Cups, a record nine League Cups, as well as 15 FA Community Shields.

     Record-Setting Liverpool Captain Jordan Henderson On "Special" FA Cup Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Henderson made Liverpool Football Club history at Wembley Stadium as his side beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final.
Liverpool's victory, which came 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match had ended 0-0, saw them win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006.
Those six trophies have all come in six different competitions, with the FA Cup adding to previous triumphs in the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Premier League and EFL Cup.
The Anfield club had already been without Fabinho, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury in Tuesday's Premier League win at Aston Villa.
And then Wolves at the weekend to finish the Premier League season off and then the Champions League final.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is now two down, two to go, after a second cup final penalty shootout win against Chelsea this season saw Jurgen Klopp's team add the FA Cup to the Carabao Cup they lifted at Wembley three months ago.
- Report: Liverpool win FA Cup, beating Chelsea on penalties- WATCH: Tsimikas converts winning penalty for Liverpool (U.S.)- Video: Liverpool's Jordan Henderson lifts FA Cup at WembleyHistory tends not to remember the losers, and Chelsea's failure to win again will quickly be drowned out by a red tide of Liverpool plaudits.
Even if they win nothing else this season, Liverpool have already achieved a domestic cup double, a feat they last pulled off in 2001, and that year, they also won a major European trophy by beating Spanish club Alaves to win the UEFA Cup.
And that is the biggest problem now facing Liverpool in their quadruple quest: do they have enough time to play, win and recover before their next challenge?
Yet they might also be needed at Southampton and, if Liverpool win that game, at home to Wolves on the final of the season next Sunday.

     Summary: Liverpool and Chelsea have met four times this season and four times they have drawn.
But in each of the two cup finals, Liverpool has prevailed in penalty shootouts.
The Reds have yet another a taste of glory and may enjoy more; Chelsea has nothing.
150 years since the first FA Cup final, this was a day of history: the first ever 0â€“0 draw in a FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium (although the fifth in total) and the first ever Wembley FA Cup final penalty shootout (although the third overall).
There must be doubts about the fitness of both for the remaining two games of the league season and also for the Champions League final against Real Madrid in a fortnight.

     Diaz dazzles for triumphant Liverpool as Lukaku labours â€” How the FA Cup final was won and lost
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WEMBLEY STADIUM, LONDON â€” Liverpool dished out a repeat dose of Wembley penalty heartache to Chelsea as they added the FA Cup to this season's EFL Cup with a 6-5 shoot-out triumph.
Jota came up with a surprisingly lax finish on the end of a Naby Keita pass with an hour played.
The France international's best moment came early in extra time when he completed an inch-perfect tackle on the marauding Diaz.
However, Chelsea's continued compulsion to go long to Lukaku when under pressure persistently undermined their ability to build attacks.
Indeed, the most impressive last-ditch defending in the Reds' box came from Alexander-Arnold â€” so often maligned in those terms.
