A law enforcement official said investigators were reviewing a manifesto believed to have been posted online by Mr. Gendron.
“It was a straight up racially motivated hate crime,” John Garcia, the Erie County sheriff, said at a news conference Saturday evening.
But Mr. Gendron was wearing heavy metal plating; he killed the guard and continued into the store, firing on shoppers and employees.
Officials said the camera that the gunman wore was used to broadcast the attack live on Twitch, a livestreaming site owned by Amazon that is popular with gamers.
