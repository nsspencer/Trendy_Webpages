     Liverpool Defeats Chelsea in 2022 Emirates FA Cup Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool has officially claimed victory over Chelsea in the 2022 Emirates FA Cup final, and from a shootout nonetheless.
Similar to their League Cup final penalty shootout win over Chelsea, the Reds reigned victorious again.
Fireworks and confetti erupted inside Wembley Stadium Saturday as Liverpool soared with a 6-5 aggregate score against their counterparts Chelsea, deeming them the winner of the 2022 FA Cup.
This is Liverpool’s first FA Cup victory since 2006 when they defeated West Ham.
The Reds have won 19 League titles, seven FA Cups, a record nine League Cups, as well as 15 FA Community Shields.

     Jordan Henderson Becomes First Liverpool Captain to Lift Six Different Trophies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Jordan Henderson became Liverpool’s captain in 2015, he took on the difficult responsibility at a club that had won just one one major trophy since 2010.
And for Henderson, it was an opportunity for the midfielder to lift his sixth trophy as the club’s captain, becoming the first Liverpool captain to do so.
Henderson, who joined Liverpool in 2011, has captained teams that have won the Champions League, Premier League, EFL Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in addition to Saturday’s FA Cup win at Wembley Stadium in London.
“It’s a big moment for us, we haven’t been in this final for some time so to win it was special,” Henderson said.
While Henderson and Liverpool will celebrate the win, three pivotal matches remain, including the Champions League final at end of May and two Premier League matches in hopes of overtaking Manchester City’s three-point cushion atop the league table.

     Record-Setting Liverpool Captain Jordan Henderson On "Special" FA Cup Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Henderson made Liverpool Football Club history at Wembley Stadium as his side beat Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final.
Liverpool's victory, which came 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match had ended 0-0, saw them win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006.
Those six trophies have all come in six different competitions, with the FA Cup adding to previous triumphs in the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Premier League and EFL Cup.
The Anfield club had already been without Fabinho, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury in Tuesday's Premier League win at Aston Villa.
And then Wolves at the weekend to finish the Premier League season off and then the Champions League final.

     Summary: Jurgen Klopp labelled his Liverpool side “mentality monsters” after they defeated Chelsea in the FA Cup final.
Liverpool won their second cup final penalty shootout of the season against Chelsea by replicating February's League Cup victory in the FA Cup.
And Klopp was full of praise for his players after he won the FA Cup for the first time — adding to the Premier League, Champions League, League Cup, Super Cup and Club World Cup he had already won at Anfield.
We are mentality monsters but there were mentality monsters in Chelsea colours as well — it was one penalty.
“Like in the last final, the League Cup, no regrets.

     Summary: Add soccer’s FA Cup to the collection.
A 6-5 victory over Chelsea on penalties in Saturday’s final in London produced Liverpool’s first FA Cup triumph since 2006 and kept it in contention for, potentially if unlikely, a quadruple of trophies.
Just like in the League Cup final in February, the FA Cup showpiece ended 0-0 through 120 minutes before Liverpool prevailed again.
This time, the Reds were helped by Chelsea midfielder Mason Mason’s penalty being saved before Konstantinos Tsimikas clinched the shootout win with his first-ever goal for the club.
In two weeks, Liverpool will be hoping to win the Champions League final against Real Madrid.

Just as in the League Cup final, a scoreless 120 minutes belied the quality of the match.
Liverpool fans can celebrate a first FA Cup triumph since 2006.
Once again Chelsea, still under UK government sanctions, suffered the cruelest of defeats, becoming the first team to lose three consecutive FA Cup finals.

     Summary: This also makes Chelsea the first club ever to lose three straight FA Cup finals.
It's another victory for Jurgen Klopp over Thomas Tuchel as well, after Liverpool bested Chelsea on penalties in the EFL Cup final in February.
And it's also Chelsea's third straight FA Cup final loss, a record in the 150 year history of the competition.
First he needed to distance himself from his agent on Friday after comments about transfer rumors, and then he only touched the ball 15 times in the FA Cup final on Saturday.
But, as the Champions League final is the more likely prize, rotation could be incoming as Klopp looks to protect his players.
