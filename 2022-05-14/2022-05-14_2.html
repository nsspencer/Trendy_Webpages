     Sidney Crosby Practices with Penguins Ahead of Game 7 vs. Rangers; Injury Status TBD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesPittsburgh Penguins captain and center Sidney Crosby practiced with the team Saturday after missing part of Game 5 and all of Game 6 of his team's first-round playoff series against the New York Rangers, per The Athletic.
The Pens and Blueshirts will play the series-deciding Game 7 on Sunday at 7 p.m.
The Rangers trailed 2-0 in Game 5 when Crosby was injured.
They've since outscored Pittsburgh 10-6 (5-3 wins in Games 5 and 6) to knot the series at three games apiece.
Naturally, Crosby's return to practice is a welcoming sign with the Penguins' season now on the line.

     The Penguins’ hopes boil down to Tristan Jarry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Who is your favorite third string goalie to lead his team to the Stanley Cup?
Hell, who’s the best third string goalie to win a whole NHL playoff series?
Unfortunately for Domingue and the Penguins, the health and time needed to get Tristan Jarry back has not allowed for a quick conclusion to the feel good story.
Simply hoping for the best is never an ideal strategy, but it beats playing a third string goalie, which will likely yield predictable results after a while.
Coming into the series, not too many people liked the Pens’ chances, even if they had Jarry (..and Crosby...and Dumoulin..and Rickard Rakell).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So much to look for at the Pittsburgh Penguins practice Saturday.
How about this: Sidney Crosby was on the ice, and he was not wearing a non-contact jersey.
Goaltender Tristan Jarry was the first player on the ice and continues to look as if his return could be imminent.
Also on the ice for the optional practice was winger Rickard Rakell, who left Game 1 after a hit by the Rangers’ Ryan Lindgren.
Sullivan listed Crosby, Jarry and Rakell as day to day.

     Penguins Issues Are Fixable in Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Penguins lost 5-3 in Game 6, forcing a Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.
In both games, the Penguins came out of the gates with an effective game plan that put them in the lead 2-0.
The first periods of Game 5 and Game 6 provided a road map to victory for the Penguins.
It may be as simple as Domingue not being confident in his high blocker side, but it cost the Penguins in Game 6.
That is something the Penguins were unable to do after he left the second period in Game 5 and the entire second period in Game 6.

     Summary: Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, goaltender Tristan Jarry and forward Rikard Rakell all participated in an optional team practice on Saturday, but remain day-to-day ahead of Sunday's Game 7 against the New York Rangers, according to head coach Mike Sullivan.
Crosby missed Pittsburgh's 5-3 Game 6 loss to New York on Friday, while Jarry has been out due to breaking his foot on April 14, and Rakell has been out since Game 1.
They're making progress," said Sullivan, who later added that everyone on the team would travel to New York for Game 7.
Penguins defenceman Brian Dumoulin, who has also been out since Game 1, is progressing off the ice.
The Penguins visit the Rangers in a do-or-die Game 7 Sunday night on Sportsnet and SN NOW.

     Summary: CROSBY SKATES; SO DO JARRY AND RAKELLAfter a heartbreaking loss last night in Game 6, the city of Pittsburgh got some much-needed good news this afternoon as Sidney Crosby was back on the ice with his teammates.
"But I think any time he's on the ice, I think it's good for our team, it's good for our players, it's good for our morale.
"They're obviously on the ice, that's encouraging.
Forward Brian Boyle, who left in the first period of Game 6 with a lower-body injury, is continuing to be evaluated.
"There's highs and lows, there's ups and downs, there's successes and disappointments," Sullivan said.
