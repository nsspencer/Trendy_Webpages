     Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby, Tristan Jarry, Rickard Rakell skate during optional practice; no word on Game 7 status

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mika Zibanejad's shot is stopped, but Chris Kreider pounces on the rebound to hand the Rangers a lead.
(0:45)Sidney Crosby, who did not play in a Game 6 loss to the New York Rangers, skated with the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday, coach Mike Sullivan said.
Sources told ESPN on Friday that Crosby was held out of the 5-3 loss with a concussion.
The Penguins have said only that he suffered an upper-body injury after taking a high hit from Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba in Game 5 on Wednesday.
Sullivan did tell reporters that all players would be traveling to New York for Game 7 on Sunday.

     Summary: So much to look for at the Pittsburgh Penguins practice Saturday.
How about this: Sidney Crosby was on the ice, and he was not wearing a non-contact jersey.
Goaltender Tristan Jarry was the first player on the ice and continues to look as if his return could be imminent.
Also on the ice for the optional practice was winger Rickard Rakell, who left Game 1 after a hit by the Rangers’ Ryan Lindgren.
Sullivan listed Crosby, Jarry and Rakell as day to day.

     The Penguins’ hopes boil down to Tristan Jarry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Who is your favorite third string goalie to lead his team to the Stanley Cup?
Hell, who’s the best third string goalie to win a whole NHL playoff series?
Unfortunately for Domingue and the Penguins, the health and time needed to get Tristan Jarry back has not allowed for a quick conclusion to the feel good story.
Simply hoping for the best is never an ideal strategy, but it beats playing a third string goalie, which will likely yield predictable results after a while.
Coming into the series, not too many people liked the Pens’ chances, even if they had Jarry (..and Crosby...and Dumoulin..and Rickard Rakell).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Penguins lost 5-3 in Game 6, forcing a Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.
In both games, the Penguins came out of the gates with an effective game plan that put them in the lead 2-0.
The first periods of Game 5 and Game 6 provided a road map to victory for the Penguins.
It may be as simple as Domingue not being confident in his high blocker side, but it cost the Penguins in Game 6.
That is something the Penguins were unable to do after he left the second period in Game 5 and the entire second period in Game 6.

Crosby missed Pittsburgh's 5-3 Game 6 loss to New York on Friday, while Jarry has been out due to breaking his foot on April 14, and Rakell has been out since Game 1.
They're making progress," said Sullivan, who later added that everyone on the team would travel to New York for Game 7.
Penguins defenceman Brian Dumoulin, who has also been out since Game 1, is progressing off the ice.
The Penguins visit the Rangers in a do-or-die Game 7 Sunday night on Sportsnet and SN NOW.
