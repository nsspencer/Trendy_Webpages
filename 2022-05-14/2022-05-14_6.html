     Summary: Ukraine has won the 66th Eurovision song contest, which was held on Saturday evening in Turin in Italy.
“Please help Ukraine, Mariupol.
Help Azovstal right now,” lead singer Oleh Psiuk shouted from the front of the stage after the band had performed.

This will always stand as a victory at Eurovision; but it means so much more.

     Eurovision 2022 Final—Russian Hackers Say They Can Stop Ukraine Kalush Orchestra Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra is favorite to win the Eurovision 2022 final AFP via Getty ImagesThe same Russian threat actors that this week targeted Italian parliamentary and military websites and threatened to disrupt U.K. National Health Service (NHS) services, could now have the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 final in their crosshairs.
The Killnet threat group has threatened to “send 10 billion requests” to the Eurovision online voting system and “add votes to some other country.”What is Killnet?
Killnet threatens to disrupt Eurovision 2022 final votingIn an apparent attempt to prevent or disrupt the online voting for current Eurovision favorites from Ukraine, the Kalush Orchestra, Killnet has hinted it could target Eurovision servers.
Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine, and the Kalush Orchestra has stated that a win would be a morale booster for the people of Ukraine.
Bizarrely, the Killnet group seems to be distancing itself from those threats to the Eurovision final in the same message that it makes them.
