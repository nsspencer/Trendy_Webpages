     Eurovision 2022 Odds and Predictions—Will Ukraine Be Crowned Winners?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine are favorites to win the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest in Turin, Italy on Saturday as the country's forces continue to resist an invasion by neighboring Russia.
Irish bookmakers Paddy Power is offering odds of 1/3 on a Ukrainian Eurovision victory.
A Paddy Power spokesperson told Newsweek the odds of Ukraine winning a record number of points are 1/2.
The Eurovision Song Contest — commonly called Eurovision — has been running since 1956 and is often seen as a major spectacle known for unusual musical choices, over-the-top outfits and complex performances.
It remains to be seen if the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest will be held in Ukraine.

     Eurovision 2022 Final—Russian Hackers Say They Can Stop Ukraine Kalush Orchestra Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra is favorite to win the Eurovision 2022 final AFP via Getty ImagesThe same Russian threat actors that this week targeted Italian parliamentary and military websites and threatened to disrupt U.K. National Health Service (NHS) services, could now have the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 final in their crosshairs.
The Killnet threat group has threatened to “send 10 billion requests” to the Eurovision online voting system and “add votes to some other country.”What is Killnet?
Killnet threatens to disrupt Eurovision 2022 final votingIn an apparent attempt to prevent or disrupt the online voting for current Eurovision favorites from Ukraine, the Kalush Orchestra, Killnet has hinted it could target Eurovision servers.
Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine, and the Kalush Orchestra has stated that a win would be a morale booster for the people of Ukraine.
Bizarrely, the Killnet group seems to be distancing itself from those threats to the Eurovision final in the same message that it makes them.

     Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra the favorite to win Eurovision Song Contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN) It tells you plenty about the Eurovision Song Contest that Norway's participants -- two grown men in wolf costumes who sing about bananas and the imminent consumption of their grandparents -- are flying relatively under the radar this year.
The continent's garish and much-loved singing competition returns in Turin, Italy on Saturday, but only one group is commanding the spotlight in the build-up: Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra.
But getting Kalush Orchestra to the Eurovision stage took some doing, and their journey is deeply interwoven with the war at home.
"All members of the group are somehow involved in the defense of the country," Psyuk told CNN via email.
But winning would be uniquely significant for Kalush Orchestra, and it's hard to imagine a more popular victor in the tournament's history.
