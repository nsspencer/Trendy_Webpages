     Udonis Haslem discloses how Florida Panthers’ ‘exciting’ playoff run has ‘captivated my attention’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Miami Heat veteran Udonis Haslem’s main focus is now the Heat’s efforts in the postseason, he’s also expressing enthusiasm for the playoff run of the NHL’s Florida Panthers.
“It’s exciting, really exciting,” Haslem said.
One of the reasons for Haslem’s enthusiasm about the Panthers is his friendship with Panthers forward Anthony Duclair.
While Haslem is keeping an eye on the Panthers, he’s zeroing in on the Heat’s own playoff run.
Haslem has been a part of all three of the Heat’s NBA titles.

     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostWASHINGTON, D.C. — For the first time since 1996, the Florida Panthers have won a playoff series.
On the back of the heroics of Carter Verhaeghe for a third straight game, the Panthers ousted the Washington Capitals Friday night with a 4-3 overtime win to take the first-round series in six games.

     Panthers find their mojo to beat Capitals, reach 2nd round

     Summary: Florida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov is congratulated for his goal against the Washington Capitals during the third period of Game 6 of a first-round NHL hockey Stanley Cup playoff series Friday, May 13, 2022, in Washington.
(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) APWhen the Florida Panthers faced their first real adversity of the season trailing their playoff series against the Washington Capitals, players held a meeting to set things straight.
Initial nerves at home early in the series faded when Florida started to feel the pressure.
Then the Panthers started to look and play like themselves and moved on to face the winner of the series between the back-to-back Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning and Toronto Maple Leafs.
No team scored as many goals as the Panthers during the regular season — a rate of 4.11 a game not seen since Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh Penguins.

     Lomberg: Florida Panthers ‘heartbeat’ helps in Game 6 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C. — Florida Panthers coach Andrew Brunette made a pivotal coaching decision ahead of a crucial Game 6 matchup with the Washington Capitals on Friday.
In came Ryan Lomberg, the Panthers’ resident fourth-line grinder who usually provides the team with a spark of energy.
Lomberg found watching Games 2-5 after Noel Acciari was put in and did not come out.
Nic Dowd had just put the Capitals up a goal and had seemingly taken the energy out of a Panthers team that held off their brigade of 26 hits in the first period.
He brought energy, he brought speed, he brought tenacity on pucks, all the things that he has done for us all year.

     Florida Panthers win first playoff series since 1996

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The forward — the hero of Florida’s first-round playoff series with Washington and a game-time decision — scored 2:46 into overtime and the Panthers beat the Capitals 4-3 to win the series in Game 6 on Friday night.
Florida got its first playoff series victory since 1996, when it reached the Stanley Cup final, ending the NHL’s record longest playoff drought between series wins, just short of 26 years, since June 1, 1996.
The Maple Leafs now own the longest active drought between playoff series wins, 18 years.
“It means a lot,” Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov said of ending the drought.
The Capitals have not won a playoff series since hoisting the Cup in 2018 and got knocked out in the first round at home for the third time in that span.

     ‘They put a lot of pressure on themselves,’ but Panthers finally get playoff validation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WHO ELSE BUT CARTER VERHAEGHEUNREAL pic.twitter.com/pyMWyzhd8J — Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) May 14, 2022In the series, Barkov led the Panthers with 22 shots on goal and was tied for the best plus-minus among forwards, scoring two goals and adding four assists.
“They put a lot of pressure on themselves — probably too much,” Brunette said.
Even after Brunette coached in the 2022 NHL All-Star Game and guided the Panthers to their first Presidents’ Trophy, Zito never removed the interim tag.
Nine of the 12 Panthers to score multiple points in the series were acquired by Zito in his less-than-two years as GM.
A year later, he’s a reason Florida can win it all and a run like this was exactly why the Panthers wanted him.

     Recap: Panthers shed wizened monkey with 4-3 overtime win over Capitals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Panthers applying a heavy forecheck, Ben Chiarot threw the puck down low to Claude Giroux and he found Verhaeghe in the slot.
After Gustav Forsling missed the net, Verhaeghe teed up Weegar for a slap shot that Samsonov stopped.
Giroux dug out the rebound and sent it left to Barkov, who easily found the yawning net for his second postseason goal.
Not sure why Claude Giroux wasn’t named Second Star instead of Aleksander Barkov, but it doesn’t really matter.
Giroux scored a goal, added two primary helpers, was credited with three hits and went +2 in a standout performance.
