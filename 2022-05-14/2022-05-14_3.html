     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostWASHINGTON, D.C. — For the first time since 1996, the Florida Panthers have won a playoff series.
On the back of the heroics of Carter Verhaeghe for a third straight game, the Panthers ousted the Washington Capitals Friday night with a 4-3 overtime win to take the first-round series in six games.
He brought energy, he brought speed, he brought tenacity on pucks, all the things that he has done for us all year.
It happened again when Oshie tied the game to send Game 6 to overtime.
The Panthers were 1:03 away from ending their 26-year playoff drought and saw the lead snatched from their hands.

     Panthers find their mojo to beat Capitals, reach 2nd round

     Summary: Florida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov is congratulated for his goal against the Washington Capitals during the third period of Game 6 of a first-round NHL hockey Stanley Cup playoff series Friday, May 13, 2022, in Washington.
(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) APWhen the Florida Panthers faced their first real adversity of the season trailing their playoff series against the Washington Capitals, players held a meeting to set things straight.
Initial nerves at home early in the series faded when Florida started to feel the pressure.
Then the Panthers started to look and play like themselves and moved on to face the winner of the series between the back-to-back Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning and Toronto Maple Leafs.
No team scored as many goals as the Panthers during the regular season — a rate of 4.11 a game not seen since Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh Penguins.

     Florida Panthers win first playoff series since 1996
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The forward — the hero of Florida’s first-round playoff series with Washington and a game-time decision — scored 2:46 into overtime and the Panthers beat the Capitals 4-3 to win the series in Game 6 on Friday night.
Florida got its first playoff series victory since 1996, when it reached the Stanley Cup final, ending the NHL’s record longest playoff drought between series wins, just short of 26 years, since June 1, 1996.
The Maple Leafs now own the longest active drought between playoff series wins, 18 years.
“It means a lot,” Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov said of ending the drought.
The Capitals have not won a playoff series since hoisting the Cup in 2018 and got knocked out in the first round at home for the third time in that span.
