Coach Sullivan on the status of Crosby, Jarry, and Rakell for tomorrow: “We’ll take each day as it comes.
They’re making progress.” pic.twitter.com/FgaHcDLxju — Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) May 14, 2022As Sullivan also mentioned, Brian Boyle was not on the ice.
With that, the Pens took off for New York for the game to decide the future of their season.

     Sidney Crosby injury update: Penguins captain returns to practice, status for Game 7 vs. Rangers unknown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby returned to practice on Saturday after missing Game 6 of their first-round playoff series against the New York Rangers, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Crosby's return to practice shortly after suffering a concussion in Game 5 was a positive sign for Pittsburgh but Crosby's status for Game 7 on Sunday remains uncertain.
Although Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan was non-committal on Crosby's status for Sunday, Crosby is said to be in "good spirits" and will travel with the team to New York.
In addition, Crosby is also the very sort of player who thrives in Game 7 scenarios.
In seven career Game 7s, Crosby has two goals and three assists.

     Summary: So much to look for at the Pittsburgh Penguins practice Saturday.
How about this: Sidney Crosby was on the ice, and he was not wearing a non-contact jersey.

Also on the ice for the optional practice was winger Rickard Rakell, who left Game 1 after a hit by the Rangers’ Ryan Lindgren.
Sullivan listed Crosby, Jarry and Rakell as day to day.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Penguins lost 5-3 in Game 6, forcing a Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.
In both games, the Penguins came out of the gates with an effective game plan that put them in the lead 2-0.
The first periods of Game 5 and Game 6 provided a road map to victory for the Penguins.
It may be as simple as Domingue not being confident in his high blocker side, but it cost the Penguins in Game 6.
That is something the Penguins were unable to do after he left the second period in Game 5 and the entire second period in Game 6.

     Summary: CROSBY SKATES; SO DO JARRY AND RAKELLAfter a heartbreaking loss last night in Game 6, the city of Pittsburgh got some much-needed good news this afternoon as Sidney Crosby was back on the ice with his teammates.
"But I think any time he's on the ice, I think it's good for our team, it's good for our players, it's good for our morale.
"They're obviously on the ice, that's encouraging.
Forward Brian Boyle, who left in the first period of Game 6 with a lower-body injury, is continuing to be evaluated.
"There's highs and lows, there's ups and downs, there's successes and disappointments," Sullivan said.
