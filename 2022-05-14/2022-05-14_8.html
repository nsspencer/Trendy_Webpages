     Clarence Thomas: “Tremendously bad” Supreme Court leak shatters public trust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The unprecedented leaked draft, first published by Politico, insinuated that the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, a decision that would make abortion immediately illegal in several states.
"There was such a belief in the rule of law, belief in the court, a belief in what we were doing, that that was verboten.
"You would never visit Supreme Court Justice's houses when things didn't go our way.
The big picture: Chief Justice John Roberts, after confirming the authenticity of the draft document, called the leak "absolutely appalling" and that he hopes "one bad apple" doesn't change "people's perception" of the Supreme Court.
He said it did not represent the court's final decision and directed the court's marshal to open an investigation into the leaked draft.

     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — Justice Clarence Thomas says the Supreme Court has been changed by the shocking leak of a draft opinion earlier this month.
The conservative Thomas, who joined the court in 1991 and has long called for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, described the leak as an unthinkable breach of trust.
“When you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I’m in, it changes the institution fundamentally.
“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ houses when things didn’t go our way.
Protests at the Supreme Court and around the nation were planned for Saturday.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — Justice Clarence Thomas says the Supreme Court has been changed by the shocking leak of a draft opinion earlier this month.
The opinion suggests the court is poised to overturn the right to an abortion recognized nearly 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade.
The conservative Thomas, who joined the court in 1991 and has long called for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, described the leak as an unthinkable breach of trust.
“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ houses when things didn’t go our way.
“Well, I’m just worried about keeping it at the court now,” Thomas responded.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe leak of a draft opinion regarding abortion has turned the Supreme Court into a place “where you look over your shoulder,” Justice Clarence Thomas said Friday night, and it may have irreparably sundered trust at the institution.
Thomas, 73, said the leak has exposed the “fragile” nature of the court.
And when you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I’m in, it changes the institution fundamentally.

On the current court, Thomas is the least loyal to the doctrine.

     Clarence Thomas Decries ‘Irreparable Damage’ of Roe Leak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I do think that what happened at the Court is tremendously bad,” Thomas said.
“And you need to be concerned about that.”Thomas also criticized the left and demonstrations targeting the justices, insisting that conservatives “would never visit Supreme Court justices’ houses when things didn’t go our way.
When asked if conservatives were embodying the civility he preached, Thomas claimed that “they’ve never trashed a Supreme Court nominee.
Thomas also lamented how the Court, in its current makeup, was no longer as respectable and collegial as it once was.
It’s like kind of an infidelity, that you can explain it, but you can’t undo it.”Indeed, there are a lot of things Justice Thomas would like to undo.
