     Washington Capitals Report Card After Overtime Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth season in a row, the Washington Capitals have been eliminated in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
As long as captain Alex Ovechkin and forward Nicklas Backstrom are on the roster, a deep playoff run will be the expectation.
How should we grade the Capitals’ season?
As the playoffs began, and Washington drew the Presidents’ Trophy winners, the Florida Panthers, I gave them no chance.
I won’t give the Capitals a failing grade, because this was about my expectation for them.

     Summary: An empty net miss, a three goal lead, and a ping off the post.
The Caps took the lead at 1:37 on a deflection goal by Nicklas Backstrom off a shot from Justin Schultz.
The Caps had every opportunity to win Game 4 but Garnet Hathaway missed the empty net.
They had every opportunity to win Game 5 but they squandered a 3-0 lead against the most dangerous offensive team.
Even though this was a series the Caps fell short in, this isn’t a playoff exit to hang your heads over.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Capitals managed to take a 2-1 series lead in Game Three, but they could not close it out.
Despite having leads during the next three games, the Capitals lost Games Four, Five, and Six, and were first-rounded for the fourth consecutive season.
The Caps have not won a playoff series since 2018 when they won their only Stanley Cup in franchise history.
The first-pairing defenseman was on the ice for every Panthers’ goal (four) that was scored in the decisive Game Six.
Against the Florida Panthers, the Capitals were out-attempted in the series at five-on-five 56 percent to 44 percent, but the Capitals kept most of that offense to the outside.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadWhen the Washington Capitals look back at what went wrong during their first-round postseason series against the Florida Panthers, the errors should be pretty clear.
Washington was eliminated from the playoffs with a 4-3 overtime loss in Game 6 on Friday night.
Washington had a 2-1 third-period lead in Game 4, a 3-0 lead in the second period of Game 5 and a 2-1 third-period lead in Game 6.
“We were unable to capitalize on all those opportunities,” said winger T.J. Oshie, who led the Capitals with six postseason goals.
When it mattered most in the postseason, the Capitals came up short.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the end it was Carter Verhaeghe, and not Jonathan Huberdeau or Aleksander Barkov, that the Washington Capitals did not have an answer for in their First Round playoff series.
When he scored two minutes into overtime of Game 6 on Friday night, sending the Florida Panthers to the Second Round for the first time in 26 years, it also sent the Washington Capitals to their fourth consecutive First Round exit.
They may have been the eighth playoff team in the East, but they still finished with 100 points in a very tough division.
And that makes it easy to get sucked into the belief that better health and better goaltending could produce better results.
But it is not yet a cliff dive and it is clear this team can still be a playoff team, and a pretty good one.

     Capitals face questions after a fourth consecutive first-round exit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Caps face questions after fourth consecutive first-round exit originally appeared on NBC Sports WashingtonThe Capitals took a few moments to collect themselves before staggering onto the ice in front of a silent Capital One Arena and amidst a host of deliriously happy Florida Panthers.
“Well I think you see how we played against the best team in the regular season,” Alex Ovechkin said.
But the Capitals’ stars are almost all 30 years or older now and that has slowly become more of a story.
Still, four of the most central members to the Capitals (T.J. Oshie, Ovechkin, John Carlson and Backstrom) were older veterans and the team’s leading scorers in the postseason.
The night of Game 6, though, Oshie, Ovechkin, Carlson and Backstrom were 35, 36, 32 and 34 years old, respectively.
