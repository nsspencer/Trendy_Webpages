     Paige Spiranac Reacts To Latest Phil Mickelson Rumor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly 24 hours ago, the golfing world learned that Phil Mickelson will not be playing in the year's second major.
"We have just been informed that Phil Mickelson has withdrawn from the PGA Championship," the statement read.
It's unclear why Mickelson isn't participating, but one rumor suggests he's not playing his best golf.
"The San Diego rumor mill has Phil playing bad golf at local courses.
I’ve heard two recent rounds in the high-70s at The Farms, which factored into the pass on PGA," golf insider Matt Ginella said.

     Summary: Phil Mickelson will not defend his title at the PGA Championship this year amid fallout from his comments about Saudi Arabia and his links to the Saudi-funded rival golf league, the PGA of America announced Friday.
The organization was informed that Mickelson was withdrawing from the tournament even though the PGA welcomed his participation.
Mickelson becomes just the third PGA champion not to defend his title in the last 75 years.
GOLF LEGEND GREG NORMAN SEEMINGLY DISMISSES JAMAL KHASHOGGI’S MURDER: ‘WE’VE ALL MADE MISTAKES’"We have just been informed that Phil Mickelson has withdrawn from the PGA Championship," a PGA statement said.
"We have notified those who have applied that their request has been declined in accordance with the PGA Tour tournament regulations.

     Phil Mickelson's withdrawal from PGA Championship only produces more questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time in two months, a major championship in men’s golf is being overshadowed by who won’t play in the event.
A large part of the story at the Masters in April was Phil Mickelson didn’t play in the PGA Tour's first major of the year.
Maybe the rumors on social media are right, and Mickelson’s game just isn’t ready to be put on display at a major championship.
Even Walter Hagen didn’t defend his 1921 PGA title because he could make more money playing exhibitions than in the PGA.
And it robs the PGA of America of what could have been one of the great celebrations of its championship with a look back at Mickelson’s victory last year.

That request was denied by the PGA Tour earlier this week.
Rich Beem says he didn't see Phil Mickelson pulling out of the US PGA Championship but thinks there are more questions to be asked.
A statement from the PGA Championship organisers read: "We have just been informed that Phil Mickelson has withdrawn from the PGA Championship.
One former champion that will be playing at next week's PGA Championship is Tiger Woods.

     Summary: That Rich Beem makes no worse than a bogey at the 72nd hole ensures a surprise one-stoke victory over Tiger Woods.
Fred Funk looks on, bemused, as Woods bellows: “Yes.” Prompted to clarify his obscure outburst, Woods says: “That’s Rich Beem one, Phil Mickelson zero.”Lefty remained without a major title.
The scale of antipathy between Mickelson and Woods was illustrated by the latter’s strange display of emotion.
Yet Woods and Mickelson now sit on the opposite sides of the ongoing battle for hearts and minds.
Tiger v Phil, just like old times, but on a basis nobody could have anticipated.

     Phil Mickelson symbolises chaotic golf world and won’t defend PGA Championship title as Saudi scheme, greed and sportswashing cast shadow over Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But most importantly, this came amid rumblings of a Saudi-backed Super League led by Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments, bankrolled by the Public Investment Fund.
The PGA Tour and DP World Tour have blocked releases for players wishing to compete in the first event, putting most of the field at risk of fines, suspensions or other sanctions.
Perhaps he is unaware that LIV Golf have hired long-time PGA Tour official Slugger White to oversee their regulations – which will be the same as, erm, the PGA Tour.
The Premier Golf League – a separate scheme, initially backed by Saudi money but not anymore – has been screaming about these ideas for years.
It’s no surprise Mickelson will probably break his media silence at a LIV Golf event rather than the PGA Championship.
