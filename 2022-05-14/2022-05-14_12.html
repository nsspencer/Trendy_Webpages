     Five takeaways from the Calgary Flames’ Game 6 loss to the Dallas Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Calgary Flames had a chance to finish off their first round series with the Dallas Stars on Friday night.
Unfortunately, they didn’t close things out: Dallas won 4-2 to force a deciding Game 7 on Sunday night.
Dallas dominated at the (face-off) dotThe Flames won just 32% of their draws in Game 6, a series low.
Puck possession is the crux of Calgary’s game, and they were chasing a lot considering how many draws they lost.
The Flames were very unlucky to not score in the opening period, primarily due to Grand Theft Oettinger.

     Wild-Card Stars Force Game 7 Against Calgary With 4-2 Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miro Heiskanen scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period and the Stars recovered after blowing an early two-goal lead, beating the Calgary Flames 4-2 on Friday night to force a deciding Game 7 in their first-round Western Conference series.
That came with 2:28 left in the second period, in which both teams scored twice.
Jake Oettinger, their 23-year-old goalie who had never started a playoff game before this series, stopped 36 shots.
It’s a tight game but I’d say that 3-2 goal late in the second was tough,” Flames center Elias Lindholm said.
GAME 7 HISTORYCalgary is 5-7 in Game 7s, but has lost six of the last seven it has played.

Get swept up in the emotion, and you might forget that the purpose is to win the game.

History tells us there is nothing in sports quite like seventh games.
For the Mavericks and Suns, it would be fascinating if we just get a close game.
The loser has avoided double-digit defeats only twice in six games and the closest game was Dallas losing by seven points in Game 1.
The last two contests have been a 30-point Suns win and a 27-point Mavericks’ victory in response.

     Calgary Flames Darryl Sutter Game 7 savvy Dallas Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 'Pressure is a good thing': Sutter doesn't want Flames to shy away from Game 7 stageCALGARY — Most Calgary Flames players lack Game 7 experience in the NHL playoffs, but their coach doesn't.
Darryl Sutter owns the best all-time record among NHL head coaches at 7-3 in best-of-seven series that reach a Game 7 finale.
His 11th Game 7 will come Sunday when the Flames and Dallas Stars close out their conference quarterfinal at the Saddledome.
Stars coach Rick Bowman said the forward passed concussion protocol, and a lower-body injury kept him on the bench in the third.
When it comes to the pressure of a Game 7, Sutter embraces standing in the eye of the hockey hurricane.
