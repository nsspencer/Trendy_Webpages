     Former Australian cricket icon Andrew Symonds dies at the age of 46
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Former Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds has died at the age of 46, Cricket Australia announced Sunday.
Queensland Police say they are investigating a fatal single-vehicle crash in Hervey Range, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Townsville.
Emergency services attending the crash had tried to revive Symonds, but he died from his injuries.
Symonds played 26 test matches for Australia between 2004 and 2008, as well as 198 one-day internationals and 14 Twenty20 internationals.
"The club is shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of former overseas star and cult hero, Andrew Symonds," the star's former club, Kent Cricket, said on Twitter.

     Former Test Cricketer Andrew Symonds Dies in Auto Accident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Australian test cricketer Andrew Symonds has died after a single-vehicle auto accident near Townsville in northeast Australia.
Cricket Australia reported Symonds' death on its website on Sunday, citing a police statement with details of the accident late Saturday night.
Symonds played 26 test matches for Australia and posted two centuries, but he was better known as a limited-overs specialist.
With dreadlocks and his face daubed with zinc cream, Symonds always cut a flamboyant figure in the Australian team.
His loss is another bitter blow for Australian cricket after the death in Thailand in March of legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne.
