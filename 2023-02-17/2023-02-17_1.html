     Sen. John Fetterman has checked himself into the hospital for clinical depression
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., "checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression" on Wednesday night, his chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, said Thursday.
"While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks," Jentleson said.
Fetterman suffered a stroke last year before he won the Pennsylvania Senate race in a highly competitive contest.
“Post-stroke depression is very, very common,” said Dr. Lee Schwamm, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who is not involved with Fetterman’s care.
And his fellow senator from Pennsylvania, Democrat Bob Casey, said he's "proud" of Fetterman "for getting the help he needs."
