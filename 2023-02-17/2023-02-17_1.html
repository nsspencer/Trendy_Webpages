     Senator John Fetterman Gets Treatment for Depression: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Share on Pinterest Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Senator John Fetterman has checked himself into a hospital for clinical depression, according to his staff.
Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman checked himself into a Washington, D.C., hospital “to receive treatment for clinical depression,” his chief of staff announced February 16.
While the statement from Fetterman’s office didn’t indicate whether his depression was related to his stroke, depression is a common experience for stroke survivors.
Depression after a stroke can also increase a person’s risk of dying, according to the statement.
A stroke also causes structural, electrical or biochemical changes in the brain that may increase a person’s risk of developing depression.
