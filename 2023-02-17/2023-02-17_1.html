     PGA Tour secures major victory in antitrust case against LIV Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late last month, the tour sought to add PIF and Al-Rumayyan to the suit, with the motion arguing that LIV is the end result of a “long-contrived plan” to take over professional golf as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which Golf Digest has detailed here.
The PIF is the primary backer of LIV, and documents the PGA Tour obtained in discovery in December allege that PIF and Al-Rumayyan were “instrumental in inducing players to breach their tour contracts.” The tour argues Al-Rumayyan personally recruited players, “played an active role in contract negotiations, and expressly approved each of the player contracts—all while knowing that these deals would interfere with the players’ tour contracts.”

     Judge Upholds PGA Tour’s Subpoenas for PIF, Al-Rumayyan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen ruled that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and PIF’s governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, are subject to subpoena requests from the PGA Tour.
According to the order, the PGA Tour’s subpoenas related depositions of Al-Rumayyan and other PIF officials will have to be re-served.
The PGA Tour had already sought a delay in the trial that is currently set to commence in January 2024.
Last month, the PGA Tour requested to add PIF and Al-Rumayyan as co-defendants to a countersuit filed against LIV Golf.
In the fling, PGA Tour attorneys claimed “PIF and Mr. Al-Rumayyan played an active and central role in orchestrating” breaches to contracts the PGA Tour had with golfers to lure them to LIV Golf.

     Judge rules PGA Tour can depose Saudi backers of LIV Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge has ruled the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the financial backer of LIV Golf, must sit for depositions and produce documents in LIV Golf’s antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.
LIV Golf has accused the PGA Tour of using monopolistic powers to squash competition.
The offseason for LIV Golf included a television contract with The CW, giving its tournament a broadcast partner for U.S. markets.
Majed Al Sorour, the CEO of Golf Saudi and managing director of LIV Golf, was transitioned out of that role last month.
LIV Golf has announced the addition of two more players for the second season — Mito Pereira of Chile, who is No.

     Summary: Dustin Johnson hits from the tee during a LIV Golf event.
A federal judge has ruled that LIV Golf’s financial backer, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and its governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan , aren’t entitled to sovereign immunity and must turn over information connected with the upstart circuit’s courtroom battle with the PGA Tour.
The PIF and Al-Rumayyan had argued that there was no court in the U.S. with jurisdiction over them, saying they were shielded because they are part of a foreign government.

     LIV Golf's anti-trust lawsuit against PGA Tour handed severe blow in federal court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a second season of LIV Golf just days from the starting line, a federal judge has dealt a blow to the group that financially supports the upstart league, one that could radically change the fledgling circuit’s anti-trust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.
However, officials for the Saudi-run firm have insisted they only have high-level oversight over LIV Golf and don’t deal with day-to-day operations.
But Thursday’s filing stated that PIF and LIV are too entangled to separate them for legal purposes.
LIV Golf attorneys have already filed an appeal to Thursday’s ruling.
LIV Golf has long been criticized as a way for the Kingdom to sportswash its human rights record with guaranteed money and multi-million dollar deals.
