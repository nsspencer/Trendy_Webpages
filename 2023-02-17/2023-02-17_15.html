     Sixers' Mac McClung performs well in Rising Stars challenge in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Philadelphia 76ers will have their main guy at All-Star weekend on Sunday in Joel Embiid, although there’s no guarantee he plays in the game itself, they have another representative in Utah.
Mac McClung, who is with the Sixers on a two-way deal, was a part of Team Jason led by NBA champion Jason Terry in the Rising Stars challenge on Friday night to kick off the weekend.
McClung has been with the team’s G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats, on the season.
McClung also did show off some athleticism that should excite some about his participation in the dunk contest on Saturday.
McClung will be looking to make a name for himself at the slam dunk contest and then look to eventually earn some time with the Sixers out on the floor after the All-Star break.
