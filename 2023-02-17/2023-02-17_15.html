     'The Marvels' Go Higher, Further, Faster in New Poster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As we all know, the upcoming female-led MCU feature, The Marvels, was initially scheduled for a July 28 theatrical release.
To make up for the delay, Marvel has released the upcoming film's first poster, showing Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) teaming up with Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) and Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau), bearing a tagline that states, "Higher.
The poster also showcases Captain Marvel's suit in the Ms. Marvel finale post-credits scene, in which Kamala takes her place.
Though there aren't any materials yet showing the three in one clip, the poster features Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeu together for the first time, with Captain Marvel's original "Higher.
Parris made her MCU debut as Monica Rambeau in WandaVision, where she gained powers while trying to enter a Scarlet Witch-controlled town.

     Moving ‘The Marvels’ to November Lets Disney Get Out of Its Own Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney and Marvel have bumped back the release of “The Marvels,” the direct sequel to both “Captain Marvel” and the series “Ms.
As a result, they’ve moved up “Haunted Mansion” a few weeks into the open slot slot; that film was originally scheduled to debut August 11.
Rather, the shift makes sense for both “The Marvels” and “Haunted Mansion” for a few reasons.
The trade-off in terms of what other films “The Marvels” is competing against at the box office might be a wash.
Also appealing: given Disney’s current rollout of new films to Disney+, “Haunted Mansion” should hit Disney+ right around Halloween, exactly when “Hocus Pocus 2” made a killing on the service.

     ‘The Marvels’ Shifts Release Date From Summer to Fall 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney’s “Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien, now slides into the July slot, from its previously announced Aug. 11 release date.
The post-credits scene for that series sets up the events of “The Marvels,” with Larson making a cameo.
In addition to the return of the scene-stealing Flerken Goose, the footage also showed Captain Rambeau as an astronaut at Saber Space Station with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).
When her character approaches a jump point perimeter, she hits it and transforms into (surprise) Ms. Marvel.
“To me, it’s only akin to the first ‘Avengers’ movie and seeing the six of them together in a frame.
