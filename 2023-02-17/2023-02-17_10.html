The Phils avoided arbitration with Alvarado by agreeing to a one-year, $3.45 million deal last week.
This season would have been Alvarado's final year under contract if not for the extension.
The Phillies don't get to the World Series without Alvarado last season.
The Phils have a deep bullpen for 2023 with Alvarado, Dominguez, Soto, Craig Kimbrel, Matt Strahm, Andrew Bellatti and Connor Brogdon.
