     RUMOR: Russell Westbrook joined by Patrick Beverley on Clippers’ shortlist, but there’s a big catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At this point, however, these two could be vying for the same thing as the Los Angeles Clippers have reportedly registered interest in signing either of these two veterans as a free-agent addition.
Westbrook, on the other hand, seems to be headed in the same direction as well with the Utah Jazz.
For now, those check-ins appear to be more about diligence than imminence, with the Clippers seen as being patient before a move, if any, materializes.
Skepticism remains that any available guard would be seen as an upgrade from the options already on the roster,” Greif wrote.
Just imagine how the Lakers would look if coach Lue is able to get the best out of Russ with the Clippers.

     Summary: “It’s just having an identity, having an identity when that ball goes up, what team you’re going to get on a nightly basis,” George said.
So we got to have an identity that carries us through that long stretch.”George’s comment that the Clippers have “everything we need” is a notable change in tone.
The team’s discussions with buyout candidates for their backcourt had maintained scrutiny on the current Clippers’ ball movement and passing.
Against the Warriors and Suns combined, the Clippers averaged 299 passes, 24 more than their season average.
Now the question remains whether the Clippers will resume their schedule by getting off on the right foot.

George already took the extra step prior to the Clippers meeting with Westbrook to publicly vouch for his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.
His first two games with the Clippers were the first time this season that he did not play 18 minutes in a game.
But the way the Clippers beat Phoenix 116-107 on Thursday gave LA the momentum it craved heading into All-Star break.
