     Summary: The NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Salt Lake City just wrapped up, with Dwyane Wade’s team besting Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith’s group in an 81-78 thriller that featured a standout performance by Seattle Seahawks wide receiver and all-around athletic marvel DK Metcalf.
Not in DK Metcalf's house ⛔️ pic.twitter.com/nYajzhx9EF — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) February 18, 2023The biggest moment came in crunch time, when Metcalf blocked actor Sinqua Walls and then took off the other way for the throwdown.
Earlier in the 4th quarter, Metcalf blocked a three-point try by actor Everett Osborne, then on the fastbreak raced down the court and finished with the reverse lay-up.
Metcalf won the game’s MVP award, racking up 20 points on 9/16 shooting, to go along with 10 rebounds and 4 blocks.
If the Sonics return to the NBA any time soon, DK may have a roster spot already reserved.
