     PGA Tour secures major victory in antitrust case against LIV Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late last month, the tour sought to add PIF and Al-Rumayyan to the suit, with the motion arguing that LIV is the end result of a “long-contrived plan” to take over professional golf as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which Golf Digest has detailed here.
The PIF is the primary backer of LIV, and documents the PGA Tour obtained in discovery in December allege that PIF and Al-Rumayyan were “instrumental in inducing players to breach their tour contracts.” The tour argues Al-Rumayyan personally recruited players, “played an active role in contract negotiations, and expressly approved each of the player contracts—all while knowing that these deals would interfere with the players’ tour contracts.”

     Federal judge clears way for PGA Tour to depose Saudi financial backers in antitrust case with LIV Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. District Judge Susan van Keulen dismissed claims of foreign sovereign immunity made by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund in the antitrust case between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf on Thursday.
Spurning from the antitrust case between the two leagues that began in August, the latest development falls in favor of the PGA Tour.
In Layman's terns: The PGA Tour will be given access to information behind the formation of LIV Golf, its business dealings and negotiations with its players.
In reaction to the antitrust lawsuit by LIV Golf, the PGA Tour responded with a counterclaim of its own.
The PGA Tour alleges that LIV Golf interfered with contracts of those former league members who ultimately joined LIV and sought subpoenas of PIF and Al-Rumayyan.

     Summary: Judge deals LIV Golf major legal blow in PGA Tour suitShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailSaudi PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan could be deposed under a judge's ruling on Thursday.
Getty ImagesThe latest development in the LIV-PGA Tour courtroom battle could spell trouble for the Saudi-backed upstarts.
On Thursday night, a federal judge ruled that PGA Tour lawyers could depose the Saudi Public Investment Fund, including PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, for documents related to the fund and its involvement as LIV Golf’s principal financier.
The ruling could mark a watershed moment in the ongoing legal battle between LIV and the Tour over the Tour’s purported monopoly status.
Per an ESPN report, lawyers for LIV and PIF have indicated they will ask a different federal judge, Beth Labson Freeman, to review Van Keulen’s ruling.

     LIV Golf's anti-trust lawsuit against PGA Tour handed severe blow in federal court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a second season of LIV Golf just days from the starting line, a federal judge has dealt a blow to the group that financially supports the upstart league, one that could radically change the fledgling circuit’s anti-trust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.
However, officials for the Saudi-run firm have insisted they only have high-level oversight over LIV Golf and don’t deal with day-to-day operations.
But Thursday’s filing stated that PIF and LIV are too entangled to separate them for legal purposes.
LIV Golf attorneys have already filed an appeal to Thursday’s ruling.
LIV Golf has long been criticized as a way for the Kingdom to sportswash its human rights record with guaranteed money and multi-million dollar deals.

     Judge rules PGA Tour can depose Saudi backers of LIV Golf

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge has ruled the head of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the financial backer of LIV Golf, must sit for depositions and produce documents in LIV Golf's antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.
LIV Golf has accused the PGA Tour of using monopolistic powers to squash competition.
The offseason for LIV Golf included a television contract with The CW, giving its tournament a broadcast partner for U.S. markets.
Majed Al Sorour, the CEO of Golf Saudi and managing director of LIV Golf, was transitioned out of that role last month.
LIV Golf has announced the addition of two more players for the second season — Mito Pereira of Chile, who is No.
