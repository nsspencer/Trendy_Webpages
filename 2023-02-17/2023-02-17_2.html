     Summary: Live From NBA All-Star 2023: WBD Sports Aims To Listen in on Player ConversationsDemand for on-field miking continues to grow as a way to engage fansStory HighlightsOutfielders and broadcast announcers have been getting chattier over the past couple of seasons.
The protocols for using live player audio during the game are still being worked out with the league, which he says is enthusiastic about the idea.
“Getting player audio is always a matter of access,” notes Chris Brown, VP, production operations and technology, WBD Sports.
Normally, player audio is sent to an EVS system for delayed playback, usually during replays.
In the past, he has managed those sources’ level and gain as well as the camera and robocam mics while Grundtvig mixed the player audio.

     Summary: Nikola Jokic is Denver’s only All-Star and no other players for the Nuggets will play in the All-Star game or even participate in any of the skills contests.
Michael Malone and his staff will coach Team LeBron in the All-Star game, which may not even include Jokic as the All-Star draft will happen right before game time for the first time in the events history.
With all that being said, here is the schedule of events for the weekend along with each contests participants.

I will say, even though the Nuggets will barely be represented at All-Star weekend, the fact their players are able to get more rest as opposed to some other teams may pay dividends in the end.
