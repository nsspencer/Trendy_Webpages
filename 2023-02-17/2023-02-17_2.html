     Summary: Senator John Fetterman (D-PA), leaves a classified briefing for U.S.
Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., will receive inpatient hospital care for a few weeks as he seeks treatment for clinical depression, a senior staffer for the senator told CNBC on Friday.
Fetterman suffered a life-threatening stroke on the campaign trail last year, and he has continued to experience health issues in office.
"While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks," Fetterman's chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, said in a statement.
Fetterman's aide told NBC that the senator has struggled to adjust to his current situation, leading him to seek treatment.

     Sen. John Fetterman has checked himself into the hospital for clinical depression
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., "checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression" on Wednesday night, his chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, said Thursday.
"While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks," Jentleson said.
Fetterman suffered a stroke last year before he won the Pennsylvania Senate race in a highly competitive contest.
“Post-stroke depression is very, very common,” said Dr. Lee Schwamm, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who is not involved with Fetterman’s care.
And his fellow senator from Pennsylvania, Democrat Bob Casey, said he's "proud" of Fetterman "for getting the help he needs."

     Clinical depression: Symptoms, treatment and outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voluntarily checked himself into a hospital on Thursday “to receive treatment for clinical depression,” according to a statement by Adam Jentleson, his chief of staff.
A 2018 study found over 37% of US adults used medications that might lead to depression.
Clinical depression, also called major depressive disorder, is the more severe form of depression.
To be diagnosed with clinical depression “an individual must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least 2 weeks,” according to the National Institute on Mental Health.
“It often acts rapidly — typically within a couple of hours — to relieve depression symptoms,” according to the National Institute on Mental Health.
