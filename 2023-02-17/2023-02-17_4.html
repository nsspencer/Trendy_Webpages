     Why Is 'Carnival Row' Ending After Season 2 on Prime Video?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne-led drama Carnival Row is back on Prime Video for its second, and final, season.
Prime Video announced a second season of Carnival Row before the first eight episodes had even been released but, sadly for fans, this hasn't been repeated for future installments.
During the subsequent period of lockdown, the team behind Carnival Row decided to make its second season the last.
Newsweek has contacted representatives for Prime Video and Carnival Row for comment.
Both seasons of Carnival Row are available to stream now on Prime Video.

     Summary: That’s when Carnival Row debuted on Prime Video, with a huge cast and complex, intersecting stories.

     Carnival Row season 2’s buckling under the weight of its fantasy world
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first season of Prime Video’s gritty fantasy series Carnival Row felt like a small part of a much bigger world.
The ending is looming and Carnival Row is covering as much as the show can, with its players as far flung as they can be.
Without the framework of a procedural, the seams of Carnival Row feel apparent.
When that gets set against the expanse of Carnival Row season 2’s expanded world, it threatens to swallow Philo whole.
But cut down to just two seasons, Carnival Row feels like it’s buckling under the weight of that world.

     Summary: Carnival Row season 2 picks up shortly after season 1 ends, but it’s been so long since that season was released (in August 2019) that a five-minute-long refresher was indeed needed at the start of the season.

     David Gyasi, Andrew Gower: 'Carnival Row' mirrors real-world troubles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo courtesy of Prime VideoNEW YORK, Feb. 17 (UPI) -- David Gyasi and Andrew Gower say their British fantasy drama, Carnival Row, reflects real contemporary issues despite that many of its characters are mythological creatures.
Gower agreed that fantasy can "really shine a light on big subjects."
But, ultimately, it is in a digestible, entertaining way, which is what I love about fantasy," Gower said.
Gyasi plays the half-man, half-goat faun Agreus; Tamzin Merchant plays his wealthy human girlfriend, Imogen; and Gower plays her disapproving brother, Ezra.
"It didn't feel like there was much that we had to imagine within the fantasy," Merchant said.
