     David Gyasi, Andrew Gower: 'Carnival Row' mirrors real-world troubles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo courtesy of Prime VideoNEW YORK, Feb. 17 (UPI) -- David Gyasi and Andrew Gower say their British fantasy drama, Carnival Row, reflects real contemporary issues despite that many of its characters are mythological creatures.
Gower agreed that fantasy can "really shine a light on big subjects."
But, ultimately, it is in a digestible, entertaining way, which is what I love about fantasy," Gower said.
Gyasi plays the half-man, half-goat faun Agreus; Tamzin Merchant plays his wealthy human girlfriend, Imogen; and Gower plays her disapproving brother, Ezra.
"It didn't feel like there was much that we had to imagine within the fantasy," Merchant said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finally, fans of Amazon Prime’s neo-noir fantasy Carnival Row get to watch the second and final season.
Since the first season of Carnival Row dropped in the fall of 2019, let’s have a quick refresher before getting into the new stuff.
What happened at the end of Carnival Row season 1?
Carnival Row review: Episode 202, “Fight or Flight”Aware of the long wait between seasons, “Fight or Flight” includes a season 1 recap, which is highly recommended.
Carnival Row was never a subtle show, and it’s even bolder now.

     Carnival Row season 2, review: Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevinge’s fantasy looks amazing — and that’s about it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve had, among other shows, Fate: The Winx Saga, Cursed, and The Magicians and now, the second (and final) series of Carnival Row.
Carnival Row was about colonialism and refugees and racism.
At the start of the second season, the Fae — including Philo, who we now know is a “half-blood” — are confined to the Burgue’s fairy quarter, the titular Carnival Row.
Carnival Row is not going to win any awards for subtlety, but it must be in the running for production design and costume Emmys.
This second season is the last.

     Why Is 'Carnival Row' Ending After Season 2 on Prime Video?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne-led drama Carnival Row is back on Prime Video for its second, and final, season.
Prime Video announced a second season of Carnival Row before the first eight episodes had even been released but, sadly for fans, this hasn't been repeated for future installments.
During the subsequent period of lockdown, the team behind Carnival Row decided to make its second season the last.
Newsweek has contacted representatives for Prime Video and Carnival Row for comment.
Both seasons of Carnival Row are available to stream now on Prime Video.

     What Exactly is ‘Carnival Row’ Season 2 Trying to Say About Communism?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And in Carnival Row Season 2 Episode 2 “New Dawn,” Imogen Spurnrose (Tamzin Merchant) and lover Agreus Astrayon (David Gyasi) stumble into the Russian revolution.
Magical creatures are considered sub-human and relegated to a ghetto called Carnival Row.
In Carnival Row Season 2, Imogen and Agreus are enjoying somewhat of a honeymoon period at sea until their chartered ship is commandeered by New Dawn.
Oh, gosh, is Carnival Row trying to be morally ambiguous again?”I have nothing against shows that want to present a cast of morally ambiguous characters.
But Andor succeeds where Carnival Row does not because it knows what its moral code actually is.

     Why won't there be a Carnival Row season 3? Orlando Bloom explains early ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Orlando Bloom stars as Rycroft Philostrate, an inspector tasked with investigating brutal murders occurring across Victorian-esque city The Burgue, where the dominant human population is deeply prejudiced towards fairy and faun refugees.
This month, Carnival Row season 2 – now billed as the final chapter – arrives on Prime Video after a three-and-a-half-year wait, during which time Beacham and Guggenheim were replaced in the top job by Daredevil's Erik Oleson.
But the biggest factor that led to ending the show early, he said, was the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw filming on Carnival Row grind to a halt for more than a year.
Orlando Bloom stars in Carnival Row season 2.

     Carnival Row Season 2: An Ode to Amazon’s Abandoned Original Fantasy Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carnival Row spent several years in development with Guillermo del Toro attached as a serious creative partner.
Thus, Carnival Row was set to be a huge original fantasy series, Amazon’s answer to Netflix’s big budgets and the new dark fantasy TV market that Game of Thrones opened up.
Carnival Row was always an imitation, always trying to be the next big creative endeavor, but lacking in the required creativity.
Carnival Row is heavily inspired by British colonialism, where the fae folk are the oppressed and colonized class.
Amazon has no need for an original fantasy series anymore; they have enough to buy Orlando Bloom’s biggest alma mater franchise.
