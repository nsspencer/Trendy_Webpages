Alvarado, who was named the Most Valuable Player, had five points in the title game.

     Summary: The Phillies have signed lefty reliever Jose Alvarado to a three year contract, per a team announcement.
The deal keeps Alvarado in Philadelphia through at least the 2025 season, and includes a club option for 2026.
According to Daniel Alvarez-Montes of El Extrabase, Alvarado will earn $9MM in each of the 2024 and 2025 seasons, with a $50K signing bonus.
Alvarado’s success came from more than just strikeouts, however.
That mix of strikeouts and groundballs is a strong recipe for success, and by signing Alvarado long term, the Phillies are indicating confidence in his ability to continue his success past his 30th birthday.
