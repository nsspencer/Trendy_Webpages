     Stella Stevens, Memphis kid turned movie star, is dead at 84

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stevens' last public appearance in her former Memphis hometown was in 2002, when she hosted "An Evening with Stella Stevens" as a benefit for her childhood alma mater, St. Anne Catholic School at 670 S. Highland.
A positive review of her performance in the Memphis Press-Scimitar, the daily evening newspaper, "really started my career" as an actress, Stevens later told The Commercial Appeal.
Memphis newspapers needed no such encouragement to follow Stevens as she pursued fame beyond the Bluff City in the wake of another young hometown hero turned movie star, Elvis Presley.
The entry for the actress in "Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia" begins: "Someday they'll erect a statue of Stella Stevens somewhere and its base will read: Beautiful Women Can Also Be Funny."
"I remember when Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis, Tennessee, a town I should be proud of," she told The Commercial Appeal.
