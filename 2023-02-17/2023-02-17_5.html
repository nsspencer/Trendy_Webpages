     Russell Westbrook to Clippers gains steam with Paul George talk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After meeting with the Los Angeles Clippers franchise officials, Utah Jazz guard Russell Westbrook will reportedly meet with franchise cornerstones Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in the near future, according to The Athletic’s Law Murray.
1 and Westbrook having yet to complete his buyout with the Jazz, his meeting with George and Kawhi could happen quite soon.
Whether or not that player can be Westbrook may simply depend on if he and the veteran-led squad believe they can truly mesh.
For what it’s worth, multiple Clippers players have stepped forward to advocate for their front office to sign Westbrook.
Chief amongst them Paul George.

     Kawhi Leonard: Clippers Aren't 'Playing at a Championship Level' Despite Win vs. Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty ImagesLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard believes the team has plenty of work to do before it truly establishes itself as a championship contender.
I don't think we're playing at a championship level yet, but we're gradually getting better and we got to keep getting better."
When asked precisely what the Clips need to do in order to enter the championship conversation, Leonard added: "We'll see when it happens.
Entering the 2022-23 season, the Clippers were thought to be among the top contenders in the Western Conference, provided Leonard and Paul George could stay healthy.
The Clippers were far from perfect in Thursday's win over the Suns, and Leonard himself had an uncharacteristically tough game.

     Summary: “It’s just having an identity, having an identity when that ball goes up, what team you’re going to get on a nightly basis,” George said.
So we got to have an identity that carries us through that long stretch.”George’s comment that the Clippers have “everything we need” is a notable change in tone.
The team’s discussions with buyout candidates for their backcourt had maintained scrutiny on the current Clippers’ ball movement and passing.
Against the Warriors and Suns combined, the Clippers averaged 299 passes, 24 more than their season average.
Now the question remains whether the Clippers will resume their schedule by getting off on the right foot.
