     Orlando Bloom On Shooting Drama Series Carnival Row In Prague: “It Was Just Beautiful, Epic &amp; Mercurial…”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From the fabled world of the Faefolk and other mythical creatures, Prime Video brings to you season 2 of the fantasy drama series Carnival Row.
In an eternal war against their oppressors, the humans, former inspector Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom), a hybrid of human and fae, investigates a series of gruesome murders at the heart of the rising conflict.
With humans and fae folk divided and freedom on the line, each hero will face impossible dilemmas and soul-defining tests in the epic conclusion of Carnival Row.
And the Row was just beautiful and epic and mercurial, and ever-evolving and changing.
It was challenging to land both of those characters on screen, at the same time, because they’re different versions of the same person.”Adding further Orlando Bloom said, “But once I decided, it was so much fun and I loved it.

     Summary: The Dead SeerEpisode 1 of Carnival Row season 2 begins with Vignette and the Black Raven cutting the barbed wires around the Row and flying out.
Kaine the Black Raven tends to his mate, Oona who seems to be on the precipice of death.
At that moment, Tourmaline sees some boys getting scared of a door and she slowly approaches it.
She sees the dead Aoife with blue eyes and as she touches the door she sees Philo shooting at something that is targeting her.
He shows him the murder of Anders who was on the supply train and hints that the Black Raven may be involved.

     Carnival Row Season 2 Review: Intricate, Fantastical World Still Lacks Spark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carnival Row season 2 picks up shortly after season 1 ends, but it’s been so long since that season was released (in August 2019) that a five-minute-long refresher was indeed needed at the start of the season.

     Carnival Row season 2’s buckling under the weight of its fantasy world
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first season of Prime Video’s gritty fantasy series Carnival Row felt like a small part of a much bigger world.
The ending is looming and Carnival Row is covering as much as the show can, with its players as far flung as they can be.
Without the framework of a procedural, the seams of Carnival Row feel apparent.
When that gets set against the expanse of Carnival Row season 2’s expanded world, it threatens to swallow Philo whole.
But cut down to just two seasons, Carnival Row feels like it’s buckling under the weight of that world.
