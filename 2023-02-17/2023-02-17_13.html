     George Strait welcomes Bruce Springsteen at Moody Center show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rick Kern/Getty ImagesBruce Springsteen played a raucous, mostly-career-spanning concert at the Moody Center on Thursday night, February 16 — no Tunnel of Love, sadly — to a sold-out crowd.
But before Springsteen and the E Street Band could begin an epic 27-song set, they were brought onto the stage by a special guest: the King of Country Music.
Springsteen was accompanied onstage by George Strait, clad in his trademark black cowboy hat and ready to welcome the Jersey boy to Austin.

     Bruce Springsteen Adds 2nd Chicago Wrigley Field Show Due To ‘Overwhelming Demand'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you came up short when trying to buy Bruce Springsteen tickets when they went on sale Friday for his Aug. 9 show at Wrigley Field in Chicago, you're in luck: Another date has been added.
According to officials, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will now perform at Wrigley Field this summer on two dates: Aug. 9 and Aug. 11.
And instead of being sold through Ticketmaster, tickets the Chicago shows will be sold directly through the stadium, organizers say.
For Beyoncé's upcoming tour stop in Chicago, it led to long queues and demand quickly exceeding supply after various presales went into effect.
The last time Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band toured in United States was in Sept. of 2016, as part of the The River tour.

     Bruce Springsteen Stuns the Moody Center with a Venue-Defining Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Springsteen returned to Austin last night, ending the longest Boss drought since the rock legend played a gig in the city for the first time at Armadillo World Headquarters back in 1973.
Everything you’ve heard about a Springsteen show is true: the exuberance, the stamina, the sustained fever pitch of unforgettable rock classics.
Just like a Springsteen record, the shows teem with energy, each song bursting with layered guitars, brass, and Bruce’s tender growl.
Now 73 years old, Springsteen has been putting on one of the best shows in live music for five decades, and that hasn’t changed one bit.
The song was written for George Theiss, who played with Springsteen in his first band, The Castiles, back in the ’60s.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Current music writer Deborah Sengupta Stith was set to review but had to bow out at the last minute.
When the night came, as with the most famous religious experience in Western society, a prophet appeared to herald the chosen one.
The whole E Street Band, of course, put on a show that's like watching Navy SEALs do their job.
As the night progressed and delirium set in, the E Street Band cracked the remaining ice and let the hits rush out.
“Because the Night,” which Springsteen co-wrote with Patti Smith, who made it famous, was my personal highlight.

     Summary: Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band!”Right.
In the before times – 2016 – Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band reunited to revisit The River and whetted worldwide appetites for more glory days.
Otherwise, they arced a swath of time capsules representing the E Street Band since sophomore LP The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle, also from 1973.
It was there that I embarked on the greatest adventure of my young life: I joined my first real rock &amp; roll band.
That’s pretty good, 1965, ’66, and ’67, an explosive time in American history and an incredible time to be in a rock band.
