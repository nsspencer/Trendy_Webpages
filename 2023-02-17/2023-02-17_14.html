     Summary: See this right here is something LIV will never have unless they decide to introduce a cut.
The entire outlook of Schauffele's week just flipped on a dime thanks to this preposterous hole-out as darkness was setting in in L.A.
This is the same guy who made an albatross at the American Express earlier this winter, by the way.
The ball is just finding the hole when he needs it to.
A feeling none of us will ever experience.

He did all that while wearing a long sleeve polo shirt that didn‚Äôt quite upstage some of his playing partner‚Äôs antics, but certainly turned some heads.
