    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Cara Murez HealthDay Reporter(HealthDay)FRIDAY, Feb. 17, 2023 (HealthDay News) – Sen. John Fetterman is being treated for clinical depression at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Fetterman survived a near-fatal stroke last year while he was campaigning for the Senate seat he now holds.
At that time, Fetterman was in the stroke unit for two days, where he underwent various tests including an MRI.
His difficulties with communication have also impacted his relationship with his family, as has his time away from them while he works in the Senate, CNBC News reported.

     Sen. John Fetterman has checked himself into the hospital for clinical depression
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., "checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression" on Wednesday night, his chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, said Thursday.
"While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks," Jentleson said.
Fetterman suffered a stroke last year before he won the Pennsylvania Senate race in a highly competitive contest.
“Post-stroke depression is very, very common,” said Dr. Lee Schwamm, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who is not involved with Fetterman’s care.
And his fellow senator from Pennsylvania, Democrat Bob Casey, said he's "proud" of Fetterman "for getting the help he needs."

Millions of Americans struggle with their mental health.
— Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) February 16, 2023“Millions of Americans struggle with their mental health,” Fetterman’s Pennsylvania colleague Sen. Bob Casey wrote in a tweet.
"I think it's probably not uncommon for people in positions of great stress to experience major depression,” said Longenecker.
He said often, people are taught to bury their mental health struggles and “continue to push through” to a level where it becomes detrimental.
