The protocols for using live player audio during the game are still being worked out with the league, which he says is enthusiastic about the idea.

Normally, player audio is sent to an EVS system for delayed playback, usually during replays.
In the past, he has managed those sources’ level and gain as well as the camera and robocam mics while Grundtvig mixed the player audio.
