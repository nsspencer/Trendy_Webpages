     Commanders finalize deal to make Eric Bieniemy new OC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Wilbon voices his dismay at Eric Bieniemy being "forced" to take the Commanders' offensive coordinator job.
(1:17)ASHBURN, Va. -- The Washington Commanders have finalized a deal to make Eric Bieniemy the team's new offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, sources told ESPN on Friday, confirming multiple reports.
Bieniemy spent the past five seasons as the Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator, helping oversee an offense that powered two Super Bowl championships -- including one last weekend.
In Washington, Bieniemy will be in complete charge of the offense and call plays.
Tennessee also showed interest in Bieniemy for its offensive coordinator position, but the Titans never interviewed him and promoted Tim Kelly to the position.

     Summary: The former Chiefs offensive coordinator will take the same position on Ron Rivera’s staff.
The Commanders will hire Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy to the same position, according to a report from NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport was the first to report the mutual interest between Bieniemy and Washington.
With Bieniemy departing for Washington, Matt Nagy is considered the favorite to replace him as the team’s offensive coordinator, per Rapoport.
The 2022 campaign was Rivera’s winningest year yet in D.C. as the Commanders went 8-8-1, but missed the playoffs for the second straight year with him as coach.

     Eric Bieniemy can quiet doubters as Commanders’ expected offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Commanders are set to have a new offensive coordinator and assistant head coach after more than a month of searching.
“I’d say hire (Eric), like right now,” Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said in 2019, before Kansas City beat San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV.
I don’t want to lose him, but if you’re asking me if he’s ready to be a head coach?
If he wants to be a head coach, he probably has to do something like this.”“This” is becoming the new offensive coordinator for the Commanders.
Last year, Reid reportedly sought direct answers during an NFL owners’ meeting about why Bieniemy had not yet become a head coach.
