     Russell Westbrook to Clippers gains steam with Paul George talk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After meeting with the Los Angeles Clippers franchise officials, Utah Jazz guard Russell Westbrook will reportedly meet with franchise cornerstones Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in the near future, according to The Athletic‚Äôs Law Murray.
1 and Westbrook having yet to complete his buyout with the Jazz, his meeting with George and Kawhi could happen quite soon.
Whether or not that player can be Westbrook may simply depend on if he and the veteran-led squad believe they can truly mesh.
For what it‚Äôs worth, multiple Clippers players have stepped forward to advocate for their front office to sign Westbrook.
Chief amongst them Paul George.

Those teams include the Bulls, Clippers, Heat and the Wizards, Westbrook‚Äôs former team.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As The Athletic reported Thursday, LA received permission to speak to Westbrook and talks have started among franchise officials.
George already took the extra step prior to the Clippers meeting with Westbrook to publicly vouch for his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.
His first two games with the Clippers were the first time this season that he did not play 18 minutes in a game.
But the way the Clippers beat Phoenix 116-107 on Thursday gave LA the momentum it craved heading into All-Star break.
So we got to have an identity that carries us through that long stretch.‚ÄùMost importantly, they‚Äôre winning games.

So we got to have an identity that carries us through that long stretch.‚ÄùGeorge‚Äôs comment that the Clippers have ‚Äúeverything we need‚Äù is a notable change in tone.
The team‚Äôs discussions with buyout candidates for their backcourt had maintained scrutiny on the current Clippers‚Äô ball movement and passing.
Against the Warriors and Suns combined, the Clippers averaged 299 passes, 24 more than their season average.
Now the question remains whether the Clippers will resume their schedule by getting off on the right foot.
