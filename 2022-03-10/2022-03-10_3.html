     Barcelona’s predicted starting lineup for Europa League clash with Galatasaray revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona welcome Galatasaray to Camp Nou this evening in the first leg of their Europa League last 16 clash.
The Blaugrana are expected to make rotations for this fixture but are still intent on putting up a strong showing and securing their fifth consecutive victory; they’re in the Europa League to win the Europa League.
Barcelona have been making great strides since Xavi Hernandez took over and have climbed as high as third in La Liga.
They beat Napoli 5-3 on aggregate in the previous round to make it this far while Galatasaray qualified straight as group winners.
Xavi Hernandez is expected to start Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal behind a back four of Sergino Dest, Eric Garcia, Clement Lenglet and Jordi Alba.

     CorSport: Milan alerted as Barcelona open talks with Jorge Mendes over Leao
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona have opened talks with agent Jorge Mendes over the possibility of signing Rafael Leao, according to a report.
The 22-year-old has has scored 11 goals and has added 6 assists in 31 games for Milan in all competitions in the current campaign, being arguably the most consistent forward, and Sport reported earlier today that Barcelona are attentive to his development.
According to il Corriere dello Sport (via PianetaMilan), Milan want to try and secure Leao’s long term future through the extension of his contract with a pay rise, but there is interest from abroad as Barcelona are in talks with Mendes.
For this reason the restyling of the squad has started and continues with Leao now in the sights of the Catalan side.
It may just force the hand of the management to speed up those renewal talks.

     Barcelona could sign former defender for €10-15 million in the summer – report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of Barcelona’s primary aims in the winter transfer window other than the signing of forwards was their pursuit of a left-back.
Jordi Alba has not had a competent competitor for several years now, and the need for reinforcement increases with every passing day.
The Portuguese side need to cut their wage bill, and he could be sold for a fee of around €10-€15 million.
However, the Spanish left-back is close to renewing his contract with Valencia which would make his signing very difficult.
Jordi Alba is not getting any younger and Grimaldo could indeed be the next big cog in Barcelona’s fullback department.

     Chelsea and Bayern planning summer swoop for Barcelona teenage prodigy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just 17 years of age, the young midfielder was handed his opportunity with the senior team by former manager Ronald Koeman in the early parts of the campaign.
Not only has he established himself as a regular in the Barça first-team setup, but the teenage prodigy has also broken into the Spanish national team.
His rapid growth has seemingly attracted the interest of clubs like Bayern Munich and Chelsea, reports Diario AS.
Bayern Munich are set to part ways with Corentin Tolisso this summer with his contract expiring, while Marcel Sabitzer’s signing has proven to be a dud.
Bayern, though, could lure the young midfielder away, which is why it is important that Barça tie him down to a new deal.
