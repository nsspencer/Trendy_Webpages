     Hideki Matsuyama withdraws from Players Championship due to back injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Reigning Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama withdrew from the Players Championship on Thursday because of a lingering back injury, the PGA Tour announced.
Matsuyama will be replaced in the field by Patrick Rodgers.
11-ranked player in the world, already has two victories this season, at the Zozo Championship in October and the Sony Open in Hawaii in January.
The Japanese star had complained about a muscle strain in his neck and shoulders earlier this week and said the injury was limiting his practice routine to only putting and chipping.
The start of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass was delayed one hour Thursday following overnight rain and storms.

     Hideki Matsuyama WDs from THE PLAYERS Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Hideki Matsuyama withdrew from THE PLAYERS Championship with a lingering back injury Thursday morning.
Matsuyama had been scheduled to go off the 10th hole at 8:40 a.m. with Joaquin Niemann and Cameron Smith.
One of the popular pre-tournament favorites, Matsuyama came into this week as one of only two multiple winners on the PGA TOUR this season (ZOZO CHAMPIONSHIP, Sony Open in Hawaii).
Although the tournament wound up being cancelled amid the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, Matsuyama (63) led after round one of the 2020 PLAYERS.
He will be the defending champion at the Masters Tournament at Augusta National next month.
