     Michigan Basketball: Big Ten Tourney Edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The victory improved Michigan’s record to 17-13 overall and 11-9 in conference - good for a tie for seventh with in-state rival Michigan State.
And let’s not forget that with its post-season fate hanging in the balance, Michigan played its final five games without its head coach.
By the end of January, Michigan had suffered blowout losses to Arizona (18 points), North Carolina (21 points), Illinois (15 points) and Michigan State (17 points).
Against Ohio State, Diabate held EJ Liddell, one of the Big Ten’s more talented big men largely in check.
Williams is also playing his best basketball, tallying nine and 17 points against Michigan State and Ohio State respectively.

     My Two Cents: Stopping Center Hunter Dickinson Key to Finally Getting Past Michigan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the Hoosiers to get that first NCAA bid in six years, they have to win, and that starts with controlling Michigan center Hunter Dickinson.
The loss to Michigan was really the only game all year where Indiana was never in it.
"You would think after the big game we had against Purdue, everybody would be sky high,'' Woodson said Tuesday.
Michigan came into that game ranked dead last in three-pointers made in the Big Ten, but they knocked down 11-of-17 long balls against the Hoosiers.
Even worse, 7-foot-1 center Hunter Dickinson kept getting open too, and Indiana was awful in covering pick-and-rolls.
