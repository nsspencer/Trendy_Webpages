     Hideki Matsuyama withdraws from Players Championship due to back injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Reigning Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama withdrew from the Players Championship on Thursday because of a lingering back injury, the PGA Tour announced.
Matsuyama will be replaced in the field by Patrick Rodgers.
11-ranked player in the world, already has two victories this season, at the Zozo Championship in October and the Sony Open in Hawaii in January.
The Japanese star had complained about a muscle strain in his neck and shoulders earlier this week and said the injury was limiting his practice routine to only putting and chipping.
The start of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass was delayed one hour Thursday following overnight rain and storms.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – The storms arrived as forecast with play halted at The Players Championship at 11 a.m.
ET by “dangerous weather” in the area.
No one had completed their first round at TPC Sawgrass and three players – Harold Varner III, Will Zalatoris and Tommy Fleetwood – were tied for the lead at 4 under.
“We need to play golf when we can play golf in order to accomplish the end goal which is, hopefully, finishing the championship by Sunday afternoon,” said Gary Young, the PGA Tour’s chief referee, who also added the setup team was already thinking ahead.
“They are actually setting up for Friday and Saturday’s weather conditions because, most likely, we’ll be finishing up Round 2 on Saturday, completely different wins.

     Summary: 1:10 p.m.: Well, there was good news and there was bad news from the PGA Tour's meterologist Wade Stettner when he spoke to Golf Channel a bit ago.
That was encouraging, BUT he said this about the forecast on Friday: "Tomorrow looks like a rough day.
It looks like we could be battling thunderstorms through most of the day.
They kind of develop in the morning and they come at us in waves throughout the day."
Golf Channel then went inside with Mike Tirico talking to the tour's chief referee for the week, Gary Young, who qupped, "We're going to have to work on Wade's positivity."

     Hideki Matsuyama WDs from THE PLAYERS Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Hideki Matsuyama withdrew from THE PLAYERS Championship with a lingering back injury Thursday morning.
Matsuyama had been scheduled to go off the 10th hole at 8:40 a.m. with Joaquin Niemann and Cameron Smith.
One of the popular pre-tournament favorites, Matsuyama came into this week as one of only two multiple winners on the PGA TOUR this season (ZOZO CHAMPIONSHIP, Sony Open in Hawaii).
Although the tournament wound up being cancelled amid the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, Matsuyama (63) led after round one of the 2020 PLAYERS.
He will be the defending champion at the Masters Tournament at Augusta National next month.

     Summary: The biggest event of the first quarter of the golf year has arrived with the best field of 2022 thus far set to put on a show at The Players Championship.
The pristine TPC Sawgrass course will serve as host with the first 18 holes prepared to set the stage for what should be a tremendous tournament on Thursday in Round 1.
That should favor ball-strikers, the players who can flight their golf ball underneath the gusts and hold it against some of the heavier stuff on the slew of water holes TPC Sawgrass has to offer.
