     How Much Jail Time Could Jussie Smollett Face at Sentencing?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NOTE: NBC Chicago will offer live coverage from the courtroom beginning around 1 p.m.Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday after being convicted of lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack he staged in Chicago, but how much jail time could he face?
But because Smollett does not have an extensive criminal history and the conviction is for a low-level nonviolent crime, experts do not expect that he will be sent to prison.
Smollett will be given a chance to speak to the judge and he could repeat some of the things he told jurors during the trial about how he was simply a victim of a violent crime.
Smollett could tell the judge as he told jurors about his extensive history of volunteering and donating to charitable causes.
He could also say that the fact that the case left his career in shambles is punishment enough for him avoid custody.

     Summary: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS – MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett after his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.
Smollett testified in his defense during last year’s trial and he steadfastly denied any involvement in the phony hate crime plan.
Just weeks after he reported the attack to police, prosecutors approved disorderly conduct charges against Smollett.
Webb brought a new set of disorderly conduct charges against Smollett in February 2021.
Smollett was written out of “Empire,” and he testified last year that his career as an actor was derailed by the ordeal.

Black Queer musical phenom Lil Nas X’s groundbreaking hit “Old Town Road” had not smashed records on the Billboard charts.
Black queer men like myself would later remember him for starring in the 2012 indie gay film The Skinny.
Think the tragic mulatto trope, but with a Black queer narrative instead.
In 2022, the state of Black queer men in pop culture has evolved.
