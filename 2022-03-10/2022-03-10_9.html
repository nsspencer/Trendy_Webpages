     Summary: BROOKLYN, N.Y. – Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski, associate head coach Chris Carrawell and freshman forward A.J.
Griffin suffered through a bout of food poisoning leading into Thursday's ACC Tournament quarterfinal win over Syracuse.
Speaking after the Blue Devils' 88-79 win over the Orange, Krzyzewski said he, Carrawell and Griffin were "throwing up all day" Wednesday.

     Summary: After Duke got by Syracuse and Miami clipped Boston College in the last possible second, the Blue Devils get a rematch with the Hurricanes in the ACC Tournament Semifinals Friday night.
You’ll recall Miami got Duke in Cameron 76-74 on January 8th.
Miami finished fourth in the ACC and is now 23-9 overall so clearly they’re a good team.
So it’s entirely possible that we won’t see Duke at full strength against Miami again.
So now we’re down to four - Duke, Miami, Virginia Tech and UNC - and we’ll see how things look after Friday night’s results.

     Syracuse men’s basketball unconventional defensive look gave them a chance against Duke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Syracuse Orange had been unable to stop the Duke Blue Devils in their two previous meetings.
So Jim Boeheim went into his bag of tricks and pulled out a triangle and two defense to confuse the young Duke squad and give his limited squad a chance.
Most of the 29 3’s that Duke hit against Syracuse came after the ball went inside and came out and had the zone defense scrambling.
This left Cole Swider, Jimmy Boeheim and Bourama Sidibe charged with limiting Williams and Paolo Banchero in the paint.
For the game Griffin was 1-3 from the field and 0-1 from 3 so Boeheim took away the two players who had killed the Orange earlier.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Syracuse basketball fell 88-79 to Duke in the quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament.
Not only is Duke one of the best team in the country, but they are matchup nightmare for the Orange.
Still, Syracuse had a lead with under three minutes to play and it was a one possession game with just over one minute to play.
Duke Just Too MuchAt the end of the day, Duke was simply too talented.
Duke is easily the worst matchup for Syracuse in the conference, and it is unfortunate that is who the Orange had as its quarterfinals opponent.

     Summary: The Blue Devils were 15.5-point favorites in their ACC Tournament quarterfinal matchup against 16-16 Syracuse.
For most of the afternoon, Syracuse threatened to one-and-done the Blue Devils in this tourney.
The Blue Devils got a double dagger late, thanks to a building-rocking 3-pointer courtesy of Jeremy Roach, and then a transition dunk on the ensuing possession by Mark Williams.
You know, if you lose that game we're done, not playing in the ACC Tournament again.
Despite not being a vintage, dominant Duke performance, the Blue Devils' offense was quite good.

Cole Swider for three, Girard for two and Jimmy Boeheim for three in Syracuse’s first five possessions and Syracuse led 48-41.

Duke, in its 88-79 conquest against an inspired Syracuse, got its first taste of that all-to-familiar slogan Thursday.
For Duke, a group that has faced questions from pundits regarding the presence of a closer, that key moment was delivered by Roach.
Syracuse, sitting at 16-16 entering Thursday and without star guard Buddy Boeheim, was as desperate as it gets.
After a career-high 28 points against Syracuse late last month, the Virginia Beach, Va., native was just not getting the rock enough.

Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said his team is eager to face the Blue Devils again, too.
The Blue Devils’ biggest issue that night was turnovers — they committed a season-high 17.
Fouled after he grabbed the rebound, Isaiah Wong hit one of two free throws with eight seconds left.
The Blue Devils have won their share of lopsided games this season while building their impressive record.
