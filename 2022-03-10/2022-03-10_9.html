     Grab A Cool Super Mario Switch Controller For 15 Bucks On Mario Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you loved everything about the above controller but were put off by its flashy design, you're in luck--Amazon is discounting the same gamepad but with an understated white design.
It comes with a few red accents (including the shoulder buttons and back), although it's muted enough to fit in with most game rooms.
Like all PowerA Enhanced Wired Controllers, it offers two mappable buttons, a 3.5mm audio jack, and analog sticks that feature anti-friction rings for added precision.

     It’s “MAR10 Day,” so Nintendo has discounted a bunch of Mario Switch games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a good day for fans of both Nintendo and calendar-based puns, as Thursday marks another "Mario Day," Nintendo's annual March 10 (or Mar10, get it?)
In practical terms, though, it mostly means Nintendo has put a bunch of Mario games on sale.
Best Mario Day 2022 dealsPerhaps the best deal of the bunch is for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, which is down to $10 on Nintendo's eShop.
This is a Switch port of one of the more underrated core Mario games , which originally launched for the Wii U in 2013.
It's brief, taking only around 3-4 hours to beat, but if nothing else it's an enjoyable look at where future Mario games may go.
