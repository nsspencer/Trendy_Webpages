     Madison Cawthorn Trashes Zelensky as a ‘Thug’ Pushing ‘Woke Ideologies’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats and Republicans in the United States have found rare common ground in standing behind Ukraine and its president, Volodomyr Zelensky.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) is among the Republicans who haven’t seemed to have much of a problem with Putin’s designs on one of America’s allies.
“Remember that Zelensky is a thug,” Cawthorn said in a video obtained by North Carolina’s WRAL.
“Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.”.
So what, then, is Cawthorn actually accomplishing by trashing Zelesnky as he fights an invasion from an authoritarian regime?

"We must unite as a nation to pray for President Zelenskyy and the brave people of Ukraine who are fighting for their lives and their freedom.
