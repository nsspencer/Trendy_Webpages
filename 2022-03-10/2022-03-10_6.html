    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona are preparing for a pivotal summer transfer window during which they plan to bring in reinforcements in several positions while also getting rid of unwanted players.
Such a move would mean the end of the road for current second-choice goalkeeper Neto.
And, as per Xavi Campos via LaTdT, the former Juventus goalkeeper will get his wishes in the summer transfer window later this year.
In case they fail to find a buyer for him, the La Liga bigwigs will terminate his contract and release him.
The club would pay him a part of his remaining contract, which runs until the summer of 2023.

     Furious Xavi Scolded FC Barcelona At Halftime, But His Two ‘Revolutions’ Didn’t Work Against Galatasaray
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Xavi Hernandez reportedly scolded his FC Barcelona team against Galatasaray.
NurPhoto via Getty ImagesXavi Hernandez's triple substitution at half time during FC Barcelona's 0-0 home draw to Galatasaray in the Europa League last 16 first leg was an indicator that all wasn't well at Camp Nou.
FC Barcelona had their chances early on, which they failed to take with Ferran Torres particularly wasteful again.
The coach tried to pull off two "revolutions" in total which fell short of having their desired impact.
Xavi's drastic triple substitution in bringing on Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Ousmane Dembele brought a tad more fluidity to Barca's game.

     Summary: With this result, Barca must win at Galatasaray in a week's time to advance to the last eight (Thursday, 1:45 p.m.
That is a (deserved) result Galatasaray will loveDomenec Torrent's side will take that every single day.
Barca know the adjustments that are neededNot all that worried for Barca in the second leg because two key players didn't start this match but surely will in the second leg.
Aubameyang should be able to produce with 90 minutes in the second leg, and having him and Busquets from the start should make a noticeable different early.
This draw for them is quite a surprise when you consider they are in 12th place in the Turkish League and regularly struggle.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What was expected to be a relatively easy fixture for Barcelona turned out to be the ultimate test on Thursday night.
Despite their woeful domestic form, Galatasaray dished out a fine performance against Barcelona and made them suffer in their own stadium.
Poor in the face of goalMuch like the game against Elche, creating chances was not the concern for Barcelona.
Barcelona were comfortable letting Pena go on loan, and a move to Galatasaray clicked in January.
Xavi gave Torres the start against Galatasaray, but the winger was wholly isolated from the game.
