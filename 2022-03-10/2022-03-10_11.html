     Britain Freezes Assets of Roman Abramovich, Creating Crisis at Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — For Chelsea F.C.’s players and coaches, the first snippets of information arrived in the text messages and news alerts that pinged their cellphones as they made their way to a private terminal at London’s Gatwick Airport on Thursday morning.
The British government had frozen the assets of their team’s Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, as part of a wider set of sanctions announced against a group of Russian oligarchs.
The action, part of the government’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, was designed to punish a handful of individuals whose businesses, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin.
Abramovich, the British government said, has enjoyed a “close relationship” with Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, for decades.
The order applied to all of Abramovich’s businesses, properties and holdings, but its most consequential — and most high-profile — effect hit Chelsea, the reigning European soccer champion, which was at that very moment beginning its journey to a Thursday night Premier League match at Norwich City.

     Summary: Nike 'Considering Walking Away' From Chelsea Kit Deal as Blues Could Miss Out on £540MNike are considering walking away from their kit deal with Chelsea, according to reports.
After agreeing a 15-year deal back in 2016, a kit deal worth £900 million, they are now looking at their sponsorship of the European and World champions.
It comes after Roman Abramovich, Chelsea owner, was sanctioned by the UK Government on Thursday morning and subsequently had his assets frozen.
Various sponsors including Hyundai, Parimatch and Zapp are considering ending their agreements, while Three have suspended their shirt deal temporarily, worth £40 million, and want their logo to be removed from shirts moving forward.
Nike are now reviewing their agreement with the Club and are 'considering walking away' which would see the Blues lose out on £540 million.

     Sanctions for Russian oligarch Abramovich leave his Chelsea soccer club in a precarious position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesChelsea FC, one of the U.K.'s most prized soccer clubs, is facing an uncertain future after its Russian oligarch owner Roman Abramovich was hit with sanctions over his ties with President Vladimir Putin.
The club's proposed £3 billion sale ($3.9 billion), player transfers and merchandise sales have all been halted as part of the penalties imposed by British authorities.
Major sponsors have also distanced themselves from the club whose name has been sullied over its owner's connections to the war in Ukraine.
Chelsea caught off guardThe clampdown on Abramovich was largely expected of a government facing increasing pressure to toughen its stance on Putin's inner circle.
The official Chelsea club shop closed Thursday and some staff were partially laid off.
