We allow an audience to identify not only with the character that Sam’s playing, but with our own lives.
That was what the book meant to me, to be able to do that.

     ‘The View': Samuel L. Jackson Defends Superhero Movies From Director Critics: ‘Movies Are Movies’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Samuel L. Jackson is more than happy to be part of superhero movies and series, even if some filmmakers consider them “not cinema” or too sexless.
In a recent interview with UK outlet The Times, Jackson noted that “all movies are valid.” When asked to expound a bit on “The View,” Jackson doubled down, and inserted his classic brand of sass.
“Movies are movies,” Jackson said.
Making movies is no longer a mystery, everybody knows how to do it.
“When we were younger, people went to see cowboy movies, and they went to see superhero movies of another ilk, they had superheroes on television.”The MCU actor then reiterated that superhero films are meant for a different audience than more serious films.

     ‘The Last Days Of Ptolemy Grey’ review: Samuel L. Jackson delivers a masterclass
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But with a great like Samuel L. Jackson in The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, the result is absolute bliss.
Walter Mosley wrote the novel The Last Days Of Ptolemy Grey in 2010.
It’s a surprise to learn that the book was so recent, as there is something distinctly old-fashioned about Mosley’s adaptation for Apple TV+ – not least its constant flashbacks to the youth of Ptolemy Grey (Samuel L. Jackson), the 91-year-old protagonist.
It is just about the only aspect of Ptolemy Grey that feels unsatisfactory.
‘The Last Days Of Ptolemy Grey’ premieres on Apple TV+ this Friday (March 11)

     Summary: Samuel L. Jackson says he didn't ask for the "BMF" engraving on his "Star Wars" lightsaber.
Jackson said on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" that the crew did it out of love for him.
During his Wednesday appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," Jackson admitted that he didn't ask for the engraving.
His character, Mace Windu, stood out in the trilogy because he was the first and only Jedi to have a purple lightsaber.
Although Jackson hasn't been in a "Star Wars" movie since "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith" in 2005, there have been rumors that he may return as Mace Windu in a future project.

     Summary: 1/5Samuel L. Jackson starred in and executive produced "The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey" on Apple TV+.
File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License PhotoLOS ANGELES, March 10 (UPI) -- Samuel L. Jackson calls his new TV series, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, premiering Friday on Apple TV+, a modern-day fairy tale.
Since there is no real-life cure for Alzheimer's disease, Jackson said Ptolemy Grey offers wish fulfillment for people dealing with it.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is about Grey reclaiming his self-worth in a world that abandoned him.
Like his other dramatic roles, Jackson said playing Ptolemy Grey did not weigh on him after wrapping.

     Summary: A shuffling, broken down Samuel L Jackson is quite a sight.
In his moments of lucidity Ptolemy is frightened of the ever changing world.
Jackson’s portrayal of a man whose life is fading away from him is one of two reasons to stick with The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.
There are some very extraneous bits indeed, such as the local drug addict who tries to attack Ptolemy every time he leaves his house.
He executive produces and has had the rights to the Walter Mosley book the series is based on for nearly a decade.
