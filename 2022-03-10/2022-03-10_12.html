     How Twitter Is Celebrating Mario Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it turns out, Mario Day is an important day to many of the people who frequent Twitter.
One person who is joining the Mario Day action is Charles Martinet, best known to most gamers as the voice of Mario.
Martinet has been voicing Mario since the early 1990s, along with a bevy of other "Mario" characters like Luigi, Waluigi, and Wario.
Martinet seems to be celebrating Mario Day in style, as the image he shared seems to have been taken at a tropical resort.
If only we could all celebrate Mario Day in such leisure and luxury.

     It’s “MAR10 Day,” so Nintendo has discounted a bunch of Mario Switch games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a good day for fans of both Nintendo and calendar-based puns, as Thursday marks another "Mario Day," Nintendo's annual March 10 (or Mar10, get it?)
In practical terms, though, it mostly means Nintendo has put a bunch of Mario games on sale.
Best Mario Day 2022 dealsPerhaps the best deal of the bunch is for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, which is down to $10 on Nintendo's eShop.
This is a Switch port of one of the more underrated core Mario games , which originally launched for the Wii U in 2013.
It's brief, taking only around 3-4 hours to beat, but if nothing else it's an enjoyable look at where future Mario games may go.
