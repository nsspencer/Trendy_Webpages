     Chicago Bears trade linebacker Khalil Mack to Los Angeles Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Chargers have agreed to trade six-time Pro Bowl linebacker Khalil Mack to L.A.
Mack, who played under current Chargers coach Brandon Staley in Chicago from 2017-2018, is under contract through the 2024 season.
The 31-year-old Mack will return to the AFC West after spending the past four seasons in Chicago.
Mack played the first four seasons of his career with the Oakland Raiders.
In four seasons with the Bears, Mack racked up 36 sacks, 14 forced fumbles and six fumble recoveries.

     The Chicago Bears’ trade of Khalil Mack signifies a painful page-turn. But GM Ryan Poles’ work is just beginning.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That was it, an unfortunate and unceremonious end to a run that once held so much promise yet ended with an undeniable fizzle.
Mack’s four seasons in Chicago, while solid overall, ended with only 36 sacks and zero playoff victories.
He wound up on injured reserve last season with a left foot injury he could never get on the right side of.
Over the last two years, Mack spent time on the injury report because of issues with his back, shoulder, knee, ankle and foot.

     Khalil Mack trade grades: Chargers edge Bears in win-win deal for star pass rusher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFL headlines kept churning on Thursday, with the Chargers agreeing to acquire star pass rusher Khalil Mack in a big-name trade with the Bears.
Already, the Chargers' odds of a 2022 playoff run have jumped as a result of Mack's arrival opposite Joey Bosa out west.
And did the Bears get a fair return for one of the most accomplished defensive players in the league?
(The 2023 sixth offers roughly the same value of a 2022 seventh, which is all but a throwaway pick.)
Granted, Miller was much less expensive and wasn't freshly injured, but Mack, when healthy, remains an elite starter.

     The Morning After...the Bears traded Khalil Mack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a weird full circle moment with this Khalil Mack trade.
I remember that fateful morning in 2018 when I woke up to the news – sleep still in my eyes – that the Bears had traded for Mack.
Fast forward four years, and the news that Mack was being traded to the Chargers happened just hours before bed and there was no excitement involved.
The Bears aren’t going to contend in 2022, but things are being set up for some big moves in 2023.
Overall, it’s a sad day for Bears fans as Mack’s trade signals the official end of what we all thought was an exciting era of Bears football.

     Bears trading pass rusher Khalil Mack to Chargers for multiple draft picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time in his stellar career, Khalil Mack is on the move.
The Chicago Bears have agreed to trade the star edge rusher to the Los Angeles Chargers in exchange for a 2022 second-round draft pick and a sixth-rounder in 2023, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Thursday.
As part of the deal, Los Angeles is taking on the entirety of Mack's remaining salary: three years, $63.9 million, Rapoport added.
Simply put, thanks in part to Herbert playing at a high level on a rookie contract, the Chargers can afford this deal.
Instead of returning to Northern California, Mack will pack his bags for the southern portion of the state to join a Chargers team that narrowly missed the playoffs in 2021 after displaying title-chasing potential.
