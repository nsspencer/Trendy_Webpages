     R.I.P. Emilio Delgado, Luis from Sesame Street
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Emilio Delgado, best known for the 45 years he spent portraying kind-hearted repair shop owner Luis Rodriguez on legendary children’s entertainment program Sesame Street, has died.
Delgado was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2020; he was 81 when he died earlier today, in his New York City home.
Delgado’s life changed, more-or-less permanently, when he received a job offer in 1971, inviting him to leave California, fly to New York, and join the cast of Sesame Street.
As Luis, Delgado was instrumental to many of the most iconic moments in the show’s long history, including his character’s wedding to Manzano’s Maria, and the famous scene in which the adults of Sesame Street explain Mr. Hooper’s death to a grieving Big Bird.
In addition to his regular Street gig, Delgado also continued to work outside the series, appearing periodically in New York-shot productions.
