     Jussie Smollett returns to court in Chicago for sentencing after conviction for phony hate crime

     Summary: Ultimately, the sentencing decision is up to Linn, who will have a range of options.
Smollett was convicted of Class 4 felonies, the state’s lowest-level felony category.
The charges carry penalties of one to three years in prison, but also probation or conditional discharge, which is similar to probation but with less strict conditions.
Linn also could require Smollett to pay a fine or restitution.

     Summary: Jussie Smollett returns to court for sentencing for lying about an attack on himEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Beaty/AP Paul Beaty/APFormer Empire actor Jussie Smollett will appear in court Thursday to hear whether he will face time in prison after being convicted in 2021 on five felony counts of lying to the police.
In January 2019, Smollett, who is Black and gay, said he had been a victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago.
Two men confronted Smollett on the street, he claimed, and struck him with their hands and poured a chemical substance on him.
Johnson said that Smollett paid $3,500 to stage the attack on himself and "drag Chicago's reputation through the mud."
In court testimony in December, Smollett maintained his story and denied any allegations that he staged a fake attack.

     Former 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett to be sentenced in racist hoax attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett will get one last chance to publicly admit to fabricating a 2019 hate-crime attack on himself before learning whether a judge sentences him to prison.
Judge James Linn is allowing news cameras into Thursday's hearing, in which Smollett is expected to be granted an opportunity to speak.
Jesse Jackson and actor Samuel L. Jackson, have written Linn letters vouching for Smollett's character and asking him for leniency, according to ABC Chicago station WLS-TV.
Smollett's lawyers have said they plan to appeal the conviction and that Smollett is "100% confident" he will win.
The Osundairo brothers testified during Smollett's trial that the actor paid them $3,500 to help him orchestrate and stage the crime.

     Summary: But because Smollett does not have an extensive criminal history and the conviction is for a low-level nonviolent crime, experts do not expect that he will be sent to prison.

Smollett will be given a chance to speak to the judge and he could repeat some of the things he told jurors during the trial about how he was simply a victim of a violent crime.
Smollett could tell the judge as he told jurors about his extensive history of volunteering and donating to charitable causes.
He could also say that the fact that the case left his career in shambles is punishment enough for him avoid custody.

     Jussie Smollett scheduled to be sentenced for lying to police in hate crime hoax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly, and Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime.
At the hearing Thursday afternoon, attorneys are first expected to argue before Judge Linn over the actor's request to toss the verdict or grant him a new trial.
Smollett testified in his own defense to deny any such plan and said he paid the brothers only for training advice and nutritional tips.
Smollett has no prior feloniesThe primary question at sentencing is whether Smollett, who has no prior felonies, is sentenced to prison.
Chicago's Department of Law noted in the city's suit that over two dozen police officers and detectives spent weeks working on Smollett's case in 2019, resulting in 1,836 overtime hours.
