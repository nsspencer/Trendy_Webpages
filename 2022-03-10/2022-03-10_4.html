    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an exciting opening round that ran well past midnight, the rest of the Big East is ready to get in the action at Madison Square Garden.
Here is a look at each of the four quarterfinal games for the Thursday slate of the 2022 Big East Tournament.
The Bulldogs were slumping entering the Big East Tournament, losing each of their last five games to end the regular season.
UConn doesn’t plan on stopping short this time around, especially after losing in the Big East Tournament semifinals last season.
Sanogo gets most of the buzz, but Isaiah Whaley is no slouch and was the 2021 Big East Co-Defensive Player of the Year, an aspect that gets lost at times in the excitement for Sanogo.

     ACC tournament in Big East tournament’s shadow in New York | Raleigh News &amp; Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet so far in this ACC tournament, it has been a building begging for company.
Meanwhile, the Big East Tournament, much like the ACC’s, is not what it was.
Beyond that, though, the game mattered because in New York City the Big East Tournament still matters.
The Big East and New York City, meanwhile, don’t feel the need for a similar sort of formal designation.
No one needs to say it’s Big East Tournament Week for anyone to know what it represents there.
