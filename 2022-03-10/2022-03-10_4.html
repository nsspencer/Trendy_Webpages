     Play Ball! Lockout Ends as M.L.B. and Union Strike a Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It took 99 days of a contentious lockout, but baseball is back.
An agreement reached Thursday by Major League Baseball’s club owners and its players’ union after months of heated negotiations will allow for a full season, with opening day scheduled for April 7.
The five-year collective bargaining agreement will increase pay for young players and better incentivize teams to compete, among other provisions.
“Being back on the field is exciting for owners, players, fans as well,” Gerrit Cole, a Yankees star pitcher and a member of a union subcommittee that worked on the deal, said in a phone interview.
He then tried to strike a more conciliatory tone with players — and fans who watched the labor fight drag out in public and compromise spring training.

     Summary: Major League Baseball (MLB) and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) today, ending a 99-day lockout which began way back in early December 2021 and ended with the new deal ratified by the players then by the owners.
Between some mutual off-days, doubleheaders during pre-existing series and a few extra days after the original season finale, shouldn't be too tough to re-schedule those.
It’s why I picked up the phone after the ratification and called [MLBPA Executive Director] Tony [Clark] and expressed my desire to work with him.

They had 38 voters — one player representing each team, plus the eight members of the executive subcommittee — and voted 26-12 in favor.
Executive subcommittee voted 8-0 against deal and teams voted 26-4 in favor, sources tell @TheAthletic.

Other changes within the new CBA include:• A 12-team postseason, with the top two division winners earning first-round byes.

     Summary: After nearly 100 days of having its doors locked to the players, Major League Baseball’s lockout has finally come to an end after the owners and the Major League Baseball Players Association came to an agreement on Thursday afternoon.
Related Bet on the 2022 MLB season at DraftKings SportsbookThere are some things in this deal that won’t go into effect until at least 2023, which includes a lot of the rules changes that were bandied about during discussions.
That’s going into effect this year.
Starting this season, the postseason field is going to be 12 teams with the top two teams in each league getting a bye.
This time around, baseball simply staying active and in the daily sports conversation is a win for both MLB and the MLBPA.
