     Analysis: Madison Cawthorn is having a *very* bad week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No one likely is happier to see this week in the rearview mirror -- more on that in a second -- than North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who has had a hellish last few days.
Earlier this week, CNN reported that for the second time in the last five years, Cawthorn was facing charges of driving with a revoked license .
Photos of a 2017 trip Cawthorn made to Adolf Hitler's vacation house -- prior to running for Congress -- surfaced on Instagram.
In the wake of the controversy, Cawthorn said that "the syntax of our language was unclear and unfairly implied I was criticizing Cory Booker."
Especially when you consider that Cawthorn hasn't even served a single full term in Congress.
