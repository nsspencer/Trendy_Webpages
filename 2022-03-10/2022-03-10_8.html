     Jen Psaki turns table on reporter trying to link Biden to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki wasn’t having it when a reporter tried to link President Joe Biden with Florida’s infamous “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
The law would ban elementary school teachers from mentioning LGBTQ topics in class.
And what we’re looking at here is a bill that would propagate misinformed, hateful policies and impact children,” Psaki responded.
“So that’s the question I hope – maybe you can pose that to some of the leaders in Florida.
Ron DeSantis (R) to discuss somehow preventing the bill – which would stop teachers from mentioning LGBTQ people in elementary schools – from being weaponized against LGBTQ people.

     Summary: White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room on 9 March 2022.
(Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty)White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to get into Biden voting against the “promotion of homosexuality” in 1994, instead focusing on Florida’s “horrific” so-called Don’t Say Gay bill.
“I mean, the president has spoken to that.”Psaki’s comments about the “Don’t Say Gay” bill were in response to questions from a New York Post reporter on Biden’s voting history as a senator in the 90s.
US secretary of education Miguel Cardona has criticised Florida lawmakers for pushing “hateful” legislation including the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which he said will “hurt some of the students most in need”.
He also reminded Florida that federal law will protect LGBT+ students’ rights, and he said schools could risk losing federal funding if they don’t follow civil rights law.

     Summary: Posted Thursday, March 10, 2022 10:08 amWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki began Wednesday's briefing by taking questions from reporters sitting behind the first row, an unusual step that comes shortly after griping among some reporters about who gets to ask questions and for how long.
"I heard there was a little kerfuffle in here after the briefing yesterday," Psaki said with a slight smirk before opening the briefing room for questions.
"What we're going to do today is we're going to start with the third and fourth row and fifth and sixth row, get more people's questions answered."

     Summary: ”The controversial legislation has been coined the “ Don’t Say Gay ” bill by critics who argue that the proposed curricular restrictions further stigmatize LGBTQ+ children and undermine existing protections in place for them at school.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the bill into law .
Is it wanting to make kids have more difficult times in school, in their communities?” she said.
Advertisement“How many parents want their kids to have transgenderism or something injected into classroom instruction?” DeSantis said.
“It’s basically saying for our younger students, do you really want them being taught about sex?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House press secretary Jen Psaki attempted to cover for President Biden's comment that he "can’t do much" about gas prices, explaining on Wednesday that "short gaggles" when Biden's getting ready to travel are "not always super comprehensive."
"I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home," the president said Wednesday.
Does the president believe there is action that he can take to address gas prices, or does he believe there’s not much that can be done?"
He warned of ever-increasing gas prices.
Others believe Biden administration policies, especially the canceling of permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, have something to do with the high gas prices facing Americans today.
