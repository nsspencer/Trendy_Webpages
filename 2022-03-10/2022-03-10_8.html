     Cawthorn calls Zelensky a 'thug,' Ukrainian government 'evil' in video

     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” and the Ukrainian government “evil” in a video obtained and published by North Carolina affiliate WRAL amid the ongoing Russian invasion.
"Remember that Zelenskyy is a thug," Cawthorn said in the recording.
"Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies."
Russia’s government has been pushing false claims about the Ukrainian government and Zelensky, calling them neo-Nazis and drug dealers in an attempt to justify their aggression.
The Kremlin is using these lies to portray themselves as the hero of a war they are fighting to liberate the people of Ukraine.
