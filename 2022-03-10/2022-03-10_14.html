     Hayden Christensen Recalls “Special Moment” on Obi-Wan Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: to convince Hayden Christensen to join the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
In order to get Hayden involved in the project, the series director Deborah Chow went to the 40-year-old actor in person.
"Deborah came up and we spent the day chatting," Hayden told Entertainment Weekly.
While slipping back into Darth Vader's suit "was very surreal," Hayden says another moment hit him even harder: Seeing Ewan return to his original role.
"The first time that I saw Ewan as Obi-Wan again," Hayden said, "that was a very special moment for me, and one that I'll remember for a very, very long time."
