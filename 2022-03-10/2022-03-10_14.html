     UNC Basketball: Tar Heels in need of victory to get off 8/9 line?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsIs the UNC basketball program still on a collision course with a 1-seed in the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament?
Now, with a much healthier postseason resume and safety in the NCAA Tournament’s field of 68 come Selection Sunday, the Tar Heels are trying to build on their current projected positioning in the big dance.
ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi still has the Tar Heels on that dreaded 8/9 seed line following their quarterfinal blowout of the Cavaliers, and it looks like it may take one more victory for them to jump up to the historically safer 7-line.
On the other hand, a title-game victory over the winner of the Duke/Miami game could catapult the Tar Heels into a very favorable position come NCAA Tournament time.

     2022 ACC Tournament: What should UNC basketball, Hubert Davis expect from Virginia Tech in semifinals?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In other words, expect a lot of points at the Barclays Center when third-seeded UNC plays seventh-seeded VT in Friday’s ACC Tournament semifinals with a Saturday night championship berth at stake.
UNC is 2-0 against Virginia Tech this season, with a 78-68 home win on Jan. 5 and a 65-57 road win on Feb. 19.
Another stop on the postseason commonwealth tour and a third matchup with Virginia Tech, the lowest remaining seed in the ACC Tournament which defeated second-seeded Notre Dame, 87-80, earlier on Thursday night.
That split – Aluma and Mutts patrolling down low with a stable of backcourt shooters to supplement their paint production – can make Virginia Tech a sneaky matchup.
They’re just a very difficult team to match up with.”UNC and Virginia Tech are scheduled to tip off at 9:30 p.m. on Friday on ESPN.

     ACC tournament 2022: UNC basketball beats Virginia Cavaliers | Raleigh News &amp; Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But North Carolina gave the Cavaliers a dose of what that feels like in its 63-43 win during the ACC tournament quarterfinals on Thursday.
It was the fewest points allowed in a first half during the shot clock era in ACC tournament history.
And the 43 total points allowed were also the fewest in an ACC tournament game in the shot clock era, which began in 1985-86.
“I thought where we got our confidence and our strength was us continuing to get defensive stops,” UNC coach Hubert Davis said.
“That’s something that we’ve talked about the entire season is validating a good performance, validating a win, validating who we are as a team,” Davis said.
