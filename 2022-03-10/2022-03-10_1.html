     Summary: Grimes and Elon Musk are now the parents of two.
In Vanity Fair's April 2022 cover story published Thursday, the singer said she and Musk welcomed their second child, who was born in December 2021, via surrogate.
The two also have a 22-month-old son, X Æ A-12.
The name of their second child is Exa Dark Sideræl, nicknamed "Y," Grimes told the magazine.

     Summary: Taylor Hill/Getty ImagesElon Musk and Grimes have welcomed a new baby to their brood, via surrogate.
And like her big brother, Grimes’ first child X Æ A-Xii, the new addition has an…interesting name: Exa Dark Sideræl [sigh-DEER-ee-al] Musk.
For the record, they normally just refer to her as Y, Grimes says in a wife-ranging feature piece in Vanity Fair — and their son usually goes by X.
The new baby’s name was born of a multitude of references, Grimes explains, with “Exa” as in exaflops, or the ability for a computer to perform a quintillion operations a second.
We’re best friends.

This goes by fast onscreen, but Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson) is not a wife but a concubine.
Grimes saw herself in Jessica, and she saw X in Jessica’s son, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet).
In solidarity with all the new moms out there, Grimes is wearing the same outfit as yesterday.
We’re all gonna do stupid things.” She’s talking about Musk, but once again she could be talking about herself.

     Grimes and Elon Musk Had a Secret Baby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Charles Sykes/Invision/AP/ShutterstockIt is hard to predict the behavior of someone who literally sold her soul as performance art, but this news still came as a shock to me: Grimes and Elon Musk had a baby at the end of 2021.
Apparently, they are now co-parenting a second child named Exa Dark Sideræl— Y for short — who was born via surrogate in December.
According to Grimes, Y was supposed to stay a secret but had an ill-timed tantrum during the singer’s recent interview with Vanity Fair.
Speaking of: it sounds like Grimes and Musk were briefly, sort of, back together.
