     Kevin Durant Calls Out 76ers Fans After Nets’ Blowout Win in Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Simmons watched on, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Seth Curry led Brooklyn to a dominant 129–100 win in the highly anticipated matchup.
After the game, Durant had some parting words for 76ers fans, some of whom left the blowout early after heckling Simmons, who has yet to make his season debut.
“He already knew that we had his back, but it just felt good to quiet all of them down midway through the game,” Durant said.
“It was very quiet towards the end, we didn’t hear no more Ben Simmons chants from the Sixers fans.
It was more Nets fans in here than anything.”As Durant gave his brief interview on TNT, Nets fans sticking around the Wells Fargo Center showered him with “MVP” chants usually reserved for Joel Embiid in that building.

     A Brewing Rivalry Goes the Nets’ Way, for One Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Nets went about their business of plowing their way to a 129-100 win, a few narratives, some of them familiar, surfaced: Who would want to face the Nets in the first round of the playoffs?
Has there even been a more dangerous team that has spent so many months teetering on mediocrity?
And after that debacle, what are we supposed to make of the new-look 76ers, a team that has been vying for the top seed in the Eastern Conference?
“I don’t want to say they wanted to win any more than us,” said Doc Rivers, the coach of the 76ers.
Against the 76ers, he scored 24 points while helping to space the floor for Irving and Kevin Durant.

     Nets Notes: Simmons, Curry, Irving
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As expected, Ben Simmons faced plenty of invective from the Philadelphia faithful in his return to Wells Fargo Center, but it was the Nets who had the last laugh on Thursday night, blowing out the Sixers by a score of 129-100 in their first matchup since February’s blockbuster Simmons/James Harden trade.
So they focused on the court tonight, and it’s hard for you chant at Ben Simmons when you’re losing by that much.”It’s a safe bet that Simmons will face more vitriol during future visits to Wells Fargo Center, especially once he’s actually on the court.
But head coach Steve Nash said it was good for the three-time All-Star to get through his first experience as a visitor in Philadelphia.
He looked happy to be here,” Nash said, per Lewis.
“I think he was happy to get it out of the way.”Here are a few more Nets-related notes:

     James Harden, Sixers see loss to Nets as a wake-up call to get better
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers have aspirations of winning a championship as they brought in James Harden in a blockbuster trade from the Brooklyn Nets back on Feb. 10.
“Tonight (Thursday) was good for us, man,” said Harden who shot 3-for-17 on the night.
The Nets got big games out of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Seth Curry on the night and the Sixers have to learn from this.
We’ve got to figure out ways to better ourselves as a group, so we don’t have nights like this.
We gotta learn from it and grow from it for sure.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The city of Philadelphia had waited five months for Ben Simmons to show up for a game, longer if you count last postseason.
6 Cavaliers, Brooklyn could easily end up being the team the Sixers face in the first round of the playoffs as either the No.
What makes Brooklyn such a dangerous matchup for the Sixers is its ability to negate Embiid’s impact on the defensive end.
The thoroughness with which they exploited the Sixers’ weaknesses could easily end up working in the latter’s advantage.
Late in the game, with the Nets up 30, the Sixers’ one-time No.

     Sixers stars react to indefensible blowout loss to Ben Simmons-less Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans poured into the arena early at the chance to see Ben Simmons and voice their opinion.
While the former Sixers has still yet to debut for Brooklyn, he joined his new team on the bench.
First up was Doc Rivers, who cited lack of intensity and physicality as two key issues for the Sixers.
We had no intensity defensively, ball wasn’t moving, we didn’t do a great job of making the extra pass.
It’s safe to say that after a brutal loss like this, the honeymoon phase is over for the new-look Sixers.

“The whole team struggled.
