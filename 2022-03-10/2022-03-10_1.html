     Jussie Smollett returns to court in Chicago for sentencing after conviction for phony hate crime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ultimately, the sentencing decision is up to Linn, who will have a range of options.
Smollett was convicted of Class 4 felonies, the state’s lowest-level felony category.
The charges carry penalties of one to three years in prison, but also probation or conditional discharge, which is similar to probation but with less strict conditions.
Linn also could require Smollett to pay a fine or restitution.

     Summary: But because Smollett does not have an extensive criminal history and the conviction is for a low-level nonviolent crime, experts do not expect that he will be sent to prison.

Smollett will be given a chance to speak to the judge and he could repeat some of the things he told jurors during the trial about how he was simply a victim of a violent crime.
Smollett could tell the judge as he told jurors about his extensive history of volunteering and donating to charitable causes.
He could also say that the fact that the case left his career in shambles is punishment enough for him avoid custody.

     Jussie Smollett to face sentencing Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS – MARCH 26: Actor Jussie Smollett after his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.
Smollett testified in his defense during last year’s trial and he steadfastly denied any involvement in the phony hate crime plan.
Just weeks after he reported the attack to police, prosecutors approved disorderly conduct charges against Smollett.
Webb brought a new set of disorderly conduct charges against Smollett in February 2021.
Smollett was written out of “Empire,” and he testified last year that his career as an actor was derailed by the ordeal.

     Jussie Smollett scheduled to be sentenced for lying to police in hate crime hoax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly, and Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime.
At the hearing Thursday afternoon, attorneys are first expected to argue before Judge Linn over the actor's request to toss the verdict or grant him a new trial.
Smollett testified in his own defense to deny any such plan and said he paid the brothers only for training advice and nutritional tips.
Smollett has no prior feloniesThe primary question at sentencing is whether Smollett, who has no prior felonies, is sentenced to prison.
Chicago's Department of Law noted in the city's suit that over two dozen police officers and detectives spent weeks working on Smollett's case in 2019, resulting in 1,836 overtime hours.
