    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the MLB lockout ended Thursday, the Hot Stove began heating up with rumors the New York Yankees were preparing to chase free-agent first baseman Freddie Freeman.
They are not willing to trade SS prospect Anthony Volpe.”MORE MLB:- MLB rumors: Yankees, Mets broadcast plans; David Cone, Alex Rodriguez, Michael Kay will join ESPN’s playoffs coverage- MLB rumors: Ex-Yankees prospect with a big bat returns to the AL East- MLB rumors: N.J. native announces retirement after 5 big-league seasonsThe Oakland A’s are expected to trade the 27-year-old Olson, and have been linked to the Yankees, Atlanta Braves, San Diego Padres and Texas Rangers.
And Olson is more than just another bat, with a pair of Gold Glove Awards on his resume.
Olson’s future will depend in part on where Freeman and Anthony Rizzo decide to sign.
The Yankees are expected to be in the mix for all three sluggers, with Luke Voit the only full-time first baseman on New York’s 40-man roster.

     Yankees Rumors: Freddie Freeman 'Still on the Table' For New York as Free Agency Resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First baseman Freddie Freeman is "definitely still on the table" for the Yankees in free agency, a source told Brendan Kuty of NJ Advance Media on Thursday.
After MLB and the MLBPA reached an agreement to end the league's ongoing work stoppage, free agency is expected to resume imminently.
According to Kuty, New York will "waste no time" reaching out to Freeman's representatives to discuss a possible blockbuster deal.
If Freeman does elect to leave Atlanta in free agency, other big-market clubs like the Dodgers will be involved in the Freeman sweepstakes as well.
The Yankees have other options beyond Freeman when it comes to the first base position.

     MLB rumors: Will Dodgers steal Freddie Freeman from Yankees, Braves?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees definitely are a pursuer, too, a good source told NJ Advance Media baseball writer Brendan Kuty on Thursday night.
“Dodgers interest in Freddie Freeman is sincere, based on what I have heard from sources,” Morosi tweeted Thursday night.
For what it’s worth, the Dodgers had the highest payroll in baseball last year at $266 million and the Yankees were second at $205.7 million.
Other first base options for the Yankees include re-signing free agent Anthony Rizzo, who spent latter part of last season with them.
“Some in the industry believe he could be the next major free agent to sign,” Morosi tweeted.

     Braves’ pursuit shows bold free agency plan with Freddie Freeman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although the Atlanta Braves achieved their dream of winning the World Series, the offseason has been borderline nightmarish for them.
According to MLB Network’s Jon Morosi, the Braves had “detailed conversations” with star pitcher Justin Verlander.
Although he ended up going back to the Houston Astros, Morosi explains that the Braves want to add a starting pitcher as well as Freeman in free agency.
With teams like the New York Mets and Tampa Bay Rays showing interest in Freeman, the Braves need to focus heavily on re-signing him.
Despite the Braves’ need for pitching shouldn’t cloud their need to bring Freeman back.

     Summary: The Braves took a title they weren’t supposed to take, which always is a delight, and they did it being powered by guys who weren’t Braves on the Fourth of July.
It would have been a crime had this lockout lasted another month or even another week: We around here really, really want to see what the Braves do next.
Could the Braves really let him leave?
That truth should serve always as the lodestar for players and owners alike, but every so often it gets obscured.
And that’s baseball, for better or worse.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A couple hours before the third game of the 2021 World Series, Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman cut short a question about his pending free agency.“I think everyone in this room knows I want to stay here,” Freeman said.He had given similar answers before the season and during the season.
He gave the same answer after he, along with the rest of his Braves teammates, hoisted the Commissioner’s Trophy in Houston following Atlanta’s first World Series title since 1995.
Freeman hoped to spend the rest of his career with the franchise which drafted him in 2007.
Freeman had become the face of the franchise in Cobb County in the wake of Chipper Jones’s retirement.And yet …In the months leading up to the lockout, Freeman did not sign with Atlanta.
The fait accompli, the no-brainer that much of the industry predicted would come to pass, had not happened.
