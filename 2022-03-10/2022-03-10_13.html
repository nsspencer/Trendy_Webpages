     Growing confidence that Barcelona can re-sign Lionel Messi this summer after PSG nightmare
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is growing confidence that Barcelona could seal the emotional transfer return of the Lionel Messi this summer.
The Argentina international left the Nou Camp at the end of last season, joining Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, but his time in the French capital hasn’t gone to plan.
According to El Nacional, there now seems to be belief among key figures, including Barcelona manager Xavi and Messi himself, that a return to the Catalan giants could be possible.
The report states that although this seemed impossible a few weeks ago, the mood now seems to be changing, and Barcelona could fund the move by offloading the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann, while Ousmane Dembele’s departure on a free transfer would also free up space on their wage bill.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Pep Guardiola is currently at Manchester City and Lionel Messi is at Paris Saint-Germain, the duo spent four absolutely fantastic seasons together at Barcelona.
So much so, that Guardiola’s time at Barcelona will see him go down as one of the best managers in football history while the team is also considered to be one of the best ever.
Because, during his tenure at the Camp Nou, the Spaniard won every trophy available including two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles.

     'Having Messi was like Phil Jackson having Michael Jordan' - Guardiola says he owes former Barcelona star a 'good bottle of wine'

     Summary: Pep Guardiola says that he owes Lionel Messi “a good bottle of wine” and has compared the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner with basketball legend Michael Jordan.
Likening his former charge to a man often named as the greatest basketball player of all time, Guardiola told Ole: “What does Messi mean?
“I owe him a good bottle of wine to thank him for the contracts he allowed me to sign!
“We had an amazing group of players who helped him when we were together at Barcelona in those four years.
No, impossible.”The bigger pictureWhile Guardiola continues to enjoy a successful coaching career with Manchester City, many believe that Messi's time at the very top of the game is coming to an end.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Barcelona manager and current Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola likened Lionel Messi’s impact to that of Basketball legend Michael Jordan.
Speaking on Spotify for ‘La Primera Jugada‘, a podcast by the Argentine newspaper Ole, Guardiola had nothing but kind words for the player with whom he won two UEFA Champions League titles in three years.
Everything, everything, Messi is like Michael Jordan,” Guardiola told Ole.
The two were close to reuniting last summer when Lionel Messi was forced to leave Barcelona.
The Rosario native, however, decided to pick the Paris Saint-Germain project and his career trajectory hasn’t been the same since.

     Summary: In his place comes a brash young Frenchman, 11 years Messi's junior, going by the name of Kylian Mbappe.
Planet Sport crunches the numbers to compare Mbappe now with Messi at the age of 23 years and four months.
However, PSG's domestic dominance means he is in fact dead level, also having won 11 trophies.
He does also hold the honour of having won Ligue 1 for four seasons in a row between 2016/17 and 2019/20, across two different teams.
Winner: Kylian MbappeOverall winner: Kylian Mbappe (4-1)Planet Earth, prepare for some quite sheer footballing dominance over the coming years from Kylian Mbappe.

     Summary: Remembering when Messi got drunk off his nut &amp; wrestled a Chupa ChupFor all of Lionel Messi’s gargantuan fame and enormous success with Barcelona and Argentina, he remains a distinctly private person.
Before we ruminate on Messi’s enormous Chupa Chup, though, the build-up to the occasion that saw him let loose is more than worth looking back on.
He already had two La Liga titles, a Champions League medal and a Ballon d’Or third-place finish to his name for crying out loud.
Another one of Messi's forgotten champions league performances, this time against Bayern Munich in the quarter finals in 2009.
The highlight came when he reached his team-mate holding a giant inflatable Chupa Chup, which Messi tries to wrestle away.
