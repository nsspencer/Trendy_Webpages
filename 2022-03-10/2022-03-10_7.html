    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 20 and third-seeded UConn men’s basketball team will take on sixth-seeded Seton Hall in the Big East tournament quarterfinals, in the first Big East tournament with Huskies fans in attendance since 2012.
Both squads come into this game hot, with UConn winning seven of their last eight, and Seton Hall riding a six game win streak.
With the amount of length that Seton Hall possesses across the board, shooting over them and finding lanes to penetrate their defense isn’t easy.
This is an edge the Huskies need to keep the tournament to advance far, and it begins with the Seton Hall game in the quarterfinals.
Akok started the first contest against Seton Hall and was 2-4 from three.

     Summary: 1 seed in the Big East Tournament: just barely surviving, seemingly never running out of nails to bite.
9 Butler in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals at the Garden on Thursday afternoon.
In front of an announced sell-out of 19,812 – largely Providence fans – in Midtown, Providence stole a game with some clutch work late.
Providence won the Big East regular-season title – for the first time in program history – without a single member on the All-Big East First Team.
Watson finished with 26 points on 9 of 14 shooting, including five big points in the final five minutes, which were jump-started by his coach.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an exciting opening round that ran well past midnight, the rest of the Big East is ready to get in the action at Madison Square Garden.
Here is a look at each of the four quarterfinal games for the Thursday slate of the 2022 Big East Tournament.
The Bulldogs were slumping entering the Big East Tournament, losing each of their last five games to end the regular season.
UConn doesn’t plan on stopping short this time around, especially after losing in the Big East Tournament semifinals last season.
Sanogo gets most of the buzz, but Isaiah Whaley is no slouch and was the 2021 Big East Co-Defensive Player of the Year, an aspect that gets lost at times in the excitement for Sanogo.

Meanwhile, the Big East Tournament, much like the ACC’s, is not what it was.
Beyond that, though, the game mattered because in New York City the Big East Tournament still matters.
The Big East and New York City, meanwhile, don’t feel the need for a similar sort of formal designation.
