     Tommy Fleetwood Loses His Beard, Finds a Place Atop the Leaderboard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Tommy Fleetwood, a golfer once ranked in the men’s top 10, has been missing from a PGA Tour leaderboard for so long, fans may not have recognized him when he vaulted into first place during the first round at the Players Championship here on Thursday.
Fleetwood has also shaved his trademark — and popular — frowzy beard.
And it turns out the facial hair is missing, in part, because of his recent two years of jagged play, which resulted in Fleetwood losing his PGA Tour playing privileges.
“I was in a really bad mood,” Fleetwood, 31, said.
“It was break some golf clubs or shave my beard.

     Tommy Fleetwood, Tom Hoge share early lead at weather-disrupted Players Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) England's Tommy Fleetwood and American Tom Hoge finished Thursday with an early share of the Players Championship lead after a weather-disrupted opening day.
The first round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events was initially delayed by over an hour due to over an inch of rain falling overnight at TPC Sawgrass, Florida.
And then later in the day, play was delayed by four hours and 14 minutes after thunderstorms rolled into the area.
The delays and an early finish because of darkness meant that more than half of the field were unable to finish their opening rounds.
Fleetwood, who has gone two years since his last victory, was one of those who was able to finish, shooting a six-under-par 66 to lead with Hoge.

Tommy Fleetwood's 6-under 66 at TPC Sawgrass led the rain-delayed first round lead at the Players Championship.
Unlike the power players who can always rely on their prodigious tee shots, Fleetwood’s game has to be hitting on most cylinders for him to compete.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Round 1 of the 2022 Players Championships was upended by two separate rain delays totaling five hours on Thursday.
That turned TPC Sawgrass into a point-and-shoot track miles from the fast and firm conditions that normally make it famous this time of year.
Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Hoge co-lead at 6 under with four players just behind them at 5 under after Day 1.
If his short game continues to show up, he could have two wins at the two biggest events of 2022 so far (TPC Sawgrass and the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club).
