     Radhe Shyam Movie Review: Uneven narration affects Prabhas and Pooja Hegde's visually pleasing love story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Title: Radhe Shyam (Telugu)Cast: Prabhas, Pooja Hegde and othersDirector: Radha Krishna KumarRun-Time: 138 minutesRating: 2.5Can love trump destiny?
Vikramaditya (Prabhas) is a palmist who is known for infallible predictions.
When he gets attracted to a doctor named Prerana (Pooja Hegde), he wonders if his fate can be altered at all.
Prerana falls in love with him all the more deeply after a crisis hits her (and steps aside in a hurry).
The film assiduously lacks tense moments that can keep us perched at the edge of our seats.

     Summary: Radhe Shyam review: Prabhas and Pooja Hedge’s fairytale romance is all about visualsThough the lead pair is likable together, they’re not really convincing as epic lovers like Radhe-Shyam, after whom the film is titled.
Flix ReviewThere is a childlike simplicity to director Radha Krishna Kumar’s Radhe Shyam.
To make all this look convincing in a Telugu film, Radha Krisha Kumar transports his cast to 1970s Italy, rich with old world charm and natural beauty.
‘It’s all written in the vedas’ is a popular propagandist line that has gained strength in the country with the current political climate, and Radhe Shyam is happy to milk it.
Radhe Shyam could have been a much better film if the writing had been stronger and the characters more fleshed out.

     Summary: What does an ace palmist who declares that he is never wrong in his predictions, have in common with a pretty young thing who enjoys hanging out of open train doors?
It’s love, of course, stupid, the kind that ‘Radhe Shyam’ expects us to swallow, hook, line and so many sinkers, while we keep collecting our jaw off the floor.
Vikramaditya (Prabhas) strides across a marble floor, surrounded by armed guards, and fetches up by Mrs Indira Gandhi’s (Flora Jacob, looking remarkably like the Congress leader) side.
Cut to Rome, where Vikramaditya meets-cute with Prerna (Pooja Hegde) in a rail compartment: remember I told you about her thing for open train doors.

“Radhe Shyam” has been aggressively promoted as a romantic thriller, and the film’s promotions have generated tremendous hype.
Highlights:Lavish visualsGrand production design/valuesPrabhas and Pooja Hegde’s looksSome poetic momentsDrawback:Weak songsNo multiple dimensionsAnalysisThe much-hyped Prabhas starrer “Radhe Shyam” is an out-and-out love story.
“Radhe Shyam” ends up with miserably ordinary songs.
“Radhe Shyam” is one of the costliest productions in Indian cinema.

     Radhe Shyam movie review: Nothing makes sense in Prabhas and Pooja Hegde's film about a palmist in love
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Also read: Radhe Shyam gets mixed response from fans, some call it 'unbearable’)By now, I was convinced that Radha Krishna Kumar's Radhe Shyam's unique plot will serve us with something never-seen-before.
But their love defies all logic and that's where Radhe Shyam falters.
And don't even bother thinking why the title was Radhe Shyam, for I didn't see any logic even there.
Set in the 1970's Europe with pristine and scenic views, Radhe Shyam is beautifully decked up with old world charm giving it a fairytale touch.
Given that Radhe Shyam is touted to be a music romantic drama, it scores well on that front.

     Radhe Shyam movie review: A shallow story and lacklustre screenplay make this Prabhas and Pooja Hegde film boring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shallow story and lacklustre screenplay make ‘Radhe Shyam’ a colossal boreA shallow story and lacklustre screenplay make ‘Radhe Shyam’ a colossal boreAt the end of Radhe Shyam, what stayed with me were its picture perfect frames that were painstakingly made to look like paintings.
Sure, the film boasts of Prabhas and Pooja Hegde who have a good screen presence.
In this period drama set in the 1970s, the protagonist Vikramaditya (Prabhas) is positioned as ‘the Einstein of palmistry’.
For the first hour or so, the aesthetic visuals, the music (background score by S S Thaman) and the lead actors who are made to look picture-perfect, accentuate the dreamy setting.
Radhe Shyam could have benefited with some of that soul in its writing.
