     Ja Morant reacts to NBA‚Äôs explanation for ridiculous ejection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Owen Crisafulli ¬∑ 2 min readJa Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies have quietly risen to the top of the crowded Western Conference standings this season.
The reasoning for Morant‚Äôs ejection was that he was questioning an official‚Äôs integrity, which did not appear to happen.
Morant was talking with a fan while free throws were being shot, and was promptly assessed his second technical foul in a span of 11 seconds.
In the blink of an eye, Morant was ejected from the game, and the Grizzlies found themselves in a tough spot.
It was certainly a strange ejection for Morant, and this appears to be another incident of questionable officiating in the NBA this season.
