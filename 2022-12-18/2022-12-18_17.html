     Twitter Hypes Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux for Dominant Showing in Win over Commanders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lee Coleman/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesThe New York Giants have the inside track on a playoff spot thanks in large part to their rookie defensive end.
Despite an inconsistent offensive performance, the New York Giants escaped Sunday's NFC East showdown with a 20-12 victory over the Washington Commanders at FedEx Field.
The teams tied two weeks ago and had identical 7-5-1 records entering the game, but the Giants moved ahead with a critical head-to-head win.
While Saquon Barkley is often the headliner for New York and scored a touchdown, it was defensive end Kayvon Thibodeaux who stole the show.
He finished with 12 tackles, three tackles for loss, one sack, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and, most importantly, a defensive touchdown.
