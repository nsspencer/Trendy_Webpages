Commanders head coach Ron Rivera seethed after the game, via the official transcript.
Snapshots of the play looked like Holmes initiated contact before the ball arrived, driving through Samuel's back.
Referee John Hussey told pool reporter Nicki Jhabvala that officials didn't deem enough contact to warrant a flag.
"To the officials it didn't rise to what they felt was a restriction, thus they didn't call it.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants win in dramatic fashion over their division rivals to improve their postseason chances.
The New York Giants earned their biggest win of the season, and their first win against a division opponent, by defeating the Washington Commanders at FedEx Field, 20-12.
The Giants went three-and-out on their first possession, and the Commanders responded with another drive into Giants territory, advancing as far as the 23.
A pair of penalties, however, forced Washington to settle for Joey Slye’s 41-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead.
After the Giants’ defense forced the Commanders to punt, the offense was pinned all the way back to their own 3-yard line.

     Summary: On Sunday, something had to give between the Washington Commanders and New York Giants.
Obviously, the game came down to the final minute, with Washington coming up six yards short of potentially tying the game.
After the game, Giants head coach Brian Daboll gave Jones a hearty hug with a "love you man" for good measure.
Then rookie Kayvon Thibodeaux, one of the Giants' first-round picks from the 2022 draft, flipped the game on its head.
On the field prior to the game, Thibodeaux gave a speech to his teammates, an example of his leadership evolution, running back Saquon Barkley said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants snapped a month long winless skid on Sunday Night with a crucial division victory over the Washington Commanders.
The Giants defense stole the show as they held Washington’s offense in check in their 20-12 win from FedEx Field.
New York and Washington had played just two weeks before their primetime showdown and settled for a tie in the Meadowlands.
The Giants defense kept Taylor Heinicke and the Commanders offense quiet for much of the first half, giving up just a field goal on Washington’s second drive of the game.
On 3rd and 4 inside the 10 yard line, Dexter Lawrence strip sacked Heinicke and recovered the fumble to keep the Commanders trailing by five.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington also was upset with an offensive pass interference penalty that wiped out a 2-point conversion in the third quarter.
McLaurin was upset because he said he didn't line up differently than he had at other times in the game.
"When I moved up, I checked to see if I was good, and he said I was good," McLaurin said.
Heinicke said, "Oh yeah," when asked if he thought pass interference should have been called.
Referee John Hussey told a pool reporter that Darnay Holmes' coverage on Curtis Samuel "didn't rise to what they felt was a restriction."
