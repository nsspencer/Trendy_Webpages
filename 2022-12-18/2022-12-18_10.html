     Initial Reactions to the Panthers' Loss to Pittsburgh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Panthers fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday afternoon, 24-16.
They beat Carolina in their own game of running the football and dominating both sides of the line of scrimmage.
The Panthers failed to get the ground game going in the first half, which is obviously a major issue.
Carolina ran the ball for just 14 yards on 10 carries and D'Onta Foreman averaged just 0.5 yards per carry.
For much of the first half, Taylor was matched up on George Pickens and it didn't pan out all that well.

     Steelers damage Panthers' playoff hopes with win behind Jaylen Warren, Mitch Trubisky

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mitch Trubisky threw for 179 yards and engineered three long touchdown drives as the Pittsburgh Steelers held on to beat Carolina 24-16 on Sunday, dealing the Panthers‚Äô playoff hopes a major blow.
The Panthers (5-9) entered the weekend in control of their playoff destiny, needing four wins in four games to win the unimpressive NFC South.
Carolina finished that drive with a field goal by Eddy Pineiro.
But the Steelers burned another 5:13 off the clock and went 43 yards to set up Chris Boswell's 50-yard field goal to make it a two-possession game.
Pineiro's third field goal, a 52-yarder, trimmed the lead to eight with 19 seconds left, but George Pickens recovered the onside kick.

Jaylen Warren capped off the drive with a two yard touchdown run to give the Steelers the 14-7 lead.
The defensive struggles continued for the Panthers when the Steelers converted a 3rd &amp; 14 in their own territory to keep the chains moving.

     Summary: Panthers' identity stolen by Steelers' D in 24-16 defeat Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold is sacked by Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt, left, and defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi during the second half of an NFL football game between the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Dec. 18, 2022, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Rusty Jones)CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) The Carolina Panthers have boasted the last few weeks about finding an identity on offense by playing smash-mouth football.
That identity was stolen on Sunday by the Pittsburgh Steelers.
''Didn't establish the run game at all.
''They did a good job of stopping our run game and getting pressure,'' Darnold said.
Darnold expects teams will follow the Steelers' plan to stop the run, but he insists Carolina can make adjustments.
