     Red Sox, Justin Turner agree on contract for near $22M

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Red Sox have an agreement with former Dodger infielder Justin Turner as they’ve signed the 38-year-old to a two-year deal worth $22 million deal.
Lee tweeted:“Third baseman Justin Turner and the Boston Red Sox are in agreement on a contract, sources tell me and @JeffPassan Turner, 38, is expected to spend most of his time at designated hitter or first base, with Rafael Devers at third.
Speier tweeted:“Justin Turner contract is a one-year deal with a player option for 2024.
The Red Sox designated Eric Hosmer for assignment seemingly to clear a path for Casas.
The Red Sox could use Turner at DH, at first base against left-handed pitching or at third base when Rafael Devers either gets a day off or plays DH himself.

Following the departure of shortstop Xander Bogaerts, the Red Sox have added a former NLCS MVP to their infield.

     Red Sox "Looking Close" To Signing Justin Turner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4:54PM: The Red Sox have agreed to a deal with infielder Justin Turner, according to ESPN’s Joon Lee and Jeff Passan (Twitter links).
As it turned out, the Dodgers and Red Sox will unofficially swap veteran hitters, with Martinez heading to Los Angeles and Turner coming to Boston.
Xander Bogaerts’ departure to the Padres has led to a lot of hard feelings from Red Sox Nation directed towards ownership and chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom.
It would seem like starting pitching, catching, and the outfield remain on Bloom’s checklist, given the other players the Red Sox have at least checked in on this winter.
After surpassing the luxury tax threshold in 2022, the Red Sox are thus far well under the $233MM threshold.
