     Cecily Strong Leaves 'SNL' After 11 Seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a sad night at Saturday Night Live when the realization set in that Cecily Strong was leaving the hit sketch series.
Now the longest-serving female cast member, Strong has been with the series for eleven seasons and has, personally, been a gift to the musical theatre fans out there.
Pour one out for the "Game Night" sketch from Chris Pine's episode that was inspired by Sunday in the Park with George.
And what a way to send Strong off.
But the real emotions came flooding out when it seemed like the episode was coming to an end and, to send Strong off, Butler sang her a Christmas song.
