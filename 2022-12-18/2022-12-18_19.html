    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ale Moreno says the World Cup final delivered on every level as Argentina took the trophy in dramatic fashion.
(1:26)Moreno: World Cup final the best game I have ever seen (1:26)Argentina were made to suffer before landing their first World Cup title in 36 years, having twice squandered a lead, including in extra-time before edging past defending champions France 4-2 on penalties in the final on Sunday.
"It was a game where we suffered," said Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who saved one penalty in the shootout on Sunday after previously saving two more spot kicks in their quarterfinal against Netherlands.
"There could not have been a World Cup that I have dreamed of like this.
It was the third world title for Argentina and the first since the late Diego Maradona won the trophy almost single-handedly in 1986.
