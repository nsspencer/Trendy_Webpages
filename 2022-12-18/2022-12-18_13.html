     Turbulent Hawaiian Airlines flight seriously injures 11 people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In all, 36 people received medical treatment following Sunday's turbulent Hawaiian Airlines flight for bumps, bruises, cuts and nausea, said Jim Ireland, director of Honolulu Emergency Medical Services.
Hawaiian Airlines Chief Operating Officer Jon Snook said such turbulence is isolated and unusual, noting the airline had not experienced anything like it in recent history.
There was some internal damage to the aircraft during the turbulence, Snook said.
In 2019, 37 passengers and flight crew members were injured when an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sydney hit intense turbulence about two hours past Hawaii.
Over the Atlantic, a 2017 American Airlines flight from Athens hit severe turbulence along the New York coastline.
