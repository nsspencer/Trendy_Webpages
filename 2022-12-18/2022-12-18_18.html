     Twitter bans users from linking to other social media platforms like Instagram and Mastodon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, during the World Cup, Twitter officially banned its users from linking to their profiles on other social media sites like Mastodon, Facebook, and Instagram.
The policy means Twitter users flocking to Mastodon are no longer allowed to tell their followers to go there instead, for instance.
Interestingly, Twitter is only targeting a handful of platforms with its new policy — not all social media sites.
The company specifies the prohibited platforms are “Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Post and Nostr.”It is also banning links to social media profile aggregators like linktr.ee.
These are services that offer a unified page of many social media accounts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Send this page to someone via emailTwitter on Sunday said that it will remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames.
The move would impact content from social media platforms like Meta Platforms’ META.O Facebook and Instagram, along with Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post while allowing cross-content posting, Twitter support said in a tweet.
Story continues below advertisementLast week, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, a volunteer group formed in 2016 to advise the social media platform on site decisions.
The policy change follows other chaotic actions at Twitter since Elon Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla TSLA.O, bought the social network.
He fired top management and laid off about half of its workforce, while seesawing on how much to charge for Twitter’s subscription service Twitter Blue.

     Summary: Should we have a policy preventing the creation of or use of existing accounts for the main purpose of advertising other social media platforms?
Essentially, you can’t post links to your other social profiles or even type out your handle in a tweet.
The Elon Musk-owned company “no longer allows free promotion of certain social media platforms” on Twitter.
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) December 18, 2022“We know that many of our users may be active on other social media platforms; however, going forward, Twitter will no longer allow free promotion of specific social media platforms on Twitter,” the social platform said on its policy page.
When Lorenz posted her other social media handles and was suspended, this policy did not yet exist.
