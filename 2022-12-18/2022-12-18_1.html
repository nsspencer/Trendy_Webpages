So much so, that she was honored with a Google Doodle on Monday.
When she was 19, poet Samuel Ampzing called Leyster an artist of "good and keen insight."
In 2009, the National Gallery of Art and the Franz Hals museum in Haarlem held a retrospective of her work.

     Judith Leyster Gets Mainstream Recognition in the Form of a Google Doodle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Judith Leyster, one of the few female Old Masters whose work has been upheld alongside her male colleagues, is the subject of a Google Doodle today that’s intended to bring her more mainstream recognition.
In 1633, she was admitted into Haarlem’s most important artists’ group, the Guild of St. Luke, making her the first female artist ever to obtain that status.
“One could say painting came easel-y to Judith Leyster, a 17th-century master painter and a central figure in the Dutch Golden Age,” Google said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, there is no record of a Leyster work having been hung in an institution or publicly sold prior to the 1892 lawsuit.
It left me indignant on her behalf.”Google has used its Doodles to honor female artists.
