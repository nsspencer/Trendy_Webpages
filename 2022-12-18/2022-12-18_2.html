    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Have you ever seen an ending like that before?"
Because what Raiders defensive end Chandler Jones pulled off -- a 48-yard walk-off fumble return after he snatched an ill-fated cross-field lateral to give the Raiders a 30-24 victory -- was something entirely different.
Chandler Jones, after missing the tackle on Stevenson, was again pushed to the ground by Patriots right guard Mike Onwenu but ended up in the right place at the right time for Las Vegas.
Chandler Jones said.
"If you've been with the Raiders, for any amount of time, we've seen our fair share of things happen, right?

     Patriots must "stay united" over final three-game stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "too many mistakes" has been a common refrain for the Patriots this season.
For most teams that should've been a winning performance, but even that silver lining came apart on the final Raiders scoring drive that went 81 yards in just 1:39.
They're not a great team and one the Patriots should've beaten with superior situational football.
Then there's Miami and Buffalo, two teams that have beaten the Patriots in seven-straight games.
FiveThirtyEight.com currently gives the Patriots a 19 percent shot at the playoffs, with the 8-6 Chargers and the 8-6 Dolphins sitting in the final two wild card spots.

     Summary: The Patriots' defense was DOM-IN-ATING.
So when the Raiders took over (after Mac Jones' naked bootleg, which for some magical reason didn't gain 10 yards?)
And they weren't set when Mac Jones took the snap for a QB sneak.
After a quick meeting with Mac Jones on the sideline, the Patriots' coaching brain trust was shown on the screen.
And that's after Mac Jones' dreadful day is factored in to the numbers.
