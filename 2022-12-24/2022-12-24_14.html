     Summary: When she heard that her local nonprofit art house, FilmScene, might be barred from showing “It’s a Wonderful Life,” she was incensed.
Preventing small theaters from showing “It’s a Wonderful Life,” she says, “goes completely against the essence of the movie” and its ideals of community, generosity and self-sacrifice.

But ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’?
“It was just like the end of ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’ where everybody comes to George’s house.

     Summary: Thankfully, legendary filmmaker Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) crafted a film that perfectly fits that description all the way back in 1946.
What Capra's "best" film is can undoubtedly be the subject of vigorous debate, but as far as what his most famous and well-known story is, it's hard to say anything other than It's a Wonderful Life (1946).
Chances are even if you haven't seen It's a Wonderful Life, you've at least heard the title and have some sense of what the plot is.
