     Don't rule out Detroit Lions grabbing a cornerback in 2023 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After missing six games early this season with an ankle injury, Chark has given the Lions the deep threat they lacked in the passing game.
The Lions will have to think hard about re-signing him this offseason, even with Jameson Williams waiting in the wings.
LB Josh Woods: Woods did not play a defensive snap Saturday, so he can’t be blamed for the Lions’ atrocious effort against the run.
Three downLB Alex Anzalone: The Lions’ entire linebacking corps probably deserves a down vote, but Anzalone gets the headline here as the leader of the unit.
If the Lions do defense-defense with their first two picks of next year’s draft, they should strongly consider a cornerback with one of those picks.

     Studs and Duds: Lions' Defense Not Physically Ready to Play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Goff tossed three red zone scoring passes, all to Shane Zylstra, and got the offense into the red zone six different times.
Later in that opening drive of the second half, Okudah was beaten on third-and-13 for a 47-yard completion from Sam Darnold to D.J.
The corner spent long stretches of the second half on the bench as Mike Hughes took over at corner.
STUD: TE Shane ZylstraZylstra had a career day against the Panthers, scoring three touchdowns.
He also committed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, an example of the undisciplined play that has cost the Lions on defense at times.

     NOTEBOOK: Lions outplayed by Panthers in 37-23 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers were coming off a loss to Pittsburgh last week and have playoff aspirations of their own with a chance to win the NFC South.
If you're not ready if you're not locked in you can get beat and that's what happened today.
We're the better team but we didn't play like it today."
Now the Lions head home to Ford Field to face the Chicago Bears (3-12), who are coming off a loss to Buffalo.
With Saturday's loss, Detroit's essentially in a must-win situation the next two weeks against Chicago and Green Bay.

     Lions grades: Brutal defensive showing dooms Detroit in ugly loss to Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions (7-8) lost to the Carolina Panthers, 37-23, in Week 16 from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.
D’Andre Swift had 12 yards on four carries, while Jamaal Williams went for 11 yards on seven attempts before limping off late.
Burns had both of Carolina’s sacks while its defense added seven quarterback hits and four tackles for loss, holding the Lions to 45 rushing yards on 17 tries.
Grade: FLinebackers: On top of that, the Panthers gashed the Lions for seven runs of more than 10 yards.
And while there are pieces to like for the future in Carolina, 320 rushing yards and 37 points to that offense is a severe black eye.
