     Bengals' Eli Apple calls out Patriots QB Mac Jones for 'dirty play'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Eli Apple won't be sending New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones a Christmas card.
Apple called out Jones for what he considered a "dirty play" during Saturday's game at Gillette Stadium.
Jones tripped Apple while Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt returned what he thought was a fumble by Jones into the end zone.
The play was blown dead, but Jones still inexplicably took Apple down by the legs away from the play.
It isn't the first time Jones has been accused by a defender of making a dirty play.

     Another late red-zone turnover dooms the Patriots; what the Bengals did to get the win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyle HightowerAssociated PressFOXBORO — Joe Burrow wanted to be happier after the Cincinnati Bengals walked off the field toting a 22-18 win over the New England Patriots on Saturday.
Burrow threw three touchdown passes and the Bengals offense totaled nearly 500 yards.
But it took the defense forcing a late turnover in the red zone to preserve the victory.
The Bengals punted it back four plays later, but the Patriots turned the ball over on downs.
The frigid temperature did little to slow down the Bengals offense early, which scored on each of its first three possessions.

     7 Keys from Patriots loss to Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bengals offense comes out firingThe Patriots defense had no answers against the first two Bengals drives of the game, as Joe Burrow picked them apart scoring two touchdowns to give Cincinnati an early lead.
Burrow had 11 straight completions to start the game, while the Patriots ran just six offensive plays in the first quarter.
It was a bad sign right out of the gate when Burrow hit Tee Higgins over Marcus Jones for a 38-yarder on the Bengals' second offensive play of the game.
Meanwhile, the Patriots offense started cold with two-straight three-and-outs on their initial possessions of the game, showing no signs of life.
It got even worse with Michael Palardy dropping the snap on his second punt, which set the Bengals up near midfield for their third possession.

     Summary: Jones really threaded the needle well on some of those throws, especially the touchdown at the back of the end zone.
Jones wasn’t charged with a turnover in this one.
Grade: D-Wide receiverThe Bengals went with a smothering, physical approach to coverage on Saturday -- and it worked.
The pass blocking was an issue for most of the day, with Jones getting pressured in the pocket early and often.
Grade: DDefensive lineAgainst a Bengals offensive line that’s been much-maligned all season, the Patriots didn’t do a whole lot of damage up front.

     Summary: But on first-and-five from the Bengals 5 with 65 seconds left, nose tackle DJ Reader stood up Pats running back Rhamondre Stevenson, Bell punched it out and Tupou and tackle B.J.
The first snap after the Pats touchdown was Higgins' jump ball for 31 yards, putting him over 100 yards for the fourth time this season and 10th time in his career.
That left Burrow with one of the great first half performances in Bengals history with a heated 284 yards on 77 percent passing (28-36) for a 115.7 passer rating.
After Bengals nose tackle DJ Reader forced a sack, Burrow sliced them again, this time five-for-five for 48 yards.
Burrow was literally perfect with a 158.3 rating on nine-for-nine passing for 121 yards on the first two drives.
