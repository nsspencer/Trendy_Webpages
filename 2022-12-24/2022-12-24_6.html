     Bills beat Bears to clinch third consecutive AFC East division title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once more, the AFC East belongs to the Buffalo Bills.
The Bills beat the Chicago Bears by a score of 35-13 on Saturday to clinch their third consecutive division title, and they'll be staying in the Second City to celebrate.
Not since the Bills strung together four straight AFC East championships from 1988-1991 has Buffalo had such a run of divisional success.
McDermott has now led the Bills to five playoff appearances in six seasons, four straight postseason berths and three consecutive division titles.
Buffalo hasn't entered the playoffs as the top seed since 1993 -- when it advanced to the last of its consecutive four Super Bowls.

     "It personifies that resiliency" | Bills keep City of Buffalo in their thoughts amidst Christmas Eve win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as head coach Sean McDermott was heading into the locker room to celebrate the victory, he got word that the team would be spending Christmas Eve in Chicago because the blizzard back home in Buffalo forced the Buffalo airport to close.
Even though the news was tough to hear, the head coach said the team will make the most of their time together before the weather allows them to fly back to their families.
"I think it personifies that resiliency, and now we got to stay here tonight," McDermott said.
McDermott expressed that the team is grateful for their situation knowing it could be worse.
From emergency care workers in Buffalo to members of the military serving overseas, the head coach is sending his thoughts and prayers to those who don't have the opportunity to be with their families this holiday season.

     Singletary, Cook lead way as Bills beat Bears for AFC East
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)CHICAGO (AP) — Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came into the season with soaring expectations and their sights set on a deep playoff run.
Devin Singletary and James Cook ran for long touchdowns in the third quarter, and the Bills locked up the AFC East title by beating the Bears 35-13 on Saturday in one of the coldest games played in Chicago.
“The reality of it is I’m not going to be running for like 100 yards a game,” Fields said.
RUNNING AWAYSingletary ran for 106 yards and became the first Bills player this season to hit triple-digits in a game.
Cook added a career-high 99, including 27-yarder in the third following a fumble by the Bears’ David Montgomery gave the Bills a 21-10 lead.

     Buffalo Bills 35, Chicago Bears 13: Rapid recap and notes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For two quarters, the Buffalo Bills stepped on enough rakes against the Chicago Bears that it looked like there might be an upset to worry about.
A 40-yard kickoff return gave the Bears impressive starting field position, and after a first down conversion, they were in Buffalo territory.
The game ended with a vintage Nathan Peterman appearance, featuring a game-ending interception — his first in favor of the Buffalo Bills; Happy Holidays, Bills fans!
Overall, the Bills pounded Chicago into submission with their running game.
Defensive end Kingsley Jonathan, cut earlier this year by the Bears, was promoted for his first Bills game today, and he ended up pretty useful for his new (old team).
