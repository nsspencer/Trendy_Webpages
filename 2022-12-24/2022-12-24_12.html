     Titans' winners and losers from Saturday's loss to Texans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tennessee Titans have been playing some of the worst football in the NFL these past five weeks, something we saw once again in the Week 16 defeat at the hands of the lowly Houston Texans.
The Titans have struggled to get their offense going consistently all season long, and making matters worse on Saturday was the fact that a raw rookie quarterback in Malik Willis was at the helm of the offense.
And while Willis wasn‚Äôt good, the Titans also did nothing to help their young signal-caller, both in pass protection and play-calling.
As we do every week, let‚Äôs take a look at the winners and losers.
As you‚Äôd imagine, there are more of the latter than the former this week.

     Summary: Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Todd Downing has been the subject of plenty of scrutiny in what amounts to nearly two full seasons on the job.
A Fireable OffenseFormer NFL head coach and current ESPN analyst Rex Ryan offered some harsh, but mostly fair, criticisms of Downing ahead of the game on NFL Countdown.
And here‚Äôs the last one: If Derrick Henry is not on the field on third down, fire the coordinator.‚Äù"STOP IT.
Give Derrick Henry the football!"

     Titans Drop Fifth Straight Game, This One a 19-14 Loss to the Texans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans lost 19-14 to the Houston Texans on a frigid Saturday in Music City.
The loss was Tennessee's fifth in a row, and it dropped the Titans (7-8) to below .500 for the first time since September.
The Titans took a 7-0 lead on a 48-yard touchdown run by Henry, who broke loose and into space on a handoff up the middle.
After a fourth-and-short stop by Titans defensive lineman Denico Autry at the 48-yard line, the Titans took over with good field position.
The Texans then took a 19-14 lead on a six-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Davis Mills to receiver Brandin Cooks with 2:52 left.
