     Mets, Carlos Correa aim to preserve $315 million deal after physical exam issues arise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time this week, Carlos Correa's $300 million coronation is getting delayed due to issues surrounding a physical examination.
Correa's 12-year, $315 million agreement with the New York Mets hit a snag Friday as the Mets expressed concern over the standard physical players receive before signing a deal.
The delay comes just three days after the San Francisco Giants postponed a news conference to introduce Correa after the sides struck a 15-year, $350 million deal.
The Mets and Correa's represenatives are aiming to work through the issues and preserve the agreement, according to a baseball official with direct knowledge of the discussions.
Hours later, he'd struck the $315 million deal with New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, who has committed close to a billion dollars in roster enhancements this winter.

     Summary: The Twins heard the news and wanted to know more about any medical concerns that reportedly caused the Giants to walk away.
But Minnesota wouldn’t up their bid or continue further discussions until they better understood Correa’s medical status, Hayes reported, citing team sources.
While in High-A, Correa injured his lower right leg on a slide into third and underwent surgery on a fractured right fibula and ligament.
The Giants reportedly expressed similar reservations Monday when they raised concerns about a leg injury Correa suffered in 2014.

According to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the New York Mets now "have concerns" about Correa's right ankle following his physical.
Twins shortstop Carlos Correa rounds third base.
(2022) Matt Krohn-USA TODAY Sports"The New York Mets, like the San Francisco Giants earlier in the week, have raised concerns about Carlos Correa’s surgically repaired lower right leg," wrote Rosenthal.
Wouldn't it be something if, after all this, Carlos Correa ends up signing with the SF Giants?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once again, issues with Carlos Correa's physical may complicate the completion of a long-term free agent contract.
As for the road forward for Correa and the Mets, Rosenthal writes:"The parties could agree to a restructured contract if the Mets continue to express reservations about the long-term stability of Correa's leg.
It might be difficult for the Mets to back out of the agreement entirely after their owner, Steve Cohen, went on record talking about the deal.
Neither happened and Correa opted out of his contract after the season and entered the free agent market.
Once again, whether he's off or on the market is uncertain despite having the structure of a long-term contract in place.

     Here’s what Mets doctors might be concerned about with Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Right when you thought the Mets would be wrapping up the Carlos Correa physical in time to sneak his finalized deal under the Christmas tree, something just had to happen.
Despite getting flagged by two teams, this injury hasn’t been an issue since debuting with the Houston Astros in 2015.
But of course, with the nature of Correa’s agreed-upon Mets contract (12 years for $315 million), the physical was more in-depth than for a one- or two-year deal.
The Mets’ concern certainly validates how the Giants’ 13-year, $350 million deal fell apart earlier this week.
This is the bat the Mets had been searching for, and there’s no way Correa would get another $300 million contract if he once again hit the free-agent market.

    </h2>

     Summary: After the Giants wouldn't give Correa a passing grade on a physical he took Monday in San Francisco, the Mets reportedly are dealing with the same issue.
"The parties could agree to a restructured contract if the Mets continue to express reservations about the long-term stability of Correa's leg," Rosenthal and Hayes wrote.

One of the wildest stories in free agency will continue, and no matter how it turns out, the Giants' concerns certainly appear to have been very valid.

Before the Mets came to terms with Correa, the Giants walked away from a 13-year, $350 million agreement with him because of medical concerns.
That prompted Correa’s agent, Scott Boras, to reengage other teams, including the Mets, who negotiated a reduced deal for the infielder in about 12 hours.
“There’s been a lot of discussion about backs and ankles,” Boras said, noting that three teams have offered Correa a contract of 10-plus years this offseason.
All told, owner Steve Cohen has committed $807.1 million to free agents, including Brandon Nimmo, Justin Verlander, Kodai Senga and others.
