     Eagles Twitter Blasts Team for Turnovers in Jalen Hurts' Absence in Loss to Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed in the NFC, the Philadelphia Eagles fell to the Dallas Cowboys 40-34 on Saturday at AT&amp;T Stadium to drop to 13-2 on the season.
It was a very winnable game for the Gardner Minshew-led Eagles, but four turnovers, including two interceptions by Minshew, resulted in Philly dropping their second game of the season.
Minshew completed 24-of-40 passes for 355 yards and two touchdowns against two interceptions in the loss.
Following the loss, NFL Twitter ripped the Eagles for their string of turnovers, three of which came in the second half:The Eagles still have a very good chance of locking up the No.
1 seed, especially if Jalen Hurts returns to the lineup next weekend against the New Orleans Saints.

     Summary: 1 seed and made the decision for them about whether to play Jalen Hurts next week or not.
A report earlier in the day indicated that an Eagles’ loss to the Cowboys would push Hurts to return next Sunday against the Saints.
Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was asked postgame whether the outcome would affect whether Hurts plays in Week 17.
“If Jalen’s ready to go, Jalen will play,” Sirianni said after the 40-34 loss.
Again, like I said, that’s nothing against Gardner, because I thought he played a really good game, but if Jalen’s ready, he’ll go.”

     Expert Predictions Cowboys-Eagles: How Will Dallas Respond to Jalen Hurts-Less Philly?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys (10-4) enter their highly anticipated Christmas Eve matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles (13-1) on a sour note after suffering an overtime loss in their recent trip to Jacksonville.
Both teams have secured their spot in the playoffs, but Philadelphia has the upper hand on securing the NFC’s No.
Philadelphia will also enter the matchup at AT&amp;T Stadium without a key piece, as QB Jalen Hurts will be sidelined after suffering a shoulder sprain in a 25-20 win over the Chicago Bears.
Can the Cowboys avenge their earlier loss to their heated rival?

     Summary: Jalen Hurts’ return to the field may come down to how his Philadelphia Eagles teammates handle the 2nd half in Dallas, according to an NFL insider.
Ahead of Saturday’s Week 16 slate, Jay Glazer shared a Hurts update on FOX.
Glazer said Hurts is dealing with a Grade 1-2 sprain in his throwing shoulder.
Hurts is missing Saturday’s key divisional clash in hopes of making sure the injury does not become more serious and lead to a longer absence.
The 3rd quarter is underway in Dallas, with the game airing on FOX.

     Hurts out, Goedert in as Eagles visit NFC East rival Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Quarterback Jalen Hurts is out with a sprained throwing shoulder, and tight end Dallas Goedert is active as Philadelphia tries to clinch the top seed in the NFC in a visit to Dallas.
Gardner Minshew is set for his first start of the season Saturday for the Eagles, who can wrap up home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs with a victory.
Hurts had already been ruled out after injuring his right shoulder in last week’s victory over Chicago.
The absence of Hurts means the starting quarterbacks won’t face each other in the regular season for these playoff-bound teams.
Dallas’ Dak Prescott missed the Eagles’ 26-17 victory in Week 6 with a broken thumb on his throwing (right) hand.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, they have hit a major roadblock with the recent shoulder injury that Jalen Hurts has suffered, and it has raised the levels of concern in Philadelphia pretty drastically over the past week or so.
Hurts sprained his right shoulder in the Eagles Week 15 win over the Chicago Bears, but ended up staying in the game and leading Philly to a win.
However, it seemed clear from the get go that Hurts wasn’t going to be able to play in Week 16 against the Dallas Cowboys, and it now seems like Hurts’ status for the Eagles Week 17 contest against the New Orleans Saints could be in jeopardy as well, which isn’t exactly good news for Philadelphia.
“Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, who will miss Saturday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys because of a sprained shoulder, also is uncertain to play against the New Orleans Saints in Week 17, league sources told ESPN.
Hurts is recovering from what doctors are calling a SC joint sprain in his throwing shoulder — an injury to the joint where the collarbone meets the breastbone.

     Report: Eagles QB Jalen Hurts 'status uncertain' vs. Saints in Week 17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints haven’t even kicked off their Week 16 game and some eyes are already being drawn towards Week 17’s matchup.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Friday evening that Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is “uncertain to play” against the Saints next week while managing a sprained throwing shoulder.
Hurts has already been ruled out for the Eagles’ game with the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday night, with veteran backup Gardner Minshew tabbed to start in his place.
We risk overlooking an immediate opponent in doing it, but Saints fans should be hoping to face Minshew next week, not Hurts.
Maybe Minshew performs better with a stronger supporting cast, but Hurts has proven himself to be a terrible matchup for the usually-stout Saints defense.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARLINGTON, Texas – Before Saturday’s game between the Eagles and Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts stood beside quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson.
Hurts was not playing after spraining his shoulder against the Chicago Bears last Sunday, forcing him to miss his first regular season game this season.
Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said he liked how Minshew played in his first start in almost a year.
Top to bottom, the Eagles still have a better roster than the Saints, and with Minshew under center, the Eagles should still win that game.
If the Eagles defeat the Saints, Hurts can return to the field against the Giants for a drive or two, allowing him to get some work in before the bye week.

     Eagles Rumors: Jalen Hurts Uncertain for Week 17 vs. Saints amid Shoulder Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is "uncertain" for his team's Week 17 game against the New Orleans Saints, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Hurts suffered a shoulder injury during Philadelphia's Week 15 win over the Chicago Bears, which will force him to miss the team's highly anticipated Christmas Eve showdown with the rival Dallas Cowboys.
He has completed 67.3 percent of his passes for 3,472 yards, 22 touchdowns and five interceptions to go with 747 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground.
Minshew went 7-13 as a starter for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019 and 2020 and also started two games for the 2021 Eagles.
The 13-1 squad just needs to win one of its last three games to clinch the No.
