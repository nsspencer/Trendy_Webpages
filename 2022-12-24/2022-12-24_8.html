     Giants vs. Vikings - NFL Game Recap - December 24, 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS -- — Justin Jefferson got the ball just far enough across midfield for Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell to summon Greg Joseph for a kick he'd never before made in a game from that distance.
After a replay reversal of the turnover call on the field, the Vikings resumed their drive and finished it in the end zone.
“They made the plays they needed to win it,” Giants coach Brian Daboll said.
"Give them credit.”JEFFERSON MOVES ON UPJefferson passed Randy Moss to set the single-season Vikings record for receiving yards with 1,756 and counting.
That's the most in NFL history through a player's first four seasons, and Jefferson is still in his third year.

     Vikings vs. Giants Game Observations: Joseph from the Norseman's Braid in 27-24 Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS — Greg Joseph lined up on the flowing hair of the midfield Norseman logo, took a breath and met the ball at the back of the Norseman's braid, painted white instead of blond for Minnesota's first Winter Whiteout game.
Off it went, 61 yards and through the uprights with room to spare.
That win total in one-score games is a new NFL record.
Did you really think the Vikings would lower the drama for the holidays?
Minnesota answered by driving 33 yards on eight plays to give Joseph the opportunity to chase history.
