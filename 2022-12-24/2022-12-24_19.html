    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mariah Carey’s co-writer and co-producer on ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ has challenged the star’s story detailing when she wrote the track.
Carey claimed in a 2017 interview that the festive classic was a “song that I wrote basically as a kid on my little Casio keyboard”.
Appearing on the Hot Takes &amp; Deep Dives With Jess Rothschild podcast, co-writer and co-producer Walter Afanasieff disputed that version of events.
She doesn’t understand music, she doesn’t know chord changes and music theory or anything like that.
Mariah chimed in and started singing ‘I don’t want a lot for Christmas’,” he continued.

     ‘All I Want For Christmas’ Collaborator Says Songwriting Origins Are Bo-Bo-Bogus

     Summary: However, there may be a Scrooge or Grinch in the way of her festival tale.
In an interview with Hot Takes and Deep Dives, ‘All I Want For Christmas’ co-writer Walter Afanasieff claims that Carey has changed the origins of the Christmas staple over the years to exclude his help.
She briefly mentions Afanasieff in the Amazon Music interview, but she discusses him as someone she got into the studio with to form her track fully and not as someone who was the song’s equal collaborator from the beginning.
Carey’s been co-producing her own music since before she was signed to Columbia records, before she had the help of the music industry.
A Christmas miracle for the Queen of Christmas!

     Grammys flashback: Mariah Carey’s 1991 Best New Artist win was one of the best ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s take a look at Carey’s legendary debut era and how it all culminated in the Grammy for Best New Artist, one of the best wins in that category ever.
Carey’s win over Wilson Phillips might be the product of two factors.
Two, and perhaps the biggest hurdle for Wilson Phillips, was the fact that, in short, they were nepo babies.
This might also explain “Hold On” losing all of its categories despite being predicted to win for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
Carey’s Best New Artist win is, to this day, one of the most amazing in that category.
