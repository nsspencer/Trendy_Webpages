     Alex Ovechkin is now 2nd all-time in NHL career goals, trails only Wayne Gretzky’s record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A pair of goals from Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin on Friday secured yet another feat in his surefire Hall of Fame career, passing hockey legend Gordie Howe for the second-most goals scored in NHL history.
In front of a friendly home crowd against the Winnipeg Jets, Ovechkin scored on a wrist shot to give Washington a 1-0 lead to tie Howe at 801 career goals.
Last week, Ovechkin became the third player in NHL history to score 800 career goals, joining Howe and Wayne Gretzky, who holds the record with 894 goals.
He is the Capitals’ franchise leader in games played, goals, points, playoff games played, playoff goals and playoff points.
According to the NHL, Ovechkin is the only player in league history to win a Stanley Cup as well as the following individual achievements:

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareWayne Gretzky’s NHL record of 894 career goals was once considered unbreakable.
Now, after Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin passed Gordie Howe to move into second place on the NHL’s career goals list, it feels almost inevitable that Ovechkin will surpass Gretzky’s mark, and perhaps by quite a bit.
“I think a thousand goals is possible for him, especially after what we’ve seen tonight,” former NHL defenseman and ESPN analyst P.K.
Why not?”One thousand goals might be ambitious, but 895 is attainable for the 37-year-old Ovechkin, who passed Gordie Howe for No.
Randy Moss, who broke Rice’s single-season touchdown record with 23 in 2007, retired 41 touchdowns shy of Rice’s career record in 2012.

     NHL roundup: Alex Ovechkin moves to No. 2 in all-time goals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd career goals in the game, moving him into second place all-time in career NHL goals, passing the late Gordie Howe.
Ovechkin now has his sights set on Wayne Gretzky's 894 goals, which still are the gold standard for career goals in the league.
Sonny Milano and Nic Dowd also scored for Washington, while Conor Sheary had two assists and Ovechkin added an assist.
It was a rough NHL debut for Flyers goalie Samuel Ersson, who gave up five goals on 30 shots.
Jack Hughes, Tomas Tatar and Yegor Sharangovich scored goals for the Devils.
