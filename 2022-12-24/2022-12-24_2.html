     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareWayne Gretzky’s NHL record of 894 career goals was once considered unbreakable.
Now, after Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin passed Gordie Howe to move into second place on the NHL’s career goals list, it feels almost inevitable that Ovechkin will surpass Gretzky’s mark, and perhaps by quite a bit.
“I think a thousand goals is possible for him, especially after what we’ve seen tonight,” former NHL defenseman and ESPN analyst P.K.
Why not?”One thousand goals might be ambitious, but 895 is attainable for the 37-year-old Ovechkin, who passed Gordie Howe for No.
Randy Moss, who broke Rice’s single-season touchdown record with 23 in 2007, retired 41 touchdowns shy of Rice’s career record in 2012.
