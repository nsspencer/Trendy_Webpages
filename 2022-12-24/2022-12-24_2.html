     Raiders' Chandler Jones leaves vs. Steelers with elbow injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Chandler Jones suffered an injury to his left elbow that resulted in him being ruled out of the Raiders' game at the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night.
Jones, 32, walked to the sidelines under his own power but had to be carted to the locker room at Acrisure Stadium midway through the third quarter.
It was Jones who, a week earlier, was in the right place at the right time, plucking the ball out of the air on a backward lateral pass from New England Patriots receiver Jakobi Meyers, scoring on a 48-yard fumble recovery with no time on the clock to give Las Vegas a 30-24 walk-off victory over the Patriots.
After signing a three-year, $51 million free agent contract with the Raiders, Jones had been playing his best football of late with four of his 4.5 sacks coming in Las Vegas' previous three games before facing the Steelers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Chandler Jones was carted off in the third quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday and was later ruled out with an elbow injury.
Jones had three total tackles before suffering the elbow injury.
Raiders linebacker Denzel Perryman was ruled out in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury.
What Jones’ injury means for RaidersThe Chandler Jones experience has mostly been a letdown for the Raiders this season, but he’d been on a tear coming into Saturday night’s game against the Steelers.
And just like Jones, Perryman was ruled out very quickly.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just more of the same for the Las Vegas Raiders.
Given the way the Raiders' defense held Pittsburgh out of the end zone for the first 59 minutes, maybe it shouldn't have been.
Yet Las Vegas couldn't create any real breathing room, thanks in large part to a return to the sloppy form that plagued it during a 2-5 start.
Las Vegas is built to win now.
With two of their linchpins out, the Raiders couldn't do much to disrupt Pickett, who steadily took the Steelers down the field in the final seconds.

     Summary: The Steelers will be without safety Terrell Edmunds tonight when they take on the Las Vegas Raiders at Acrisure Stadium.
Edmunds didn't practice all week, dealing with a hamstring injury that had him listed as questionable going into the game and he is inactive.
This is the second game this season Edmunds will miss, also inactive for the Steelers Week 5 game against the Buffalo Bills.
With Edmunds out, the Steelers promoted safety Elijah Riley to the 53-man roster from the practice squad.
He was also elevated for the Week 5 game against the Buffalo Bills and Week 6 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and saw action in both games.

     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers left Acrisure Stadium following their Week 16 win over the Las Vegas Raiders with two injuries.
Okay, maybe the excitement was there, but not every moment of the game was a thriller for the Steelers.
Pittsburgh left the game with two injuries on defense, one to safety Tre Norwood and the other to inside linebacker Marcus Allen.
The second-year safety was in on a tackle of Las Vegas Raiders tight end Darren Waller when the injury happened.

     Reed: The Raiders’ underwhelming offense sets up an offseason of change
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their response when the Raiders defense made the Steelers go three-and-out late in the fourth quarter?
Ultimately, it was the underachieving offense that guaranteed the Raiders (6-9) would have a disappointing finish to this season.
GO DEEPER Raiders' Josh Jacobs sounds off after offense lets team down in loss to Steelers“It’s on us,” Jacobs told reporters.
Waller and Renfrow both missed chunks of time and the Raiders were left without the group that McDaniels spent the offseason molding his offense around.
Derek Carr and the offense has averaged just 16.7 points the last three games, with the Raiders losing two out of three.

     Summary: Kenny Pickett finds George Pickens over the middle for a touchdown to put the Steelers up 13-10 in the fourth quarter.
The current Steelers -- all of whom were born after Harris retired in 1984 -- did their best to pay tribute.
"We dedicated this to Franco," Pickett said.
Freiermuth caught seven passes for 66 yards and Najee Harris had 95 total yards as the Steelers (7-8) won for the fifth time in seven games.
It was a gap the Raiders found themselves on the right side of for the first 59-plus minutes at the second-coldest home game in Steelers' history.

"We felt like we were making strides in some areas, and obviously, we didn't do that well enough today," said Carr.

"When you fall short, I mean, my heart breaks," continued Carr, baring his emotions to the media again.
