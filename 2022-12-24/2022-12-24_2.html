    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesTua Tagovailoa threw three interceptions in the Dolphins‚Äô loss to the Packers on Sunday afternoon, but Russell Wilson may pass him for the most on Christmas before the first half is over.
He was picked off by cornerback Cobie Durant to set up a Baker Mayfield touchdown pass and his former Seahawks teammate Bobby Wagner got him to end the second possession.
It‚Äôs the first time that Wagner and Wilson have ever faced each other outside of a Seahawks practice.
It took the Rams two plays to get into the end zone.
Running back Cam Akers scored from three yards out and the Rams now lead 17-0 with just under five minutes to play in the first quarter.

     Summary: Barry WernerTouchdown WireLos Angeles Rams linebacker Bobby Wagner should have a pretty good read on what Russell Wilson plans to do with the football.
The veteran linebacker and quarterback were teammates for years with the Seattle Seahawks.
On Christmas, they were on opposite sides of the field with Wilson under center for the Denver Broncos in a Week 16 clash at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.
Wilson threw a pass and Wagner picked it.
The Rams were out to a quick 17-0 lead after Cam Akers' TD and the PAT.

     Summary: In perhaps one of the least anticipated Christmas Day games featuring two 4-10 NFL teams, Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos got off to a rough start against the Los Angeles Rams.
And the Rams made Wilson and co. pay, scoring touchdowns following each pick and grabbing a 17-0 lead before the end of the first quarter.
On 3rd-and-9 on the Broncos‚Äô own 26-yard line, Wilson tried to connect with Courtland Sutton but was instead picked off by Cobie Durant.

     Watch: Bobby Wagner picks former teammate Russell Wilson on Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner said back in August that he wanted to sack Russell Wilson on Christmas Day, being former teammates when they were with the Seattle Seahawks.
Wagner is now with the Rams and Russell Wilson is with the Broncos, and while Wagner didn‚Äôt get his wish (yet), he did make a different type of game-changing play.
In the first quarter against the Broncos on Sunday, Wagner picked off Wilson on a throw over the middle, returning it inside the 15-yard line to set up a touchdown by Cam Akers a few plays later.
Wagner has been a playmaker all season for the Rams, and this is just another example of him being a stud in Year 1 with Los Angeles.
It‚Äôs icing on the cake that his second interception of the season came against Wilson.
