     Blue Jays GM hints at free agency activity after Daulton Varsho trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Joey Mistretta · 2 min readThe Toronto Blue Jays acquired C/OF Daulton Varsho from the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday.
However, Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said there could be more moves in the works prior to Opening Day, per Keegan Matheson.
“I think our heavy lifting is done, but I’m not ruling anything out and would expect some incremental improvements,” Atkins said following the Daulton Varsho trade.
The Blue Jays have made a number of moves this offseason.
For now, they are content with adding Daulton Varsho to a roster that projects to be one of the best in the league.

     Blue Jays Acquire Daulton Varsho from Diamondbacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blue Jays Acquire Daulton Varsho from Diamondbacks by SportsGrid 1 hours agoThe Toronto Blue Jays have acquired Daulton Varsho from the Arizona Diamondbacks, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.
The Jays and DBacks were dealing from positions of strength.
The Jays had a surplus of catchers at the MLB level, and the same can be said of the Dbacks in the outfield.
Moreno could instantly become one of the best catchers, both defensively and offensively, in the National League.
This trade is not going to move the needle all that much for the Diamondbacks.

     Mike Hazen says Diamondbacks did not take trading Daulton Varsho lightly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said he did not want to trot out the same team that won 74 games in 2022 next spring.
Trading the 26-year-old Varsho was a “challenging” decision, but the GM concluded that it was a way to improve the lineup in 2023 and going forward.
“It wasn’t something that we took lightly,” Hazen told reporters on Friday.
“(Moreno’s) ability to get on base, he makes contact, he’s got a great two-strike approach, he’s just a really good hitter,” Hazen said.
We think they fit our team going into next year.”Gurriel Jr. will be a free agent after next season.

     Gabriel Moreno, Daulton Varsho Trade Evaluation, Part 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays made a trade yesterday, exchanging Daulton Varsho for top rated catching prospect Gabriel Moreno and veteran right handed outfielder Lourdes Gurriel.
Part 1: Head to head player evaluationsBack on November 29th I published a Diamondbacks Outfielder Trade Value article.
Recently ZiPS projection system gave Varsho 2.8 WAR in 534 PA and Steamer projections gave him 3.1 WAR in 582 PA.
I would personally look at the $61 million projection as a floor, and the $77 million as a 60 or 70th percentile projection.
In the longer term, focusing on 2024-2026, even the more conservative lower value projection for Moreno almost equals the higher projection for Varsho.

     Thoughts on the Daulton Varsho for Gabriel Moreno, Lourdes Gurriel Jr deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not least because of Mike Hazen's consistent statements that the team did not have to trade any of them.
Their best was probably Adrian del Castillo, and his stock plummeted this year, hitting below the Uecker Line at High-A.
Also, while the defensive metrics loved Varsho in the outfield, putting up 2 dWAR consistently, like he did in 2022, is very hard.
Moreno also took part in the Arizona Fall League last year, where he hit .329, with as many walks as strikeouts.
Then there's Lourdes Gurriel Jr., who effectively replaces Varsho in the mix.
