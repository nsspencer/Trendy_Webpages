     The Chiefs players gave Andy Reid his favorite Christmas gift of all: a cheeseburger
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kind of like what the Chiefs players gave coach Andy Reid after a 24-10 win over the Seahawks on Saturday afternoon.
“We took a little poll,” Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes told Reid, “and we got you a little gift.”Tight end Travis Kelce walked up and presented Reid with the gift.
The best gift for the best coach ️ pic.twitter.com/2Nvw6Oz3BO — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) December 24, 2022Reid’s love of cheeseburgers is almost as renowned as his play-calling ability.
Two years ago, Reid told NBC Sports’ Peter King: “How great is a good cheeseburger?
It keeps you grounded, Peter.”It’s safe to say Reid was feeling grounded on Christmas Eve.

     Three numbers that mattered in Kansas City Chiefs’ 24-10 win vs. Seattle Seahawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are three numbers that helped determine the result of the Kansas City Chiefs’ 24-10 win against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday afternoon at Arrowhead Stadium.
14%A week after performing miserably on third downs, Kansas City’s defense bounced back in a memorable way Saturday.
The Chiefs held the Seahawks to 2 for 14 on third down for a 14% success rate.
72After KC’s offense was shut down most of the game, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce came through on a critical fourth-quarter drive to officially put it away.
Mahomes hit Kelce for 20 and then 52 on consecutive plays — combining for 72 yards of offense to move the ball to the Seattle 8.

     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs marched on with an efficient 24-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks, keeping pace with the Buffalo Bills at 12-3 on the year so far.
Offensive spotlight: Mahomes went 5-for-12 on throws beyond the sticks in this game, but that doesn’t tell the full story.
Defensive spotlight: Chris Jones had another huge game up front for the Kansas City Chiefs defense.
Rookie spotlight: Per our first pass of the game, five members of the Seattle Seahawks allowed multiple pressures in the game.
Offensive line spotlight: Seahawks’ rookie running back Kenneth Walker III has dealt with injuries lately but put together a solid performance in the loss.

     Four Takeaways From the Chiefs' 24-10 Win Over the Seahawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs came into their Christmas Eve matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on the heels of consecutive wins that were much closer than they needed to be.
With the win, the Chiefs rise to 12-3 on the season and force the Seahawks to below .500 for the first time since Week 5.
Kansas City's defense was exceptionalThe Chiefs' defense has caught a lot of criticism in recent weeks, and for good reason.
The entire Chiefs defense showed up, but several individuals managed to stand out.
On a more critical note, Dave Toub's special teams unit once again had several shortcomings in other areas.

     Summary: With the triumph, Kansas City has secured its fifth straight 12-win season with quarterback Patrick Mahomes at the helm.
With that said, the Chiefs no longer hope to win a bunch of regular-season contests.
"Here in Kansas City, we're not complacent," Clark said.
We want to win the conference first, secure home-field advantage and then we have fun throughout the playoffs.
That's the goal here in Kansas City, baby."

You wouldn’t know that based on the defensive performance from the Chiefs in the 24-10 win.
The defense didn’t allow a Seahawks first down until the midway point of the second quarter.
Overall, it felt like the most complete defensive performance the team has managed in several weeks.
Patrick Mahomes really summed the defensive performance up perfectly in his postgame press conference.

     Chiefs Give Coach Andy Reid a Cheeseburger for Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chiefs players might have asked themselves that question this week when deciding on a holiday gift for coach Andy Reid.
After all, Reid has guided Kansas City to nine playoff berths in 10 seasons, including seven consecutive AFC West division crowns.
He famously coached the Chiefs to victory in Super Bowl LIV, ending a 50-year franchise championship drought.
With all that success as prologue, it had to be difficult to come up with a fitting gift idea for Reid.
Good thing his players apparently remembered what Reid said after the team’s Super Bowl win three seasons ago: “I’m gonna go get the biggest cheeseburger you’ve ever seen!”Here’s Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes presenting Reid with an edible gift after Saturday’s 24-10 win over the Seahawks.

     Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City Chiefs could face another free agency setback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs have shown life without Tyreek Hill isn't all that bad, but they would rather not lose a key receiver for the second straight NFL off-seasonAll good and great things must come to an end and life in the NFL is no different.
But for teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, with superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes in his prime, head coach Andy Reid showing no signs of his genius waning and a title already under their belts, that window is never closed.
Smith-Schuster, 26, only signed a one-year contract with Kansas City last off-season and his performances this year will leave him with no shortage of options when free agency begins.
With offensive tackle Orlando Brown, running back Jerick McKinnon and receiver Mecole Hardman also heading towards free agency, it is possible next summer signals another reimagining of the Kansas City offence and how it functions.
Mahomes will be very happy in Week One next season if that trio remains intact.
