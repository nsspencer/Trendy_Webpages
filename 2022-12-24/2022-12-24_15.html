     7 takeaways from the Saints' Christmas Eve win over the Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Saints have not hit 4 yards per carry in each of their last eight contests, but they did enough when it matters on Saturday.
And on the defensive side, New Orleans just surrendered over 5 yards per carry to the Atlanta Falcons last week.
These are areas that the Saints have no been able to get consistently going throughout the season.
So to turn around and win on the prowess of those elements is a positive step for New Orleans.
The run game on both sides of the ball has not been what many expected it would be in 2022, but that did not get in the Saints way in a game where the rushing phase was so critical.

     Browns gift 17-10 win to Saints after coughing up 10-point lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND — Alvin Kamara and Taysom Hill each had touchdown runs and the New Orleans Saints went outside and handled Cleveland’s arctic-like cold in a 17-10 win Saturday over the Browns, who were officially eliminated from the playoffs.
The Saints (6-9) were 0-6 in outdoor games this season before rallying to beat the Browns (6-9) in the coldest game in New Orleans history.
The temperature was 6 degrees at kickoff, making it the coldest regular-season game in Cleveland history.
Their previous coldest game was 24 degrees on Dec. 26, 1993 in Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium.
Watson’s TD scamper gave the Browns a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter.

     Saints stay in playoff hunt with win over Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Without a roof over their heads, the Saints went outside and handled the frightful weather — and the Browns.
The Saints (6-9) were 0-6 in outdoor games this season before rallying to beat the Browns (6-9) in the coldest game in New Orleans history.
Only the Browns’ 1981 playoff game (1 degree) against the Oakland Raiders was worse.
Their previous coldest game was 24 degrees on Dec. 26, 1993 in Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium.
Kamara's TD was the 72nd of his career, tying him with Marques Colston for the most in Saints history.

     New Orleans Saints offensive line flexes muscle in victory over Cleveland on Saturday | NFL Week 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It might not have been the most complete, most pristine or most pleasing-to-the-eye victory that New Orleans has posted this season.
OFFENSE: Give the offensive line as many platitudes as you want for this one.
New Orleans entered the game without right guard Cesar Ruiz, the only member of the offensive line who'd played every snap this season, and lost left guard Andrus Peat during the game.
But the offensive line helped make Kamara's runs from the Wildcat formation, and Hill's quarterback power runs, effective even when the Browns knew what was coming.
It was the kind of day and gameplan that offensive linemen pine for, and the Saints' linemen made the most of it.

     After Further Review: Five takes from Saints win over Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Saints kept their postseason hopes alive with a total team win in the frigid Cleveland cold.
Take Two: Where the game was wonAt the 4:20 mark of the second quarter, the Saints defense was toast.
His first two runs were 11 and 16 yards on that late second quarter field goal drive which really sparked the offense.
Tough holding call on Paulson Adebo when the Saints forced an incompletion on third and long on the Browns’ final drive.
Great to see Allen give a game ball to the Saints equipment staff.

     Browns eliminated from playoff contention in loss to Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pass bounced off Bell's hands, however, and into the grasp of Saints S Daniel Sorensen, who returned the ball 36 yards to the Browns' 15-yard line.
The Saints turned the interception into the go-ahead and game-winning touchdown four plays later with a 4-yard run from Kamara.
Player of the game: Grant Delpit, who gave the Browns their first big play of the game with an interception on a deflected pass from Saints QB Andy Dalton.
Delpit also made a 40-yard return on the play, which gave the Browns great field position for their next drive.
The game was decided when: On fourth-and-10 from the Saints' 15-yard line with no timeouts and 26 seconds left, Watson took a sack.
