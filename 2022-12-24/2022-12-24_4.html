     Death Stranding is free on the Epic Games Store right now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Only now, the Christmas giveaway is for the base edition of Death Stranding (opens in new tab) rather than the director's cut.
For a couple weeks every December Epic gives away a new free game on the Epic Game Store (opens in new tab) every single day.
But wow, Christmas day is delivering big: Epic Rolled out Death Stranding: Director's Cut for free on December 25.
The Epic Games Store seems to be straining under the load of the Death Stranding Director's Cut giveaway, but it's still online as of this writing.
You've got a whole day to grab Death Stranding before it's back to its usual $40 price.

     Epic Games Store crashes as Death Stranding added as free game for Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You can contact Andrew at andrew.amos@dexerto.comThe Epic Games Store crashed across Christmas Day as servers struggled to keep up with demand for Death Stranding.
Epic Games is bringing the festive cheer with its free game promotion across Christmas.
Some have been critical of Epic Games Store in the promotion though.
Originally the platform put the Death Stranding Director’s Cut for free.
Death Stranding will be available for free until the end of December 25 on the Epic Games Store, with another new game coming on December 26 as the promotion continues.

     Epic Games Store Free Game for Dec 26 Is Death Stranding; Directors Cut Accidentally Given for a Short Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those living under a rock, Epic Games Store is offering 15 free titles, one every day till December 30.
The free game for December 26 has been announced and it is none other than Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding.
Accidentally offering Director's CutThe game that is free at the moment is Death Stranding Standard Edition.
What's interesting is that Epic Games Store accidentally offered Death Stranding Director's Cut for a short amount of time and many players were also able to grab it for free.
Epic Games Store then removed Director's Cut promptly and offered the Standard edition to the players.

     Today's Free Game Giveaway Is So Good It's Crashing The Epic Games Store
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it so happens, today's free game is such a big draw that the Epic Games store had trouble keeping up with demand, at least initially.
Today's title that is up for grabs is Death Stranding.
Once you've claimed the game and completed the checkout process, it's yours to keep in your games catalog forever (or until the Epic Games store ceases to exist, anyway).
Death Stranding released to the PlayStation 4 three years ago, then was ported to PC in July 2020 (see our Death Stranding review ).
Your best bet is to send a daily reminder to check the Epic Games store at 11:00am, so you don't end up forgetting and missing out.
