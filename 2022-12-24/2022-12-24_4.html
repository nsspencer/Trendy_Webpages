     Summary: The Steelers will be without safety Terrell Edmunds tonight when they take on the Las Vegas Raiders at Acrisure Stadium.
Edmunds didn't practice all week, dealing with a hamstring injury that had him listed as questionable going into the game and he is inactive.
This is the second game this season Edmunds will miss, also inactive for the Steelers Week 5 game against the Buffalo Bills.
With Edmunds out, the Steelers promoted safety Elijah Riley to the 53-man roster from the practice squad.
He was also elevated for the Week 5 game against the Buffalo Bills and Week 6 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and saw action in both games.

     Summary: Kenny Pickett finds George Pickens over the middle for a touchdown to put the Steelers up 13-10 in the fourth quarter.
The current Steelers -- all of whom were born after Harris retired in 1984 -- did their best to pay tribute.
"We dedicated this to Franco," Pickett said.
Freiermuth caught seven passes for 66 yards and Najee Harris had 95 total yards as the Steelers (7-8) won for the fifth time in seven games.
It was a gap the Raiders found themselves on the right side of for the first 59-plus minutes at the second-coldest home game in Steelers' history.
