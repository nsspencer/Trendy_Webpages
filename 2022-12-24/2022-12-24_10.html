     NFL Playoff Picture 2022-23: Updated AFC, NFC Standings After Week 16 Saturday Slate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesThe NFL is barreling toward the playoffs as the 2022 season has reached Week 16.
After the entirety of Saturday's schedule came to an end, the playoff picture gained a bit more clarity.
Following a fifth consecutive loss, Tennessee is also on the outside looking in on the playoff picture.
The Giants maintain their position in the NFC standings, but Saturday's loss was an emotional letdown.
The conference-leading Philadelphia Eagles also were denied the chance to clinch the NFC East, taking a 40-34 loss against the Dallas Cowboys in a Christmas Eve thriller.
