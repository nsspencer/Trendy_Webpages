    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From 1977 through 2001, the Seattle Seahawks traveled to Arrowhead Stadium once a season.
The Seahawks, 7-7, will be back at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday for what will be one of the coldest games in Chiefs history.
A 38-30 Chiefs win is the prediction from NFL.com’s Gregg Rosenthal.
This is part of what Beasley wrote: “Seattle isn’t desperate yet, but they do find themselves on the outside looking in at the NFC playoff race.
The Chiefs are just 4-10 ATS this year with just one cover at home.”The five Audacy writers think the Chiefs will win.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s the second consecutive week where I feel like a Chiefs victory is going to hinge on committing to the run game.
If you’re not giving Jerick McKinnon and Isiah Pacheco a combined 25 or more carries in Week 16, you’re not doing yourselves any favors.
This might be the last gasp for the Seahawks’ playoff hopes, so expect them to pull out all the stops.
At the end of the day, I expect a home victory for the Chiefs as an early Christmas present for all of the Chiefs Kingdom.

     Summary: On Saturday, the Kansas City Chiefs face the Seattle Seahawks.
We welcome John P. Gilbert of Field Gulls — our sister SBNation site covering the Seahawks — for Five Questions with the Enemy.
Between the weather and how crucial Lockett is to the offense, it’s likely to be absolutely massive.
That’s not to say that Seattle can’t win the game, but it’s certainly not unlikely for the Chiefs to win in convincing fashion.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs can’t climb into first place in the AFC and secure that coveted first-round playoff bye with a win over Seattle on Saturday, nor can the Seahawks slip into the postseason by knocking off the West Division champs.
The playoff hopes of the Seahawks, who are 7-7 and have lost four of their last five, are hanging by a thread.
They’ve been though this so they understand it,” said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, whose team has hosted the past four AFC title games.
That will be important this week.”The Seahawks have things to clean up, too.
Jones was noticeably ill during last week’s win over the Texans, playing just 40 of 63 defensive snaps.
