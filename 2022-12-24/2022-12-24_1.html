Despite a second straight defeat, the Commanders still control their own destiny, but they need wins over the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Cowboys at home over the final two weeks of the regular season to feel good about their playoff chances.

Purdy’s deep-ball numbers include a 34-yard bomb to George Kittle in the third quarter Saturday, the decisive score in the 49ers’ 37-20 win over the Commanders.

• Rookie defensive end Drake Jackson was a healthy scratch.
That meant San Francisco had to go heavy in terms of the number of defensive tackles and lighter at defensive end.

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers had time on their side between their division clinching 21-13 win over the Seattle Seahawks and their upcoming Week 16 matchup versus the Washington Commanders.
Cornerback Charvarius Ward was one of those players, progressing through the "last steps" of the NFL's concussion protocol and getting cleared to play in Saturday's contest.
Joining him on the 49ers active list against Washington are rookie running back Jordan Mason (hamstring), defensive back Tarvarius Moore (illness, knee) and cornerback Ambry Thomas (ankle).
So, there's always a risk of it (having a setback), but we're at the point, he's at the point, where it's time to find out."
The team will also be without rookie defensive lineman Drake Jackson who landed on the inactives list.
