     Hampus Lindholm injury: Bruins star leaves Game 2 after taking massive hit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first two periods in Game 2 of the Bruins' first-round playoff series against the Hurricanes were an absolute disaster for Boston.
The Bruins announced early in the third period that Lindholm would not return to the game due to an upper body injury.
Losing him for any length of time would be a huge setback for the Bruins' blue line.
If Lindholm is unable to play in Friday night's Game 3 at TD Garden, the best options to replace him are Mike Reilly and Josh Brown.
Reilly is a left-shooting defenseman, so he's probably the best choice from a fit standpoint, although Brown would give the Bruins more of a physical presence.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy didn’t have good news on defenseman Hampus Lindholm after the Bruins’ 5-2 loss to Carolina in Game 2 of the team’s best of seven series.
Lindholm was circling clockwise behind the Bruins’ net and didn’t see Andrei Svechnikov bearing down on him.
He has an upper-body injury,” Cassidy said.
He was ruled out, officially with an upper-body injury, early in the third period.
Cassidy wasn’t sure if Lindholm would travel back to Boston with the team or not.

     Bruins' Hampus Lindholm leaves game vs. Hurricanes after hit by Andrei Svechnikov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Bruins defenseman Hampus Lindholm exited Wednesday's 5-2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes after a hit by Andrei Svechnikov near the end of the second period and did not return, the Bruins announced.
Svechnikov's shoulder collided with Lindholm's chest at full speed, knocking over Lindholm.
He was helped off the ice and Svechnikov was not assessed a penalty for the hit.
Lindholm, 28, was acquired by the Bruins at the trade deadline from the Anaheim Ducks.
With a 5-1 Game 1 victory on Monday and Wednesday's win, the Hurricanes have a 2-0 lead in the first-round series.

     Hurricanes outmuscle Bruins to win Game 2, but lose goalie Antti Raanta to injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Hurricanes and Boston Bruins engaged in a playoff game Wednesday that had all the elements of two teams that really don’t like each other.
They also could go into TD Garden with a rookie goalie starting and facing both a hostile Bruins crowd and Bruins team.
It happened as fast as Bruins forward David Pastrnak could throw his hands into the face of Canes goalie Antti Raanta, or Andrei Svechnikov could level Bruins defenseman Hampus Lindholm.
But Pastrnak hit Raanta in the mask, leaving him down and bloodied at 7:47 of the first period.
Raanta was ruled out with an upper-body injury, that with goalie Frederik Andersen sidelined since April 16 with a lower-body injury.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going into Game 2, the Bruins’ only real shake-up was to drop Hampus Lindholm to the second defense pair.
Going into Game 3, the Bruins are facing a whole bunch of questions, including who will replace Lindholm in the lineup.
The Bruins lost Lindholm to a predatory hit by Andrei Svechnikov, then went on to drop Game 2 by a 5-2 score.
Patrice Bergeron got one back for the Bruins late in the second period, and on the power play no less!
After taking a silly penalty early in the second period, Frederic found himself stapled to the bench for a bit.
