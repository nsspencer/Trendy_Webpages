     What Is The Song At The Beginning Of Moon Knight Episode 6?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Learn MoreWhat Is The Song At The Beginning Of Moon Knight Episode 6?
Episode 5 of Marvel's "Moon Knight" left fans with a massive cliffhanger concerning the fate of Marc Spector (Oscar Isaac) and his alternate identity Steven Grant, the latter of whom seemed to meet a grisly demise in the episode's climactic final moments.
Much of Episode 5 was dedicated to Spector and Grant's attempts to reconcile the fact that they were two split personalities sharing the same body.
By the end of the episode the two finally seem to connect, accepting each other as an essential part of their shared life.
One of "Moon Knight's" greatest strengths is the way it consistently uses its soundtrack to emphasize its themes and plot points — and this trend continues at the start of Episode 6.

     Moon Knight Episode 6 Finale Review: Gods and Monsters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having had more of my focus drawn toward those aspects, Moon Knight delivered a solid finale full of unexpected sights in “Gods and Monsters”.
Did I expect to see the Moon Knight limo, complete with its personalized SPKTR number plate?
Moon Knight as a whole certainly had its issues.
Seeing Khonshu and Ammit go head-to-head was a joy, and I definitely cheered a little when Layla rejected Khonshu.
With Marc and Steven now imagining they are “free” of Khonshu, what does the future hold for Moon Knight?

     Summary: You were always there, full of hope,” Marc tells Steven, thanking him for being there when life became too dark to handle.
But when Khonshu tells Marc to kill them both, Layla reminds him that he has a choice.
Do it yourself,” Marc tells Khonshu.
Moon Knight finally gives us a mid-credits scene, and it’s a doozy: Arthur finds himself in a psychiatric hospital, muttering about sand.

     Summary: If you’re new to Moon Knight then you are no doubt asking yourself if Jake Lockley will have his own Moon Knight suit.
In the comics, Moon Knight just had the one look for almost 40 years.
So in the comics, the Mr. Knight look is not Steven Grant’s Moon Knight suit; it’s just… a Moon Knight suit.
There has been, however, one instance of Jake Lockley having his own Moon Knight suit.
Marc Spector is wearing the Mr. Knight suit, and Jake Lockley is wearing the Moon Knight suit.

     Summary: We can call it now: Moon Knight is officially the best Disney+ show in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
This week’s episode opens with Layla (May Calamawy), who shines like she never has before in her desperation to stop Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke) after her husband’s been shot.
Image via Disney+However, in characteristic Marvel fashion, there is, of course, a post-credits stinger, but this one is more than merely a cute joke or a set-up for tying Moon Knight into the larger Marvel universe.
Rating: A+All episodes of Moon Knight are streaming now on Disney+.
