     Summary: The Fed raises interest rates by the most in over 20 years to fight inflationEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve ordered the largest interest hike in more than two decades Wednesday as part of its escalating campaign to battle stubbornly high inflation.
"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing," Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Rising interest rates increase the cost of all kinds of credit, from auto loans to home mortgages.
But Powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth.
In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed announced plans to begin gradually reducing its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities on June 1.

     Fed hikes interest rates for second time in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel of Fed officials in charge of monetary policy, boosted interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to a target range of 0.75 to 1 percent.
Rates on credit cards, short-term credit products and loans with adjustable interest rates — which lenders often tie to the Fed’s baseline interest rate range — are set to rise immediately.
Fed officials are hoping to bring inflation down by reducing consumer and business spending through higher interest rates.
When the Fed raises interest rates quickly to stop rising inflation, the steep rise in borrowing costs can slow the economy into a recession and an increase in unemployment.
Powell and Fed officials have expressed confidence the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates without a stoppage in growth or joblessness rising.

     Markets Cheer After Powell Downplays Even Larger Rate Hikes

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 climbed 3%, its best day since May 2020.
Political Cartoons View All 485 ImagesThe comments came shortly after the Fed said it raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by a half-percentage point, it’s most aggressive move since 2000, and signaled further large rate hikes ahead.
The S&amp;P 500 rose 124.69 points to 4,300.17.
The VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&amp;P 500, fell about 11%, one of its biggest drops this year, after Powell's remarks.
Roughly 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 notched gains, with technology companies powering much of the advance.

     Summary: The Fed hikes rates to curb borrowing, cool off an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes.
The unusual dynamic is stoking worries that rapid Fed rate hikes could tip the economy into recession.
Behind the aggressive approach is annual inflation that reached a new 40-year high of 8.6% in March.
Powell, though, said the Fed won't ease off rate increases until it's confident "inflation is under control and starting to come down."
Fed officials also have discussed the possibility of selling the assets to diminish its balance sheet more quickly if necessary.

     Fed Authorizes Biggest Interest Rate Hike In 22 Years To Fight Inflation Amid ‘Violent’ Stock Selloff
    </h2>

     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points—the most since May 2000.
The increase—the largest since May 2000—was approved unanimously and comes after Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged inflation is “much too high” in late March and pledged to “move expeditiously .
“A repricing of stocks is currently taking place due to rising interest rates, which mathematically makes stocks less attractive,” explains David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of $3.6 billion advisory The Bahnsen Group.
“Recession risks are low now, but elevated in 2023 as inflation could force the Fed to hike until it hurts,” he said.

     Fed raises interest rates by 0.50%, largest move since 2000
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised short-term interest rates by 0.50%, as part of an effort to tamp down the inflationary pressures weighing on Americans.
The decision to raise rates by 0.50% marked the most aggressive increase made in a single meeting since May 2000.
Over the last two decades, the Fed has opted to raise interest rates only in increments of 0.25%, with the latest move underscoring the severity that inflation poses at the moment.
The Fed is now targeting interest rates in a range between 0.75% and 1.00%, with some Fed officials advocating for raising the target closer to 2.5% by the end of the year.
Fed hikes bleed through the economy in the form of higher interest rates on credit products like credit cards, mortgages, and business loans.
