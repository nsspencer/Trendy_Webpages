     Fed Makes Biggest Interest Rate Increase Since 2000 as High Inflation Persists
    </h2>

     Summary: “They’re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing, or even making supply chains temporarily worse,” Mr. Powell said.
Officials began to raise interest rates in March and have recently signaled that they will lift borrowing costs up to the point where they begin to constrain the economy.
Mr. Powell said that once they achieved that goal, officials would assess how the economy was performing and continue to raise rates if doing so was necessary.
The Fed’s policy rate is now set to a range of 0.75 to 1 percent.
“The market was really spooked” about the potential for a three-quarter-point hike, Ms. Misra at TD said.

     Summary: The Fed raises interest rates by the most in over 20 years to fight inflationEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve ordered the largest interest hike in more than two decades Wednesday as part of its escalating campaign to battle stubbornly high inflation.
"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing," Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Rising interest rates increase the cost of all kinds of credit, from auto loans to home mortgages.
But Powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth.
In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed announced plans to begin gradually reducing its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities on June 1.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the speed with which interest rates are expected to go up underscores its concern about the soaring cost of living.
Before the Great Recession of 2007-2009, Fed rates got as high as 5.25%.
Still, the impact to borrowing costs in coming months will depend chiefly on the -- as yet undetermined -- pace of the Fed's rate hikes.
The good news, however, is that these savings rates will rise as the Fed moves interest rates higher.
Zero percent interest rates depress government bond rates, essentially forcing investors to bet on riskier assets like stocks.

     Fed raises interest rates by 0.50%, largest move since 2000
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised short-term interest rates by 0.50%, as part of an effort to tamp down on the inflationary pressures weighing on Americans.
The decision to raise rates by 0.50% marked the most aggressive increase made in a single meeting since May 2000.
Over the last two decades, the Fed has opted to raise interest rates only in increments of 0.25%, with the latest move underscoring the severity that inflation poses at the moment.
The Fed is now targeting interest rates in a range between 0.75% and 1.00%, with some Fed officials advocating for raising the target closer to 2.5% by the end of the year.
Fed hikes bleed through the economy in the form of higher interest rates on credit products like credit cards, mortgages, and business loans.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday by half a percentage point, or 0.5%, the largest increase in more than two decades.
“In the economy, higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for firms, businesses and households.
The traditional, simplified logic around rising interest rates is that they’re bad for borrowers, who pay higher costs for loans.
The average interest rate for savings accounts has remained at just 0.06% for an entire year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.“Banks are taking care of themselves first.
With the Fed selling these securities and increasing the supply in the market, borrowers will have to offer higher interest rates to find buyers.

     Summary: We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlookAdvertisement How will higher interest rates affect your finances?
In part, the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the Fed will keep raising rates.
Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers.
They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.This is particularly true for large banks now.
They won't need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or CD buyers.
