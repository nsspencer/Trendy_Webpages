     FL U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz: Some pro-abortion protesters are ‘over-educated, under-loved’ women
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz took to Twitter to discredit women who rallied Tuesday in support of abortion rights as “over-educated” and “under-loved.”At 6:20 AM Wednesday, he tweeted:“How many of the women rallying against overturning Roe are over-educated, under-loved millennials who sadly return from protests to a lonely microwave dinner with their cats, and no bumble matches?”Bumble is a common dating app on smartphones.
Florida women and abortion-rights advocates gathered and protested across the state Tuesday following a leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion indicating the justices at the high court will likely overturn a nearly half-century old landmark case of Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.
Gaetz is a Republican who represents areas in the most western part of the Florida panhandle, a heavily-red voting district.
The U.S. Representative is currently under federal investigation for allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, in connection with former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who has plead guilty to sex trafficking charges of a minor among other charges.
Gaetz was also accused by state Rep. Chris Latvala of creating a point-system game about House members’ sexual conquests within the Florida Capitol, according to the Sun Sentinel in 2020.

     Matt Gaetz Accidentally Reminds People He’s a Loser Who Allegedly Has to Pay Women for Sex
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday evening, millions of Americans learned the horrifying news that in the very near future, abortion could be severely restricted or fully outlawed in nearly half the country.
And after apparently thinking about it for roughly 36 hours, Rep. Matt Gaetz woke up on Thursday morning and tweeted this:Twitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
Gaetz, of course, denies all this, in addition to a report from The New York Times that cited receipts showing that he and his “wingman,” Joel Greenberg, made online payments to one woman, Greenberg paid a second woman, and both women told their friends the money was for sex with the men.
(Greenberg, who entered a plea deal last year, “will continue to honor his obligations pursuant to that agreement,” his attorney said in August.)
As for the misogynistic “over-educated” bit, well, the jokes just write themselves, and by jokes, we mean cold, hard truths.

     Gaetz faces backlash for ‘over-educated’ women remark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) is facing backlash after questioning how many “over-educated, under-loved” women have participated in protests supporting abortion rights after a draft ruling from the Supreme Court showed that the bench is poised to roll back Roe v. Wade.
“How many of the women rallying against overturning Roe are over-educated, under-loved millennials who sadly return from protests to a lonely microwave dinner with their cats, and no bumble matches?” Gaetz wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning.
A number of tweets criticizing the congressman referenced the sex trafficking investigation that is examining the 39-year-old congressman.
“How many of the Republican politicians trying to control women and restrict their fundamental rights are currently under criminal investigation for sex crimes?” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) wrote on Twitter.
The organization is selling t-shirts that read “Over-Educated Woman Who Supports Abortion Access,” with the proceeds going to the group’s 501(c)(3) abortion fund.

     Trickle-down creeponomics: Gaetz calls women protesting Roe draft opinion ‘over-educated’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Overeducated women?
Gaetz sees women, at least those who disagree with his worldview, as having too much education for their own good.
Mike Huckabee retweeted a video of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaking passionately about the possibility of Roe being overturned.
A new Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 57% of voters want the Supreme Court to uphold abortion rights and that only 28% hope it strikes Roe down.
A 2021 Quinnipiac poll showed that even 39% of Republican voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

     Matt Gaetz Lashes Out At ‘Over-Educated’ Women Protesting For Abortion Rights
    </h2>

     Summary: Matt Gaetz is a model avatar for the Republican Party’s manic culture war.
It makes sense, then, that he delivered the best encapsulation of the socially conservative right’s response to pro-choice protests now sweeping the country.
How many of the women rallying against overturning Roe are over-educated, under-loved millennials who sadly return from protests to a lonely microwave dinner with their cats, and no bumble matches?
— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) May 4, 2022The core of the argument is familiar: feminists are unhappy shrews, and only conservative women are happy and have families.
“Lonely microwave dinner with their cats” derisively refers to feminists as undesirable.
