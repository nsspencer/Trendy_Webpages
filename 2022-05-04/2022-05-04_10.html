     Lyft stock is getting smoked — here's why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lyft (LYFT) stock is getting smoked in early trading Wednesday following an earnings report that beat estimates, but revealed that the company is pumping cash into adding more drivers to its platform.
In the quarter, Lyft reported revenue of $875.6 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $844.5 million and losses per share of $0.57 versus expectations of $0.58.
However, Lyft said it’s going to begin pouring money into growing its driver base in anticipation of a jump in user numbers following the winter Omicron surge.
“Coming out of omicron, we want to invest more in driver supply in Q2 to move our marketplace further into balance,” CFO Elaine Paul said during Lyft’s earnings call.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, called the hit to Lyft’s stock a “severe overreaction” in a note to investors following the company’s earnings report.
