     On Ryan Tannehill and mentorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In case you have been hiding under a rock for the last few hours, Ryan Tannehill said yesterday that it isn’t his job to mentor Malik Willis.
He also went on to say it’s good if Willis learns from him along the way, but the whole quote doesn’t generate clicks.
I said it on Twitter last night, and I will say it again - Tannehill is 100% right here.
It is not his job to mentor Willis.
Like he said yesterday, hopefully Malik will learn some things about being an NFL quarterback from Tannehill.

     Summary: AdvertisementTwo years ago, Tannehill roped the Titans into a four-year extension worth $118 million, including $62 million in fully guaranteed money and $91 million in total guarantees.
Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.
Buy for $478 at AmazonIf it takes a village to raise a quarterback, 33-year-old Ryan Tannehill wants no part of that endeavor.
The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

He also stated he believed Brown and the Titans would get something done.

     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.
