     Drew Barrymore Hopes to Have Britney Spears on Her Show for a “Unique Conversation” About Their Pasts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drew Barrymore wants to dish with the Princess of Pop herself, Britney Spears.
Ahead of the Season 3 premiere of The Drew Barrymore Show, the host/actress/entrepreneur chatted with Variety about the success of her show, and revealed the big name she’s hoping to interview on the daytime hit next.
Although she’s yet to have Spears join her eponymous talk show, Barrymore told Variety she hopes to have an “openhearted” chat with the performer.
And whenever Spears does land beside Barrymore on her show, the actress told Variety she’ll be all ears.
If she can snag an interview with the press-shy Spears, it would surely be the highlight of Barrymore’s talk show host career — if Oprah doesn’t beat her there first.
