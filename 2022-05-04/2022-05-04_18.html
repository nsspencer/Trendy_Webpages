     Summary: “I don't want to get into it, but the umpires were explaining to me the reason why they [ejected Bumgarner],” Lovullo said.
“And it put us really behind the eight ball, it got very aggressive there.
… What led up to that was a little bit probably of Bum being uncomfortable in a certain situation; he said a little bit too much and got ejected.

     Video Reveals What Madison Bumgarner Appeared to Tell Umpire Before Ejection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s only May, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a stranger ejection this MLB season than Madison Bumgarner’s on Tuesday night.
In one of the oddest and most viral moments of the young season, the Diamondbacks pitcher was tossed in the first inning by first base umpire Dan Bellino after getting checked for foreign substances.
During the check, Bellino rubbed Bumgarner’s hand for what felt like an irregularly long time, keeping his eyes fixed on Bumgarner’s face for most of it.
When he finished, Bumgarner said something to Bellino, immediately prompting an ejection.
There’s been no word yet of further disciplinary action levied against Bumgarner, or any public comments on the incident.

     Madison Bumgarner ejected from Arizona Diamondbacks-Miami Marlins game after awkward exchange with umpire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Madison Bumgarner is ejected from the game by Dan Bellino after an altercation during a foreign substances check.
After a foreign substance check in which Bellino stared at Bumgarner during a longer-than-typical examination of his left hand, Bumgarner and Bellino exchanged words.
Bellino told a pool reporter that Bumgarner was ejected for directing profanity at an umpire.
It was just a hand check,'' Bellino said.
Madison Bumgarner reacted furiously after being ejected by umpire Dan Bellino.

     Arizona’s Madison Bumgarner held back by teammates after first-inning ejection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner was ejected Wednesday right after his hand was checked for a foreign substance.
As he was walking to the dugout, the veteran left-hander gestured with his arm before holding his hand out for first base umpire Dan Bellino to take a look.
Diamondbacks executive and former major league right-hander Dan Haren was quick to the pitcher’s defense, saying the umpire instigated Bumgarner.
“Was completely instigated by Dan Bellino, was staring at Bum until he looked at Bellino in the eyes,” Haren tweeted.
Complete BS.”Bumgarner was replaced by right-hander Corbin Martin at the start of the second inning.

     Summary: First base umpire Dan Bellino did his job, checking Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner's hand just in case there were any foreign substances.
Only Bellino and Bumgarner know what was said between them, but the hand check was thorough, one could say.
Maybe a little too much so for Bumgarner, who is known to display a fiery temperament every now and then.
Bumgarner didn't have much more to say about the ejection, other than he was not thrown out because of anything on his hand.
Bumgarner entered the game with a 1.17 earned run average, with his velocity back up and his cutter effective.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But local native Pavin Smith, in front of family sitting near home plate, helped give the Diamondbacks their first series sweep in Miami since 2015.
His two-run home run with one out in the top of the ninth gave Arizona an 8-7 lead.
The Marlins took a 7-6 lead to the ninth inning, scoring four runs combined in the seventh and eighth innings.
I think everybody is that watched that game and played in that game," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.
Arizona scored 18 runs in the three games in Miami, and although all were close games, the Diamondbacks totaled 27 hits.

     Summary: Diamondbacks starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner gave up a home run to lead off the bottom of the first inning against the Marlins in Miami on Wednesday in matinee action.
He then recorded three outs, but wouldn't make it into the dugout before being ejected from the game.
Bumgarner appeared to be a bit less-than-enthused over at least one call from home plate umpire Ryan Wills.
The ensuing now-standard "sticky stuff" check of his hands resulted in a quick exchange of words before Bumgarner got the heave-ho from first base umpire Dan Bellino.
To the action footage:The Diamondbacks would respond with an 8-7 win, on the strength of a five-run third inning, to sweep the Marlins.

Is this a hypnosis or a hand check?
