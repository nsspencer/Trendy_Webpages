     Ryan Tannehill should not be expected to mentor Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesTitans quarterback Ryan Tannehill made waves on Tuesday by saying it’s not his job to mentor rookie quarterback Malik Willis.
And it’s not Tannehill’s job to mentor Malik Willis.
. . so for all you young QBs that need a mentor, DM me &amp; Ill be that guy, happy to help in any way I can!”What if Tannehill isn’t ready to concede that Willis is the next guy?
What if Tannehill, who is still only 33, intends to stick around for more than the four years of the rookie contract Willis will sign?
Regardless, no NFL starter who intends to keep that job indefinitely should be expected or inclined to help his understudy become good enough to take over.

Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.
