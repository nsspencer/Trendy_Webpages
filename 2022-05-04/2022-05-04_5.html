    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) An opposition group that is actively campaigning against Rep. Madison Cawthorn has released a video clip appearing to show the North Carolina Republican naked in bed and, as Cawthorn described it, "being crass with a friend" and "acting foolish."
After the video appeared on social media, Cawthorn tweeted, "A new hit against me just dropped.
Years ago, in this video, I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny.
I told you there would be a drip drip campaign.
But he has caused a number of distractions for House Republicans, who are trying to win the majority in November.

     Summary: US Representative Madison Cawthorn released a new video defending himself after a series of negative stories, saying the media is unfairly attacking the North Carolina freshman.
Particularly, Mr Cawthorn criticised Politico, which published photos of him wearing lingerie during what the congressman described as a scavenger hunt game on a cruise.
Mr Smith is Mr Cawthorn’s cousin.
He also noted that Mr Smith is his aide on Capitol Hill, which Congress is required to provide under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Mr Cawthorn faces a tough primary challenge on 17 May and he angered multiple Republicans when he said on a podcast that members of Congress invited him to an orgy and do cocaine in front of him.

     Summary: Should Trump run for president again, a challenge to his eligibility is probably forthcoming.
AdvertisementGreene sued in her case but lost in federal court; while she appeals, state officials are evaluating her fitness for office.
The judge, a Trump appointee, also ruled that the voters could not appeal the ruling in place of state officials.
He noted that under the Fourteenth Amendment, two-thirds of Congress can grant amnesty to an insurrectionist.
“I don’t think a federal judge or anyone can determine eligibility for Congress” except Congress itself, he said.
