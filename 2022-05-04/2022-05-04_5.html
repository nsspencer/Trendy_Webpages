     With Late Rally, Real Madrid Overcomes City and Outdoes Itself
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It does not seem too florid, too ethereal, to suggest that Real Madrid does not so much beat teams at soccer as overwhelm them by harnessing some elemental force, something that naturally occurs in its environment.
Real Madrid did not particularly like the turn the universe was taking.
It did not have any great desire to exist in a dimension in which Manchester City was in the Champions League final and it was not.
Manchester City was now living in Real Madrid’s world, and the ending in Real Madrid’s world is always the same.
A few minutes into extra time, Karim Benzema tumbled over Ruben Días’s outstretched leg.

     Real Madrid mounts stunning comeback to beat Manchester City and reach Champions League final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Real Madrid battled back from the brink of elimination to overcome Manchester City and book its place in the Champions League final.
It will be the fifth time Ancelotti has reached the Champions League final as a manager, the only man to have ever achieved that feat.
There is just something intangible -- almost mystical -- that hangs in the air on a Champions League night in this stadium.
It's Nacho's use of the word "magic" that feels most accurate on Champions League nights.
But just when fans were finally starting to believe that "magic" wasn't real, Real once again proved that it just might be.
