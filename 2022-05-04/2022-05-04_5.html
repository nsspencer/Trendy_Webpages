     Summary: Lyft President John Zimmer (R) and CEO Logan Green speak as Lyft lists on the Nasdaq at an IPO event in Los Angeles March 29, 2019.
Lyft shares plunged 29.9% Wednesday as investors expect short-term headwinds to weigh on the company.
Lyft reported better-than-expected results on both the top and bottom lines after the bell on Tuesday.
But the company provided light guidance for the second quarter and said it would have to keep spending on driver incentives due to surging gas prices, sending shares tumbling.
"We can understand why the stock is lower following the Q1 call (namely: disappointing EBITDA guidance), and we are cutting our price target to reflect sector-wide multiple compression and lower conviction re: margins.

     Lyft stock is getting smoked — here's why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lyft (LYFT) stock is getting smoked in early trading Wednesday following an earnings report that beat estimates, but revealed that the company is pumping cash into adding more drivers to its platform.
In the quarter, Lyft reported revenue of $875.6 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $844.5 million and losses per share of $0.57 versus expectations of $0.58.
However, Lyft said it’s going to begin pouring money into growing its driver base in anticipation of a jump in user numbers following the winter Omicron surge.
“Coming out of omicron, we want to invest more in driver supply in Q2 to move our marketplace further into balance,” CFO Elaine Paul said during Lyft’s earnings call.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, called the hit to Lyft’s stock a “severe overreaction” in a note to investors following the company’s earnings report.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "As a negative, Lyft is spending money like a 1980s Rock Star and this will have a violent negative reaction from investors in an already jittery market," Ives wrote in a note to clients.
In addition, Arounian noted that investor "patience is wearing thin" on Lyft (LYFT) but said that the sharp decline in the company's share price was a "severe overreaction."
Lyft (LYFT) said it generated $55 million in EBITDA during the first quarter and $876 million in revenue, up 44% on a year-over-year basis.
As a result, Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil downgraded Lyft (LYFT) to neutral from positive and lowered the stock's price target to $25.
In April, investment firm New Street Research said a merger between Lyft (LYFT) and DoorDash (DASH) made sense, noting the businesses complement each other.
