     Is the Marvel Comics Version of Jake Lockley the Same as 'Moon Knight's' Jake Lockley?

     Summary: Spoiler alert: The following article contains spoilers for the Moon Knight Season 1 finale on Disney Plus.
It was Jake Lockley (Oscar Isaac) all along!
From the start of Moon Knight, it was obvious that there was another, far more violent identity of Marc Spector (Oscar Isaac) that Marc himself was not aware of.
This identity isn't afraid to kill when necessary.
Khonshu (F. Murray Abraham/Karim El Hakim) utilized Jake to his advantage, whenever Marc/Steven refused to enact his vengeance.

     Summary: And while Khonshu may have freed Marc and Steven, Jake is still very much in his service.
So...what exactly was happening in that Moon Knight credits scene?
We don't know whether Moon Knight will next continue in another season, or as a supporting character in someone's movie (maybe Blade?
Moon Knight By Lemire &amp; Smallwood: The Complete Collection amazon.com $47.35 SHOP NOWPrior to the big credits scene reveal, the Jake persona had already been teased a few times in the Moon Knight TV show.
And, as that credits scene shows, the fact that this third persona—being sold as the most vicious and violent—is still in league with Khonshu means that Marc/Steven/Jake is still Moon Knight.

“You're trying to ride this line of it being like, the mystery that may not mean a lot to people that don't know the Moon Knight canon super well.
And even though viewers only spend a few minutes with Jake, it’s clear that “this isn't Marc.
It's like if [you met him, you’d] be like, ‘wow, so you're Jake Lockley,’ in a way that you're kind of enamored and scared at the same time.
That was always the goal and the ambition.”All episodes of Marvel Studios' Moon Knight are now streaming exclusively on Disney+!

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel’s latest Disney Plus series, Moon Knight, took its bows with its final episode in classic Marvel fashion: A shocking revelation delivered via credits scene.
Also in classic Marvel fashion, Moon Knight’s credits scene opens many more questions than it answers, and its final episode is long on hints and short on concrete resolution.
Here’s everything we were left wondering at the end of Moon Knight’s finale, and how Marvel Comics might have the answers.
note: This post contains spoilers for all of Moon Knight, in case you hadn’t figured that out.]
A nattily-suited Khonshu is a staple of Moon Knight comics, and he looks just as good in live action as on the page.
