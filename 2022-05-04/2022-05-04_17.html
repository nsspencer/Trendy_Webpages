     Intuit Will Refund $141 Million to Low-Income TurboTax Users
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For years, the maker of the TurboTax software claimed that people could file their tax returns online for free.
Millions of customers signed up, only to pay hidden fees later in the process.
Ms. James announced on Wednesday that Intuit, the company creating the software, would pay back $141 million to more than four million Americans who were unfairly charged for tax services that were falsely advertised as free.
The settlement also requires Intuit, which enticed customers with its “free, free, free” ad campaign, to stop misrepresenting its tax products.
Intuit said in a statement that the company did not admit any wrongdoing and agreed to pay the settlement fee “to put this matter behind it.”

     AG Paxton Secures $14 Million in Restitution for Consumers in Settlement with Intuit Turbo Tax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Attorney General Paxton announced a significant settlement against Inuit Inc., who markets the popular product “Turbo Tax.” Texas will receive more than $14 million in restitution for Texas consumers as part of a $141 million multistate settlement, which resolves an investigation begun over two years ago.
Eligible Texas consumers should begin receiving their restitution payments within the next few months.
This settlement comes on the heels of opioid settlements previously announced by Attorney General Ken Paxton in February 2022, that also widely benefit Texas consumers.
In those settlements, Attorney General Paxton successfully secured over $1.819 billion from the makers and distributors of opioids as well as industry-changing injunctive relief.
From 2017 through 2021, the cases brought by Attorney General Paxton’s Consumer Protection Division have resulted in over $60 million in ordered restitution.

     TurboTax settlement: Firm to pay $141 million for false promises of free filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressNEW YORK – The company behind the TurboTax tax-filing program will pay $141 million to customers deceived by misleading promises of free tax-filing services, New York's attorney general announced Wednesday.
Under the terms of a settlement signed by the attorneys general of all 50 states, Mountain View, California-based Intuit will suspend TurboTax’s “free, free, free” ad campaign and pay restitution to nearly 4.4 million taxpayers, New York Attorney General Letitia James said.
One was through its participation in the IRS Free File Program, geared toward taxpayers earning roughly $34,000 and members of the military.
According to documents obtained by ProPublica, Intuit executives knew they were deceiving customers by advertising free services that were not free to everyone.
“The website lists Free, Free, Free and the customers are assuming their return will be free,” an internal company PowerPoint presentation said.

Puskar/APNEW YORK — The company behind the TurboTax tax-filing program will pay $141 million to customers across the United States who were deceived by misleading promises of free tax-filing services, New York's attorney general announced Wednesday.

     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight TurboTax offered two free products dating to 2020.
The first was for low-income earners and military members as a part of the Internal Revenue Service’s free filing program.
Intuit withdrew from IRS Free File in 2021, saying it could provide more benefits without the program’s limitations.
“Intuit cheated millions of low-income Americans out of free tax filing services they were entitled to,” James said in a statement.
Consumers are set to automatically receive mailed checks of $30 for each year they paid for filing services.

Investigators said Intuit also engaged in deceptive trade practices, including intentionally blocking its IRS Free File landing page from search engine results during the 2019 tax filing season.
As part of the settlement, Intuit must suspend TurboTax's "Free, free, free" ad campaign that "lured" customers with promises of free tax preparation services, "only to deceive them into paying," according to a release from James' office.
The commercial, which aired during the Super Bowl, featured an announcer declaring "TurboTax Free is free.
Free, free, free, free."
