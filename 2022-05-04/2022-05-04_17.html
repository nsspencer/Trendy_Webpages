     Amber Heard Testifies About a ‘Pattern’ of Violence by Johnny Depp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard, an actress defending herself against a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, took the stand on Wednesday, recalling how a whirlwind romance that started on a movie set descended into a “pattern” of violence perpetrated against her by the actor.
The couple first got to know each other in 2009 on the set of “The Rum Diary,” a movie that Mr. Depp produced and starred in, and they fell in love on the movie’s press tour, Ms. Heard testified.
But by 2012, she said, Mr. Depp was repeatedly accusing her of infidelity and his anger would often escalate to physical attacks, despite her denials.
“He would explode,” Ms. Heard said, recounting how Mr. Depp would punch walls next to her head, shove her to the ground and slap her repetitively.
Ms. Heard often grew emotional during her testimony as she explained the physical confrontations in graphic terms, at times appearing chagrined as she gave reasons for staying in the relationship despite her misgivings.

    </h2>

     Summary: Heard said Depp got on his knees and started crying and promised her he would never hurt her again.
Heard said March 2013 was a particularly rough time because Depp started drinking again after a bout with sobriety.
Heard said she didn't know what he was talking about, but soon he started patting her down and doing a "cavity search" on her.
When Heard and Depp made it to their hotel in Russia, Heard said Depp "whacked" her in the face, and she got a bloody nose.
"There was this sense that he didn't know what was going on," she continued.

     Summary: Amber Heard accuses Johnny Depp of physical abuse on her first day of testimonyEnlarge this image toggle caption Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty Images Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty ImagesAmber Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia courtroom on Wednesday to discuss her experiences and her relationship with Johnny Depp, her ex-husband, who is suing Heard in a $50 million defamation case.
Over more than two hours Heard described years of alleged abuse at the hands of Depp.
Depp has denied committing violence against Heard in his own lengthy testimony in the case at the Fairfax County Circuit Court.
In court, Heard described first meeting Depp when she was 22, saying there was a mutual electricity between them, despite both being in other long-term, committed relationships.
Earlier in the day, psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that Heard endured emotional abuse and intimate partner violence during her time with Depp.

On May 4, the actress took the stand and began testifying in a Virginia courtroom as part of Johnny Depp's $50 million defamation lawsuit against her.
"I am here because my ex-husband is suing me for an op-ed I wrote," she said.
Back in 2018, Heard wrote an essay for the Washington Post in which she described herself as a "public figure representing domestic abuse."
Although the article never mentioned Depp by name, his attorneys previously said in court documents that Heard's op-ed was all part of an "elaborate hoax."

Heard recalled that Lily-Rose began crying and she comforted her before Depp came in and asked his daughter to leave.

A “jar of cocaine” sat nearby, the court heard, and Heard asked Depp about the “Wino Forever” tattoo on his arm.
Depp, Heard said, criticized her choice of clothes – about “pouring herself out” in a low-cut dress at a charity event.
Heard testified that Depp was deeply jealous and that his jealousy turned their relationship into “a never-ending fight”.
And Johnny on opiates is very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,” Heard testified.

She laughed when Depp told her it said “Wino” — an alteration to a tattoo he had made when he’d been dating actor Winona Ryder.
That allegation never made any sense to me.”Through most of Heard’s testimony, Depp stared down at the table in front of him.
During cross-examination Wednesday, Hughes acknowledged that she wasn’t making factual determinations that Depp assaulted Heard on specific occasions.
