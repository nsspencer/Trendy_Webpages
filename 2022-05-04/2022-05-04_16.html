In Florida, overturning Roe v. Wade means a 15-week abortion ban signed into law by the governor would no longer be considered unconstitutional.
That usually happens about five-and-a-half or six weeks into a pregnancy, which falls short of the roughly 24 weeks protected under Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce its final decision on Roe v. Wade this summer.

     Where DC, Maryland and Virginia abortion laws stand amid Roe v. Wade SCOTUS draft

     Summary: Local and state abortion laws have come back into focus after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.Local abortion laws have come back into focus after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.
Currently, 23 states have either laws limiting abortion that predate the original Roe v. Wade or “trigger” laws that would restrict or outright ban abortion if Roe was overturned, according to the abortion rights Guttmacher Institute.
Locally, D.C., Maryland and Virginia generally don’t restrict access to abortions, but each have some unique considerations.
As NBC Washington reported, if Republicans take control of Congress in the midterm elections this fall, it could put D.C.’s access to abortion on shakier ground.
He has not yet laid out any plans to change Virginia’s abortion laws.
