     The Fight Over Abortion History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mary Ziegler, the author of several books on the history of abortion (and a critic of the draft decision), said that part was correct.
This is the argument made in the historians’ brief, which outlines the history of abortion regulation up to 1866.
For decades after the founding of the United States, common law did not regulate abortion, or even recognize that abortion was happening at that early stage.
“That is because common law did not even acknowledge a fetus as existing separately from a pregnant woman” before quickening, the historians argue.
It was considered a life.”Justice Alito’s SourcesWhile the draft makes references to the historians’ brief, it relies more heavily on other sources, including “Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History,” a 2006 book by Joseph W. Dellapenna that challenged Justice Blackmun’s historical arguments in Roe.

     Summary: Her situation indeed felt difficult: three young children at home, a husband in prison, an unfinished college education.
Another baby, she told herself, would send her struggling family straight over the edge.
“I never thought I would be here,” said the woman, who before coming in had driven past a few anti-abortion protesters demonstrating outside and had to stop her car to throw up.
“It took me a lot to be here today.

     Summary: For purple states like Pennsylvania, abortion laws may depend on who becomes governorIf the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion in purple states, like Pennsylvania, might largely depend on which party can keep or take control of state government.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is term limited.
And like some other purple states, the race for governor looks neck-and-neck between Democrats and Republicans.
DUNKLAU: In a recent statewide poll, 53% of Pennsylvania voters said abortion should remain legal in certain circumstances.
When there's abortion, there's no chance.

In Florida, overturning Roe v. Wade means a 15-week abortion ban signed into law by the governor would no longer be considered unconstitutional.
That usually happens about five-and-a-half or six weeks into a pregnancy, which falls short of the roughly 24 weeks protected under Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce its final decision on Roe v. Wade this summer.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Larry Hogan (R) has decided to withhold the $3.5 million that state lawmakers designated for training new providers, his spokesman said.
Ariana B. Kelly (D-Montgomery), the lead sponsor of Maryland’s abortion access law.
Private organizations can train providers to perform abortions, and advocates said most medical abortions do not require extensive training.
Since most abortion training takes place in clinical settings, if those states ban abortion, medical training to perform abortions could be severely curtailed, Kelly said.
He’s barred from spending that money on anything besides abortion training, but he can use his discretion on whether to spend it at all.

     Summary: Florida law allows abortion until the third trimester — about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
Beginning July 1, Florida will have the state’s strictest ban on abortions in the post Roe v. Wade era.
• • •Will the new Florida law make exceptions for pregnancies arising from rape, incest or human trafficking?
• • •Will medication abortion options still be allowed in Florida under the new law?
Although Florida law doesn’t ban telehealth prescriptions outright, the in-person requirement means they aren’t an option for Florida residents seeking an abortion.
