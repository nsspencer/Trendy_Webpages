     Obi-Wan Kenobi’s latest trailer shows him trying (and failing) to train Luke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A second trailer for the Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series has been released to celebrate Star Wars Day, May the 4th.
In it, we see Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan trying to convince a reluctant Owen Lars (Joel Edgerton) to let him train a young Luke Skywalker.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to premiere on the streaming service on Friday, May 27th and will run for six episodes.
At this point in the Star Wars story, the Empire is now in control of the galaxy and all remaining Jedi are now being hunted down and killed by Vader’s Inquisitors.
Obi-Wan Kenobi features Hayden Christensen set to reprise his role as Darth Vader from the prequels.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lucasfilm’s new trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi offers a glimpse at some of the rest of the cast, including Kumail Nanjiani (who may also be a Jedi?)
and Joel Edgerton as Owen Lars, who seems none too happy to see Kenobi show up and want to train a very young Luke Skywalker.
(Last time, all we got was Vader breathing!)
Joining Ewan McGregor and Christensen in Obi-Wan Kenobi are Moses Ingram, Bonnie Piesse, Indira Varma, Rupert Friend, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Sung Kang, Simone Kessell, and Benny Safdie.
Obi-Wan Kenobi will premiere on Disney Plus with a two-episode event.

     New 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Poster Teases a Duel of the Fates

     Summary: debuted a new poster for the upcoming live-action Star Wars series Obi-Wan Kenobi.
COLLIDER VIDEO OF THE DAYImage via LucasfilmRELATED: 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Trailer Teases Darth Vader and Reveals Kumail Nanjiani's CharacterThe series marks the return of Hayden Christensen in the role of Vader.
In a way, the Obi-Wan Kenobi series is a do-over for both McGregor and Christensen, who have both had very different careers after appearing in the prequel films.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is the third live-action Star Wars series for the Disney+ streaming service, following The Mandalorian (which is entering its third season) and The Book of Boba Fett.
Obi-Wan Kenobi will premiere on Disney+ on Friday, May 27, with the first two episodes.

     'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Feels Like the Last Hope for Star Wars Under Disney
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A message that kickstarts the movie's second act and -- in many ways -- the Star Wars franchise as an enterprise:"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Me: A bruised and battered Star Wars fan, watching aghast as Disney released clunker after clunker into the canon.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a central character in the Star Wars universe, and he's played by one of Hollywood's biggest stars.
Prequel-land feels like a different Star Wars universe that's less rigid and lived in.
Maybe I'm guilty of projecting my own hopes and dreams here, but perhaps Obi-Wan Kenobi can make Star Wars feel vast and unknowable again.
