     Uber continues its recovery from the pandemic lull but loses $5.6 billion from investments.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Uber on Wednesday reported strong growth in its ride-hailing and delivery businesses and said it was continuing to bounce back from a pandemic slump, even as it lost $5.6 billion because of its investments in other ride-sharing companies, primarily the Chinese service Didi.
The company reported $6.9 billion in revenue for the first three months of 2022, outstripping analysts’ expectations and skyrocketing 136 percent compared with revenue from the same time last year, when Covid vaccines were scarce and people were not traveling as much.
Uber also said it logged 1.7 billion trips during the quarter and had 115 million people using its platform each month, an 18 percent and 17 percent increase, respectively, year over year.
Now, “as people have returned to offices, restaurants, pubs, stadiums and airports around the world, they’ve returned to Uber,” Dara Khosrowshahi, the company’s chief executive, said in prepared remarks to investors.
He added that the company’s results “make clear that we are emerging on a strong path out of the pandemic.”
