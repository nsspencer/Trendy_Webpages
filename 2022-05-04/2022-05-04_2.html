     A new 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' trailer teases appearances from Darth Vader and young Luke Skywalker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is back -- but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
-- May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
Years after Emperor Palpatine rose to power and "Order 66'd" most Jedi, Obi-Wan still can't catch a break: He's evading evil Inquisitors intent on hunting him down as one of the galaxy's last living Jedi and keeping careful tabs on a young Luke Skywalker, living simply on his Uncle Owen's moisture farm on Tatooine.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the "Star Wars" timeline , only recently became a Sith.
It's likely -- Hayden Christensen is reprising his role as a badly burnt Anakin/Vader in the series.

     New Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer Reveals How The Empire Framed Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This image from showrunner Deborah Chow's new series tells us how the Empire explained Kenobi's “crime” to the public.
It simply has to be decoded from the Star Wars alphabet known as Aurebesh.
The Empire wants Kenobi returned.
Whatever the case, we know that by the time Vader confronts Kenobi in 1977's original Star Wars, his patience is at an end.
Vader strikes Kenobi down, even after being warned this will only make Kenobi more powerful than he can imagine.

     New ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ trailer from Disney+ teases Darth Vader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In honor of “Star Wars Day,” Disney+ has released another trailer for its upcoming “Obi-Wan Kenobi” series starring Ewan McGregor as the storied Jedi Master.
Much like the first trailer, it’s filled with many of the usual “Star Wars” standards — swinging lightsabers, sleek spaceships, people looking miserable on the desert planet of Tatooine, etc.
But this time around, Disney+ is giving fans a look at Darth Vader — or at least parts of him.
Lucasfilm had previously teased an image of Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) from the upcoming series.
The series is just one of several upcoming “Star Wars” series to be produced for the streaming service, including “Andor,” starring Diego Luna, and “Ahsoka,” starring Rosario Dawson, among others.
