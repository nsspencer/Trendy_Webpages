     Did you know the original iconic 'Star Wars' character art was created by a Hoosier?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of the most iconic images in science fiction and popular culture — spaceships from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T.," the menacing Darth Vader of "Star Wars" fame and many more — were born in a Hoosier's brain.
He died in 2012 after a lifetime of professional artistic accomplishments, most notably providing the visual blueprint for many of the "Star Wars" franchise's locations and characters.
McQuarrie's original "Star Wars" paintings were based only on descriptions from Lucas, a few pages of the script and comic book illustrations Lucas had used as inspiration.
The Times also noted Hasbro eventually created a toy line based on McQuarrie's "Star Wars" concept art.
In addition to "Star Wars," McQuarrie also worked on "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Star Trek IV," "Jurassic Park" and the original "Battlestar Galactica" TV series.
