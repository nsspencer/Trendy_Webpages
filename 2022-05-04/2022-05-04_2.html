     Summary: The official trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi has arrived in celebration of May the 4th, and it’s filled with new imagery and details from the upcoming limited series.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, starting May 27 on Disney+, follows Ewan McGregor’s legendary Jedi Master 10 years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.
As seen in the new trailer, the hunt is on for the Jedi — and Obi-Wan in particular.
It’s a sentiment that draws a straight line to his concerns in Star Wars: A New Hope.
