     Dave Chappelle Attacked Onstage During Hollywood Bowl Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday night, during Dave Chappelle’s stand-up comedy performance at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl, a man rushed onstage and tackled the comic mid-performance before being subdued—and stomped down—by a number of security guards and Chappelle’s entourage, which included the actor Jamie Foxx.
Chappelle, 48, was performing a set as part of Netflix’s inaugural comedy festival, Netflix Is A Joke Fest.
Earlier in the set, he discussed how he had to increase his security personnel in the wake of the Netflix controversy.
After the melee, Chappelle brought opener Chris Rock out onstage, who joked “it was Will Smith.” Chappelle also brought out Foxx for a standing ovation, and then announced: “I’ve been doing this for 35 years.
I’ve always wanted to do that.”Last fall, Netflix employees staged a walkout in protest of Chappelle’s The Closer, which contained a number of transphobic jokes.
