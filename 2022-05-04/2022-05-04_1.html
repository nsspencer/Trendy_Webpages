     Dave Chappelle Tackled While Performing Onstage at Hollywood Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Comedian Dave Chappelle was attacked while performing on stage Tuesday at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.
(The Hollywood Bowl website indicates that attendees’ phones were to be secured in Yondr devices, which allow guests to keep their phones, but seals them off so they can’t be used.
“Whenever you’re in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff’s hat,” quipped Chappelle at the show’s curtain call.
You’re a legend, and we’re not going to let nothing happen to you.”Variety has reached out to Netflix, LAPD and the Hollywood Bowl for comment.
Most recently, Chappelle made the news for helping to kill an affordable housing plan in his hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio.
