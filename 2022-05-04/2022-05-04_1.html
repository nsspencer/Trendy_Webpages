     Dave Chappelle Attacked While Performing at the Hollywood Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A spokesperson for the comedian could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
It was not immediately clear what prompted the man to rush the stage.
Footage circulating on social media appeared to show the man charging into Mr. Chappelle as he performed.
Ms. Sacks wrote that police officers and Fire Department officials later loaded the man into an ambulance.
She wrote that the actor Jamie Foxx went onstage after Mr. Chappelle, 48, was tackled, looking “absolutely shocked,” and that the musicians Mos Def and Talib Kweli performed as vehicles from the Los Angeles Police Department arrived behind the stage.
