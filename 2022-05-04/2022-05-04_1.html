     Summary: Dave Chappelle was apparently unharmed after an audience member rushed the stage and physically attacked the comedian in the middle of his performance in Los Angeles Tuesday night.
Security staff chased the attacker until they detained him off stage at the Hollywood Bowl.
The attacker was later escorted from the venue on a stretcher and appeared to have injuries to his arm and face.
In the special, Chappelle jokes about trans women and their genitalia and defends J.K. Rowling against critics who say she is transphobic.
Rock, who had a brief set earlier in the show, came back on stage and joked, "Was that Will Smith?"
