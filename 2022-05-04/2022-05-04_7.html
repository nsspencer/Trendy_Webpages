     On Ryan Tannehill and mentorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In case you have been hiding under a rock for the last few hours, Ryan Tannehill said yesterday that it isn’t his job to mentor Malik Willis.
He also went on to say it’s good if Willis learns from him along the way, but the whole quote doesn’t generate clicks.
I said it on Twitter last night, and I will say it again - Tannehill is 100% right here.
It is not his job to mentor Willis.
Like he said yesterday, hopefully Malik will learn some things about being an NFL quarterback from Tannehill.

     Summary: AdvertisementTwo years ago, Tannehill roped the Titans into a four-year extension worth $118 million, including $62 million in fully guaranteed money and $91 million in total guarantees.
Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.
Buy for $478 at AmazonIf it takes a village to raise a quarterback, 33-year-old Ryan Tannehill wants no part of that endeavor.
The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

     Ryan Tannehill Won't 'Mentor' Malik Willis; Will Falcons QB Marcus Mariota Do The Same?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill shocked reporters during a press conference earlier this week when he said he wouldn't mentor his rookie teammate Malik Willis.
Christopher Hanewinc/USA Today Sports Ryan Tannehill, Marcus Mariota Marcus Mariota Arthur Smith, Marcus Mariota"I don't think it's my job to mentor him," Tannehill told reporters.
Ultimately, Tannehill was given the opportunity to start after Mariota was benched and has started every game for the Titans since.
Mariota signed with the Las Vegas Raiders as a backup to Derek Carr for two seasons before joining the Falcons and being given an opportunity to start.
It's probably a large reason why the team signed Mariota knowing another quarterback was on the way to compete alongside him for the starting job.

     Summary: Perhaps nobody on the Tennessee Titans had a tougher draft weekend than quarterback Ryan Tannehill.
Brown, who was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Titans also drafted someone the team hopes will be his future replacement, Liberty signal-caller, Malik Willis.
As far as Brown no longer being in Nashville is concerned, Tannehill said the loss of the Ole Miss product “hurts” both professionally and personally.
He also stated he believed Brown and the Titans would get something done.
Happy to see him get what he wanted, but at the end of the day, it hurts.”Tannehill said he honestly thought #Titans and AJ Brown would get a deal done.

     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.

     NFL insider notebook: Ryan Tannehill taking undue flak over Malik Willis comments, plus Panthers shakeup, more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Tannehill wants to play quarterback of the Tennessee Titans and not be the private coach to rookie Malik Willis?
Tannehill is a capable, 33-year-old starter in the league who's quarterbacked this Titans franchise to three consecutive postseasons.
And then we arrive to the Titans drafting Willis without giving Tannehill a heads up (which they didn't have to do anyway.)
Willis, whom the Titans took with the 86th overall pick last week, has an incredible support system around him.
There was nothing in what he said that indicates he's going to shun Willis or not answer any of his questions.
