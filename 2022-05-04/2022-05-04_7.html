     As mortgage rates rise, here’s how to decide whether you should buy a home or rent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Take these steps before making a decision whether to own a home or rent.
You should also have enough monthly income to afford the mortgage payment, taxes and insurance, as well as extra monthly expenses like utilities.
If you can't afford the monthly payments, continue to rent and keep saving money if homeownership is your ultimate goal, Holbert said.
If high rent prohibits you from saving, consider downsizing or making other big lifestyle changes so you can start putting more money aside.
"While it's really good to save, where you're really going to find that big cash for that down payment is going to be in those big spending categories, like housing or your car."

     Mortgage Rates Started Higher, But Improved After Fed Announcement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mortgage Rates Started Higher, But Improved After Fed AnnouncementToday brought the much-anticipated policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
In other words, today's 0.50% rate hike from the Fed was as close to a 100% certainty as anything ever is when it concerns the future.
In addition to that reassurance, the Fed rolled out its plan to reduce bond holdings, but it did so in a way that suggested the reduction process is finite.
Mortgage lenders priced rates very defensively ahead of the Fed with the average lender at a new long-term high for conventional 30yr fixed scenarios.
After the Fed, when bonds improved, virtually all mortgage lenders have reversed course and are now back in line with their best rates of the week.

The Fed’s role and the latest FOMC meetingThe Federal Reserve doesn’t actually determine mortgage interest rates.
Although rises in the Fed rate normally precede mortgage interest rate growth, lending markets may have already accounted for May’s hike.

     Summary: Lowest Mortgage Rates by StateThe lowest mortgage rates available vary depending on the state where originations occur.
Mortgage rates can be influenced by state-level variations in credit score, average mortgage loan term, and size, as well as individual lenders' varying risk management strategies.
What Causes Mortgage Rates to Rise or Fall?
Macroeconomic factors have kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of this year.
This bond-buying policy (and not the more publicized federal funds rate) is a major influencer on mortgage rates.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House-hunters across the U.S. are confronting a painful reality: Rising mortgage rates are adding thousands of dollars to the cost of buying a home.
In Ohio, for example, the average mortgage rate has shot up to 5.33%, up from 3.94% in January.
Although home loan costs don't usually rise directly in line with the Fed's benchmark rate, long-term mortgage rates generally track yields on the 10-year Treasury.
Economists don't expect mortgage rates to drop anytime soon.
Analysts at PNC Financial Services Group expect the Fed to raise interest rates half a point on Wednesday in hopes of slowing the crushing inflation impacting U.S. households.

     Mortgage rates loosen inventory in Denver, but prices keep climbing

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Data Desk analyzed a report from the Denver Metro Association of Realtors that seems to indicate the loosening of mortgage rates is loosening up the housing market, but the supply still hasn’t stopped prices from reaching more record highs.
According to the latest Market Trends Report from the Denver Metro Association of Realtors, the high This comes after the latest Market Trends Report from the Denver Metro Association of Realtors, which shows that high mortgage rates seen in April are keeping Coloradans from moving around and loosening the housing supply as a result.
“We normally see an 8.59% increase in month-over-month inventory,” an overview from Andrew Abrams, chair of the DMAR Market Trends Committee read.
Loosened or not, the climbing number of available listings isn’t having any impact on the relentless upward march of prices.
A detached single-family home in the Denver area closed for a median cost of $650,000 in April.
