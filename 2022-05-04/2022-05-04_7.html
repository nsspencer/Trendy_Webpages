     A new 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' trailer teases appearances from Darth Vader and young Luke Skywalker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is back -- but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
-- May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
Years after Emperor Palpatine rose to power and "Order 66'd" most Jedi, Obi-Wan still can't catch a break: He's evading evil Inquisitors intent on hunting him down as one of the galaxy's last living Jedi and keeping careful tabs on a young Luke Skywalker, living simply on his Uncle Owen's moisture farm on Tatooine.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the "Star Wars" timeline , only recently became a Sith.
It's likely -- Hayden Christensen is reprising his role as a badly burnt Anakin/Vader in the series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The official trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi has arrived in celebration of May the 4th, and it’s filled with new imagery and details from the upcoming limited series.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, starting May 27 on Disney+, follows Ewan McGregor’s legendary Jedi Master 10 years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.
As seen in the new trailer, the hunt is on for the Jedi — and Obi-Wan in particular.
It’s a sentiment that draws a straight line to his concerns in Star Wars: A New Hope.

     New ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ trailer from Disney+ teases Darth Vader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In honor of “Star Wars Day,” Disney+ has released another trailer for its upcoming “Obi-Wan Kenobi” series starring Ewan McGregor as the storied Jedi Master.
Much like the first trailer, it’s filled with many of the usual “Star Wars” standards — swinging lightsabers, sleek spaceships, people looking miserable on the desert planet of Tatooine, etc.
But this time around, Disney+ is giving fans a look at Darth Vader — or at least parts of him.
Lucasfilm had previously teased an image of Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) from the upcoming series.
The series is just one of several upcoming “Star Wars” series to be produced for the streaming service, including “Andor,” starring Diego Luna, and “Ahsoka,” starring Rosario Dawson, among others.

     Summary: Basically an official holiday at this point, May 4 is Star Wars’ moment to shine.
Whether that’s through day-long rewatches or dressing up in Jedi robes, it’s the time for fans of the franchise to party like it’s Life Day.
As a little treat, Disney+ has decided to give us a present in the form of a new trailer for the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi series.
With a bit more salt- and-pepper in his beard, Obi-Wan has been keeping watch over a young Luke Skywalker on Tatooine.
In the new trailer, Uncle Owen (Joel Edgerton reprises the role) warns Obi-Wan to stay away from Luke.
