     Will there be a Moon Knight Season 2? This Marvel leak may have the answer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Marvel Television Universe may be hugely important to the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the shows themselves exist on little self-contained islands.
But what does the deletion of “series” and substitution of “season” mean for Moon Knight?
The more exciting interpretation, though, is just the opposite: Maybe there’s more Moon Knight to come in the future, so the inaccurate first tweet was deleted.
Marvel StudiosThis clearly wasn’t something Marvel intended us to see and discuss, especially in the days leading up to the Moon Knight finale.
But Moon Knight is so self-contained that it feels like his story could only continue in the same TV format.

     Summary: The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Marvel’s Moon Knight.
“Series,” of course refers to the show itself; a “series finale” would have meant the end of the Moon Knight as a television show.
(We’re optimistic, at this point, that Moon Knight will appear somewhere in Marvel’s upcoming slate of films, if only as a surprise secondary character.
“Season finale,” however, implies that the series will return to Disney + for a second season.
Director Mohamed Diab, however, appears confident that Moon Knight will return—and not just on the big screen.

     How a Marvel Tweet Could Complicate ‘Moon Knight’ and Oscar Isaac’s Emmys Odds

     Summary: “Moon Knight” has taken off with critics and superhero fans around the globe, raking in enormous numbers for Disney+ and Marvel Studios.
pic.twitter.com/wOAJYgph6P — Moon Knight (@moonknight) May 3, 2022Screen shot taken by THEDIRECT.comThe social “blip” could trigger the Television Academy to reject the submission for “Moon Knight” in the limited series categories, which would force a switch to the drama races.
In 2017, HBO’s “Big Little Lies” dominated with eight Emmys in the limited series categories.
PBS’ “Downton Abbey” won six Emmys in 2011 in the limited categories, including outstanding miniseries or movie.
In addition to “Moon Knight,” he’s the lead and one of the executive producers in HBO’s remake of the 1973 Swedish miniseries “Scenes From a Marriage” alongside recent Oscar-winner Jessica Chastain.

     The ‘Moon Knight’ Finale Demands A Season 2

     Summary: Moon Knight MarvelMoon Knight has finished its six episode, season 1 run here, and even if it’s supposed to be a one-off miniseries, it sure does not present that way in the finale.
If she has a cool name like “Moon Knight” we haven’t heard it yet.
Moon Knight MarvelLayla is a wholly original, non-comics character created specifically for this Moon Knight series, presumably to ensure that a series about Egyptian gods actually had an Egyptian character.
Moon Knight MarvelAgain, it would be another weird turn to finally introduce Jake Lockley as a compounding factor and not bring him back for more in a second season.
We’ll see what happens to Moon Knight, but it’s been a weird, good run so far.
