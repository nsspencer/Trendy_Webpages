     For Star Wars Day, Disney+ releases a new ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ trailer – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star War nerds will be happy to know that Disney+ just released its brand-new trailer for “Obi-Wan Kenobi” to kick off Star Wars Day (aka May the Fourth).
The six-episode, highly anticipated, limited series will premiere exclusively on the service on Friday, May 27.
Typical to Disney+’s release schedule, fans will have to wait weekly to stream each episode until the finale on June 22.
Directed by Deborah Chow, “Obi-Wan Kenobi” takes place a decade after the events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where the Jedi Master (McGregor) is betrayed by his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker.
McGregor will reprise his role along with Hayden Christensen, who played Darth Vader in the prequel films.

     Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer Breakdown: Darth Vader, 4-LOM, Purge Troopers, and Easter Eggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If we were placing bets, we’d say Vader shows up around the end of episode 3.
One of the scum trying to take out Obi-Wan is 4-LOM, the bug-eyed bounty hunter with the protocol droid body.
You’ll spot 4-LOM second on the right in the famous bounty hunter lineup scene (above) in Empire.
This time we see Obi-Wan shooting back at a figure that we can’t quite make out.
You might just assume this is 4-LOM, except that this mystery second attacker is shooting yellow laser bolts at Obi-Wan, while in the previous shot 4-LOM shoots red lasers.

     Star Wars Day: 'Obi Wan' series drops second trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) in a scene from the Disney+ series about the Jedi master.
CNN —“Obi-Wan Kenobi” is back – but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
– May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the “Star Wars” timeline, only recently became a Sith.
And who will get to say, “I have a bad feeling about this?”These and more questions will be answered, hopefully, when “Obi-Wan Kenobi” premieres on May 27 on Disney+.
