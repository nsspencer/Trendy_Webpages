     Fed Makes Biggest Interest Rate Increase Since 2000 as High Inflation Persists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “They’re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing, or even making supply chains temporarily worse,” Mr. Powell said.
Officials began to raise interest rates in March and have recently signaled that they will lift borrowing costs up to the point where they begin to constrain the economy.
Mr. Powell said that once they achieved that goal, officials would assess how the economy was performing and continue to raise rates if doing so was necessary.
The Fed’s policy rate is now set to a range of 0.75 to 1 percent.
“The market was really spooked” about the potential for a three-quarter-point hike, Ms. Misra at TD said.

     Summary: The Fed raises interest rates by the most in over 20 years to fight inflationEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve ordered the largest interest hike in more than two decades Wednesday as part of its escalating campaign to battle stubbornly high inflation.
"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing," Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Rising interest rates increase the cost of all kinds of credit, from auto loans to home mortgages.
But Powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth.
In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed announced plans to begin gradually reducing its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities on June 1.

     Fed hikes interest rates for second time in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel of Fed officials in charge of monetary policy, boosted interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to a target range of 0.75 to 1 percent.
Rates on credit cards, short-term credit products and loans with adjustable interest rates — which lenders often tie to the Fed’s baseline interest rate range — are set to rise immediately.
Fed officials are hoping to bring inflation down by reducing consumer and business spending through higher interest rates.
When the Fed raises interest rates quickly to stop rising inflation, the steep rise in borrowing costs can slow the economy into a recession and an increase in unemployment.
Powell and Fed officials have expressed confidence the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates without a stoppage in growth or joblessness rising.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points—the most since May 2000.
The increase—the largest since May 2000—was approved unanimously and comes after Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged inflation is “much too high” in late March and pledged to “move expeditiously .
“A repricing of stocks is currently taking place due to rising interest rates, which mathematically makes stocks less attractive,” explains David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of $3.6 billion advisory The Bahnsen Group.
“Recession risks are low now, but elevated in 2023 as inflation could force the Fed to hike until it hurts,” he said.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday by half a percentage point, or 0.5%, the largest increase in more than two decades.
“In the economy, higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for firms, businesses and households.
The traditional, simplified logic around rising interest rates is that they’re bad for borrowers, who pay higher costs for loans.
The average interest rate for savings accounts has remained at just 0.06% for an entire year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.“Banks are taking care of themselves first.
With the Fed selling these securities and increasing the supply in the market, borrowers will have to offer higher interest rates to find buyers.

     Fed raises interest rates by half-point, the most since 2000
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Powell has said he wants to quickly raise the Fed’s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth.
Fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point, which the Fed says is about 2.4%, by year’s end.
"The Fed can’t fix supply-side challenges with higher interest rates,’’ said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
The Fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings, which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures, without triggering mass layoffs.
What’s more, other central banks around the world are also raising rates, a trend that could further imperil global growth.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the speed with which interest rates are expected to go up underscores its concern about the soaring cost of living.
Before the Great Recession of 2007-2009, Fed rates got as high as 5.25%.
Still, the impact to borrowing costs in coming months will depend chiefly on the – as yet undetermined – pace of the Fed’s rate hikes.
The good news, however, is that these savings rates will rise as the Fed moves interest rates higher.
Zero percent interest rates depress government bond rates, essentially forcing investors to bet on riskier assets like stocks.
