     Moon Knight Episode 6 Finale Review: Gods and Monsters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having had more of my focus drawn toward those aspects, Moon Knight delivered a solid finale full of unexpected sights in “Gods and Monsters”.
Did I expect to see the Moon Knight limo, complete with its personalized SPKTR number plate?
Moon Knight as a whole certainly had its issues.
Seeing Khonshu and Ammit go head-to-head was a joy, and I definitely cheered a little when Layla rejected Khonshu.
With Marc and Steven now imagining they are “free” of Khonshu, what does the future hold for Moon Knight?

     ‘Moon Knight’ Easter Eggs: 5 Things You May Have Missed in Episode 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re new to Moon Knight then you are no doubt asking yourself if Jake Lockley will have his own Moon Knight suit.
In the comics, Moon Knight just had the one look for almost 40 years.
So in the comics, the Mr. Knight look is not Steven Grant’s Moon Knight suit; it’s just… a Moon Knight suit.
There has been, however, one instance of Jake Lockley having his own Moon Knight suit.
Marc Spector is wearing the Mr. Knight suit, and Jake Lockley is wearing the Moon Knight suit.

     Moon Knight recap: series one, episode six – a satisfying, tantalising finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+.
Full MoonLike many commenters on last week’s recap, I really didn’t see episode five of Moon Knight coming.
On the other, the plot was meandering, Moon Knight barely featured and, after a solid start, it took a dip in episode three before sprinting to the finish with three excellent episodes.
Bill Sienkiewicz was a key artist on the Moon Knight comics from issue No 1.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 6 Opens the Door to Possibility in an Action-Packed Finale | Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We can call it now: Moon Knight is officially the best Disney+ show in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
This week’s episode opens with Layla (May Calamawy), who shines like she never has before in her desperation to stop Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke) after her husband’s been shot.
Image via Disney+However, in characteristic Marvel fashion, there is, of course, a post-credits stinger, but this one is more than merely a cute joke or a set-up for tying Moon Knight into the larger Marvel universe.
Rating: A+All episodes of Moon Knight are streaming now on Disney+.

Moon Knight is back, baby.
Now, if we do happen to see Moon Knight again in the MCU, we know that it’s Jake and an anti-hero.
There’s no denying that there is more story to tell with Moon Knight, but season one wrapped things up pretty nicely.
In real life, Bill Sienkiewicz is a comic-book artist who, would you believe it, was one of the first to pencil/draw Moon Knight.
