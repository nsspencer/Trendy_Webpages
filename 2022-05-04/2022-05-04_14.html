     The Fight Over Abortion History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mary Ziegler, the author of several books on the history of abortion (and a critic of the draft decision), said that part was correct.
This is the argument made in the historians’ brief, which outlines the history of abortion regulation up to 1866.
For decades after the founding of the United States, common law did not regulate abortion, or even recognize that abortion was happening at that early stage.
“That is because common law did not even acknowledge a fetus as existing separately from a pregnant woman” before quickening, the historians argue.
It was considered a life.”Justice Alito’s SourcesWhile the draft makes references to the historians’ brief, it relies more heavily on other sources, including “Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History,” a 2006 book by Joseph W. Dellapenna that challenged Justice Blackmun’s historical arguments in Roe.

In Florida, overturning Roe v. Wade means a 15-week abortion ban signed into law by the governor would no longer be considered unconstitutional.
That usually happens about five-and-a-half or six weeks into a pregnancy, which falls short of the roughly 24 weeks protected under Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce its final decision on Roe v. Wade this summer.

     Summary: For purple states like Pennsylvania, abortion laws may depend on who becomes governorIf the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion in purple states, like Pennsylvania, might largely depend on which party can keep or take control of state government.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is term limited.
And like some other purple states, the race for governor looks neck-and-neck between Democrats and Republicans.
DUNKLAU: In a recent statewide poll, 53% of Pennsylvania voters said abortion should remain legal in certain circumstances.
When there's abortion, there's no chance.

     Where DC, Maryland and Virginia abortion laws stand amid Roe v. Wade SCOTUS draft

     Summary: Local and state abortion laws have come back into focus after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.Local abortion laws have come back into focus after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.
Currently, 23 states have either laws limiting abortion that predate the original Roe v. Wade or “trigger” laws that would restrict or outright ban abortion if Roe was overturned, according to the abortion rights Guttmacher Institute.
Locally, D.C., Maryland and Virginia generally don’t restrict access to abortions, but each have some unique considerations.
As NBC Washington reported, if Republicans take control of Congress in the midterm elections this fall, it could put D.C.’s access to abortion on shakier ground.
He has not yet laid out any plans to change Virginia’s abortion laws.

     Md. expanded abortion access. But Hogan won’t pay to train providers.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Larry Hogan (R) has decided to withhold the $3.5 million that state lawmakers designated for training new providers, his spokesman said.
Ariana B. Kelly (D-Montgomery), the lead sponsor of Maryland’s abortion access law.
Private organizations can train providers to perform abortions, and advocates said most medical abortions do not require extensive training.
Since most abortion training takes place in clinical settings, if those states ban abortion, medical training to perform abortions could be severely curtailed, Kelly said.
He’s barred from spending that money on anything besides abortion training, but he can use his discretion on whether to spend it at all.

     Roe v. Wade FAQ: What if abortion rights law gets overturned?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happens if Roe v. Wade is overturned?
If Roe v. Wade were overturned, each state would determine its own laws regarding abortion.
More than 20 U.S. states have laws that could restrict access to abortion without Roe v. Wade.
According to the Guttmacher Institute , 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned.
Exactly how much abortion rates would fall after Roe v. Wade being overturned is hard to predict.
