Typical to Disney+’s release schedule, fans will have to wait weekly to stream each episode until the finale on June 22.
Directed by Deborah Chow, “Obi-Wan Kenobi” takes place a decade after the events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where the Jedi Master (McGregor) is betrayed by his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker.
