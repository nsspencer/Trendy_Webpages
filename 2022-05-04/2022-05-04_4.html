     The Ending Of Moon Knight Episode 6 Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Whoever else might be in there", Harrow notes of the brain Marc Spector and Steven Grant share.
By the time the episode is over, this umpteenth little tease about another personality's existence comes into play in a major way.
Despite Taweret's (voiced by Antonia Salib) warnings, Marc Spector turns his back to the peaceful Field of Reeds, and chooses to rescue Steven from Duat.
With that, Marc and Steven become whole, return to their body, and become Moon Knight (and Mr. Knight) again.
By the time the post-credits scene comes along, the Jake Lockley identity indeed makes his presence known.

     ‘Moon Knight’ Easter Eggs: 5 Things You May Have Missed in Episode 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re new to Moon Knight then you are no doubt asking yourself if Jake Lockley will have his own Moon Knight suit.
In the comics, Moon Knight just had the one look for almost 40 years.
So in the comics, the Mr. Knight look is not Steven Grant’s Moon Knight suit; it’s just… a Moon Knight suit.
There has been, however, one instance of Jake Lockley having his own Moon Knight suit.
Marc Spector is wearing the Mr. Knight suit, and Jake Lockley is wearing the Moon Knight suit.

     Moon Knight Episode 6 Finale Review: Gods and Monsters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having had more of my focus drawn toward those aspects, Moon Knight delivered a solid finale full of unexpected sights in “Gods and Monsters”.
Did I expect to see the Moon Knight limo, complete with its personalized SPKTR number plate?
Moon Knight as a whole certainly had its issues.
Seeing Khonshu and Ammit go head-to-head was a joy, and I definitely cheered a little when Layla rejected Khonshu.
With Marc and Steven now imagining they are “free” of Khonshu, what does the future hold for Moon Knight?

But when Khonshu tells Marc to kill them both, Layla reminds him that he has a choice.
Do it yourself,” Marc tells Khonshu.
Moon Knight finally gives us a mid-credits scene, and it’s a doozy: Arthur finds himself in a psychiatric hospital, muttering about sand.
