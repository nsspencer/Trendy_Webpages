     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.
