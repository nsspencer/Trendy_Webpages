It will be the fifth time Ancelotti has reached the Champions League final as a manager, the only man to have ever achieved that feat.
There is just something intangible -- almost mystical -- that hangs in the air on a Champions League night in this stadium.
It's Nacho's use of the word "magic" that feels most accurate on Champions League nights.
But just when fans were finally starting to believe that "magic" wasn't real, Real once again proved that it just might be.

West Ham are devastating at them.
Still, Emery wanted more, and he knows his side will have to adjust their approach for the second leg.
The same would be true of Thiago; if play is anymore broken in the second leg he will be able to play more passes that push the tempo.
