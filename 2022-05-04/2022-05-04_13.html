     Summary: Heard said Depp got on his knees and started crying and promised her he would never hurt her again.
Heard said March 2013 was a particularly rough time because Depp started drinking again after a bout with sobriety.
Heard said she didn't know what he was talking about, but soon he started patting her down and doing a "cavity search" on her.
When Heard and Depp made it to their hotel in Russia, Heard said Depp "whacked" her in the face, and she got a bloody nose.
"There was this sense that he didn't know what was going on," she continued.

     Summary: Amber Heard accuses Johnny Depp of physical abuse on her first day of testimonyEnlarge this image toggle caption Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty Images Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty ImagesAmber Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia courtroom on Wednesday to discuss her experiences and her relationship with Johnny Depp, her ex-husband, who is suing Heard in a $50 million defamation case.
Over more than two hours Heard described years of alleged abuse at the hands of Depp.
Depp has denied committing violence against Heard in his own lengthy testimony in the case at the Fairfax County Circuit Court.
In court, Heard described first meeting Depp when she was 22, saying there was a mutual electricity between them, despite both being in other long-term, committed relationships.
Earlier in the day, psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that Heard endured emotional abuse and intimate partner violence during her time with Depp.

     Amber Heard's Five Most Notable Moments From Testimony Against Johnny Depp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actress Amber Heard testified in her defense on Wednesday as part of a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp.
Wednesday she began her testimony on the witness stand, in which she recalled emotional and controversial moments during her relationship with Depp.
For a majority of Heard's testimony, Depp seemed to be distracted by something on the table, keeping his head down and his sunglasses on.
"I just stood there staring at the stupid light, I didn't know what to do," Heard testified.
Heard recalled that Lily-Rose began crying and she comforted her before Depp came in and asked his daughter to leave.

     Summary: “I went from slightly bigger role to slightly bigger role, and worked my butt off,” Heard testified.
A “jar of cocaine” sat nearby, the court heard, and Heard asked Depp about the “Wino Forever” tattoo on his arm.
Depp, Heard said, criticized her choice of clothes – about “pouring herself out” in a low-cut dress at a charity event.
Heard testified that Depp was deeply jealous and that his jealousy turned their relationship into “a never-ending fight”.
And Johnny on opiates is very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,” Heard testified.
