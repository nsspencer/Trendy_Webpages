“You're trying to ride this line of it being like, the mystery that may not mean a lot to people that don't know the Moon Knight canon super well.
And even though viewers only spend a few minutes with Jake, it’s clear that “this isn't Marc.
It's like if [you met him, you’d] be like, ‘wow, so you're Jake Lockley,’ in a way that you're kind of enamored and scared at the same time.
That was always the goal and the ambition.”All episodes of Marvel Studios' Moon Knight are now streaming exclusively on Disney+!
