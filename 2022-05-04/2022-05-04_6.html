     Summary: Spoiler alert: The following article contains spoilers for the Moon Knight Season 1 finale on Disney Plus.
It was Jake Lockley (Oscar Isaac) all along!
From the start of Moon Knight, it was obvious that there was another, far more violent identity of Marc Spector (Oscar Isaac) that Marc himself was not aware of.
This identity isn't afraid to kill when necessary.
Khonshu (F. Murray Abraham/Karim El Hakim) utilized Jake to his advantage, whenever Marc/Steven refused to enact his vengeance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel’s latest Disney Plus series, Moon Knight, took its bows with its final episode in classic Marvel fashion: A shocking revelation delivered via credits scene.
Also in classic Marvel fashion, Moon Knight’s credits scene opens many more questions than it answers, and its final episode is long on hints and short on concrete resolution.
Here’s everything we were left wondering at the end of Moon Knight’s finale, and how Marvel Comics might have the answers.
note: This post contains spoilers for all of Moon Knight, in case you hadn’t figured that out.]
A nattily-suited Khonshu is a staple of Moon Knight comics, and he looks just as good in live action as on the page.

     Summary: And while Khonshu may have freed Marc and Steven, Jake is still very much in his service.
So...what exactly was happening in that Moon Knight credits scene?
We don't know whether Moon Knight will next continue in another season, or as a supporting character in someone's movie (maybe Blade?
Moon Knight By Lemire &amp; Smallwood: The Complete Collection amazon.com $47.35 SHOP NOWPrior to the big credits scene reveal, the Jake persona had already been teased a few times in the Moon Knight TV show.
And, as that credits scene shows, the fact that this third persona—being sold as the most vicious and violent—is still in league with Khonshu means that Marc/Steven/Jake is still Moon Knight.

     Summary: SPOILER WARNING: This story discusses major plot points in Season 1, Episode 6 of “Moon Knight,” currently streaming on Disney+.
And in the final scene of the (possibly) final episode of “Moon Knight,” audiences finally got to meet him: Jake Lockley.
Marvel recently referred to the episode as the “season finale” of “Moon Knight,” not the series finale.
If you ask me, I would tell you that “Moon Knight” is here to stay.
“Moon Knight” is becoming a national pride in Egypt.
