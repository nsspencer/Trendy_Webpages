     Nina Turner hints at bigger things to come after Ohio primary loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Nina Turner run for president in 2024?
Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner on Tuesday lost her primary election to represent Ohio's 11th congressional district.
The Associated Press called the race with 66.3% of votes for incumbent Representative Shontel Brown and 33.7% for Turner.
But just as happened in the special election, millions were funneled into stopping her.
Powerful corporate Democrats also coalesced around Turner's opponent ahead of the primary, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which officially endorsed Brown.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Progressive Democrat Nina Turner teased a 2024 presidential bid during a concession speech on Tuesday after she was defeated in her bid to challenge Democratic Representative Shontel Brown.
"Sister Turner ain't going nowhere," Turner said and the crowed applauded and cheered.

     Progressive Leader Nina Turner Loses Ohio Election to Establishment Incumbent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Shontel Brown, an establishment incumbent whose campaign was boosted by torrents of super PAC spending, handily defeated progressive champion Nina Turner on Tuesday in the Democratic primary for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District.
Outside organizations spent heavily on Brown’s behalf in the U.S. House race, a rematch of a heated special election that drew national attention less than a year ago.
Tuesday’s contest wasn’t nearly as close as last year’s: Brown prevailed this time around with just over 66% of the vote.
“AIPAC and their billionaire friends are spending some $10 million to defeat Nina Turner, Summer Lee, Nida Allam, and Jessica Cisneros.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 3, 2022While Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Turner in both the special election and Tuesday’s rematch, other high-profile progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups stayed on the sidelines in the latter contest.

     Nina Turner hints at presidential run in congressional concession speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turner said voters in the new parts of the district deserved an opportunity to weigh in on who their congressional representative should be.
Although the district’s geography has changed, it remains the state’s most demographically Democratic district.
Of the $6.4 million she collected, $6.1 million came from individuals, statistics from PoliticalMoneyLine indicate.
The organization’s statistics indicate that 12% of the money Turner collected came from people in Ohio.
Of the nearly $4 million that Brown collected in the election cycle, $738,050 came from political action committees.

     Progressive Champion Nina Turner Loses Ohio Primary Race After Dem Party “Set Out to Destroy” Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In another closely watched race in Ohio, Democratic Congressmember Shontel Brown defeated progressive challenger Nina Turner, the former co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign.
NINA TURNER: Let me say this extemporaneously: Sister Turner ain’t going nowhere.
AMY GOODMAN: So, this comes as The Intercept reports Nina Turner had faced opposition from several political action committees, including the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC and the Protect Our Future PAC.
Nina Turner also did not receive support from several progressive groups that had backed her previous run.
ANDREW PEREZ: You know, it sounds like a big issue really was that progressive groups weren’t really involved, and groups like DMFI really, really spent big in the last few weeks.
