The judge, a Trump appointee, also ruled that the voters could not appeal the ruling in place of state officials.
He noted that under the Fourteenth Amendment, two-thirds of Congress can grant amnesty to an insurrectionist.
“I don’t think a federal judge or anyone can determine eligibility for Congress” except Congress itself, he said.

     Madison Cawthorn May Have a New Ethics Violation to Handle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House ethics rules stipulate that senior congressional staff can only earn $29,595 in outside income each year.
According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, Cawthorn’s campaign paid Harp a combined $73,237 in direct payments and payments to his LLC, EMP Strategies.
But the ethics rules don’t calculate senior pay at an annual rate; the pay rate is calculated per every 90-day period.
And that small daily increase carried thousands of dollars in ramifications, because it meant he was subject to the outside income limitations.
Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of the good government group Documented, agreed, saying it seemed Cawthorn and Harp tried to “game ethics rules” to max out his income.
