     For Star Wars Day, Disney+ releases a new ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ trailer – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star War nerds will be happy to know that Disney+ just released its brand-new trailer for “Obi-Wan Kenobi” to kick off Star Wars Day (aka May the Fourth).
The six-episode, highly anticipated, limited series will premiere exclusively on the service on Friday, May 27.
Typical to Disney+’s release schedule, fans will have to wait weekly to stream each episode until the finale on June 22.
Directed by Deborah Chow, “Obi-Wan Kenobi” takes place a decade after the events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where the Jedi Master (McGregor) is betrayed by his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker.
McGregor will reprise his role along with Hayden Christensen, who played Darth Vader in the prequel films.

     Obi-Wan Kenobi’s latest trailer shows him trying (and failing) to train Luke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A second trailer for the Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series has been released to celebrate Star Wars Day, May the 4th.
In it, we see Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan trying to convince a reluctant Owen Lars (Joel Edgerton) to let him train a young Luke Skywalker.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to premiere on the streaming service on Friday, May 27th and will run for six episodes.
At this point in the Star Wars story, the Empire is now in control of the galaxy and all remaining Jedi are now being hunted down and killed by Vader’s Inquisitors.
Obi-Wan Kenobi features Hayden Christensen set to reprise his role as Darth Vader from the prequels.

     A new 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' trailer teases appearances from Darth Vader and young Luke Skywalker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is back -- but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
-- May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
Years after Emperor Palpatine rose to power and "Order 66'd" most Jedi, Obi-Wan still can't catch a break: He's evading evil Inquisitors intent on hunting him down as one of the galaxy's last living Jedi and keeping careful tabs on a young Luke Skywalker, living simply on his Uncle Owen's moisture farm on Tatooine.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the "Star Wars" timeline , only recently became a Sith.
It's likely -- Hayden Christensen is reprising his role as a badly burnt Anakin/Vader in the series.

     Summary: The official trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi has arrived in celebration of May the 4th, and it’s filled with new imagery and details from the upcoming limited series.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, starting May 27 on Disney+, follows Ewan McGregor’s legendary Jedi Master 10 years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.
As seen in the new trailer, the hunt is on for the Jedi — and Obi-Wan in particular.

     Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer Breakdown: Darth Vader, 4-LOM, Purge Troopers, and Easter Eggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If we were placing bets, we’d say Vader shows up around the end of episode 3.
One of the scum trying to take out Obi-Wan is 4-LOM, the bug-eyed bounty hunter with the protocol droid body.
You’ll spot 4-LOM second on the right in the famous bounty hunter lineup scene (above) in Empire.
This time we see Obi-Wan shooting back at a figure that we can’t quite make out.
You might just assume this is 4-LOM, except that this mystery second attacker is shooting yellow laser bolts at Obi-Wan, while in the previous shot 4-LOM shoots red lasers.
