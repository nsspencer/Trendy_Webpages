     For Star Wars Day, Disney+ releases a new ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ trailer – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star War nerds will be happy to know that Disney+ just released its brand-new trailer for “Obi-Wan Kenobi” to kick off Star Wars Day (aka May the Fourth).
The six-episode, highly anticipated, limited series will premiere exclusively on the service on Friday, May 27.
Typical to Disney+’s release schedule, fans will have to wait weekly to stream each episode until the finale on June 22.
Directed by Deborah Chow, “Obi-Wan Kenobi” takes place a decade after the events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where the Jedi Master (McGregor) is betrayed by his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker.
McGregor will reprise his role along with Hayden Christensen, who played Darth Vader in the prequel films.

     A new 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' trailer teases appearances from Darth Vader and young Luke Skywalker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is back -- but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
-- May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
Years after Emperor Palpatine rose to power and "Order 66'd" most Jedi, Obi-Wan still can't catch a break: He's evading evil Inquisitors intent on hunting him down as one of the galaxy's last living Jedi and keeping careful tabs on a young Luke Skywalker, living simply on his Uncle Owen's moisture farm on Tatooine.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the "Star Wars" timeline , only recently became a Sith.
It's likely -- Hayden Christensen is reprising his role as a badly burnt Anakin/Vader in the series.
