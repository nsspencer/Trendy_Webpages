     Bruins' Hampus Lindholm leaves game vs. Hurricanes after hit by Andrei Svechnikov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Bruins defenseman Hampus Lindholm exited Wednesday's 5-2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes after a hit by Andrei Svechnikov near the end of the second period and did not return, the Bruins announced.
Svechnikov's shoulder collided with Lindholm's chest at full speed, knocking over Lindholm.
He was helped off the ice and Svechnikov was not assessed a penalty for the hit.
Lindholm, 28, was acquired by the Bruins at the trade deadline from the Anaheim Ducks.
With a 5-1 Game 1 victory on Monday and Wednesday's win, the Hurricanes have a 2-0 lead in the first-round series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins need a massive improvement from David Pastrnak or their season could end as soon as Sunday afternoon at TD Garden.
In fact, the first period of Game 2 probably was the worst 20 minutes of Pastrnak's Bruins career.
It started when he collided with Hurricanes goalie Antti Raanta and wiped out a Bruins power play.
After an initial major call, David Pastrnak receives a 2-minute penalty for goaltender interference on Antti Raanta.
The Bruins reunited Pastrnak, Marchand and Patrice Bergeron on the top line in the third period Wednesday night.

     Rod Brind’Amour thinks the Bruins are targeting Carolina’s goalies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Needless to say, all parties involved in Game 2 of the Bruins-Hurricanes series were still pretty fired up post-game.
The Bruins were fired up after seeing one of their guys KO’d and putting forward another pretty poor performance.
And then there’s Rod Brind’Amour, who may not have been fired up, but was nevertheless convinced that the Bruins are focusing their efforts on running his goalies.
Speaking after the game, Brind’Amour was asked (around the 0:58 mark) on Bally Sports if he thought the Bruins were “deliberately trying to target [his] goalies,” and this was his response:“Well, what do you think?
Given the state of the series, the Bruins have about 150 other more pressing concerns than trying to take out Carolina’s goalies.

     Summary: Bruins 3 takeaways as the Bruins suffer another decisive loss to Hurricanes, going down 2-0 The Bruins weren't only outplayed, they were also undisciplined in Wednesday's 5-2 loss.
The Bruins came out with a pep in their step in Game 2 against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Yet, the undisciplined Bruins didn’t test Kochetkov until they entered desperation mode.
The Hurricanes pounced on turnovers and tips, with Jesper Fast and Sebastian Aho scoring 2:27 apart for a 2-0 lead.
I don’t know if [player safety] will [review it], so we’ll have to see on that.”Advertisement:Svechnikov’s hit didn’t appear intentional.

     Summary: Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour says "it couldn't get any more obvious" after being asked if the Bruins targeted Hurricane goaltenders.
RALEIGH, N.C. -- — The Carolina Hurricanes didn't flinch after losing yet another goaltender.
Sebastian Aho and Nino Niederreiter each scored twice and the Hurricanes overcame the early loss of goalie Antti Raanta to beat the Bruins 5-2 on Wednesday night.
Perhaps just as importantly, the Hurricanes looked ready for a fight at every moment as the Bruins racking up penalties and time in the box while facing yet another uphill climb.
Asked afterward whether he thought the Bruins were intentionally targeting his goaltenders, he said: "Well, what do you think?

     Bruins Drop Game 2 to Carolina, Fall into 2-0 Series Hole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "One game at a time," Bergeron said when asked how the Bruins can get the series back on track.
After the game, Cassidy said that the blue liner was "not doing well" but did not know if he had been transported to a hospital.
"It looked high to me, that's why he left the game because he has an upper-body injury," Cassidy said of the hit.
The Bruins surrendered two power-play goals to the Hurricanes, sandwiched around Bergeron's marker, which left them in a 4-1 hole after two periods.
Carolina capitalized on its second two-man advantage when Nino Niederreiter made it 4-1 with 1:08 remaining in the second period.
