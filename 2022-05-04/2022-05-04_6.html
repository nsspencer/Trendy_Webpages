     The Moon Knight Season Finale Asked More Questions Than It Answered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, for the week of May 1, Chef Feige is serving up the season finale of Moon Knight, paired with the premiere of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
For now, it's time to break down the Moon Knight finale.
Though Moon Knight found itself lost in the metaphorical and literal desert more often than not, it was nice to see Grant and Spector, as Mr. Knight and Moon Knight, respectively, finally fight alongside each other without bickering.
If we're being honest, the permanence of Harrow's death probably depends on whether or not Ethan Hawke wants to return to the MCU after Moon Knight.
May Calamawy's surprise transformation from Layla Abdallah El-Faouly into Scarlet Scarab—an Egyptian superhero from the comics—may very well be the Moon Knight moment that'll keep us wanting more.

     Summary: Marvel’s latest Disney Plus series, Moon Knight, took its bows with its final episode in classic Marvel fashion: A shocking revelation delivered via credits scene.
Also in classic Marvel fashion, Moon Knight’s credits scene opens many more questions than it answers, and its final episode is long on hints and short on concrete resolution.
Here’s everything we were left wondering at the end of Moon Knight’s finale, and how Marvel Comics might have the answers.
note: This post contains spoilers for all of Moon Knight, in case you hadn’t figured that out.]

“You're trying to ride this line of it being like, the mystery that may not mean a lot to people that don't know the Moon Knight canon super well.
And even though viewers only spend a few minutes with Jake, it’s clear that “this isn't Marc.
It's like if [you met him, you’d] be like, ‘wow, so you're Jake Lockley,’ in a way that you're kind of enamored and scared at the same time.
That was always the goal and the ambition.”All episodes of Marvel Studios' Moon Knight are now streaming exclusively on Disney+!
