     Kurt Warner Seems to Respond to Ryan Tannehill’s Comment on Mentorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hall of Famer Kurt Warner didn’t seem to take to Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill’s comments about mentorship on Tuesday after the team selected rookie Malik Willis in the third round of the 2022 NFL draft.
“We’re competing against each other, we’re watching the same tape, we’re doing the same drills,” Tannehill explained on Tuesday.
Despite being unaware of the franchise’s intentions, the veteran quarterback shared that he called the team’s new rookie immediately after the selection was announced.
Despite Tannehill’s steady play, the Titans have signaled that they are preparing for the future at the quarterback position by picking Willis.

Over the course of about 17 minutes, Tannehill was exceptionally forthright with Titans reporters, who grilled him on a number of tricky topics.
What jumped out to me were lines like “I was in a dark place” after throwing three interceptions in the Titans' playoff loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.

     Summary: Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill didn’t exactly impress many people with his comments on Tuesday regarding Malik Willis.
When asked about potentially mentoring the team’s new third-round pick, the 33-year-old veteran wasn’t really jumping at the prospect.
Where’s the national media on their Cam Newton hot takes now??

In this particular instance, it may be good to take notes from Cam—someone who, by the way, literally mentored Willis in the past.

Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.

The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.

     NFL insider notebook: Ryan Tannehill taking undue flak over Malik Willis comments, plus Panthers shakeup, more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Tannehill wants to play quarterback of the Tennessee Titans and not be the private coach to rookie Malik Willis?
Tannehill is a capable, 33-year-old starter in the league who's quarterbacked this Titans franchise to three consecutive postseasons.
And then we arrive to the Titans drafting Willis without giving Tannehill a heads up (which they didn't have to do anyway.)
Willis, whom the Titans took with the 86th overall pick last week, has an incredible support system around him.
There was nothing in what he said that indicates he's going to shun Willis or not answer any of his questions.
