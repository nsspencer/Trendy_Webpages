     Why Star Wars Day is the most successful fake holiday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today is Star Wars Day, also known as ‚ÄúMay the fourth be with you‚Äù day, an annual celebration of all things Star Wars that plays on the space opera‚Äôs famous Jedi phrase, ‚ÄúMay the force be with you,‚Äù as well as the first film‚Äôs release date of May 25, 1977.
‚ÄúLucasfilm cannot take credit for Star Wars Day.
The short film reveals the sound design process at Lucasfilm‚Äôs Skywalker Ranch, where many of the iconic Star Wars sounds (lightsabers, Wookie roars, etc.)
But unlike Valentine‚Äôs Day, Christmas, or even the somewhat obscure Pi Day, what distinguishes Star Wars Day is that a company owns it.
In that way, Star Wars Day is potentially the most lucrative holiday of all, because the real revenue earned is all going to one place‚ÄîDisney.
