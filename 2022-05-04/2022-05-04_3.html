     Nina Turner hints at bigger things to come after Ohio primary loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Nina Turner run for president in 2024?
Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner on Tuesday lost her primary election to represent Ohio's 11th congressional district.
The Associated Press called the race with 66.3% of votes for incumbent Representative Shontel Brown and 33.7% for Turner.
But just as happened in the special election, millions were funneled into stopping her.
Powerful corporate Democrats also coalesced around Turner's opponent ahead of the primary, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which officially endorsed Brown.
