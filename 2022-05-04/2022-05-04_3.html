     Summary: In case you have been hiding under a rock for the last few hours, Ryan Tannehill said yesterday that it isn’t his job to mentor Malik Willis.
He also went on to say it’s good if Willis learns from him along the way, but the whole quote doesn’t generate clicks.
I said it on Twitter last night, and I will say it again - Tannehill is 100% right here.
It is not his job to mentor Willis.
Like he said yesterday, hopefully Malik will learn some things about being an NFL quarterback from Tannehill.

Former St. Louis Rams star Kurt Warner said he will never understand that mentality and offered to help any young quarterback that needs it.
— Kurt Warner (@kurt13warner) May 3, 2022Warner had to fight for a roster spot with the Rams before he became a star and led them to a Super Bowl win.
Warner later specified that he thinks Tannehill is a great teammate and “great dude.” He just does not agree with the mentality.

     Ryan Tannehill sought therapy after Titans playoff loss: ‘I was in a dark place’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a tough offseason for Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill – and it goes beyond the team drafting Malik Willis.
Tannehill, who has been the Titans’ quarterback since 2019 and has led Tennessee to three straight playoff appearances, met the media on Tuesday after the team drafted Willis in third round of the 2022 NFL Draft.
I was in a dark place, and it took me a while, a lot of work to get out of it.
It’s hard to argue that anyone had a rougher draft than Tannehill, who watched as the team traded away No.
The 33-year-old appeared testy in the press conference when asked about Willis and the potential relationship the two quarterbacks would have.

     Summary: Ryan Tannehill threw three interceptions in the contest, which is a big reason why Cincinnati won their first road playoff game in franchise history.

A lot sleepless nights, a lot of reflecting, rewatching the game over and over in my head.
It was weeks and weeks and weeks to get through it.

     Summary: AdvertisementTwo years ago, Tannehill roped the Titans into a four-year extension worth $118 million, including $62 million in fully guaranteed money and $91 million in total guarantees.
Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.
Buy for $478 at AmazonIf it takes a village to raise a quarterback, 33-year-old Ryan Tannehill wants no part of that endeavor.
The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

Brown, who was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Titans also drafted someone the team hopes will be his future replacement, Liberty signal-caller, Malik Willis.
As far as Brown no longer being in Nashville is concerned, Tannehill said the loss of the Ole Miss product “hurts” both professionally and personally.
He also stated he believed Brown and the Titans would get something done.
Happy to see him get what he wanted, but at the end of the day, it hurts.”Tannehill said he honestly thought #Titans and AJ Brown would get a deal done.

     Ryan Tannehill: Not ‘my job’ to mentor rookie Titans QB Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadComing off a disastrous performance in the playoffs and having just seen his team draft an intriguing quarterback, the Tennessee Titans’ Ryan Tannehill said Tuesday that he didn’t feel obligated to show rookie Malik Willis the ropes.
“I think, as a starter, my job is hard enough to win ballgames and be a leader,” Favre added.
“I don’t look at that as my job,” Flacco said to reporters of possibly serving as a mentor to Lock.
Among the quarterbacks he leapfrogged for that job was Matt Moore, who had been the team’s primary starter the previous season.
“We’re competing against each other.”The Tennessee Titans need Ryan Tannehill to do what Alex Smith did for Patrick Mahomes.
