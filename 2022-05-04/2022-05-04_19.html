     Summary: Getty ImagesTitans quarterback Ryan Tannehill made waves on Tuesday by saying it’s not his job to mentor rookie quarterback Malik Willis.
And it’s not Tannehill’s job to mentor Malik Willis.
. . so for all you young QBs that need a mentor, DM me &amp; Ill be that guy, happy to help in any way I can!”What if Tannehill isn’t ready to concede that Willis is the next guy?
What if Tannehill, who is still only 33, intends to stick around for more than the four years of the rookie contract Willis will sign?
Regardless, no NFL starter who intends to keep that job indefinitely should be expected or inclined to help his understudy become good enough to take over.

     NFL Players Debate Ryan Tannehill’s Viral Comment About Mentoring Malik Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill caused some furrowed brows across the NFL on Tuesday when he said it wasn’t his job to mentor Tennessee’s rookie quarterback Malik Willis.
On Wednesday, players and veterans throughout the league weighed in on the matter.
“We’re competing against each other, we’re watching the same tape, we’re doing the same drills,” Tannehill said Tuesday.
Despite being unaware of the franchise’s intentions, the veteran quarterback shared that he called the team’s new rookie immediately after the selection was announced.

     Summary: AdvertisementTwo years ago, Tannehill roped the Titans into a four-year extension worth $118 million, including $62 million in fully guaranteed money and $91 million in total guarantees.
Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.

The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.

     Summary: Former Texas A&amp;M quarterback Ryan Tannehill led the Tennessee Titans to the No.
But after the team drafted highly-touted Liberty QB prospect Malik Willis at 86th overall in the NFL Draft Friday, questions were raised about Tennessee’s faith in Tannehill.

     Summary: Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill didn’t exactly impress many people with his comments on Tuesday regarding Malik Willis.
When asked about potentially mentoring the team’s new third-round pick, the 33-year-old veteran wasn’t really jumping at the prospect.
Where’s the national media on their Cam Newton hot takes now??

In this particular instance, it may be good to take notes from Cam—someone who, by the way, literally mentored Willis in the past.
