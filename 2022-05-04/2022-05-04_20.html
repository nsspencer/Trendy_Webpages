     Nina Turner's Concession Speech Teases Presidential Bid After Ohio Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Progressive Democrat Nina Turner teased a 2024 presidential bid during a concession speech on Tuesday after she was defeated in her bid to challenge Democratic Representative Shontel Brown.
"Sister Turner ain't going nowhere," Turner said and the crowed applauded and cheered.
"And I think the great state of California got something to say about what Sister Turner should do," she said.
"The great state of Iowa got something to say about what Sister Turner should do.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York's 14th district endorsed Turner on the eve of the primary, while President Joe Biden endorsed Brown on Friday.

     Shontel Brown Wins Rematch With Nina Turner Over Cleveland Congressional Seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time in as many years, voters in Ohio’s working-class, mostly Black 11th Congressional district chose Shontel Brown over Nina Turner to represent them in Congress.
The difference this time is that Brown went into Tuesday night’s primary as the incumbent and emerges likely to hold onto her seat from the overwhelmingly Democratic district after November’s general election.
Brown, who chaired the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, ran a more centrist campaign and enjoyed the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and others inside the party.
Brown won the first contest by about 4,000 votes.
This time around, Brown won by an overwhelming margin; the Associated Press called the race for Brown by 27 percentage points on Tuesday evening.

     Nina Turner hints at presidential run in congressional concession speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turner said voters in the new parts of the district deserved an opportunity to weigh in on who their congressional representative should be.
Although the district’s geography has changed, it remains the state’s most demographically Democratic district.
Of the $6.4 million she collected, $6.1 million came from individuals, statistics from PoliticalMoneyLine indicate.
The organization’s statistics indicate that 12% of the money Turner collected came from people in Ohio.
Of the nearly $4 million that Brown collected in the election cycle, $738,050 came from political action committees.

     Progressive Leader Nina Turner Loses Ohio Election to Establishment Incumbent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Shontel Brown, an establishment incumbent whose campaign was boosted by torrents of super PAC spending, handily defeated progressive champion Nina Turner on Tuesday in the Democratic primary for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District.
Outside organizations spent heavily on Brown’s behalf in the U.S. House race, a rematch of a heated special election that drew national attention less than a year ago.
Tuesday’s contest wasn’t nearly as close as last year’s: Brown prevailed this time around with just over 66% of the vote.
“AIPAC and their billionaire friends are spending some $10 million to defeat Nina Turner, Summer Lee, Nida Allam, and Jessica Cisneros.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 3, 2022While Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Turner in both the special election and Tuesday’s rematch, other high-profile progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups stayed on the sidelines in the latter contest.

     Nina Turner Was Defeated Last Night. But Not All Is Lost.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Left was served a hard reminder of this last night when Nina Turner lost again to Representative Shontel Brown in Ohio’s 11th congressional district.
Instead, turnout dipped by about three thousand votes on the rainy day, and Turner fared poorly in Cleveland.
Brown slightly out-fundraised Turner this year, and her candidacy was once more backed by significant amounts of money from oligarchs and outside pro-Israel groups, who again ran ads attacking Turner.
But with Biden now in the doldrums even among his own voters, Turner ended up faring worse.
Meanwhile, Turner ran this race without the full-throated backing of leading progressives that she got last time.

     Progressive Champion Nina Turner Loses Ohio Primary Race After Dem Party “Set Out to Destroy” Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In another closely watched race in Ohio, Democratic Congressmember Shontel Brown defeated progressive challenger Nina Turner, the former co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign.
NINA TURNER: Let me say this extemporaneously: Sister Turner ain’t going nowhere.
AMY GOODMAN: So, this comes as The Intercept reports Nina Turner had faced opposition from several political action committees, including the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC and the Protect Our Future PAC.
Nina Turner also did not receive support from several progressive groups that had backed her previous run.
ANDREW PEREZ: You know, it sounds like a big issue really was that progressive groups weren’t really involved, and groups like DMFI really, really spent big in the last few weeks.
