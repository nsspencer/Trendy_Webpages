“And it put us really behind the eight ball, it got very aggressive there.

     Madison Bumgarner Restrained From Umpire After Being Ejected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diamondbacks starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner was ejected in Wednesday’s game vs. the Marlins after he was checked by the first base umpire for foreign substances.
The incident occurred in the first inning as first-base umpire Dan Bellino paused the game to check Bumgarner’s hand.
Bumgarner didn’t take kindly to Bellino’s decision, and he had to be physically held back by his Arizona teammates and coaches.
Corbin Martin came in to replace the starting pitcher at the beginning of the second inning.
Bumgarner allowed one home run during the first inning to Marlins infielder Jon Berti.

     Video Reveals What Madison Bumgarner Appeared to Tell Umpire Before Ejection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s only May, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a stranger ejection this MLB season than Madison Bumgarner’s on Tuesday night.
In one of the oddest and most viral moments of the young season, the Diamondbacks pitcher was tossed in the first inning by first base umpire Dan Bellino after getting checked for foreign substances.
During the check, Bellino rubbed Bumgarner’s hand for what felt like an irregularly long time, keeping his eyes fixed on Bumgarner’s face for most of it.
When he finished, Bumgarner said something to Bellino, immediately prompting an ejection.
There’s been no word yet of further disciplinary action levied against Bumgarner, or any public comments on the incident.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner was ejected Wednesday right after his hand was checked for a foreign substance.
As he was walking to the dugout, the veteran left-hander gestured with his arm before holding his hand out for first base umpire Dan Bellino to take a look.
Diamondbacks executive and former major league right-hander Dan Haren was quick to the pitcher’s defense, saying the umpire instigated Bumgarner.
“Was completely instigated by Dan Bellino, was staring at Bum until he looked at Bellino in the eyes,” Haren tweeted.
Complete BS.”Bumgarner was replaced by right-hander Corbin Martin at the start of the second inning.

     Summary: Diamondbacks starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner gave up a home run to lead off the bottom of the first inning against the Marlins in Miami on Wednesday in matinee action.
He then recorded three outs, but wouldn't make it into the dugout before being ejected from the game.
Bumgarner appeared to be a bit less-than-enthused over at least one call from home plate umpire Ryan Wills.
The ensuing now-standard "sticky stuff" check of his hands resulted in a quick exchange of words before Bumgarner got the heave-ho from first base umpire Dan Bellino.
To the action footage:The Diamondbacks would respond with an 8-7 win, on the strength of a five-run third inning, to sweep the Marlins.

     Summary: Emotions spilled over Wednesday afternoon after what began as a routine check for foreign substances turned into something much more bizarre.
The result was Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner being tossed from the game, and questions lingering on what actually happened.
First base umpire Dan Bellino examined Bumgarner’s pitching hand, but took exceedingly long to complete the check.
Is this a hypnosis or a hand check?

After a foreign substance check in which Bellino stared at Bumgarner during a longer-than-typical examination of his left hand, Bumgarner and Bellino exchanged words.
Bellino told a pool reporter that Bumgarner was ejected for directing profanity at an umpire.
It was just a hand check,'' Bellino said.

His two-run home run with one out in the top of the ninth gave Arizona an 8-7 lead.
The Marlins took a 7-6 lead to the ninth inning, scoring four runs combined in the seventh and eighth innings.
I think everybody is that watched that game and played in that game," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.
Arizona scored 18 runs in the three games in Miami, and although all were close games, the Diamondbacks totaled 27 hits.

Facing the Marlins’ Garrett Cooper in the first inning, Bumgarner threw what he thought would be called strike three and began walking toward the dugout, but the pitch was instead called a ball.
Bumgarner, clearly annoyed, appeared to exchange words with Bellino.
Bumgarner was so enraged that he had to be physically restrained as he tried to walk towards Bellino.
“Was completely instigated by Dan Bellino, was staring at Bum until he looked at Bellino in the eyes,” Haren tweeted.

     Summary: Diamondbacks left-hander Madison Bumgarner was ejected after the first inning at Miami on Wednesday, after a heated argument with first base umpire Dan Bellino.
The interaction, in which Bumgarner needed to be held back by several players and coaches, was sparked during the between-innings check of his hands for a foreign substance.
Bumgarner, 32, gave up a leadoff home run to the Marlins' Jon Berti and had thrown just 13 pitches before his ejection.
He has a 1.17 ERA with 15 strikeouts in five starts.
