     Kurt Warner Seems to Respond to Ryan Tannehill’s Comment on Mentorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hall of Famer Kurt Warner didn’t seem to take to Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill’s comments about mentorship on Tuesday after the team selected rookie Malik Willis in the third round of the 2022 NFL draft.
“We’re competing against each other, we’re watching the same tape, we’re doing the same drills,” Tannehill explained on Tuesday.
Despite being unaware of the franchise’s intentions, the veteran quarterback shared that he called the team’s new rookie immediately after the selection was announced.
Despite Tannehill’s steady play, the Titans have signaled that they are preparing for the future at the quarterback position by picking Willis.

     Summary: AdvertisementTwo years ago, Tannehill roped the Titans into a four-year extension worth $118 million, including $62 million in fully guaranteed money and $91 million in total guarantees.
Tannehill was fresh off leading the Titans to the AFC Championship Game after tossing 22 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.

The longer it takes for Willis to bloom, the longer Tannehill remains the AFC’s Jimmy Garoppolo.
Per Spotrac, a pre-June 1 trade of Tannehill would leave the Titans with $28.4 million in dead cap.
