     Why Lyft Stock Crashed Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happenedShares of Lyft (LYFT -29.91%) plummeted 30% on Wednesday after the ride-sharing company warned investors that paying up to retain drivers would weigh heavily on its profits.
However, Lyft's revenue was down 10% from 2021's Q4.
Sharply higher fuel costs dented drivers' net earnings and made it harder for Lyft to retain them.
Consequently, management guided for adjusted EBITDA of $10 million to $20 million in Q2.
That was substantially below Wall Street's expectations, which had called for adjusted EBITDA of $83 million.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadSilicon Valley’s ride-hailing giants saw their shares tumble Wednesday despite strong revenue growth, as Lyft’s ridership trajectory weighed on investors.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Lyft posted first-quarter revenue of $875.6 million, a 44 percent increase over the same period last year.
There are also concerns about the company’s spending as it uses subsidies to attract more drivers onto its platform, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
Uber shares also fell, erasing 4.6 percent to end the session at $28.12, even though the company said it has already made the necessary investments to attract more drivers.
We have to keep increasing the number of new drivers on the platform,” he said.
