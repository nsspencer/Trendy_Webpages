     Summary: (CNN) The Satanic Temple in Massachusetts is requesting that Boston fly its flag, after the Supreme Court ruled this week that the city had violated the First Amendment rights of a Christian group when it denied them flying their flag outside of City Hall.
According to a copy of the request tweeted by The Satanic Temple, the group is asking Boston to fly the flag for "Satanic Appreciation Week" on July 23-29.
The Satanic Temple said its request was in response to the recent ruling.
CNN reached out to The Satanic Temple for comment but did not immediately hear back.
Boston, according to the city's website, no longer accepts flag raising applications as of October 19, 2021.

     Satanic Temple asks Boston to fly flag after Supreme Court ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON (AP) — The Satanic Temple is requesting to fly a flag over Boston City Hall after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this week that the city violated the free speech rights of a conservative activist seeking to fly a Christian flag outside the downtown building.
The Salem-based group tweeted a request filed Tuesday with the city property management department to raise a flag marking “Satanic Appreciation Week” from July 23-29.
The Satanic Temple is separate from the Church of Satan, which was founded in the 1960s.
Founded in 2013, the Satanic Temple doesn’t believe in Satan and describes itself as a “non-theistic religious organization” that advocates for secularism.
It has lodged freedom of religion challenges nationwide, including a federal lawsuit arguing the Boston City Council’s traditional opening prayer at its public meetings is discriminatory and unconstitutional.

     Following Supreme Court ruling, Salem’s Satanic Temple wants to fly its flag at Boston City Hall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The news of The Satanic Temple’s application to fly a flag at City Hall was first reported by MassLive.
The flag the Temple wants to fly features black-and-white stripes and a goat’s head and pentagram symbol, according to Greaves.
The city’s flag-raising program at City Hall was suspended last October.
In other words, it doesn’t sound like the Temple’s flag will be flying outside City Hall in the near future.
In 2019, The Satanic Temple in Salem announced that it had been officially recognized as a church by the Internal Revenue Service.
