     As mortgage rates rise, here’s how to decide whether you should buy a home or rent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Take these steps before making a decision whether to own a home or rent.
You should also have enough monthly income to afford the mortgage payment, taxes and insurance, as well as extra monthly expenses like utilities.
If you can't afford the monthly payments, continue to rent and keep saving money if homeownership is your ultimate goal, Holbert said.
If high rent prohibits you from saving, consider downsizing or making other big lifestyle changes so you can start putting more money aside.
"While it's really good to save, where you're really going to find that big cash for that down payment is going to be in those big spending categories, like housing or your car."

     Buying a home? Here's how much rising mortgage rates will add to the cost.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House-hunters across the U.S. are confronting a painful reality: Rising mortgage rates are adding thousands of dollars to the cost of buying a home.
In Ohio, for example, the average mortgage rate has shot up to 5.33%, up from 3.94% in January.
Although home loan costs don't usually rise directly in line with the Fed's benchmark rate, long-term mortgage rates generally track yields on the 10-year Treasury.
Economists don't expect mortgage rates to drop anytime soon.
Analysts at PNC Financial Services Group expect the Fed to raise interest rates half a point on Wednesday in hopes of slowing the crushing inflation impacting U.S. households.

     Summary: Lowest Mortgage Rates by StateThe lowest mortgage rates available vary depending on the state where originations occur.
Mortgage rates can be influenced by state-level variations in credit score, average mortgage loan term, and size, as well as individual lenders' varying risk management strategies.
What Causes Mortgage Rates to Rise or Fall?
Macroeconomic factors have kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of this year.
This bond-buying policy (and not the more publicized federal funds rate) is a major influencer on mortgage rates.

     Current 30-Year Mortgage Rates: Compare Today’s Rates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Find out if a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the right type of home loan for you and compare current rates for 30-year mortgages.
Current 30-Year Mortgage RatesToday’s average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 5.58% compared to the 5.50% average rate a week earlier.
15-Year vs. 30-Year MortgagesGetting a 15-year mortgage instead of a 30-year mortgage means you’re paying off the house in half the time.
Rates on a 15-year mortgage tend to be slightly less than a 30-year mortgage.
If you have the means to make higher monthly mortgage payments, a 15-year mortgage might be a better option for you.
