     Summary: Amber Heard accuses Johnny Depp of physical abuse on her first day of testimonyEnlarge this image toggle caption Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty Images Elizabeth Frantz/AFP via Getty ImagesAmber Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia courtroom on Wednesday to discuss her experiences and her relationship with Johnny Depp, her ex-husband, who is suing Heard in a $50 million defamation case.
Over more than two hours Heard described years of alleged abuse at the hands of Depp.
Depp has denied committing violence against Heard in his own lengthy testimony in the case at the Fairfax County Circuit Court.
In court, Heard described first meeting Depp when she was 22, saying there was a mutual electricity between them, despite both being in other long-term, committed relationships.
Earlier in the day, psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that Heard endured emotional abuse and intimate partner violence during her time with Depp.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1/5Actress Amber Heard testified in her defense as she stands accused of defaming her ex-husband, actor Jonny Depp, on Wednesday, saying it was one of "the most painful and difficult thing I've ever gone through."
Depp sued Heard for $50 million over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post where she described herself as a "public figure representing domestic abuse."
When she emerged Heard said Depp asked her "how long I'd been hiding it" and ripped the front of her dress and her underwear.
"He proceeds to do a cavity search," Heard said.
Her testimony contradicted earlier testimony by Shannon Curry, an expert in intimate partner violence hired by Depp's legal team.

     Summary: Actress Amber Heard testified in her defense on Wednesday as part of a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp.
Wednesday she began her testimony on the witness stand, in which she recalled emotional and controversial moments during her relationship with Depp.
For a majority of Heard's testimony, Depp seemed to be distracted by something on the table, keeping his head down and his sunglasses on.
"I just stood there staring at the stupid light, I didn't know what to do," Heard testified.
Heard recalled that Lily-Rose began crying and she comforted her before Depp came in and asked his daughter to leave.

     Amber Heard Testifies About a ‘Pattern’ of Violence by Johnny Depp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard, an actress defending herself against a defamation lawsuit filed by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, took the stand on Wednesday, recalling how a whirlwind romance that started on a movie set descended into a “pattern” of violence perpetrated against her by the actor.
The couple first got to know each other in 2009 on the set of “The Rum Diary,” a movie that Mr. Depp produced and starred in, and they fell in love on the movie’s press tour, Ms. Heard testified.
But by 2012, she said, Mr. Depp was repeatedly accusing her of infidelity and his anger would often escalate to physical attacks, despite her denials.
“He would explode,” Ms. Heard said, recounting how Mr. Depp would punch walls next to her head, shove her to the ground and slap her repetitively.
Ms. Heard often grew emotional during her testimony as she explained the physical confrontations in graphic terms, at times appearing chagrined as she gave reasons for staying in the relationship despite her misgivings.

     Summary: Tuesday's recap:Psychologist alleges Amber Heard suffered PTSD, sexual abuse in Johnny Depp relationshipHeard said Depp slapped her twice more.
Much of the testimony during the first three weeks centered on the volatile relationship between Depp and Heard.
As their relationship progressed, Heard said, Depp took issues with clothing she wore and expressed concern she was cheating on him with friends.
Hughes' testimony contradicts that of a psychologist hired by Depp's lawyers, who said Heard was faking her symptoms of PTSD and suffered from borderline and histrionic personality disorders.
Hughes was the first witness to take the stand on Heard's behalf after Depp's lawyers rested their case Tuesday morning.

That allegation never made any sense to me.”Through most of Heard’s testimony, Depp stared down at the table in front of him.

Heard testified that Depp was deeply jealous and that his jealousy turned their relationship into “a never-ending fight”.
And Johnny on opiates is very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,” Heard testified.
Depp described Heard to the jury as having a “need for conflict”.
