The six-episode, highly anticipated, limited series will premiere exclusively on the service on Friday, May 27.
Typical to Disney+’s release schedule, fans will have to wait weekly to stream each episode until the finale on June 22.
Directed by Deborah Chow, “Obi-Wan Kenobi” takes place a decade after the events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where the Jedi Master (McGregor) is betrayed by his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker.
McGregor will reprise his role along with Hayden Christensen, who played Darth Vader in the prequel films.

     A new 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' trailer teases appearances from Darth Vader and young Luke Skywalker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is back -- but, based on the new trailer for the Disney+ series, the droll Jedi master no longer has the high ground.
-- May the Fourth, the trailer teases appearances from a young Luke Skywalker, lightsaber-wielding villains and, of course, a certain Sith known for his belabored breathing.
Years after Emperor Palpatine rose to power and "Order 66'd" most Jedi, Obi-Wan still can't catch a break: He's evading evil Inquisitors intent on hunting him down as one of the galaxy's last living Jedi and keeping careful tabs on a young Luke Skywalker, living simply on his Uncle Owen's moisture farm on Tatooine.
The trailer ends with the instantly recognizable breaths of one Darth Vader, who, in the "Star Wars" timeline , only recently became a Sith.
It's likely -- Hayden Christensen is reprising his role as a badly burnt Anakin/Vader in the series.

     New Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer Reveals How The Empire Framed Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This image from showrunner Deborah Chow's new series tells us how the Empire explained Kenobi's “crime” to the public.
It simply has to be decoded from the Star Wars alphabet known as Aurebesh.
The Empire wants Kenobi returned.
Whatever the case, we know that by the time Vader confronts Kenobi in 1977's original Star Wars, his patience is at an end.
Vader strikes Kenobi down, even after being warned this will only make Kenobi more powerful than he can imagine.

     'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Trailer: May the Fourth Tease Hints at Darth Vader's Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We're mere weeks away from Ewan McGregor returning as Obi-Wan Kenobi in his own Disney Plus series, but May the Fourth (Star Wars Day) brought a fresh trailer to get us hyped with a hint of Darth Vader.
Wednesday's sneak peak showed Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker's guardian Owen Lars disagreeing about the son of Vader's future.
That happens to be the second day of Star Wars convention Celebration Anaheim, which runs May 26-29, so we might get more Obi-Wan announcements then.
We know McGregor's prequel trilogy co-star Hayden Christensen will return as Vader in the show, but the extent of his role is unclear.
The previous trailer suggested Obi-Wan will be trying to keep Anakin's young son, Luke, hidden from Inquisitors, a group of lightsaber-wielding Jedi hunters previously seen in animated series Star Wars: Rebels and video game Jedi: Fallen Order.
