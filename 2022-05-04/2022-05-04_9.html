He has an upper-body injury,” Cassidy said.
He was ruled out, officially with an upper-body injury, early in the third period.

     Summary: The Boston Bruins need a massive improvement from David Pastrnak or their season could end as soon as Sunday afternoon at TD Garden.
In fact, the first period of Game 2 probably was the worst 20 minutes of Pastrnak's Bruins career.
It started when he collided with Hurricanes goalie Antti Raanta and wiped out a Bruins power play.
After an initial major call, David Pastrnak receives a 2-minute penalty for goaltender interference on Antti Raanta.
The Bruins reunited Pastrnak, Marchand and Patrice Bergeron on the top line in the third period Wednesday night.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carolina and Boston ratcheted up the intensity in Game 2 of their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series on Wednesday.
And it led to both sides suffering a key loss as Hurricanes' goalie Antti Raanta and Bruins' defender Hampus Lindholm left the game with injuries.
Carolina saw Raanta go down midway through the first period after a collision with Bruins' forward David Pastrnak.
Hurricanes' coach Rod Brind'Amor had no update on Raanta after the win but did say the netminder wasn't in concussion protocol.
Svechnikov wasn't penalized for that hit, but Brandon Carlo stepped in to defend his teammate and both Carlo and Svechnikov earned roughing minors for the ensuing scrum.

Going into Game 3, the Bruins are facing a whole bunch of questions, including who will replace Lindholm in the lineup.
The Bruins lost Lindholm to a predatory hit by Andrei Svechnikov, then went on to drop Game 2 by a 5-2 score.
Patrice Bergeron got one back for the Bruins late in the second period, and on the power play no less!
After taking a silly penalty early in the second period, Frederic found himself stapled to the bench for a bit.
