     Fed issues biggest rate hike in 22 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's the first time in 22 years that the central bank has hiked rates this much.
In March, the Fed ramped up its benchmark borrowing rate for the first time since late 2018, increasing it by a quarter-percentage point.
In his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that additional half-percentage-point rate hikes will be on the table for the next few meetings.
But the bank isn't looking to go bigger:"A 75 basis point increase is not something the committee is actively considering," Powell told reporters.
"If inflation comes down we're not going to stop, we're just going to go down to 25 basis point increases," he added.

     Summary: The Fed raises interest rates by the most in over 20 years to fight inflationEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve ordered the largest interest hike in more than two decades Wednesday as part of its escalating campaign to battle stubbornly high inflation.
"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing," Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Rising interest rates increase the cost of all kinds of credit, from auto loans to home mortgages.
But Powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth.
In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed announced plans to begin gradually reducing its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities on June 1.

So the first thing borrowers can do is shop around to see which banks have the best interest rates on offer.
With fixed rates at 2% last year, many Australians already switched in expectation that rates would rise.
A fixed rate can offer certainty over two or three years, she said, but there were pros and cons, so doing your research was important.
“You may want to consider locking it in – the cheapest fixed rate on Canstar’s database is 3.28%,” Zahos said.

     Summary: TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The Federal Reserve announced a .5% interest rate hike on Wednesday aimed to combat skyrocketing inflation.
Many are wondering what impact rising rates will have on the booming housing market, if any.
With the price of mortgages climbing, and now expected to jump even higher with the fed raising interest rates, consumers will have to pay even more for their dream home.
Overton believes higher interest rates will be felt across the board, from stocks to buying a car to the housing market.

     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates — as it did Wednesday — the impact doesn’t stop with U.S. homebuyers paying more for mortgages or Main Street business owners facing costlier bank loans.
They also affect global investment: As rates rise in the U.S, safer American government and corporate bonds start looking more attractive to global investors.
To defend their sinking currencies, central banks in developing countries are likely to raise their own rates; some have already started.
The last one came in the mid-1990s under Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, an episode that ended unhappily for many developing countries.
Rising U.S. interest rates don’t always spell disaster for developing world countries.

“In the economy, higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for firms, businesses and households.
The traditional, simplified logic around rising interest rates is that they’re bad for borrowers, who pay higher costs for loans.
The average interest rate for savings accounts has remained at just 0.06% for an entire year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.“Banks are taking care of themselves first.
With the Fed selling these securities and increasing the supply in the market, borrowers will have to offer higher interest rates to find buyers.

     Summary: We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlookAdvertisement How will higher interest rates affect your finances?
In part, the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the Fed will keep raising rates.
Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers.
They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.This is particularly true for large banks now.
They won't need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or CD buyers.
