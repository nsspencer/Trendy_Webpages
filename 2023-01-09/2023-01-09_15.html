     Summary: Despite Sunday’s last-second win, the Texans hold two top 10 draft picks, along with other treasure from years of tanking.
They have no issues with payroll or salary cap moving forward; they’re just largely bereft of impact football players.
(And have an owner who has done nothing to distinguish himself since inheriting the franchise from his daddy.)
It remains to be seen if McNair is willing to fire GM Nick Caserio to get a big fish like Payton, and for prospective coaches, losing the first overall pick stings.
“But you can reset the franchise on Day One [of the draft] if you do it right,” the GM said.

     Summary: LUBBOCK, Texas – The Texas Tech football program will have 11 of its alumni featured on NFL Playoff rosters beginning this weekend with the start of the Wild Card round.
The NFL Playoffs kick off at 3:30 p.m. CT Saturday with the Seattle Seahawks playing at San Francisco, which will include Kerry Hyder Jr. on the 49ers' defensive front.
Hyder, now in his eighth NFL season, totaled 19 tackles and a sack over 16 appearances during the regular season for a 49ers team that is the No.
The NFL Playoffs will be officially down to eight remaining teams Monday night after the Dallas Cowboys travel to Tampa Bay.
It was the second 5,000-yard passing season of Mahomes' career as he is the youngest quarterback in history to do so.

They’ve given up the sixth-most yards this season and have allowed at least 371 yards in both meetings with the Niners.
Moreover, that was the third straight game in which they’ve been held to 21 points or fewer.
That will be critical to limiting the Los Angeles Chargers’ offense.
Worse, their defense is falling apart, giving up an average of 379.6 yards per game across that stretch.

     Ranking NFL head coach openings: Which jobs are most enticing in 2023?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first team to sack its coach this season might also represent the most appealing opening, in part because of Wilks' inspired work with the interim tag.
Carolina's about-face also demonstrated the potential of the young talent on the roster after Christian McCaffrey was traded.
The lack of a premier starter under center is the one drawback of this job.
The biggest draw is the Panthers' location in what will likely be a wide-open NFC South.
Atlanta is rebuilding, New Orleans is in a terrible salary-cap spot and Tampa would have to replace Brady while likely also being in a tight salary-cap spot.
