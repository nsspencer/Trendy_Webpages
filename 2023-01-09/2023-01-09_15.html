     Kliff Kingsbury fired after four seasons with Arizona Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kliff Kingsbury is out as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals after four seasons, the team announced on Monday.
He made the jump to the pros in 2019 when the Cardinals hired him as head coach.
After going 13-18-1 in Kingsbury’s first two seasons, the Cardinals looked poised to contend last year.
In the wake of that disappointing playoff performance, the Cardinals signed Kingsbury and Keim to contract extensions through 2027.
Kingsbury hasn’t been on any other NFL staffs in his coaching career, but he has a friendship with Rams head coach Sean McVay and played for Patriots head coach Bill Belichick in 2003.

"In addition, general manager Steve Keim has decided to step away from his position in order to focus on his health.
Kingsbury signed an extension through 2027 in March, but that didn't stop owner Michael Bidwill from making a change.
"I've been around this organization my entire life, and I don't know any coach that has worked harder than Kliff Kingsbury," Bidwill said during a news conference on Monday.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals will be starting from scratch this offseason in the front office and on the sideline.
Here’s a look at how the Cardinals got here and some of the biggest questions they face:Why did the Cardinals fire Kingsbury?
With GM Steve Keim "stepping away" and coach Kliff Kingsbury fired, the Cardinals could look vastly different in the 2023 season.
They started four quarterbacks, and had their five starting offensive linemen together for just three games this season.
They'll have the tall task of making decisions on Arizona's pending free agents, including four of the five starting offensive linemen.
