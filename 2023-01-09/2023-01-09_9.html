     Tua Tagovailoa’s injury status after Dolphins clinch final AFC playoff spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Quinn Allen · 2 min readThe Miami Dolphins are heading to the playoffs after beating the New York Jets on Sunday, securing the final AFC Wild Card spot.
But, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa still remains in concussion protocol, and his status for the postseason is in serious doubt.
“Tua ended yesterday still in first 3 steps of concussion protocol.
Dolphins have declined to say if they’ll definitely play Tua this season if he’s cleared.”With his long-term health taken into consideration, Tagovailoa probably shouldn’t play again this season.
He was the sole reason the league tightened up their concussion protocol in the first place after the scary scene in Cincinnati when he collapsed on the field.
