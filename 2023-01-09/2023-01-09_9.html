     Summary: The Texans have 11 picks in the 2023 NFL Draft.

Altogether, Texans General Manager Nick Caserio and the franchise have a pair of first-rounders, a second round pick, two third-rounders, a pick in the fourth round and fifth round, and a quartet of sixth-round selections.
After those picks are made public, the overall order of every pick in the Draft will be set.

     Summary: In the wake of the Lovie Smith firing, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith said Black coaches should avoid working for the Texans.
Stephen A. Smith called out the Houston Texans after firing coach Lovie Smith for their treatment of Black coaches.
The controversial ESPN personality made his remarks on Monday’s episode of “First Take,” adding that Black coaches should avoid the Texans.
You should hope beyond God that the Houston Texans never call you – not as long as [general manager Nick Caserio] is in there.
“Caserio shouldn’t have his job,” Smith said.

     Summary: The Texans have started their search for a new head coach.
McNair explained he'll take "a more active role in the process" and detailed the next steps in finding the sixth head coach in club history.
"The structured process allows us to begin the head coaching interviews virtually this week," McNair said.
According to Caserio, the Texans haven't wasted any time in finding the next head coach, but they'll also be very deliberate and go about it differently than in years past.
He met with all of them today and explained that some might stay on under the new head coach, while others might not be a part of the 2023 staff.

No team is in need of a new owner more than the Texans.

Lovie Smith was fired as Texans head coach on Sunday pretty much immediately at the conclusion of a 3-13-1 season.
With the Texans making a swift decision on Smith, they'll have ample opportunity to pursue a wide pool of potential candidates.

Despite the fact the Texans finished 3-13-1 with a 32-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and posted a 2-3 record in their final five games, including tight matchups with the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, Houston decided to move in another direction.
The coaching move will commence the third consecutive offseason in the Nick Caserio era that the Texans will conduct a coaching search.
Last offseason the Texans settled on promoting Smith from defensive coordinator to coach after a month-long search.
Here are three reasons why the Texans had to move on from Smith.
