     Summary: articleWhen it comes to college football, nothing makes the game more fun than a little friendly wager between competitors.
Georgia officials and their Texas counterparts are putting their money where their mouth is while cheering on the Bulldogs and TCU's Horned Frogs.
If Georgia wins, Abbott will have to send its fellow Southern state BBQ and cold drinks from Lone Star Beer.
If Georgia wins, Texas will deliver him some Texan Waygu steaks.
"I look forward to chowing down on that stake when my Georgia Bulldogs beat those Horned Frogs on Monday night," Harper said.

     Summary: We are inching closer and closer to the national title game between Georgia and TCU officially kicking off.
The Bulldogs come into this game as a 13.5-point favorite and hope to win their second title in as many seasons.
This will be the 5th matchup between these 2 programs in a series that Georgia is currently 4-0 in.
With the game just a few hours away from getting underway, the Georgia football media team provided an early look at the uniforms the Bulldogs will be repping during the title game.

     Georgia Reaps Rewards of Big Football Recruiting Spend: Data Viz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart initially cited “culture” and “hard work” in a press conference on Sunday, when he was asked how his program has managed to maintain excellence.
For three straight years prior to the pandemic, Georgia was the most extravagant spender in the football recruiting category, allocating a total of $9.04 million during that timespan.
Alabama and Georgia took big jumps in the recruiting power rankings in the years directly following the hirings of Saban and Smart, respectively.
“There's some doors open to us now, because of this success, that have been closed for a long time,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said in a press conference.
I mean, are we really doing this?”A second Georgia national championship could encourage even more schools to increase their recruiting spending in order to keep up.
