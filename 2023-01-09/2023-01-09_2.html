     Inside Job Cancelled at Netflix, Reversing Season 2 Renewal — Read Creator's 'Heartbroken' Statement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix has reversed its decision on Inside Job, cancelling the adult animated series after it was previously renewed for Season 2.
Series creator Shion Takeuchi broke the news in a tweet on Sunday, writing, “I’m heartbroken to confirm that Netflix has decided to cancel Season 2 of Inside Job.
'Un-Renewed' TV ShowsSet in a world where popular conspiracy theories were actually very true, Inside Job centered on the happenings at Cognito, Inc., a shadow government organization that attempted to keep the truth from reaching the American people.
Inside Job‘s first season was released in two parts, in October 2021 and November 2022.
The show was initially renewed for Season 2 last June.

     What Netflix Just Did To ‘Inside Job’ Season 2 Is Brutal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside Job Inside JobWhile Netflix cancelling a show is not exactly breaking news at this point, this week we have a unique case with Inside Job, and its newly aflame mob of angry fans.
Inside Job was not just cancelled after season 1, it was actually un-renewed, a rare move that is sadly becoming increasingly more common in the tumultuous streaming era.
Inside Job is a series from former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi that posits a world where conspiracy theories are real.
Netflix famously renewed GLOW for a final season and then reversed that decision, cancelling the series without a proper conclusion, though at the time, they cited COVID-based production issues for that decision.
It’s not clear how many seasons Inside Job had planned, but it was not given even a second one to expand, while other animated shows like Big Mouth are entering their seventh season after renewal.
