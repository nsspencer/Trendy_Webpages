     What Netflix Just Did To ‘Inside Job’ Season 2 Is Brutal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside Job Inside JobWhile Netflix cancelling a show is not exactly breaking news at this point, this week we have a unique case with Inside Job, and its newly aflame mob of angry fans.
Inside Job was not just cancelled after season 1, it was actually un-renewed, a rare move that is sadly becoming increasingly more common in the tumultuous streaming era.
Inside Job is a series from former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi that posits a world where conspiracy theories are real.
Netflix famously renewed GLOW for a final season and then reversed that decision, cancelling the series without a proper conclusion, though at the time, they cited COVID-based production issues for that decision.
It’s not clear how many seasons Inside Job had planned, but it was not given even a second one to expand, while other animated shows like Big Mouth are entering their seventh season after renewal.

     Netflix axes Inside Job after one season and fans aren't happy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The creator of this TV show, Shion Takeuchi, confirmed as much via Twitter (opens in new tab), saying "I'm heartbroken to confirm that Netflix has decided to cancel season 2 of Inside Job."
Despite the huge amount of adult animated TV shows on Netflix, Inside Job was particularly well-received, and at the time of writing it has an 89% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes as well as a 79% critics' score.
I’m sorry guys, it’s true.💔#insidejob pic.twitter.com/MQZJ3S7gRDJanuary 9, 2023 See moreGiven those numbers, it's no surprise to hear that Inside Job fans aren't exactly pleased with this decision.
A rough 2022 saw many hit shows canceled, with Warrior Nun, Archive 81, Fate: The Winx Saga and The Midnight Club being just four of many, many shows canceled in the year.
So will Inside Job fans ever get to see more from Reagen Ridley and Brett Hand, the show's two main characters?
