     Summary: California braces for flooding from intense storms rolling across the stateEnlarge this image toggle caption Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty ImagesAnother powerful winter storm system is causing flooding, snow and mudslides in areas of California, where intense downpours have already wreaked havoc on communities earlier this month.
At least 14 people have died in the recent storms, The Associated Press reported, citing state officials.
And Northern California will face a third batch of rain on Wednesday.
More than six feet of snow is expected to pile on the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California up until Wednesday — increasing the risk of avalanches.

     California storm forces thousands to flee homes and leaves 1 dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The heavy rains are expected to worsen ongoing flooding and prolong the risk of flash flooding and mudslides across the state.
Firefighters block the CA 192 Foothill road while the Arroyo Paredon Creek overflows due to heavy rainfall in Carpinteria on Monday.
Heavy rainfall in the area, which is home to 10,000 people, had already flooded roads and creeks, he said.
The flooding came five years to the day after heavy rains hammered a Montecito “burn scar,” killing nearly two dozen people.
The severe weather also forced the Santa Barbara Airport to close due to flooding, the airport announced in a tweet Monday.

     California storm: Mass evacuations as atmospheric river brings flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By the numbers: The NWS issued flood watches Monday for over 34 million Californians — about 90% of the state's population.
Nearly all of California has received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average in the past several weeks, the National Weather Service noted in a forecast discussion.
While flooding, power outages and landslides threaten Californians in the near-term, these storms are boosting reservoir levels, severely depleted by the Southwest's megadrought.
Flash flood warnings were issued for Santa Cruz and counties across the state, as the California Highway Patrol reported water rescues taking place in Santa Cruz and other areas.
These storms may contain damaging winds, hail and very heavy rainfall that could lead to more flooding.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A series of deadly and destructive storms continued to hammer California on Monday, as the drought-stricken state grapples with the sudden onslaught of a very wet January.
The California department of water resources warned that more than a dozen places were at high risk of flooding.
In southern California, the entire community of Montecito were ordered to evacuate on Monday, amid a deluge of rain that has flooded roads and swollen waterways.
“We are in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms – and California is using every resource at its disposal to protect lives and limit damage,” he said.
He urged people to stay home and asked Biden to declare a federal emergency to support storm response and recovery efforts.

The rescue team will "re-evaluate the weather conditions to see when they can resume the search," Cipolla added.
A firefighter discovered one of the boy's shoes, but crews still had not found the child more than five hours later.
The storms won't be enough to officially end California's drought, but they have helped.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, expects a break in the rain after Jan. 18.
