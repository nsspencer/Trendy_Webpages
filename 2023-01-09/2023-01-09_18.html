     Chargers expect Mike Williams to practice, “indication” is he’ll play this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesChargers wide receiver Mike Williams left Sunday’s game with a back injury, but it looks like he avoided an injury that will impact his availability for Saturday’s game against the Jaguars.
Word on Sunday night was that X-rays on Williams’ back were negative and head coach Brandon Staley offered another positive update on Monday.
Staley said that the team expects Williams to practice this week and that the “indication” at this point is that the wideout will be able to play in Jacksonville.
Williams’ injury led to criticism of Staley for playing the team’s starters in a game that would have no impact on their playoff positioning.
The good news about Williams’ injury should help him avoid more of it this week.

     Chargers' Mike Williams, Joey Bosa injured: Brandon Staley explains playing starters in meaningless game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But that didn't stop coach Brandon Staley from playing regular starters against the Broncos in Sunday's 31-28 loss.
In between a hard hit on Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert, who stayed under center into the fourth quarter, star wide receiver Mike Williams and pass rusher Joey Bosa both left the game with separate ailments.
The Chargers, however, appeared to have dodged a huge loss as Williams appeared to have suffered back spasms, according to ESPN, and X-rays came back negative.
Staley explained his decision to go with starters after the game.
Despite the injuries, the Chargers kept their starters on the field to start the second half, later falling behind the Broncos, who have long been eliminated from playoff contention.

     Chargers’ good news on injuries: Mike Williams, Joey Bosa, Kenneth Murray Jr. seem OK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers received good news on Mike Williams’ back Monday as tests revealed he has nothing more serious than a contusion.
Staley said Williams should be able to practice “at some point this week.”If the Chargers are going to make a postseason run, the presence of Williams would seem almost mandatory.
They hooked up for a 35-yard gain in the final 30 seconds of the Chargers’ Week 15 victory over Tennessee.
Trainers assist the Chargers’ Mike Williams off the field after the receiver hurt his back against Denver in the regular-season finale.
“We felt like he got enough snaps, both run game and pass game, and playing in altitude,” Staley said on Bosa.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is huge considering the Chargers' torrid injury history this season.
Williams' injury initially looked bad when he had to be carted off the field in the second quarter and then reportedly had to be helped out of the locker room and onto the team bus.
ESPN's Lindsey Thiry later reported Williams suffered back spasms and his initial MRI came back negative.
Williams also missed a Week 4 game in 2019 with a back injury.
Allen, who missed seven games with a hamstring injury, played well into the fourth quarter and even scored a touchdown.
