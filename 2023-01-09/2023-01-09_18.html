     Several California counties ordered to evacuate as deadly storm weathers on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A series of deadly and destructive storms continued to hammer California on Monday, as the drought-stricken state grapples with the sudden onslaught of a very wet January.
The California department of water resources warned that more than a dozen places were at high risk of flooding.
In southern California, the entire community of Montecito were ordered to evacuate on Monday, amid a deluge of rain that has flooded roads and swollen waterways.
“We are in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms – and California is using every resource at its disposal to protect lives and limit damage,” he said.
He urged people to stay home and asked Biden to declare a federal emergency to support storm response and recovery efforts.

     Summary: FORT BRAGG, Calif. — One person is dead, a 5-year-old is missing and more than 7 million people in the Los Angeles area were under a flash flood warning Monday as a "parade of cyclones" slammed California.

In Southern California, downtown Los Angeles recorded just over an inch of rain in the last 48 hours, according to the agency.
A second episode is expected Tuesday, resulting in slightly smaller amounts, but affecting areas farther south into Southern California, it said.
On Monday, seven people were rescued from a river in Ventura County, a county fire department spokesperson said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rescuers ended the search for a 5-year-old boy who was swept away by floodwaters along the Central Coast of California while the entire coastal community of Montecito was ordered to evacuate Monday as the latest in a series of powerful storms walloped the state.
The boy has not been declared dead, said spokesperson Tony Cipolla of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Office.
Bystanders were able to pull the mother out of the truck, but the boy was swept out of the vehicle and downstream, likely into a river, Swanson said.
Up the coast, evacuation orders were issued in Santa Cruz County for about 32,000 residents living near rain-swollen rivers and creeks.

     Summary: Heavy rain fueled by an atmospheric river again pummeled California on Jan. 9, flooding homes and roads, prompting evacuation orders and knocking out power.
Neighbors were able to rescue the mother, but the boy was pulled downstream toward the Salinas River, he said.
This includes rapid water rises, mudslides, and the potential for major river flooding,” the Weather Service warned Monday.
“All of this rain on top of last week’s rain will produce responses on the area’s major rivers,” the Weather Service wrote.
An atmospheric river soaked Northern and Central California on New Year’s Eve, knocking out power and stranding some people in flooded cars.
