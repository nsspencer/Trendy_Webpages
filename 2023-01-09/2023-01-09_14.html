     Summary: ndrew Tate is led away by police, in the Ilfov area, north of Bucharest, Romaniandrew Tate is led away by police, in the Ilfov area, north of Bucharest, Romania Observator Antena 1 via LAPRESSEOn Sunday, while incarcerated in Romania, Andrew Tate or his brother may have been brought to the hospital, according to a report relayed on Twitter by Andrew Tate.
The account claimed that Tate had been "attacked," but Romanian media suggested a less dramatic truth.
There was no evidence to back up the assertion that Tate was intentionally injured in the Romanian reporting.
A Romanian court prolonged the original 24-hour detention period for Tate and the others to 30-days.
While the inquiry is ongoing, authorities have taken many of Tate and his brother's vehicles and possessions.

"The Matrix has attacked me," the tweet reads, perpetuating conspiracies around Tate's arrest.
Though the account suggested Tate had been "attacked," Romanian media suggested a more mundane reality.
Tate's account has repeatedly referred to the "Matrix" movies while posting vague assertions that the investigation is a conspiracy against him.
Authorities have seized several of Tate and his brother's cars and properties while the investigation is ongoing.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}Andrew Tate’s lawyer has claimed there is “no evidence” to support allegations of human trafficking, rape or organised crime against him or his brother.
The former professional kickboxer turned controversial influencer, 36, and his brother Tristan were detained in Romania last month as part of an investigation by the Romanian organised crime bureau.
Eugen Vidineac, who represents both brothers, told Romanian newssite Gandul the defence had not been given the opportunity to study the prosecution file for the case.
“I will point this out from the beginning, that even up to the present moment, the criminal investigation file has not been made available to us to ensure the effective defence of our clients.

     Andrew Tate sends cryptic "Matrix" tweet after 'being rushed to hospital' from jail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Tate has sent a cryptic tweet about an attack from "The Matrix" after being rushed to hospital amid his 30-day spell in a Romanian jail.
The four-time kickboxing world champion was arrested last month in connection with an investigation into alleged human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.
Both he and his brother Tristan, 34, were detained for 24 hours before a judge granted police a further 30 days to detain them in a detention centre.
Both Andrew and Tristan Tate were arrested in connection with allegedly forming an organised crime group which used girls in adult videos.
Days before his arrest, Andrew Tate found himself in a Twitter spat with climate activist Greta Thunberg when he bragged about the "massive emissions" from his Bugatti.

     Andrew Tate's Hospital Visit Sparks Conflicting Reports About His Health
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Tate became the subject of conflicting reports over the weekend, after it was reported that he had briefly visited a hospital following his arrest.
Romanian prosecutors allege the Tate brothers coerced six women into producing pornography, with the alleged victims facing "acts of physical violence and mental coercion."
Part of the text of the article, which was shown in the tweet in a screenshot, stated one of the Tate brothers "ended up in hospital" following their arrest.
"The attorney for the Tate brothers notified the central detention center and stated that he had certain medical problems," the quote continued.
Tate has not ‘seen a heart specialist in Paris regularly.’ Not sure where you got that one from.
