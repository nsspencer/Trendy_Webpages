     Summary: Sasse announced last year that he would step down from his position to become the University of Florida’s next president.
Sasse made little secret of the frustration he felt with the Senate and the changing nature of the Republican Party.
Before his election to the Senate in 2014, Sasse was president of Midland University, a private Lutheran liberal arts school in Nebraska with an enrollment of about 1,600 students.
The University of Florida has an enrollment of over 60,000 students on a 2,000-acre campus with over a thousand buildings.
CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the process by which Ben Sasse became the incoming University of Florida president.

     Summary: Nebraska's outgoing U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse knows he may be remembered more for his criticisms of former President Donald Trump than for the policies he supported during his eight years in office.
Sasse talked about his political legacy with the Omaha World-Herald as he prepared to leave the Senate Sunday to become president of the University of Florida.
Sasse was a prominent Trump critic who joined with a handful of other Republicans to vote to convict the former president at his impeachment trial after the 2021 Capitol riot.
Sasse acknowledged that his complicated relationship with Trump will shape his legacy.
Before he was elected to the Senate, Sasse led the small, private Midland University in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska.
