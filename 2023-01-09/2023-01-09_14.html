     California storm: Mass evacuations as atmospheric river brings flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has brought with it widespread flash flooding, river flooding, mudslides and staggeringly high mountain snowfall totals.
While flooding, power outages and landslides threaten Californians in the near-term, these storms are boosting reservoir levels, severely depleted by the Southwest's megadrought.
These storms may contain damaging winds, hail and very heavy rainfall that could lead to more flooding.
For the record: President Biden approved California's emergency declaration request due to the atmospheric river storms late Sunday.
"Forecasts for incoming storms show increased impacts to the San Joaquin Valley and Monterey County," Anderson said, noting that the state flood operations center is closely monitoring the situation.

     California storm: 90% of residents are under flood watches as another storm threatens mudslides, power outages and deadly inundation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TRACK THE STORMS“Expect widespread power outages, downed trees and difficult driving conditions,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento tweeted.
This includes rapid water rises, mudslides, and the potential for major river flooding,” the National Weather Service said Monday.
The moisture is expected to sink southward Monday night, making flooding “increasing likely” over the Southern California coastal ranges Tuesday, the weather service said.
“Valley areas will likely see gusts as high as 45-50 mph, with gusts greater than 60 mph possible in wind prone areas,” the National Weather Service in Reno said.
As the storm pushes inland, more than 5 feet of snow could fall along the Sierra Crest west of Lake Tahoe, the weather service said.
