     ‘Totally Unexpected’: Diamond of MAGA Duo ‘Diamond &amp; Silk’ Dies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lucas Jackson/ReutersOne-half of the ardently pro-Trump commentary duo “Diamond and Silk” died on Monday.
“Diamond blazed a trail, founded on her passion and love for the entire race of humanity,” read a statement on a fundraising page for her memorial.
MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, who hosted a video series for the duo, told The Daily Beast that Trump’s post was the first he had heard of Hardaway’s death.
In November, the duo’s Twitter account asked followers to pray for Hardaway, but didn’t specify her illness.
As “Diamond and Silk,” Hardaway and Richardson rose to fame on the right as outspoken African-American supporters of Trump during his 2016 presidential run.
