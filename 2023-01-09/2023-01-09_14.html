The Best Animated TV Series of 2022 6 ImagesIGN’s Inside Job Season One review gave it 7/10 and said: “Inside Job offers likable characters and a world full of creatures and secret societies.

     Summary: Inside Job has been canceled by Netflix ahead of its second season, its creator Shion Takeuchi has confirmed.
Inside Job has been left out in the cold, and it sucks.
A lot of big names turned to Netflix, whose coffers were opened for all willing to sign their name on the dotted line.
This rings true with Inside Job, as creator Shion Takeuchi made a name for herself on shows like Gravity Falls and Disenchantment before landing at Netflix.
While the first season provided only a few glimpses of this brilliance, I’m sure the now shrouded future was to hold so many more.

     What Netflix Just Did To ‘Inside Job’ Season 2 Is Brutal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside Job Inside JobWhile Netflix cancelling a show is not exactly breaking news at this point, this week we have a unique case with Inside Job, and its newly aflame mob of angry fans.
Inside Job was not just cancelled after season 1, it was actually un-renewed, a rare move that is sadly becoming increasingly more common in the tumultuous streaming era.
Inside Job is a series from former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi that posits a world where conspiracy theories are real.
Netflix famously renewed GLOW for a final season and then reversed that decision, cancelling the series without a proper conclusion, though at the time, they cited COVID-based production issues for that decision.
It’s not clear how many seasons Inside Job had planned, but it was not given even a second one to expand, while other animated shows like Big Mouth are entering their seventh season after renewal.
