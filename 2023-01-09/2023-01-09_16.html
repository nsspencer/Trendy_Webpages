     Summary: Fair Value CalculationI prepared two valuation models in order to make a more accurate assessment of the valuation.
Apple fair value calculation based on DCF (Author's calculation)The second valuation method is based on an earnings-per-share calculation.
In the second valuation method the fair value is $88,53, which corresponds to an overvaluation of the stock of 32% (see figure below).

     Why Apple Was Rising Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happenedShares of Apple (AAPL 0.41%) were rising on Monday, up 2.4% as of 10:33 a.m.
An exciting product launch could be the catalyst sending Apple's beaten-down shares above the market today.
Delays or not, it appears investors are excited about a new product launch.
Apple hasn't really released a brand-new type of device since the Apple Watch back in 2015, or, if you count AirPods as a device, 2016; while there were initially some skeptics, the Apple Watch has made a meaningful impact on revenues and profits for the iPhone giant, as have AirPods, despite Apple's already-massive size.
Whether that is cheap enough to be considered a bargain for Apple stock remains to be seen, and it may depend on how bad an upcoming recession will be -- if we even have one.
