     Summary: Despite Sunday’s last-second win, the Texans hold two top-10 draft picks, along with other treasure from years of tanking.
They have no issues with payroll or salary cap moving forward; they’re just largely bereft of impact football players.
(And have an owner who has done nothing to distinguish himself since inheriting the franchise from his daddy.)
It remains to be seen if McNair is willing to fire GM Nick Caserio to get a big fish such as Payton, and for prospective coaches, losing the first overall pick stings.
“But you can reset the franchise on Day One [of the draft] if you do it right,” the GM said.

     Summary: More than half of the NFL has reached the beginning of the offseason with the regular season coming to a close Sunday.
Several teams have already made the decision to change key positions within the organization, whether that be a general manager, head coach or coordinator.
All of the NFL firings can be found here.
Rather than scouring the scatter shot reports across social media, CBSSports.com has compiled all of those reports of interest in one place.
Below, we will track all of the coordinator, head coach and general manager candidates and where they have been requested to interview.

     Summary: The first team to sack its coach this season might also represent the most appealing opening, in part because of Wilks' inspired work with the interim tag.
Carolina's about-face also demonstrated the potential of the young talent on the roster after Christian McCaffrey was traded.
The lack of a premier starter under center is the one drawback of this job.
The biggest draw is the Panthers' location in what will likely be a wide-open NFC South.
Atlanta is rebuilding, New Orleans is in a terrible salary-cap spot and Tampa would have to replace Brady while likely also being in a tight salary-cap spot.

     Summary: LUBBOCK, Texas – The Texas Tech football program will have 11 of its alumni featured on NFL Playoff rosters beginning this weekend with the start of the Wild Card round.
The NFL Playoffs kick off at 3:30 p.m. CT Saturday with the Seattle Seahawks playing at San Francisco, which will include Kerry Hyder Jr. on the 49ers' defensive front.
Hyder, now in his eighth NFL season, totaled 19 tackles and a sack over 16 appearances during the regular season for a 49ers team that is the No.
The NFL Playoffs will be officially down to eight remaining teams Monday night after the Dallas Cowboys travel to Tampa Bay.
It was the second 5,000-yard passing season of Mahomes' career as he is the youngest quarterback in history to do so.

     Summary: Chargers (cont’d)Due to their horrible defense on the ground, the Chargers are best when they force their opponents to pass.
Don’t get me wrong, their pass defense isn’t great — they have a mediocre pass rush and are just alright at creating turnovers — but compared to their run defense, it’s otherworldly.
The Chargers could theoretically play spoiler if given the opportunity to play either of those teams.
They handed the Chargers their worst loss of the season back in Week 3, and have only gotten better since then.
While the Chargers are the better team on paper, head coach Brandon Staley holds this team back tremendously, and I wouldn’t be shocked if he’s outshined and defeated in Jacksonville this weekend.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The postseason is a fresh slate for 14 contenders, and only time will tell which ones are ready to make a run at the Lombardi.
2 Teddy Bridgewater possess the consistent deep-area accuracy to play shootout, which may well be required thanks to their vulnerable pass defense.
Fortunately, John Harbaugh is battle-tested on the sidelines, and their "D," headlined by Roquan Smith, averages more than a takeaway per game.
The X factor may well be Jonathan Gannon's defense, which leads the NFL in sacks but has been prone to death by a thousand papercuts.
Like the Patriots of old, when the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick pairing alone demanded trust, they are today's steadiest NFL standard.
