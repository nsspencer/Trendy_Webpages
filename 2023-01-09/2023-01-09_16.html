     Brian Walshe, husband of missing mom Ana Walshe, was convicted of Warhol art fraud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The husband of missing Massachusetts woman Ana Walshe is a convicted art fraudster who tried to sell fake Andy Warhol paintings.
Brian Walshe, in the 2018 fraud case, went to great lengths to sell the fake paintings, the US Attorney’s Office said.
Images of paintings are seen in court filings regarding Brian Walshe and alleged Andy Warhol art fraud.
When selling the two fake Warhol copies to the buyer in 2016, Walshe included a photo of an invoice for the two Warhol paintings with Warhol Foundation numbers, the feds said.
The sentencing delay for the art fraud could be connected to another legal matter involving Walshe.
