     Summary: Sasse announced last year that he would step down from his position to become the University of Florida’s next president.
Sasse made little secret of the frustration he felt with the Senate and the changing nature of the Republican Party.
The University of Florida has an enrollment of over 60,000 students on a 2,000-acre campus with over a thousand buildings.
Unlike Sasse, the university’s most recent presidents had extensive careers as administrators at major universities prior to taking the school’s top job.
CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the process by which Ben Sasse became the incoming University of Florida president.

     Summary: Nebraska's outgoing U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse knows he may be remembered more for his criticisms of former President Donald Trump than for the policies he supported during his eight years in office.
Sasse talked about his political legacy with the Omaha World-Herald as he prepared to leave the Senate Sunday to become president of the University of Florida.
Sasse was a prominent Trump critic who joined with a handful of other Republicans to vote to convict the former president at his impeachment trial after the 2021 Capitol riot.
Sasse acknowledged that his complicated relationship with Trump will shape his legacy.
Before he was elected to the Senate, Sasse led the small, private Midland University in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska.

     US Senate 'does not work well', Sen. Ben Sasse says before officially resigning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Republican Senator Ben Sasse has officially stepped down from the Senate one week after he criticized the upper chamber of the US Congress as an institution that "does not work very well.”Sasse, an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, officially resigned from the Senate on Sunday.
“When we’re being honest with each other, which usually means when on one of the very rare occasions where cameras aren’t present, we all know that a big chunk of the performative yelling that happens here and in every hearing room is just about being booked for even more performative yelling at night on TV,” he said.
He was among seven Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for a second time after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
He blamed Trump for intimidating election officials and repeatedly boosting baseless claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election.
“Those lies had consequences, endangering the life of the vice president and bringing us dangerously close to a bloody constitutional crisis,” Sasse said at the time.
