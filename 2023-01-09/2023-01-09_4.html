McKee is one of the most accurate quarterbacks in the draft class but was put in a lot of unwinnable situations on tape at Stanford.
Porter allowed all of 143 yards this past season and broke up nine of the 30 targets into his coverage.

     2023 Fantasy Football Mock Draft: Justin Jefferson and Christian McCaffrey Top Their Positions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here is our very first way-too-early 2023 fantasy football mock draft.
With wide receivers being far more predictable than running backs, Jefferson gets the nod as the top pick in 2023 fantasy football drafts.
Tethered to an elite quarterback on an elite offense, there’s no reason to doubt Ekeler can post another season of 20 ppg in 2023.
1.06 Cooper Kupp, WR, Los Angeles RamsI’m a little weary of Cooper Kupp entering the 2023 season.
2.10 Jalen Hurts, QB, Philadelphia EaglesHad he not missed the two most important weeks of the fantasy season, I would argue Jalen Hurts was the single best pick of 2022 fantasy drafts.
