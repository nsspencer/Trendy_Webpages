Emergency protective measures (Category B), limited to direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.

     California storm: Mass evacuations as atmospheric river brings flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By the numbers: The NWS issued flood watches Monday for over 34 million Californians — about 90% of the state's population.
Nearly all of California has received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average in the past several weeks, the National Weather Service noted in a forecast discussion.
While flooding, power outages and landslides threaten Californians in the near-term, these storms are boosting reservoir levels, severely depleted by the Southwest's megadrought.
Flash flood warnings were issued for Santa Cruz and counties across the state, as the California Highway Patrol reported water rescues taking place in Santa Cruz and other areas.
These storms may contain damaging winds, hail and very heavy rainfall that could lead to more flooding.

     California’s dilemma: How do you harness an epic amount of rain in a water-scarce state? Let it flood, scientists say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, 90% of the state’s population was under a flood watch as another round of storms rolled through.
And scientists warn that it has a long way to go to erase years unfavorable precipitation trends and water supply overuse.
But the abrupt shift from drought warnings to flood warnings highlights the dilemma California faces: How do you manage an overwhelming amount of rain in a water-scarce state?
And is it possible to harness that water so it’s available in the dry summer months?
Part of the solution, climate scientists told CNN, is drawing levees back to allow rivers more room to flood safely into surrounding land.

     Summary: The National Weather Service says California is in the middle of two major episodes of rain taking place "in quick succession" on Monday and Tuesday.
And Northern California will face a third batch of rain on Wednesday.
More than six feet of snow is expected to pile on the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California up until Wednesday — increasing the risk of avalanches.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A series of deadly and destructive storms continued to hammer California on Monday, as the drought-stricken state grapples with the sudden onslaught of a very wet January.
The California department of water resources warned that more than a dozen places were at high risk of flooding.
In southern California, the entire community of Montecito were ordered to evacuate on Monday, amid a deluge of rain that has flooded roads and swollen waterways.
“We are in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms – and California is using every resource at its disposal to protect lives and limit damage,” he said.
He urged people to stay home and asked Biden to declare a federal emergency to support storm response and recovery efforts.

     Summary: The boy has not been declared dead, said spokesperson Tony Cipolla of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office.
The rescue team will "re-evaluate the weather conditions to see when they can resume the search," Cipolla added.
A firefighter discovered one of the boy's shoes, but crews still had not found the child more than five hours later.
The storms won't be enough to officially end California's drought, but they have helped.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, expects a break in the rain after Jan. 18.

     Summary: Heavy rain fueled by an atmospheric river again pummeled California on Jan. 9, flooding homes and roads, prompting evacuation orders and knocking out power.
Neighbors were able to rescue the mother, but the boy was pulled downstream toward the Salinas River, he said.
This includes rapid water rises, mudslides, and the potential for major river flooding,” the Weather Service warned Monday.
“All of this rain on top of last week’s rain will produce responses on the area’s major rivers,” the Weather Service wrote.
An atmospheric river soaked Northern and Central California on New Year’s Eve, knocking out power and stranding some people in flooded cars.
