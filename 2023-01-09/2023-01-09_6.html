     10 takeaways from the Broncos' 2022 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos wrapped up the 2022 season on Sunday with a 5-12 record, marking the second-straight year the team has finished in last place in the AFC West and the seventh-straight year Denver has missed the playoffs.
After a sixth-straight losing season, the Broncos plan to make big changes this offseason, most notably by bringing in a new head coach.
Before we completely turn our attention toward the future, though, we’re taking a quick look back at the 2022 season.
There were a few bright spots, but it was mostly a forgettable year for Denver.
Here are ten takeaways from the Broncos’ season.

     Summary: ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Monday, citing sources, that the Denver Broncos have asked the 49ers' permission to interview Ryans for their open head-coaching job.
Broncos also have put in permission to interview 49ersâ DC DeMeco Ryans for their HC job, per league sources.
Ryans isn't the only coach with 49ers ties to be named a candidate for the Broncos job.
Former 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh reportedly will be interviewed for the position early this week.
There will be plenty of competition for the Broncos job.

     Denver Broncos' Expected Timeline to Hire a New Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos fired Nathaniel Hackett on December 26, which gave the team the option for a slight head start on the coaching search.
The Broncos have done what every team looking at hiring a new head coach has done — they started putting together their list of candidates to interview.
However, with the lack of interviews and having to abide by specific rules regarding interviews, fans want to know what the Broncos' timeline for hiring a new head coach is.
The timeline was set the first week after Denver fired Vic Fangio on January 9.
The timeline can't be strictly narrowed down without knowing the candidates the Broncos want to interview.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos won their final game of the season on Sunday, defeating their division rivals the Los Angeles Chargers 31-28.
Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson completed 13-of-24 passes for 283 and three touchdowns, which ties his season high.
Since this is the last game of the season, this will be the last Twitter reaction post of the 2022 campaign due to the Broncos being eliminated from the playoffs.
However, since the Broncos brought home the win, it may be a more positive outlook.
Let’s take a dive in to conclude the 2022 season.

     Summary: Six offensive starters had their seasons completely or partially derailed by injury, and those six are all under contract for 2023.
But those six players are intent on coming back next season, albeit playing for a new head coach.
“I know they’re going to do their part to get healthy and ready (for Week 1) and I’m going to do my part.
The rookie didn’t play the first five games due to a hamstring injury.
“If we can stay healthy and we’ve got a full team, we can come out and go through anybody,” Hamler said.

     Broncos QB Russell Wilson after 5-12 season: 'I fell short'

     Summary: Russell Wilson ends a tumultuous first season in Denver on a high note with a trio of touchdown passes in the Broncos' win over the Chargers.
(1:08)DENVER -- Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson closed out what he called a “really humbling year’’ Sunday with one of his best efforts of a lost season and a promise to fix what went wrong.
Wilson said his 2023 season will start “[Monday] morning.’’The Broncos finished 5-12 -- 2010 was the franchise's only other 12-loss season -- with a 31-28 victory over the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers in Empower Field at Mile High.
When Wilson was asked Sunday about how he often did not look like a nine-time Pro Bowler, Wilson responded:“I asked myself that same question, where’s he at?’’Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson (3) runs the ball in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers.
“That whole (fixing) narrative … What you saw out there is Russell Wilson is Russell Wilson, he’s a Hall of Fame, NFL quarterback,’’ Rosburg said.

     'We are going to turn this thing around': Russell Wilson surges late as Broncos look ahead to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Denver aims to end its seven-year playoff drought, both of those elements should boost the Broncos' chances in 2023.
The Broncos, though, will also need to improve at the game's most important position — and quarterback Russell Wilson is dedicated to making that happen.
That is what I came here to do: to help the Denver Broncos win.
Then, in Sunday's win, Wilson posted his second game this season with three passing touchdowns and completed three passes of at least 50 yards.
As Wilson and the Broncos head into a new season, though, they likely both hope that a new year can bring familiar results for Wilson.

There could be things about the organization that give him pause, things he would know about only because he was head coach there.
