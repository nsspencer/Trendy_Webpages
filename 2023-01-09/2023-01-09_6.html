     The Great irony About Kliff Kingsbury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pattern continued this past spring when Bidwill signed GM Steve Keim and Kliff Kingsbury to their lucrative contract extensions.
It makes one wonder who is laughing harder on the way to the bank these days, Kliff Kingsbury, Kyler Murray or Erik Burkhardt?
Well, until the Paparazzi happens to click photos of Kyler Murray and Kliff Kingsbury puffing on Cubans and slurping back Margaritas on the shores of Zihuatanejo, all bets are off.
Note: I felt compelled to write this satire today because, in truth, I am feeling very emotional about Kliff getting fired.
And I am repulsed by the thought of Kliff Kingburyâ€™s firing being the coda of the HBO Hard Knocks In-Season finale.

     Cardinals fire Kliff Kingsbury; GM Steve Keim steps aside
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Cardinals have fired head coach Kliff Kingsbury 10 months after signing him to a contract extension through the 2027 season.
Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said during a news conference Monday that Keim offered his resignation last week.
His firing comes a day after the Cardinals lost their season finale 38-13 to the 49ers, completing a 4-13 season.
Back-to-back late-season collapses in 2020 and 2021 overshadowed whatever success the Cardinals had built under Kingsbury, but it was also a trend.
This season didn't get off to as impressive a start, but things still fell apart in the backstretch.

     Summary: "We have announced that head coach Kliff Kingsbury has been relieved of his duties," the team said in a statement.
"In addition, general manager Steve Keim has decided to step away from his position in order to focus on his health.
Kingsbury signed an extension through 2027 in March, but that didn't stop owner Michael Bidwill from making a change.
"I've been around this organization my entire life, and I don't know any coach that has worked harder than Kliff Kingsbury," Bidwill said during a news conference on Monday.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

     Cardinals fire coach Kliff Kingsbury, GM Steve Keim stepping down from his spot

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cardinals have reportedly already asked for permission of four GM candidates: Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham, 49ers assistant GM Adam Peters, 49ers director of pro personnel Ran Carthon, and Titans director of player personnel Monti Ossenfort.
On the flip side, the Titans have reportedly asked permission to talk to Harris about their vacant GM post.
Asked about his financial wherewithal to hire a high-profile coach, Bidwill said he wanted the "best coach and the best GM."
"I don't know if the biggest name correlates to the best coach," he said.
He doesn't see the need to say one or the other necessarily has to have personnel control, because he'd prefer a "real partnership" between the GM and coach.
