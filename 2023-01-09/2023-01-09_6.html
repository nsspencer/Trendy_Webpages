     Report: Texans Request HC Interview with Broncos' Ejiro Evero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ejiro Evero may indeed prove one-and-done with the Denver Broncos.
Fresh off his first season as the team's defensive coordinator, Evero is garnering head-coaching interest from the Houston Texans, who officially submitted an interview request Monday, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported.
Evero is among several candidates for the Texans job, joining 49ers DC DeMeco Ryans (whom Denver also plans to interview), Eagles DC Jonathan Gannon, and Philadelphia offensive coordinator Shane Steichen.

A relatively unknown assistant prior to his hiring, Evero inherited — and bettered — what was mostly Vic Fangio's heralded bunch.

     Summary: The Texans have already asked the Broncos for permission to interview defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
Evero is also expected to interview for Denver’s opening.
If the Broncos do not promote Evero, they will undoubtedly hope that he remains with the team as defensive coordinator after an excellent first year on the job in 2022.
The Texans have also requested an interview with San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans, as have the Broncos.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos won their final game of the season on Sunday, defeating their division rivals the Los Angeles Chargers 31-28.
Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson completed 13-of-24 passes for 283 and three touchdowns, which ties his season high.
Since this is the last game of the season, this will be the last Twitter reaction post of the 2022 campaign due to the Broncos being eliminated from the playoffs.
However, since the Broncos brought home the win, it may be a more positive outlook.
Let’s take a dive in to conclude the 2022 season.

     Denver Broncos' Expected Timeline to Hire a New Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos fired Nathaniel Hackett on December 26, which gave the team the option for a slight head start on the coaching search.
The Broncos have done what every team looking at hiring a new head coach has done — they started putting together their list of candidates to interview.
However, with the lack of interviews and having to abide by specific rules regarding interviews, fans want to know what the Broncos' timeline for hiring a new head coach is.
The timeline was set the first week after Denver fired Vic Fangio on January 9.
The timeline can't be strictly narrowed down without knowing the candidates the Broncos want to interview.

"Not saying 'Hack' [former head coach Nathaniel Hackett] didn't want to win or nothing like that.
A coach that's not going to play around.
Several Broncos, though, also explained that an incoming head coach would find a solid locker room and a team that's ready to work.
We've seen a lot of turnover, a lot of change, but this team's hungry to win."

Broncos Wire has published a list of 20 potential head coach candidates for the team, but Denver’s interview list will likely be shorter.

Whoever becomes the team’s next head coach will have to make decisions on the rest of Hackett’s holdover coaching staff.

There could be things about the organization that give him pause, things he would know about only because he was head coach there.
