     Arsenal's transfer window: Mudryk, Felix and the players Arteta needs to sign in January
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal may be top of the Premier League but it's clear that they will need reinforcements if they are to sustain their title challenge.
Arsenal’s strength in depth has been the topic of much discussion since Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Newcastle.
The Arsenal manager has stated that the club is active in the transfer market and their attempts to bring in winger Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk are now common knowledge.
But just how shallow is Arsenal’s pool of players and where are reinforcements most required?

     Fans Stand on Top of Car to Watch Matt Turner, Arsenal Vs. Oxford in FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A group of fans in England would certainly say so.
During the Arsenal vs. Oxford United FA Cup fixture on Monday at the Kassam Stadium, some fans, taking the car seat phrase a bit too literal, caught the action by standing on top of a car overlooking the inside of the pitch.
USMNT goalie Matt Turner starred for Arsenal -- the current Premier League leaders -- in goal, and logged yet another clean sheet -- his fourth in five appearances.
The standing fans didn't have much to enjoy during the opening 45 minutes when the game stayed level at 0-0, but the Gunners eventually showed their class with three second-half goals to prevail 3-0.
Holding a capacity of over 53,000 with no view if standing on top of a car, the standing fans would need to get actual tickets this time around.

     Better call Eddie! Winners, losers &amp; ratings as Nketiah brace sees Arsenal past stubborn Oxford United
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eddie Nketiah answered Arsenal's call once again in the absence of Gabriel Jesus, netting a brace in a 3-0 FA Cup third round win at Oxford United.
Three second-half goals saw an under-par Arsenal past Oxford United to set up a mouth-watering FA Cup fourth round clash with Manchester City at the end of the month.
But they improved massively after the interval, with Fabio Vieira producing two excellent assists to break the resistance of the hosts.
There was still time for Nketiah to add his second of the game, dinking a fine finish over the onrushing McGinty following Gabriel Martinelli's ball through.
In the end it was a convincing win for Arsenal, albeit after a very poor first-half display.

     Summary: It depends on the proposals, but Manchester United and Arsenal have both confirmed in recent meetings with the agent Jorge Mendes their interest in signing Felix on loan.
Both Manchester United and Arsenal consider that fee too high.
While Manchester United are also exploring other options for a traditional number nine in case the Felix deal collapses, Arsenal are fully focused on Mudryk.
Yes, the Blues love Mudryk and they want to enter the race if he doesn't go to Arsenal.
Mudryk wants to join Arsenal, it's his priority ... but Chelsea are not giving up until the very end.

     Arsenal beats Oxford 3-0, sets up FA Cup match with Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OXFORD, England (AP) — Arsenal set up a fourth-round match with English Premier League title rival Manchester City in the FA Cup by beating third-tier Oxford United 3-0 on Monday.
Arsenal will head to Etihad Stadium on the weekend of Jan. 28-29 for the match against City in the last 32 of the famous old competition.
City, the defending league champion, is in second place and trails Arsenal by five points approaching the halfway point of the season.
Advertising“We had to stay patient, we had to up the level as it wasn’t good enough from us in the first half and we did that in the second,” Nketiah said.
Arsenal avoided becoming the ninth Premier League team to be eliminated in the third round, after Everton, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Brentford, Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa were ousted over the last three days.

     Summary: Arsenal eased by Oxford United 3-0 in the third round of the FA Cup, overcoming a slow start to pull away in the final 30 minutes.
The League One side succeeded in stifling the attack of their Premier League opposition in the first half, as neither team recorded a shot on target.
Vieira provided another assist just seven minutes later, playing in Eddie Nketiah who coolly took the ball around Edward McGinty and slotted it into an empty net.
Arsenal advance to face Manchester City away in the fourth round later this month.
That match will come less than three weeks before the two Premier League title rivals meet in the league for the first time this season.

A trip to Premier League champions City at the end of the month is Arsenal's reward for the win, as Mikel Arteta's side continue their fine season.

     Report: Arsenal and Shakhtar working on Mudryk deal structure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite Chelsea’s best efforts to derail Arsenal’s pursuit of Mykhailo Mudryk it appears we are edging towards a deal with Shakhtar Donetsk for the 21-year-old winger.
According to Sport Arena, Arsenal want add-on bonuses to make up 30% of the entire transfer fee while Shakhtar are pushing for a maximum of 20%.
The Gunners had an initial €60 million package (€40 million upfront plus €20 million in add-ons) rejected and followed up with another approach that was also turned down.
In the meantime, Mudryk is due to arrive in Antalya, Turkey for Shakhtar’s winter break training camp.
Arsenal play Sp*rs in the north London derby on Sunday – likely to come too soon for Mudryk – and have dates with Manchester United and Manchester City on the agenda before the end of the month.
