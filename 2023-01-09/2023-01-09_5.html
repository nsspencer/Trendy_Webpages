     Houston Texans already telling fans the Davis Mills era is over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that the Lovie Smith era is over for the Houston Texans, most people are expecting the Davis Mills era to end as well.
It’s noticeable that one teammate not pictured is Davis Mills.
Davis Mills is not on the Texans 2023 Season Ticket add!
It is of course possible that the Houston Texans just don’t think Mills is “marketable” heading into the 2022 offseason.
The season ticket renewal pic is just confirmation that the Davis Mills era for the Houston Texans is officially over.

     3 reasons why the Houston Texans had to fire Lovie Smith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday evening.
Despite the fact the Texans finished 3-13-1 with a 32-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and posted a 2-3 record in their final five games, including tight matchups with the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, Houston decided to move in another direction.
The coaching move will commence the third consecutive offseason in the Nick Caserio era that the Texans will conduct a coaching search.
Last offseason the Texans settled on promoting Smith from defensive coordinator to coach after a month-long search.
Here are three reasons why the Texans had to move on from Smith.

We have Lovie Smith to thank for the ensuing offseason speculation.

No team is in need of a new owner more than the Texans.
Texans fans deserve better — but sadly that isn’t going to happen.
