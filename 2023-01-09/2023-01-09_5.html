     Cardinals fire Kliff Kingsbury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cardinals have fired Kliff Kingsbury, according to multiple reports.
Team owner Michael Bidwill elected to make the move less than a calendar year after signing Kingsbury and General Manager Steve Keim to extensions through the 2027 season.
The Saints are expecting to get a request from the Cardinals to interview Sean Payton.
Kingsbury finishes his tenure 28-37-1 in the regular season with an 0-1 postseason record.
While Keim is currently on a medical leave of absence, the Cardinals are also not expected to retain him as G.M.

     Cardinals fire head coach Kliff Kingsbury following 4-13 season; GM Steve Keim stepping down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We have announced that head coach Kliff Kingsbury has been relieved of his duties," the team said in a statement.
Kingsbury went 28-37-1 in four seasons in the desert with a dismal 4-13 record in 2022.
Arizona improved by three wins each season under Kingsbury, going from 5-10-1 in 2019 to 8-8 in 2020 to 11-6 in 2021.
A tumultuous campaign, starting with DeAndre Hopkins' suspension and highlighted by several injuries, including losing Murray to an ACL tear, saw the offense struggle mightily.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

     Kliff Kingsbury fired as Arizona Cardinals head coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals fired head coach Kliff Kingsbury on Monday after a 4-13 season, his fourth on the job.
Kingsbury, hired when he was 39 years old, had gone 35-40 as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders from 2013-18 before he was fired.
After hiring Kingsbury, Arizona drafted quarterback Kyler Murray first overall to quarterback the offense and traded 2018 first-round pick Josh Rosen.
The team paired the new NFL head coach with experienced defensive coordinator Vance Joseph.
Kingsbury coached Case Keenum (Houston), Johnny Manziel (Texas A&amp;M), Davis Webb (Texas Tech) and Mahomes (Texas Tech).

     Cardinals Fire HC Kliff Kingsbury; GM Steve Keim Will Not Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cardinals have fired Kliff Kingsbury, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter (on Twitter).
Ian Rapoport of NFL Network adds that general manager Steve Keim will also not be returning (Twitter link).
Still, eyebrows were raised at the Cardinals’ decision to hire him in 2019 given his overall record of 35-40 at Texas Tech.
Another playoff appearance was expected given the faith shown by the organization to Keim, Kingsbury and (by virtue of his own monster extension) Murray.
A rift was reported to be growing between Kingsbury and Murray, something which fueled the fire of this dismissal taking place.
