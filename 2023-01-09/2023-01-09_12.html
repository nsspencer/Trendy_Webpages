Owner Michael Bidwill announced Monday that the team already has interviewed internal candidates Adrian Wilson and Quentin Harris.
Wilson is vice president, pro personnel and just concluded his eighth season with the team, while Harris is vice president, player personnel and just concluded his 15th season with the Cardinals.
“There’s an incredible sense of urgency,” Bidwill said, via video from Johnny Venerable of PHNX Cardinals.

     Cardinals' head-coaching candidates: Vance Joseph to get 'long look'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A look at some of the coaches already being linked to the Cardinals as they begin their stone unturning:Vance Joseph, Cardinals DCKingsbury may be gone, but the jury’s still out when it comes down to defensive coordinator Vance Joseph.
Per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Joseph is expected to get “a long look” for the head-coaching vacancy.
Serving under Kingsbury the past four seasons, Joseph has garnered a lot of respect within the franchise.
Sean Payton, former Saints head coachEven before Kingsbury’s firing, Payton was a name thrown around by many as a potential candidate for the position.
And according to Rapoport, the former New Orleans Saints head coach has done his homework on the Cardinals if the position did become available.

Kingsbury is also one of only seven coaches in Arizona Cardinals’ franchise history to make the playoffs.

"In addition, general manager Steve Keim has decided to step away from his position in order to focus on his health.
Kingsbury signed an extension through 2027 in March, but that didn't stop owner Michael Bidwill from making a change.
"I've been around this organization my entire life, and I don't know any coach that has worked harder than Kliff Kingsbury," Bidwill said during a news conference on Monday.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

He said he also completed one interview with an external GM candidate, although he would not name who it was.
The Cardinals have not made an external general manager hiring since 1993 when Buddy Ryan was named head coach and general manager.

Asked about his financial wherewithal to hire a high-profile coach, Bidwill said he wanted the "best coach and the best GM."
"I don't know if the biggest name correlates to the best coach," he said.
He doesn't see the need to say one or the other necessarily has to have personnel control, because he'd prefer a "real partnership" between the GM and coach.

     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals will be starting from scratch this offseason in the front office and on the sideline.
Here’s a look at how the Cardinals got here and some of the biggest questions they face:Why did the Cardinals fire Kingsbury?
With GM Steve Keim "stepping away" and coach Kliff Kingsbury fired, the Cardinals could look vastly different in the 2023 season.
They started four quarterbacks, and had their five starting offensive linemen together for just three games this season.
They'll have the tall task of making decisions on Arizona's pending free agents, including four of the five starting offensive linemen.
