     Arsenal's transfer window: Mudryk, Felix and the players Arteta needs to sign in January
    </h2>

     Summary: Arsenal may be top of the Premier League but it's clear that they will need reinforcements if they are to sustain their title challenge.
Arsenal’s strength in depth has been the topic of much discussion since Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Newcastle.
The Arsenal manager has stated that the club is active in the transfer market and their attempts to bring in winger Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk are now common knowledge.
But just how shallow is Arsenal’s pool of players and where are reinforcements most required?

     Summary: It depends on the proposals, but Manchester United and Arsenal have both confirmed in recent meetings with the agent Jorge Mendes their interest in signing Felix on loan.
Both Manchester United and Arsenal consider that fee too high.
While Manchester United are also exploring other options for a traditional number nine in case the Felix deal collapses, Arsenal are fully focused on Mudryk.
Yes, the Blues love Mudryk and they want to enter the race if he doesn't go to Arsenal.
Mudryk wants to join Arsenal, it's his priority ... but Chelsea are not giving up until the very end.

     How Arsenal beat Oxford 3-0 in FA Cup thanks to Elneny goal, Nketiah double
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal eased by Oxford United 3-0 in the third round of the FA Cup, overcoming a slow start to pull away in the final 30 minutes.
The League One side succeeded in stifling the attack of their Premier League opposition in the first half, as neither team recorded a shot on target.
Vieira provided another assist just seven minutes later, playing in Eddie Nketiah who coolly took the ball around Edward McGinty and slotted it into an empty net.
Arsenal advance to face Manchester City away in the fourth round later this month.
That match will come less than three weeks before the two Premier League title rivals meet in the league for the first time this season.

     Summary: (AFP via Getty Images)Mykhaylo Mudryk is more likely to compete for silverware at Chelsea instead of Arsenal, Stan Collymore has claimed.
Both Premier League clubs are in talks to land the Ukrainian winger from Shakhtar Donetsk, with a price tag of £85million placed on his services.
Despite the Gunners sitting pretty atop the Premier League, former striker Collymore thinks the long-term project at Stamford Bridge is “better”.
“And that may well be true, but for me, Chelsea is still the more attractive project.
If [Todd] Boehly can sell Chelsea’s future to Mudryk then that’s the more alluring option.
