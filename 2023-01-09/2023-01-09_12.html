    </h2>

     Summary: Naturally, the speculation begun.
While this could simply be two buddies consoling each other after a brutal end to another regular season, you had to wonder not only if this was the last time they played together, but both of their final games as Green Bay Packers.
Cobb's best years are clearly behind him, and while he is under contract for another year, could very well end up getting cut at 32 years old.

     Aaron Rodgers clarifies Jameson Williams jersey swap decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And in the process, the loss may also have put an end to Rodgers’ illustrious career.
But Aaron Rodgers says not so fast.
After Rodgers rejected Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams’ attempt at a jersey swap, saying that he “gotta hold on to” the jersey he was wearing, plenty thought that it meant that the 39-year old quarterback had already made retirement plans.
“I think I might have told him I’d give him a jersey when we played in Detroit, so I’ll probably have to send him a jersey,” Rodgers added.
He could still decide to retire or suit up for next season, regardless of the reasoning behind his decision not to swap jerseys with Williams.
