     Copenhagen's legendary Noma restaurant to close next year and reinvent itself as a 'giant lab'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) — Noma , one of the most feted restaurants in the world, is set to close its doors to diners next year.
The following year it will be reborn as a "giant lab," dubbed Noma 3.0.
Creator, chef and owner René Redzepi and his team have been working on Noma's new direction for the past two years.
Thibault Savary/AFP/Getty Images"Our goal is to create a lasting organization dedicated to groundbreaking work in food, but also to redefine the foundation for a restaurant team, a place where you can learn, you can take risks, and you can grow!"
The former restaurant will still welcome guests at the occasional pop-up or season, it said.

     Noma Is Closing for Good, Saying Fine Dining Is ‘Unsustainable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noma representatives responded to the allegations in The New York Times and Financial Times reporting.
As leaders in the culinary world, Redzepi and his team were perhaps best positioned to lead by example and create solutions for a better working environment.
“We have to completely rethink the industry,” he told The New York Times.
In its current form, haute cuisine relies heavily on an unsavory mix of unpaid labor and some level of intimidation.
It’s certainly not the last we’ll be hearing of Redzepi and his team, as they branch out into new-to-them territory.

     Noma, Renowned Restaurant Parodied in ‘The Menu,’ Is Closing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Renowned celebrity chef René Redzepi told the New York Times that his Copenhagen restaurant will close for regular service at the end of 2024.
Redzepi opened Noma in 2003 and already earned its first Michelin star by 2005.
In an interview with Thrillist, production designer Ethan Tobman cited Noma as an inspiration for the film’s fictional hyperlocal, hyperexpensive restaurant, Hawthorn.
“This is simply too hard, and we have to work in a different way.” Noma charges over $400 a seating before wine pairings, but it only began paying interns this past October.
Redzepi will maintain the Noma brand under his new Noma Projects operation, which will staff 60 to 70 full-time workers to develop and sell home-cooking items online.

     You Were Never Going to Go to Noma Anyway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You were probably never going to go to Noma.
All of this adds up to precious few being able to experience Noma, and that experience requires so much effort that I can’t help thinking that my personal energy would be better spent elsewhere.
At this point, you also don’t really have to go to Noma to experience Noma.
There are enough Noma alums — and alums of restaurants opened by Noma alums — that Noma is all around us.
Outside the cost and the schlep, Noma always seemed like it was built on the assumption of a diner’s reverence.
