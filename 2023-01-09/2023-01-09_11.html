     Summary: Despite Sunday’s last-second win, the Texans hold two top-10 draft picks, along with other treasure from years of tanking.
They have no issues with payroll or salary cap moving forward; they’re just largely bereft of impact football players.
(And have an owner who has done nothing to distinguish himself since inheriting the franchise from his daddy.)
It remains to be seen if McNair is willing to fire GM Nick Caserio to get a big fish such as Payton, and for prospective coaches, losing the first overall pick stings.
“But you can reset the franchise on Day One [of the draft] if you do it right,” the GM said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first team to sack its coach this season might also represent the most appealing opening, in part because of Wilks' inspired work with the interim tag.
Carolina's about-face also demonstrated the potential of the young talent on the roster after Christian McCaffrey was traded.
The lack of a premier starter under center is the one drawback of this job.
The biggest draw is the Panthers' location in what will likely be a wide-open NFC South.
Atlanta is rebuilding, New Orleans is in a terrible salary-cap spot and Tampa would have to replace Brady while likely also being in a tight salary-cap spot.
