     Arsenal beats Oxford 3-0, sets up FA Cup match with Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OXFORD, England (AP) — Arsenal set up a fourth-round match with English Premier League title rival Manchester City in the FA Cup by beating third-tier Oxford United 3-0 on Monday.
Arsenal will head to Etihad Stadium on the weekend of Jan. 28-29 for the match against City in the last 32 of the famous old competition.
City, the defending league champion, is in second place and trails Arsenal by five points approaching the halfway point of the season.
Advertising“We had to stay patient, we had to up the level as it wasn’t good enough from us in the first half and we did that in the second,” Nketiah said.
Arsenal avoided becoming the ninth Premier League team to be eliminated in the third round, after Everton, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Brentford, Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa were ousted over the last three days.

     Fans Stand on Top of Car to Watch Matt Turner, Arsenal Vs. Oxford in FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A group of fans in England would certainly say so.
During the Arsenal vs. Oxford United FA Cup fixture on Monday at the Kassam Stadium, some fans, taking the car seat phrase a bit too literal, caught the action by standing on top of a car overlooking the inside of the pitch.
USMNT goalie Matt Turner starred for Arsenal -- the current Premier League leaders -- in goal, and logged yet another clean sheet -- his fourth in five appearances.
The standing fans didn't have much to enjoy during the opening 45 minutes when the game stayed level at 0-0, but the Gunners eventually showed their class with three second-half goals to prevail 3-0.
Holding a capacity of over 53,000 with no view if standing on top of a car, the standing fans would need to get actual tickets this time around.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal eased by Oxford United 3-0 in the third round of the FA Cup, overcoming a slow start to pull away in the final 30 minutes.
The League One side succeeded in stifling the attack of their Premier League opposition in the first half, as neither team recorded a shot on target.
Vieira provided another assist just seven minutes later, playing in Eddie Nketiah who coolly took the ball around Edward McGinty and slotted it into an empty net.
Arsenal advance to face Manchester City away in the fourth round later this month.
That match will come less than three weeks before the two Premier League title rivals meet in the league for the first time this season.
