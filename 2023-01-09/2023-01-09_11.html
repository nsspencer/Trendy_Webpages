    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum already holds a number of Boston Celtics records at only 24 years old.
After back-to-back 3-pointers vs. the Chicago Bulls, Tatum passed the great John Havlicek (1,193 in 1971) for the most points scored by a Celtic in the first half of a season, according to C's radio voice Sean Grande.
Back to back 3's for Jayson Tatum and yet another milestone.
Tatum is on the verge of a fourth consecutive All-Star selection.
He's in the NBA MVP conversation as he entered Monday with a career-high 30.8 points per game on 47.2 percent shooting.

     Twitter Hypes Jayson Tatum for Dropping 32 in Celtics' Win over Zach LaVine, Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Babineau/NBAE via Getty ImagesBoston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum put forth another dominant performance to lead the team to victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night.
The 24-year-old dropped 32 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in the 107-99 win, much to the delight of fans at TD Garden.
Tatum's effort helped the Celtics outlast a late surge by Bulls star Zach LaVine, who scored 15 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter to keep things close.
Many believe he is among the favorites to win NBA MVP this year, and surviving a test against another All-Star player is further proof of why he deserves to be in that conversation.
Boston will be going for its fourth straight win when it hosts the New Orleans Pelicans (25-16) on Wednesday.

Boston’s third straight win over the Bulls did not come easy but it came in a fashion that excited Joe Mazzulla postgame.

     In Robert Williams’ first start of season, Celtics felt ‘back to normal’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics didn’t need a hot night from outside to hold off the Bulls, 107-99, partly because Mazzulla started Robert Williams for the first time all season.
Still, for the first time since Williams returned from a season-opening 29-game absence, the Celtics called on him in the starting frontcourt.
For various reasons, including limited playing time for Williams since his return, Boston only used the duo for 38 combined minutes over Williams’ first nine games this season.
That objective contributed to the length of time the team held out Williams at the beginning of the season.
Robert Williams won’t necessarily stay in the first unit once Smart returns but Mazzulla liked how Boston looked against Chicago.

     Summary: Celtics 7 takeaways from Celtics win over Bulls, as Robert Williams returns to starting lineup “He's kind of like that blanket.
We just kind of rely on him.” After nine games coming off the bench while he built strength following knee troubles, Robert Williams returned to the Celtics' starting lineup Monday.
The biggest news Monday was Robert Williams’ return to the starting lineup, with Marcus Smart sidelined with a knee contusion.
Jayson Tatum called for Robert Williams to start in his postgame comments following the Spurs game, and he was rewarded on Monday.
Robert Williams may catch him by the time the season is over, but Derrick White currently leads the Celtics in blocked shots.

     Summary: Celtics The Nets are surging but need to prove themselves against the Celtics Before Kevin Durant’s injury, Thursday’s showdown between the Atlantic Division rivals looked like a test balloon between contenders.
Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) dribbles against Boston Celtics guard Payton Pritchard (11) as Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon (13) watches during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2022, in New York.
Since Nov. 27, when the Nets’ run began following a loss to the Pacers, they have a net rating of +8.6, which is the best in the league.
Advertisement:Interestingly, the Nets – who were once considered the NBA’s newest super team – are now the ones with something to prove against the Celtics after last year’s sweep.
When 3-pointers are falling, can the Nets slow the Celtics’ offensive train before it picks up too much speed?
