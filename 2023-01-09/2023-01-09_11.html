     Streak of brutal weather continues in California with more storms this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The National Weather Service says California is in the middle of two major episodes of rain taking place "in quick succession" on Monday and Tuesday.
The first downpour hit the central California coast, which saw 3 to 5 inches of rain fall within 24 hours by Monday afternoon.
And Northern California will face a third batch of rain on Wednesday.
More than six feet of snow is expected to pile on the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California up until Wednesday — increasing the risk of avalanches.

     California storm: Mass evacuations as atmospheric river brings flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has brought with it widespread flash flooding, river flooding, mudslides and staggeringly high mountain snowfall totals.
By the numbers: The NWS issued flood watches Monday for over 34 million Californians — about 90% of the state's population.
Nearly all of California has received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average in the past several weeks, the National Weather Service noted in a forecast discussion.
While flooding, power outages and landslides threaten Californians in the near-term, these storms are boosting reservoir levels, severely depleted by the Southwest's megadrought.
These storms may contain damaging winds, hail and very heavy rainfall that could lead to more flooding.

     Several California counties ordered to evacuate as deadly storm weathers on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A series of deadly and destructive storms continued to hammer California on Monday, as the drought-stricken state grapples with the sudden onslaught of a very wet January.
The California department of water resources warned that more than a dozen places were at high risk of flooding.
In southern California, the entire community of Montecito were ordered to evacuate on Monday, amid a deluge of rain that has flooded roads and swollen waterways.
“We are in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms – and California is using every resource at its disposal to protect lives and limit damage,” he said.
He urged people to stay home and asked Biden to declare a federal emergency to support storm response and recovery efforts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FORT BRAGG, Calif. — One person is dead, a 5-year-old is missing and more than 7 million people in the Los Angeles area were under a flash flood warning Monday as a "parade of cyclones" slammed California.
In Southern California, a massive stretch of Southern California including Los Angeles, Malibu, El Monte and Santa Clarita were under a flash flooding warning until midnight, the National Weather Service said.
In Southern California, downtown Los Angeles recorded just over an inch of rain in the last 48 hours, according to the agency.
A second episode is expected Tuesday, resulting in slightly smaller amounts, but affecting areas farther south into Southern California, it said.
On Monday, seven people were rescued from a river in Ventura County, a county fire department spokesperson said.

     Summary: Continued heavy rains have California concerned about rivers that face high flood risk.
AdvertisementMajor flooding was reported Monday along the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz County.
DWR director Karla Nemeth said the storm system was “extraordinary” and “another climate signal” of California’s worsening swings between extreme conditions.
Five of the six weirs in the DWR’s Sacramento River Flood Control Project have passively opened after being triggered by overtopped systems.
Early Monday, evacuations were underway and major flooding was reported in Felton Grove and Paradise Park after the San Lorenzo River rose over its banks and flowed into the surrounding community.

     Summary: The boy has not been declared dead, said spokesperson Tony Cipolla of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office.
The rescue team will "re-evaluate the weather conditions to see when they can resume the search," Cipolla added.
A firefighter discovered one of the boy's shoes, but crews still had not found the child more than five hours later.
The storms won't be enough to officially end California's drought, but they have helped.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, expects a break in the rain after Jan. 18.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heavy rain fueled by an atmospheric river in Santa Cruz County, Calif., raised the San Lorenzo River on Jan. 9, flooding homes and roads.
Neighbors were able to rescue the mother, but the boy was pulled downstream towards the Salinas River, he said.
This includes rapid water rises, mudslides, and the potential for major river flooding,” the Weather Service warned Monday.
“All of this rain on top of last week’s rain will produce responses on the area’s major rivers,” the Weather Service wrote.
An atmospheric river soaked Northern and Central California on New Year’s Eve, knocking out power and stranding some people in flooded cars.
