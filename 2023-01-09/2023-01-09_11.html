     Summary: Andrew Tate's Twitter account shared a story about him or his brother being hospitalized.
"The Matrix has attacked me," the tweet reads, perpetuating conspiracies around Tate's arrest.
Though the account suggested Tate had been "attacked," Romanian media suggested a more mundane reality.
Tate's account has repeatedly referred to the "Matrix" movies while posting vague assertions that the investigation is a conspiracy against him.
Authorities have seized several of Tate and his brother's cars and properties while the investigation is ongoing.

The message also included a caption ostensibly from Tate reading, "The Matrix has attacked me.
However, no definitive answer has come out of the speculation and Tate remains in the detention center of Capitol Police after the possible medical visit.

     Andrew Tate sends cryptic "Matrix" tweet after 'being rushed to hospital' from jail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Tate has sent a cryptic tweet about an attack from "The Matrix" after being rushed to hospital amid his 30-day spell in a Romanian jail.
The four-time kickboxing world champion was arrested last month in connection with an investigation into alleged human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.
Both he and his brother Tristan, 34, were detained for 24 hours before a judge granted police a further 30 days to detain them in a detention centre.
Both Andrew and Tristan Tate were arrested in connection with allegedly forming an organised crime group which used girls in adult videos.
Days before his arrest, Andrew Tate found himself in a Twitter spat with climate activist Greta Thunberg when he bragged about the "massive emissions" from his Bugatti.

     Andrew Tate's Hospital Visit Sparks Conflicting Reports About His Health
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Tate became the subject of conflicting reports over the weekend, after it was reported that he had briefly visited a hospital following his arrest.
Romanian prosecutors allege the Tate brothers coerced six women into producing pornography, with the alleged victims facing "acts of physical violence and mental coercion."
Part of the text of the article, which was shown in the tweet in a screenshot, stated one of the Tate brothers "ended up in hospital" following their arrest.
"The attorney for the Tate brothers notified the central detention center and stated that he had certain medical problems," the quote continued.
Tate has not ‘seen a heart specialist in Paris regularly.’ Not sure where you got that one from.
