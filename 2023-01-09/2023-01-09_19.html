     Streak of brutal weather continues in California with more storms this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The National Weather Service says California is in the middle of two major episodes of rain taking place "in quick succession" on Monday and Tuesday.
The first downpour hit the central California coast, which saw 3 to 5 inches of rain fall within 24 hours by Monday afternoon.
And Northern California will face a third batch of rain on Wednesday.
More than six feet of snow is expected to pile on the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California up until Wednesday — increasing the risk of avalanches.

     California storm: Mass evacuations as atmospheric river brings flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has brought with it widespread flash flooding, river flooding, mudslides and staggeringly high mountain snowfall totals.
By the numbers: The NWS issued flood watches Monday for over 34 million Californians — about 90% of the state's population.
Nearly all of California has received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average in the past several weeks, the National Weather Service noted in a forecast discussion.
While flooding, power outages and landslides threaten Californians in the near-term, these storms are boosting reservoir levels, severely depleted by the Southwest's megadrought.
These storms may contain damaging winds, hail and very heavy rainfall that could lead to more flooding.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A series of deadly and destructive storms continued to hammer California on Monday, as the drought-stricken state grapples with the sudden onslaught of a very wet January.
The California department of water resources warned that more than a dozen places were at high risk of flooding.
In southern California, the entire community of Montecito were ordered to evacuate on Monday, amid a deluge of rain that has flooded roads and swollen waterways.
“We are in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms – and California is using every resource at its disposal to protect lives and limit damage,” he said.
He urged people to stay home and asked Biden to declare a federal emergency to support storm response and recovery efforts.

     Summary: TRACK THE STORMS“Expect widespread power outages, downed trees and difficult driving conditions,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento tweeted.
This includes rapid water rises, mudslides, and the potential for major river flooding,” the National Weather Service said Monday.
The moisture is expected to sink southward Monday night, making flooding “increasing likely” over the Southern California coastal ranges Tuesday, the weather service said.
“Valley areas will likely see gusts as high as 45-50 mph, with gusts greater than 60 mph possible in wind prone areas,” the National Weather Service in Reno said.
As the storm pushes inland, more than 5 feet of snow could fall along the Sierra Crest west of Lake Tahoe, the weather service said.
