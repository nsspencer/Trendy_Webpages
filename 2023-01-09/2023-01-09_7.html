     Broncos request interview with Dan Quinn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports that the team has requested an interview with Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn.
Quinn interviewed with the Broncos last year before Denver hired Nathaniel Hackett, who was fired after 15 games on the job.
Quinn interviewed with several other teams as well, but wound up returning for a second season running the defense in Dallas.
The Broncos are also expected to interview their defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh.
They’ve also spoken with former Saints head coach Sean Payton, but have to wait to formally interview him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos wrapped up the 2022 season on Sunday with a 5-12 record, marking the second-straight year the team has finished in last place in the AFC West and the seventh-straight year Denver has missed the playoffs.
After a sixth-straight losing season, the Broncos plan to make big changes this offseason, most notably by bringing in a new head coach.
Before we completely turn our attention toward the future, though, we’re taking a quick look back at the 2022 season.
There were a few bright spots, but it was mostly a forgettable year for Denver.
Here are ten takeaways from the Broncos’ season.

     Denver Broncos' Expected Timeline to Hire a New Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos fired Nathaniel Hackett on December 26, which gave the team the option for a slight head start on the coaching search.
The Broncos have done what every team looking at hiring a new head coach has done — they started putting together their list of candidates to interview.
However, with the lack of interviews and having to abide by specific rules regarding interviews, fans want to know what the Broncos' timeline for hiring a new head coach is.
The timeline was set the first week after Denver fired Vic Fangio on January 9.
The timeline can't be strictly narrowed down without knowing the candidates the Broncos want to interview.

     Broncos QB Russell Wilson after 5-12 season: 'I fell short'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Wilson ends a tumultuous first season in Denver on a high note with a trio of touchdown passes in the Broncos' win over the Chargers.
(1:08)DENVER -- Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson closed out what he called a “really humbling year’’ Sunday with one of his best efforts of a lost season and a promise to fix what went wrong.
Wilson said his 2023 season will start “[Monday] morning.’’The Broncos finished 5-12 -- 2010 was the franchise's only other 12-loss season -- with a 31-28 victory over the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers in Empower Field at Mile High.
When Wilson was asked Sunday about how he often did not look like a nine-time Pro Bowler, Wilson responded:“I asked myself that same question, where’s he at?’’Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson (3) runs the ball in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers.
“That whole (fixing) narrative … What you saw out there is Russell Wilson is Russell Wilson, he’s a Hall of Fame, NFL quarterback,’’ Rosburg said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos won their final game of the season on Sunday, defeating their division rivals the Los Angeles Chargers 31-28.
Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson completed 13-of-24 passes for 283 and three touchdowns, which ties his season high.
Since this is the last game of the season, this will be the last Twitter reaction post of the 2022 campaign due to the Broncos being eliminated from the playoffs.
However, since the Broncos brought home the win, it may be a more positive outlook.
Let’s take a dive in to conclude the 2022 season.

     'We are going to turn this thing around': Russell Wilson surges late as Broncos look ahead to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Denver aims to end its seven-year playoff drought, both of those elements should boost the Broncos' chances in 2023.
The Broncos, though, will also need to improve at the game's most important position — and quarterback Russell Wilson is dedicated to making that happen.
That is what I came here to do: to help the Denver Broncos win.
Then, in Sunday's win, Wilson posted his second game this season with three passing touchdowns and completed three passes of at least 50 yards.
As Wilson and the Broncos head into a new season, though, they likely both hope that a new year can bring familiar results for Wilson.

Broncos Wire has published a list of 20 potential head coach candidates for the team, but Denver’s interview list will likely be shorter.
“A coach with a winning attitude, a coach that makes everybody around him better,” Surtain said on Sunday when asked what kind of coach he wants the team to hire.
Whoever becomes the team’s next head coach will have to make decisions on the rest of Hackett’s holdover coaching staff.
