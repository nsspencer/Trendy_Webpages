    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that the Lovie Smith era is over for the Houston Texans, most people are expecting the Davis Mills era to end as well.
It’s noticeable that one teammate not pictured is Davis Mills.
Davis Mills is not on the Texans 2023 Season Ticket add!
It is of course possible that the Houston Texans just don’t think Mills is “marketable” heading into the 2022 offseason.
The season ticket renewal pic is just confirmation that the Davis Mills era for the Houston Texans is officially over.

     3 reasons why the Houston Texans had to fire Lovie Smith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday evening.
Despite the fact the Texans finished 3-13-1 with a 32-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and posted a 2-3 record in their final five games, including tight matchups with the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, Houston decided to move in another direction.
The coaching move will commence the third consecutive offseason in the Nick Caserio era that the Texans will conduct a coaching search.
Last offseason the Texans settled on promoting Smith from defensive coordinator to coach after a month-long search.
Here are three reasons why the Texans had to move on from Smith.

     Summary: In the wake of the Lovie Smith firing, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith said Black coaches should avoid working for the Texans.
Stephen A. Smith called out the Houston Texans after firing coach Lovie Smith for their treatment of Black coaches.
The controversial ESPN personality made his remarks on Monday’s episode of “First Take,” adding that Black coaches should avoid the Texans.
You should hope beyond God that the Houston Texans never call you – not as long as [general manager Nick Caserio] is in there.
“Caserio shouldn’t have his job,” Smith said.

     Summary: In Week 15, the Texans led the Kansas City Chiefs with five minutes remaining in regulation.
Then, in Week 16, the Texans tossed Malik Willis into a sinkhole, from which we may never escape, for a surprising win.
AdvertisementRather than risk overtime and another tie against the Colts, lame duck coach Lovie Smith went for two and the win.
AdvertisementIf anything, Lovie Smith should be chief emeritus of the offseason.
We have Lovie Smith to thank for the ensuing offseason speculation.

     Summary: The Houston Texans are a joke.
Nobody should be more angry than Texans fans, who have been forced to watch McNair’s nepotism flush this team down the toilet.
Make no mistake: The Texans will find a coach, because coaching in the NFL is still the greatest prize for any football coach.
No team is in need of a new owner more than the Texans.
Texans fans deserve better — but sadly that isn’t going to happen.

It also means that for the Texans, the cycle of football rebirth has been renewed beginning with the official release of the Texans 2023-24 schedule.
It’s of course not a full schedule, we won’t know WHEN they play these teams until May.
Speaking as someone for whom almost all Texans games are away games, this is a pretty dire list of travel destinations.
And depending on when the Saints/Texans game is, that will probably be my travel game.
