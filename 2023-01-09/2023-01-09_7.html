    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that the Lovie Smith era is over for the Houston Texans, most people are expecting the Davis Mills era to end as well.
It’s noticeable that one teammate not pictured is Davis Mills.
Davis Mills is not on the Texans 2023 Season Ticket add!
It is of course possible that the Houston Texans just don’t think Mills is “marketable” heading into the 2022 offseason.
The season ticket renewal pic is just confirmation that the Davis Mills era for the Houston Texans is officially over.

     Stephen A. Smith Calls Out Texans For Treatment of Black Coaches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the wake of the Lovie Smith firing, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith said Black coaches should avoid working for the Texans.
Stephen A. Smith called out the Houston Texans after firing coach Lovie Smith for their treatment of Black coaches.
The controversial ESPN personality made his remarks on Monday’s episode of “First Take,” adding that Black coaches should avoid the Texans.
You should hope beyond God that the Houston Texans never call you – not as long as [general manager Nick Caserio] is in there.
“Caserio shouldn’t have his job,” Smith said.

     3 reasons why the Houston Texans had to fire Lovie Smith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Houston Texans fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday evening.
Despite the fact the Texans finished 3-13-1 with a 32-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and posted a 2-3 record in their final five games, including tight matchups with the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, Houston decided to move in another direction.
The coaching move will commence the third consecutive offseason in the Nick Caserio era that the Texans will conduct a coaching search.
Last offseason the Texans settled on promoting Smith from defensive coordinator to coach after a month-long search.
Here are three reasons why the Texans had to move on from Smith.

     Summary: How many 2023 NFL Draft picks will the Texans be working with as they seek to kick-start their rebuild?
As of now, the Texans have 12 draft selections in the 2023 NFL Draft — almost twice the standard amount of picks.

     With the NFL’s Houston Texans, Black coaches have had no chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black NFL coaches who aspire to reach the top of their field should beware of Houston Texans officials bearing gifts.
In Houston, Black head coaches have about as much of a chance of enjoying longevity as any secondary Black character in a war movie: From the opening scene, it’s clear who’s going down first.
Of course, when it comes to Black coaches in the NFL, that’s common refrain among Black NFL employees.
In the previous 37 openings for NFL head coaches, only five Black men were hired to fill positions.
Compared with their white counterparts, Black NFL coaches receive few opportunities to lead teams.

     Summary: The Houston Texans are a joke.
Nobody should be more angry than Texans fans, who have been forced to watch McNair’s nepotism flush this team down the toilet.
Make no mistake: The Texans will find a coach, because coaching in the NFL is still the greatest prize for any football coach.
No team is in need of a new owner more than the Texans.
Texans fans deserve better — but sadly that isn’t going to happen.
