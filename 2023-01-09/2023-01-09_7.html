     LSU Gymnast Olivia Dunne Asks Fans for Respect After Disruptive Group at Utah Meet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alex Goodlett/Getty ImagesLSU gymnast Olivia Dunne has become one of the NCAA's most popular athletes, but she was forced to speak out after seeing rowdy fans at a meet against Utah on Friday in Salt Lake City.
The comment comes after fans chanted wildly at Dunne during the meet, holding signs and yelling while other athletes were competing.
Olympic silver medalist and color commentator Samantha Peszek provided a view of the fans outside the arena:According to Josh Furlong of KSL, LSU had to move its team bus to avoid the crowd.
Heisman Trophy winners Bryce Young and Caleb Williams are the only NCAA athletes with a higher valuation, per On3.
The attention has helped bring extra fans to a high-profile gymnastics meet, although Dunne didn't even compete as No.
