     Denver Broncos' Expected Timeline to Hire a New Head Coach

     Summary: The Denver Broncos fired Nathaniel Hackett on December 26, which gave the team the option for a slight head start on the coaching search.
The Broncos have done what every team looking at hiring a new head coach has done — they started putting together their list of candidates to interview.
However, with the lack of interviews and having to abide by specific rules regarding interviews, fans want to know what the Broncos' timeline for hiring a new head coach is.
The timeline was set the first week after Denver fired Vic Fangio on January 9.
The timeline can't be strictly narrowed down without knowing the candidates the Broncos want to interview.

     Summary: Don’t be afraid of pounding the rock into the line, time and again, until the dam breaks.
Above all, don’t be afraid to take the ball OUT of Russell Wilson’s hands.
The Broncos were 4-0 when they ran the ball 30 times or more; Denver went 1-12 when it didn’t.
Namely, that the Broncos looked better when Wilson, their $245 million quarterback, acted as a complementary piece, a bonus, instead of as the focal point of the attack.
In three Broncos starts that featured 30 or more rush attempts, Wilson sported a passer rating of 87.55 and a TD-to-interception ratio of 4-to-1.

     Summary: Russell Wilson ends a tumultuous first season in Denver on a high note with a trio of touchdown passes in the Broncos' win over the Chargers.
(1:08)DENVER -- Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson closed out what he called a “really humbling year’’ Sunday with one of his best efforts of a lost season and a promise to fix what went wrong.
Wilson said his 2023 season will start “[Monday] morning.’’The Broncos finished 5-12 -- 2010 was the franchise's only other 12-loss season -- with a 31-28 victory over the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers in Empower Field at Mile High.
When Wilson was asked Sunday about how he often did not look like a nine-time Pro Bowler, Wilson responded:“I asked myself that same question, where’s he at?’’Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson (3) runs the ball in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers.
“That whole (fixing) narrative … What you saw out there is Russell Wilson is Russell Wilson, he’s a Hall of Fame, NFL quarterback,’’ Rosburg said.

     'We are going to turn this thing around': Russell Wilson surges late as Broncos look ahead to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Denver aims to end its seven-year playoff drought, both of those elements should boost the Broncos' chances in 2023.
The Broncos, though, will also need to improve at the game's most important position — and quarterback Russell Wilson is dedicated to making that happen.
That is what I came here to do: to help the Denver Broncos win.
Then, in Sunday's win, Wilson posted his second game this season with three passing touchdowns and completed three passes of at least 50 yards.
As Wilson and the Broncos head into a new season, though, they likely both hope that a new year can bring familiar results for Wilson.

A coach that's not going to play around.
