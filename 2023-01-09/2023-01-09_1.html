     Summary: 0 of 5AP Photo/Ashley LandisGeorgia head coach Kirby Smart noted before the game that his team wanted to "hunt."
After failing to win a single national championship since 1980, the Georgia Bulldogs have now won back-to-back titles and finished a spotless 15-0 season in style, thrashing TCU 65-7.
In a prime-time, season-opening win over Oregon, Georgia scored touchdowns on its first seven possessions.
The league has now won its fourth consecutive national championship and the 14th in the past 20 seasons.
"We had things go about as bad as they could go in the first half," said TCU coach Sonny Dykes, noting his team was "wide-eyed" early.

     Summary: Georgia Bulldogs repeat as college football's national champion, thrashing TCUEnlarge this image toggle caption Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ronald Martinez/Getty ImagesThe University of Georgia Bulldogs showed why they're the best team in college football — again.
With an unrelenting and dominant performance in the national championship game, Georgia swamped Texas Christian University 65-7 to finish undefeated and repeat as national champions.
Georgia responded right away with a 37-yard Bennett touchdown pass to extend the lead to 17-7.
The Bulldog defense stopped TCU on its next series and then marched 92-yards for another Stetson Bennett rushing touchdown for a 24-7 Georgia lead in the second quarter.
Led by Bennett (a former walk-on QB), Georgia overwhelmed the Southeastern Conference — the best conference in college football.

     Summary: 1 Georgia Bulldogs scored on their first six drives and dominated No.
3 Texas Christian University 65-7 to win their second consecutive College Football Playoff championship game on Monday night in Inglewood, California.
I’m just trying to see everybody for the last time, you know, hug everybody.”Bennett picked up his second championship game offensive most valuable player award, and his six total touchdowns tied the championship game era record set by Joe Burrow with Louisiana State University in 2020.
The 58-point margin of victory was the largest since college football instituted an official championship game in the 1998 season, and Georgia’s 65 points are the most scored in a championship game.
Congrats to the Dawgs on a hard-fought National Championship – and to @TCUFootball for beating the odds all season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the catch, Davis was able to atone for his fumble the series prior that led to a Georgia field goal.
The Horned Frogs would cap off that 75-yard drive -- their best of the night -- and make it a 10-7 game.
But Georgia just relentlessly attacked early and often, refusing to let TCU get fully off the mat.
What helped was that Georgia's defense dominated TCU early in a way it could not against LSU in the SEC Championship Game or versus Ohio State in the Peach Bowl.
It was a shockingly poor night for Duggan, but also for TCU receiver Quentin Johnston.
