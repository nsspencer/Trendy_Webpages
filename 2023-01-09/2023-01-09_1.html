     Georgia Reaps Rewards of Big Football Recruiting Spend: Data Viz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart initially cited “culture” and “hard work” in a press conference on Sunday, when he was asked how his program has managed to maintain excellence.
For three straight years prior to the pandemic, Georgia was the most extravagant spender in the football recruiting category, allocating a total of $9.04 million during that timespan.
Alabama and Georgia took big jumps in the recruiting power rankings in the years directly following the hirings of Saban and Smart, respectively.
“There's some doors open to us now, because of this success, that have been closed for a long time,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said in a press conference.
I mean, are we really doing this?”A second Georgia national championship could encourage even more schools to increase their recruiting spending in order to keep up.
