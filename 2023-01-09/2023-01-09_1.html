     Netflix axes Inside Job after one season and fans aren't happy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The creator of this TV show, Shion Takeuchi, confirmed as much via Twitter (opens in new tab), saying "I'm heartbroken to confirm that Netflix has decided to cancel season 2 of Inside Job."
Despite the huge amount of adult animated TV shows on Netflix, Inside Job was particularly well-received, and at the time of writing it has an 89% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes as well as a 79% critics' score.
I’m sorry guys, it’s true.💔#insidejob pic.twitter.com/MQZJ3S7gRDJanuary 9, 2023 See moreGiven those numbers, it's no surprise to hear that Inside Job fans aren't exactly pleased with this decision.
A rough 2022 saw many hit shows canceled, with Warrior Nun, Archive 81, Fate: The Winx Saga and The Midnight Club being just four of many, many shows canceled in the year.
So will Inside Job fans ever get to see more from Reagen Ridley and Brett Hand, the show's two main characters?
