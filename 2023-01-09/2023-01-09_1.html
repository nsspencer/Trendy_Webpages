     Summary: Georgia Bulldogs repeat as college football's national champion, thrashing TCUEnlarge this image toggle caption Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ronald Martinez/Getty ImagesThe University of Georgia Bulldogs showed why they're the best team in college football — again.
With an unrelenting and dominant performance in the national championship game, Georgia swamped Texas Christian University 65-7 to finish undefeated and repeat as national champions.
Georgia responded right away with a 37-yard Bennett touchdown pass to extend the lead to 17-7.
The Bulldog defense stopped TCU on its next series and then marched 92-yards for another Stetson Bennett rushing touchdown for a 24-7 Georgia lead in the second quarter.
Led by Bennett (a former walk-on QB), Georgia overwhelmed the Southeastern Conference — the best conference in college football.

(2:20)Georgia's journey to becoming top dogs once again (2:20)Fresh off winning back-to-back national championships, the Georgia Bulldogs are the overall betting favorites at +375 to win next season's College Football Playoff.
They're going to lose [Stetson] Bennett, but Bama is going to lose [Bryce] Young," Caesars Sportsbook lead college football trader Joey Feazel told ESPN.
TCU lost to Georgia 65-7 in Monday's CFP title game, falling short of capping off an incredible underdog story.
"But college football championship winners have usually come from teams priced on the lower end of the spectrum."

     Summary: The national championship trophy ceremony was still a couple of hours away Monday at SoFi Stadium, but by then it already had become clear: Georgia remained on top of college football.
:Kirby Smart's son was 'bawling' after Georgia won national championship.
Sure Beats Playing Georgia.”When Georgia beat Alabama in the national championship last season, it felt like a snapshot rather than a reordering of the sport’s long-term power dynamic.
Order would be restored this season, or so I thought, after those 2021 Georgia Bulldogs served up 15 NFL Draft picks.
The list of coaches who possess one national championship includes the likes of Gene Chizik and Ed Orgeron.

     Summary: College football’s national championship game on Monday was over minutes after it started.
Georgia got one minor scare in the regular season against Missouri, then got a terror against Ohio State in the Peach Bowl semifinal of the College Football Playoff.
Their newfound inevitability will last as long as Smart, 47, remains interested in coaching college football.
Inevitability means being Goliath and only losing the occasional Playoff game to other, slightly smaller Goliaths, like Alabama and Ohio State.
