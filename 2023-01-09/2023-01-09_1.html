     Georgia football: Stetson Bennett enters Vince Young territory vs TCU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Rexwell Villas · 2 min readThe Georgia Bulldogs put on a masterclass on both ends of the field in the first half of their College Football Playoff National Championship Game showdown against the TCU Horned Frogs, thanks in large part to the wheels of Georgia football quarterback Stetson Bennett.
The Georgia football star kicked off the scoring with a 21-yard rushing score in the first quarter, which capped a smooth five-play drive for the Bulldogs.
Bennett would score yet another touchdown on the ground in the second quarter to stretch the Bulldogs’ lead to 17 points.
Stetson Bennett had a direct hand in four Georgia football touchdowns in the first half against TCU.
But Georgia football isn’t just having success when Bennett is on the field.

     Georgia Reaps Rewards of Big Football Recruiting Spend: Data Viz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart initially cited “culture” and “hard work” in a press conference on Sunday, when he was asked how his program has managed to maintain excellence.
For three straight years prior to the pandemic, Georgia was the most extravagant spender in the football recruiting category, allocating a total of $9.04 million during that timespan.
Alabama and Georgia took big jumps in the recruiting power rankings in the years directly following the hirings of Saban and Smart, respectively.
“There's some doors open to us now, because of this success, that have been closed for a long time,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said in a press conference.
I mean, are we really doing this?”A second Georgia national championship could encourage even more schools to increase their recruiting spending in order to keep up.
