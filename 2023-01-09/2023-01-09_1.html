     2023 NFL Draft: Seahawks to have No. 5 overall pick thanks to Russell Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The offseason trade with the Denver Broncos has officially netted Seattle a top-five draft pick.
SEATTLE — First, the Seahawks have a playoff game to worry about, but the team also has officially secured a top-five draft pick thanks to its former franchise quarterback.
5 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, after the Denver Broncos finished the season with a 5-12 record after making a blockbuster trade for Russell Wilson with the Seahawks in March.
3 overall, but the Broncos decided to close out their miserable campaign with a surprise victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.
Not only will John Schneider have that fifth overall pick, but Seattle also still has its own first-round pick, which won't have a designated spot in the order until the Seahawks are eliminated from the playoffs.

     Rams PFF grades: Best and worst performers vs. Seahawks in Week 18
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams finished the season with yet another terrible outing on offense, scoring just 16 points in an overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday afternoon.
Pro Football Focus graded the Rams offense very poorly, with the top player failing to score higher than even 75.0 overall.
The defense had some much better performances, led by Jalen Ramsey and Taylor Rapp.
Leonard Floyd’s grade was shockingly low, however, considering he had five pressures and a sack in the loss.
Here’s a look at the best and worst performers from Sunday’s season finale.

The Seahawks later traded the fifth-round pick from the Broncos and used two resulting picks to select outside linebacker Tyreke Smith and wide receiver Dareke Young.
The Broncos used the fourth-round pick from Seattle to select defensive lineman Eyioma Uwazurike.
With the 2022 regular season now over, we know the 2023 first-round pick the Broncos traded will be fifth overall.
So Denver will have a first-round pick this spring — unless they use it to acquire coach Sean Payton from the New Orleans Saints.

2) They cleaned up on a rookie draft class that undoubtedly helped launch them into the playoffs.

This was a long way from a perfect regular season for the Seahawks.
But they’ve been all hits lately — and given the circumstances, they just delivered a regular season for the ages.

RENTON, Wash. - At the NFL level, separation between elite players and good players boils down the smallest of details.

Sure enough, Lockett and his coaches as well as teammates got their cake and were able to eat it too.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday he does not believe the two previous games this season will have any bearing on what happens this weekend.
“I don’t really look at it as you have beat someone three times,” Shanahan said on a conference call with reporters.
It all comes down to this.”The 49ers beat the Rams last season by scores of 31-10 and 27-24 in overtime.
This season, the 49ers registered a 27-7 victory over the Seahawks in Week 2 at Levi’s Stadium.

     Summary: — Brady Henderson (@BradyHenderson) January 9, 2023But what this doesn’t account for is the fact that the Seattle Seahawks have never lost to the 49ers in the postseason.
You might recall that game, because it went a little something like this:"The Tip" by Richard Sherman is one of the best Seahawks moments in history.
Just like that team, this iteration of the Seahawks has to take on a heavily favored team in the playoffs.
But rookie QBs can be volatile, and they don’t have a track record of success in the postseason.
The 49ers are probably more confident than that Seahawks squad, since they are riding a winning streak into the postseason.

Jeyarajah: "Georgia is going to win the battle against TCU's offensive line; the talent and depth is simply too overwhelming.
One, James' insistence that the Lakers trade for Westbrook in the first place removed most of their remaining flexibility.
Still, if the Lakers sit on their proverbial hands through the trade deadline, all eyes will be on James' response.
