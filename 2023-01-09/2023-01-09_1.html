     Stetson Bennett sets tone early with stunning feat vs. TCU in National Championship Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Rexwell Villas · 2 min readAlmost like clockwork, the Georgia Bulldogs started the scoring in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, with Georgia football engineering a five-play drive that was capped by a Stetson Bennett 21-yard rushing touchdown to put the defending champions ahead early against the TCU Horned Frogs.
Stetson Bennett’s 21-yard TD is the 2nd-longest Rush TD by a QB in a national championship game in the CFP/BCS era (since 1998).
Georgia football has a balanced offense and defense, and they have not wasted much time in flexing their muscles on both ends of the field against an upset-seeking TCU squad.
The Horned Frogs responded to that Bennett rushing TD right away with a quarterback rushing score of its own, with Max Duggan finding the end zone on a much shorter 2-yard rush.
Georgia football is seeking its second straight National Championship Game win in the College Football Playoff era.

     Georgia Reaps Rewards of Big Football Recruiting Spend: Data Viz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart initially cited “culture” and “hard work” in a press conference on Sunday, when he was asked how his program has managed to maintain excellence.
For three straight years prior to the pandemic, Georgia was the most extravagant spender in the football recruiting category, allocating a total of $9.04 million during that timespan.
Alabama and Georgia took big jumps in the recruiting power rankings in the years directly following the hirings of Saban and Smart, respectively.
“There's some doors open to us now, because of this success, that have been closed for a long time,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said in a press conference.
I mean, are we really doing this?”A second Georgia national championship could encourage even more schools to increase their recruiting spending in order to keep up.
