     Summary: Georgia Bulldogs repeat as college football's national champion, thrashing TCUEnlarge this image toggle caption Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ronald Martinez/Getty ImagesThe University of Georgia Bulldogs showed why they're the best team in college football — again.
With an unrelenting and dominant performance in the national championship game, Georgia swamped Texas Christian University 65-7 to finish undefeated and repeat as national champions.
Georgia responded right away with a 37-yard Bennett touchdown pass to extend the lead to 17-7.
The Bulldog defense stopped TCU on its next series and then marched 92-yards for another Stetson Bennett rushing touchdown for a 24-7 Georgia lead in the second quarter.
Led by Bennett (a former walk-on QB), Georgia overwhelmed the Southeastern Conference — the best conference in college football.

     Summary: Rece Davis chronicles how Georgia established itself as the standard bearer in college football after winning back-to-back championships.
(2:20)Georgia's journey to becoming top dogs once again (2:20)Fresh off winning back-to-back national championships, the Georgia Bulldogs are the overall betting favorites at +375 to win next season's College Football Playoff.
They're going to lose [Stetson] Bennett, but Bama is going to lose [Bryce] Young," Caesars Sportsbook lead college football trader Joey Feazel told ESPN.
TCU lost to Georgia 65-7 in Monday's CFP title game, falling short of capping off an incredible underdog story.
"But college football championship winners have usually come from teams priced on the lower end of the spectrum."
