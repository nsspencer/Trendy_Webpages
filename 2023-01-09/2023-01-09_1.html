     Georgia football: Stetson Bennett enters Vince Young territory vs TCU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Rexwell Villas · 2 min readThe Georgia Bulldogs put on a masterclass on both ends of the field in the first half of their College Football Playoff National Championship Game showdown against the TCU Horned Frogs, thanks in large part to the wheels of Georgia football quarterback Stetson Bennett.
The Georgia football star kicked off the scoring with a 21-yard rushing score in the first quarter, which capped a smooth five-play drive for the Bulldogs.
Bennett would score yet another touchdown on the ground in the second quarter to stretch the Bulldogs’ lead to 17 points.
Stetson Bennett had a direct hand in four Georgia football touchdowns in the first half against TCU.
But Georgia football isn’t just having success when Bennett is on the field.
