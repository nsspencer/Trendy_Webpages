     Cardinals fire Kliff Kingsbury; GM Steve Keim steps aside
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals have fired head coach Kliff Kingsbury 10 months after signing him to a contract extension through the 2027 season.
Like Kingsbury, Keim signed an extension in 2022 that took his contract through the 2027 season.
Back-to-back late-season collapses in 2020 and 2021 overshadowed whatever success the Cardinals had built under Kingsbury, but it was also a trend.
Dating back to his time at Texas Tech, Kingsbury's teams had been successful early in seasons only to trend downward in the second half.
Through 2021, Kingsbury's teams went 42-20-1 in the first seven games and 17-44 after.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We have announced that head coach Kliff Kingsbury has been relieved of his duties," the team said in a statement.
Kingsbury went 28-37-1 in four seasons in the desert with a dismal 4-13 record in 2022.
Arizona improved by three wins each season under Kingsbury, going from 5-10-1 in 2019 to 8-8 in 2020 to 11-6 in 2021.
A tumultuous campaign, starting with DeAndre Hopkins' suspension and highlighted by several injuries, including losing Murray to an ACL tear, saw the offense struggle mightily.
Now the Cardinals will look for a breath of fresh air with a new head coach and GM.

     Kliff Kingsbury fired as Arizona Cardinals head coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals fired head coach Kliff Kingsbury on Monday after a 4-13 season, his fourth on the job.
Kingsbury, hired when he was 39 years old, had gone 35-40 as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders from 2013-18 before he was fired.
After hiring Kingsbury, Arizona drafted quarterback Kyler Murray first overall to quarterback the offense and traded 2018 first-round pick Josh Rosen.
The team paired the new NFL head coach with experienced defensive coordinator Vance Joseph.
Kingsbury coached Case Keenum (Houston), Johnny Manziel (Texas A&amp;M), Davis Webb (Texas Tech) and Mahomes (Texas Tech).
