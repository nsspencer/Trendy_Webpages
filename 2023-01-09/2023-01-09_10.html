     What Celtics said of Robert Williams’ 1st start of season: ‘Rob is phenomenal’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — With each passing game Robert Williams III suited up for the Celtics after knee surgery, he showed off his undeniable impact even in limited minutes.
Boston was one of the best teams in the league last season partly because Williams transformed the C’s defensively.
“Obviously Smart wasn’t there, but Rob looked great.
The five-man group of Tatum, Smart, Williams, Al Horford and Jaylen Brown was a force defensively.
The starters already have the built-in chemistry from this season, but Williams still needs to fold into a new system under a new coach.

     Summary: Celtics The Nets are surging but need to prove themselves against the Celtics Before Kevin Durant’s injury, Thursday’s showdown between the Atlantic Division rivals looked like a test balloon between contenders.
Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) dribbles against Boston Celtics guard Payton Pritchard (11) as Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon (13) watches during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2022, in New York.
Since Nov. 27, when the Nets’ run began following a loss to the Pacers, they have a net rating of +8.6, which is the best in the league.
Advertisement:Interestingly, the Nets – who were once considered the NBA’s newest super team – are now the ones with something to prove against the Celtics after last year’s sweep.
When 3-pointers are falling, can the Nets slow the Celtics’ offensive train before it picks up too much speed?

     Summary: Celtics 7 takeaways from Celtics win over Bulls, as Robert Williams returns to starting lineup “He's kind of like that blanket.
We just kind of rely on him.” After nine games coming off the bench while he built strength following knee troubles, Robert Williams returned to the Celtics' starting lineup Monday.
The biggest news Monday was Robert Williams’ return to the starting lineup, with Marcus Smart sidelined with a knee contusion.
Jayson Tatum called for Robert Williams to start in his postgame comments following the Spurs game, and he was rewarded on Monday.
Robert Williams may catch him by the time the season is over, but Derrick White currently leads the Celtics in blocked shots.
