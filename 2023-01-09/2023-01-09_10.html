     Nasdaq gains for a second day as investors buy beaten-up tech shares like Tesla
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nasdaq Composite posted the biggest advance of 0.8%, pushed up by a nearly 7% rally in Tesla stock.
The S&amp;P 500 followed with a 0.1% gain.
That follows a winning shortened week for the three major indexes, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 posting their best weeks since November.
A chunk of those gains came Friday, with the Dow rallying 700 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively.
Later in the week, investors will watch for December's consumer price index report coming Thursday and big bank earnings scheduled for Friday.

     S&amp;P Could Fall 24% This Year, Morgan Stanley Says, But One Sector May Be The Best Bet To Avoid The Slide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineThe S&amp;P 500 may soon sink to its lowest level in three years, Morgan Stanley strategists warned Monday, as concerns about how a bleak macroeconomic situation will weigh on bottom lines continue to haunt Wall Street.
Getty ImagesKey FactsAnalysts led by Michael Wilson estimated the S&amp;P could slip to as low as 3,000 points during 2023, according to a note to clients.
That indicates 24% downside from the index’s 3,930 mark as of Monday and would be the S&amp;P’s lowest mark since May 2020.
It’s an “easy sale” at the S&amp;P’s current price with “inevitable earnings declines” one the way, Wilson wrote.
Surprising FactThe S&amp;P is overvalued according to 17 of the 20 historical metrics tracked by Bank of America.

     S&amp;P 500: US Stocks Risk 22% Slump, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson Warns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: US equities face much sharper declines than many pessimists expect with the specter of recession likely to compound their biggest annual slump since the global financial crisis, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.
Michael Wilson — long one of the most vocal bears on US stocks — said in a research note that while investors are generally pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth, corporate profit estimates are still too high and the equity risk premium is at its lowest since the run-up to 2008.
That suggests the S&amp;P 500 could fall much lower than the 3,500 to 3,600 points the market is currently estimating in the event of a mild recession, he said.

     The S&amp;P 500 could fall another 22% and investors' view of more downside for stocks is too mild, Morgan Stanley says

     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 could sink by more than investors anticipate, Morgan Stanley warned on Monday.
Investors see the S&amp;P 500 sitting at 3,500-3,600.
The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19% in 2022 but has been pushing higher as 2023 trade gets underway.
