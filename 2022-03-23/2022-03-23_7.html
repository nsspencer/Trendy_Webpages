     You Are Home: Is Harry Styles teasing a new album? – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Pham via Getty ImagesHarry Styles fans are convinced that the singer is teasing a new album with a mysterious online campaign.
The subject of the speculation is a website, Youarehome.co, which right now is only showing a door.
When you click it, it opens, revealing a bunch of illustrations of different kinds of mushrooms.
Then, on Tuesday, Harry’s social accounts followed the Youarehome Twitter and Instagram accounts, indicating that there’s a link between them.
Another possible clue: those photos of Harry in London in February filming something that had him reclining on a huge bed.

     Harry Styles’s New Album Cover Ushers in a Delicate Style Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles is back!
Styles will be releasing his third album, the follow-up to 2019’s critically-acclaimed and Grammy-winning Fine Line, on May 20, titled simply: Harry’s Home.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a new Harry Styles album if it didn’t usher in a fresh style chapter for the famously chic singer too.
Although given Styles’s playful approach to gendered dressing, it’s not like that would have mattered anyway, with the musician wearing a custom look inspired the brand’s spring 2022 collection.

     Welcome to ‘Harry’s House’: New Styles album coming right after Coachella
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some pleasing news for Harry Styles fans: The English pop star is releasing a new album this spring — right after he plays Coachella.
On Wednesday, Styles and Sony Music announced that the 28-year-old performer’s third studio album, “Harry’s House,” will debut May 20.
For the record: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the title of Harry Styles’ debut solo album is “Sign of the Times.” The album is titled “Harry Styles.”“Harry’s House” is Styles’ latest solo effort, following the releases of his Grammy-nominated sophomore record, “Fine Line,” and his eponymous debut album.
But first: Styles, Billie Eilish and Kanye West are set to headline this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
The live music event will mark Styles’ Coachella debut and take place over two weekends, April 15-17 and April 22-24, at the Empire Polo club in Indio.
