     MacKenzie Scott donates a record $275 million to Planned Parenthood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Gabriella Borter(Reuters) – Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $275 million to women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, the largest gift from a single donor in the organization’s more than 100-year history, Planned Parenthood said on Wednesday.
The donation, which is part of Scott’s pledge to give away the majority of her wealth, was made to Planned Parenthood’s national office and 21 regional affiliates.
Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other healthcare services at its clinics around the country, is at the forefront of the political battle over abortion rights playing out in U.S. state legislatures and courts.
“We are incredibly grateful for Ms. Scott’s extraordinary philanthropic investment in Planned Parenthood, as a critical part of the public health infrastructure,” Planned Parenthood Chief Executive Alexis MacGill Johnson said in a statement.
On Tuesday, Habitat for Humanity announced that Scott had donated $436 million, which will go toward the organization’s efforts to boost affordable housing and Black homeownership.
