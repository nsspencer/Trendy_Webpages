     Summary: Eagles offensive lineman and noted songbird Jordan Mailata might have a new nickname after Wednesday night.
Thingamabob.

Our own Adam Hermann put together an extensive analysis on the context clues suggesting that Thingamabob was actually Mailata, and, wouldn't you know it, he was spot on.
When Mailata eventually hangs up the cleats, it seems clear what his next venture should be.
