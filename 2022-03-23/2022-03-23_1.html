     Tyreek Hill could be on the move from the Kansas City Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter and Ian Rapoport broke Twitter on Wednesday morning by announcing that Kansas City Chiefs All Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill and his team were pursuing a trade.
Jets and Dolphins are in serious talks to trade for Chiefs’ WR Tyreek Hill, per league sources.
Hill and Chiefs are mulling what to do but Hill’s time in KC looks like it could be coming to an end.
Despite an offer from the #Chiefs that would make superstar Tyreek Hill one of the highest-paid receivers, extension talks have stalled and Kansas City has now given Hill’s agent permission to seek a trade, sources tell me and @TomPelissero.
Instead, the Chiefs are letting one of the greatest wide receivers of this generation pursue a trade.

     Tyreek Hill trade: Chiefs give WR permission to seek deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyreek Hill, one of the most dynamic wide receivers in the NFL, could be on the move.
After NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that he was given permission by the Chiefs to seek a trade, his colleague Tom Pelissero added that teams are already engaged in trade talks for the three-time First-Team All-Pro.
The Chiefs made an offer that would make Hill “one of the highest-paid receivers,” Rapoport reports, but talks between the two sides have stalled out.
Now, he has permission to seek a trade.
Per Pelissero, multiple teams are involved in trade talks with Kansas City, which could get back a “massive haul.”It may not be a long wait for a move either.

     Tyreek Hill Rumors: Chiefs WR Given Permission to Seek Trade as Contract Talks Stall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesThe Kansas City Chiefs have reportedly given Tyreek Hill and his agent permission to seek a trade, according to Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero of NFL Network.
He is expected to become the highest-paid receiver in the NFL when he deal is completed.
Rapoport previously reported Hill and the Chiefs were "deep in talks" over a contract extension that would pay the receiver over $20 million per year.
According to Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports, the Chiefs began considering a trade after Adams reset the market with his extension.
According to Robinson, the Chiefs are seeking two first-round picks in a deal.

     Dolphins in 'serious talks' on trade for Chiefs WR Tyreek Hill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins have had an impressive offseason to this point, as they’ve re-signed their top free agent in Emmanuel Ogbah and grabbed free agent at their biggest position of need in Terron Armstead.
According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Miami Dolphins are one of two AFC East teams, the other being the New York Jets, involved in trade conversations with the Kansas City Chiefs for wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
Hill, 28, is under contract for just the 2022 season and has a cap hit of $21 million.
However, a team trading for the wide receiver could obviously give him an extension to lower the hit.
29 this year and two first-round picks in 2023 that could be used in a trade package that could pair Hill with Jaylen Waddle and really take this offense to the next level.

     Chiefs give WR Tyreek Hill's camp permission to seek trade after contract extension talks stall
    </h2>

Multiple teams have already engaged the Chiefs in discussions regarding Hill, and the expectation is Hill would fetch a massive haul in a trade, per Pelissero.
Rapoport adds that Hill would receive a new contract extension wherever he lands.
Hill's fit in Green Bay makes plenty of sense following the Packers' decision to trade Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders.
Hill originated the celebration while racking up touchdowns with the Chiefs, who at their peak were nearly unstoppable thanks to Mahomes' rare arm and Hill's elite speed.
