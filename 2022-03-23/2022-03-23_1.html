     Chiefs’ Jarran Reed signs with Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the bulk of the AFC West improved tremendously this offseason, the division-reigning Kansas City Chiefs might not be in the same boat, especially now that they’ve lost defensive tackle Jarran Reed.
— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) March 22, 2022The Chiefs signed Reed the season prior.
As a pro, 2018 and 2020 were really the only two quality seasons for Reed, recording 17 sacks in those two seasons combined.
He had a combined 38 QB hits in those two years as well, so the ceiling is there for the defensive tackle.
As for the Bengals, they were actually just projected to take a defensive tackle in the 2022 NFL Draft by ESPN’s Mel Kiper.

     Packers to sign DL Jarran Reed following a visit to Green Bay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the Green Bay Packers will be signing defensive lineman Jarran Reed to a one-year deal.
Prior to 2021, Reed had played his entire career with the Seattle Seahawks, who drafted him 49th overall in 2016.
Over five seasons in Seattle, Reed started in 80 games and recorded 22 tackles for a loss and 24.5 sacks.
When the announcement was made that the NFL had suspended Reed, despite the local police failing to charge Reed, the local media questioned why Reed wasn’t charged and dissected the police report in public.
I love you 12s pic.twitter.com/QH9YRPRqK0 — jarran reed (@jarranreed) July 22, 2019The signing of Reed gives the Green Bay Packers a fifth interior defensive lineman on the roster, following the loss of Tyler Lancaster (expiring contract) and Kingsley Keke (waived) since January.
