     Tyreek Hill trade: Chiefs deal star WR to Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyreek Hill is being traded to the Dolphins in a blockbuster deal that will make him the highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, his agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
It’s a four-year deal worth $120 million with $72.2 million guaranteed.
The Chiefs will get a first-round, second-round and fourth-round pick in the 2022 draft in the deal, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer.
The deal is a three-year extension worth $75 million, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.
However, the contract includes an extra non-guaranteed year that makes it the four-year monster deal that Rosenhaus originally told ESPN.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter and Ian Rapoport broke Twitter on Wednesday morning by announcing that Kansas City Chiefs All Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill and his team were pursuing a trade.
Jets and Dolphins are in serious talks to trade for Chiefs’ WR Tyreek Hill, per league sources.
Hill and Chiefs are mulling what to do but Hill’s time in KC looks like it could be coming to an end.
Despite an offer from the #Chiefs that would make superstar Tyreek Hill one of the highest-paid receivers, extension talks have stalled and Kansas City has now given Hill’s agent permission to seek a trade, sources tell me and @TomPelissero.
Instead, the Chiefs are letting one of the greatest wide receivers of this generation pursue a trade.

     Summary: KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI - JANUARY 23: Tyreek Hill #10 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with teammate Patrick Mahomes #15 after scoring a 64 yard touchdown against the Buffalo Bills during the fourth quarter in the AFC Divisional Playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium on January 23, 2022 in Kansas City, Missouri.
Trading Tyreek Hill is a mistake for KC Chiefs.
