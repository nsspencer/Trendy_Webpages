     Tyreek Hill could be on the move from the Kansas City Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter and Ian Rapoport broke Twitter on Wednesday morning by announcing that Kansas City Chiefs All Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill and his team were pursuing a trade.
Jets and Dolphins are in serious talks to trade for Chiefs’ WR Tyreek Hill, per league sources.
Hill and Chiefs are mulling what to do but Hill’s time in KC looks like it could be coming to an end.
Despite an offer from the #Chiefs that would make superstar Tyreek Hill one of the highest-paid receivers, extension talks have stalled and Kansas City has now given Hill’s agent permission to seek a trade, sources tell me and @TomPelissero.
Instead, the Chiefs are letting one of the greatest wide receivers of this generation pursue a trade.

     Cornerback is top priority for the Buffalo Bills after Tyreek Hill trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI - JANUARY 24: Tyreek Hill #10 of the Kansas City Chiefs runs with the ball in the second half against the Buffalo Bills during the AFC Championship game at Arrowhead Stadium on January 24, 2021 in Kansas City, Missouri.
(Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)General manager Brandon Beane was busy over the past week addressing a number of roster needs for the Buffalo Bills.
However, that focus should change after the Miami Dolphins traded with the Kansas City Chiefs for Tyreek Hill.
Buffalo Bills need a veteran cornerback as a backup plan for Tre’Davious WhiteIf the Buffalo Bills knew that Tre’Davious White would be ready at the start of the season, the need wouldn’t be as great.
The Buffalo Bills almost certainly would have addressed cornerback this offseason but the need has become greater after the recent trade by the Miami Dolphins.

     Summary: The Chiefs are trading wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for five draft picks, including a first-rounder (No.
29 overall) in the 2022 draft, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Wednesday.
They found one with the Dolphins, where Hill will receive the extension he sought while also immediately becoming their most prominent player.
Rapoport and Pelissero reported Hill's new extension is for four years and is worth $120 million with $72.2 million guaranteed.
This move will also benefit the Chiefs, we now have cap space and additional draft picks to grow as a football team.

     Broncos sent a perfect tweet after the Tyreek Hill trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs shocked the football world on Wednesday when they agreed to trade wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for five draft picks.
Hill was apparently unable to agree to terms on a contract extension with the Chiefs so he asked for — and was granted — a trade.
The Dolphins were more than willing to pay up, giving Hill a four-year, $120 million contract.
Fans from every other team in the AFC West were quick to react with celebratory memes on Twitter following the news that the Denver Broncos, Las Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders will no longer have to face Hill twice a season.

     Trading Tyreek Hill was best long-term move for KC Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)The Kansas City Chiefs have traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for multiple draft picks.
The Tyreek Hill trade is best for the Kansas City Chiefs in the long run.
This trade does make the Chiefs worse today, but in the long run, this blockbuster trade benefited Kansas City tremendously.
In return for Hill, the Dolphins coughed up five draft picks including a first and second in this upcoming draft.
Kansas City would not be able to be aggressive in free agency, and if they were to do so, it would result in moving money around into future years, keeping Kansas City in a ruthless cycle.
