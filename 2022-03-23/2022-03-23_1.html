     Tyreek Hill trade: Chiefs deal star WR to Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyreek Hill is being traded to the Dolphins in a blockbuster deal that will make him the highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, his agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
It’s a four-year deal worth $120 million with $72.2 million guaranteed.
The Chiefs will get a first-round, second-round and fourth-round pick in the 2022 draft in the deal, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer.
The deal is a three-year extension worth $75 million, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.
However, the contract includes an extra non-guaranteed year that makes it the four-year monster deal that Rosenhaus originally told ESPN.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter and Ian Rapoport broke Twitter on Wednesday morning by announcing that Kansas City Chiefs All Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill and his team were pursuing a trade.
Jets and Dolphins are in serious talks to trade for Chiefs’ WR Tyreek Hill, per league sources.
Hill and Chiefs are mulling what to do but Hill’s time in KC looks like it could be coming to an end.
Despite an offer from the #Chiefs that would make superstar Tyreek Hill one of the highest-paid receivers, extension talks have stalled and Kansas City has now given Hill’s agent permission to seek a trade, sources tell me and @TomPelissero.
Instead, the Chiefs are letting one of the greatest wide receivers of this generation pursue a trade.

     Chiefs trade six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Tyreek Hill to Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After unsuccessful attempts to secure a contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs, the six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver is on the move in a trade that will send him to the Miami Dolphins, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports.
Hill's departure and payday represents a continued changing of the landscape in an NFL offseason that has seen five quarterbacks traded, with a marquee wide receiver also being dealt and paid handsomely.
This offseason, Miami also brought on three-time Pro Bowl left tackle Terron Armstead and left guard Connor Williams to fortify the team's front.
Kansas City signed former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster last week and is now armed with a collection of draft picks, including four of the top 62 selections, and additional cap space.

     Summary: (Photo by Chris Unger/Getty Images)The Kansas City Chiefs are reportedly exploring a potential trade for Tyreek Hill and Twitter is as chaotic as you might expect it to be.
The Chiefs and Hill have been working on a long-term extension that has hit the roadblock now labeled as “paying Tyreek what he is worth”.
No one is Tyreek Hill.
— James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) March 23, 2022Tyreek Hill has been a Pro Bowler every year of his career.
If the Chiefs trade him, it's really hard to make any case they're the best team in the West.

     Chiefs give WR Tyreek Hill's camp permission to seek trade after contract extension talks stall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite an offer that would make Tyreek Hill one of the NFL's highest-paid receivers, talks on a contract extension have stalled and the Chiefs have given Hill's agent permission to seek a trade, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Wednesday.
Multiple teams have already engaged the Chiefs in discussions regarding Hill, and the expectation is Hill would fetch a massive haul in a trade, per Pelissero.
Rapoport adds that Hill would receive a new contract extension wherever he lands.
Hill's fit in Green Bay makes plenty of sense following the Packers' decision to trade Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders.
Hill originated the celebration while racking up touchdowns with the Chiefs, who at their peak were nearly unstoppable thanks to Mahomes' rare arm and Hill's elite speed.
