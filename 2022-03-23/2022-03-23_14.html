     Mo Brooks says Trump asked him to “remove Joe Biden from the White House"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama Senate candidate Mo Brooks (R) said Wednesday that former President Trump asked him to "remove Joe Biden from the White House."
Driving the news: "President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency," Brooks said in a statement.
" As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks.
"I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement."
Brooks last year told a Trump rally to move on from disputing the 2020 election results and "look forward" to 2022.

     House Republican Says Trump Asked Him to Illegally ‘Rescind’ 2020 Election

     Summary: “I know what the legal remedy for a contested presidential election is,” he continued.
“There is one and only one per the Constitution and U. S. Code and it occurs on the first Jan. 6 after each presidential election.
Mr. Brooks did not immediately respond to further questions.
In his statement, he said he had fought on behalf of Mr. Trump “between Nov. 3 and Jan. 6” — “when it counted.”On Dec. 21, 2020, Mr. Brooks and other House Republicans met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss plans to object to the election.
“Will you fight for America?”Later on Capitol Hill, after a pro-Trump mob rampaged through the building, Mr. Brooks tried to object to electoral votes from several states for Mr. Biden.

     Summary: Trump yanks endorsement of Alabama Senate candidate Brooks, who said to get past 2020Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesU.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., has been a staunch pro-Donald Trump voice in Congress and on the campaign trail.
The reason Trump gave for his break with Brooks is a fundamental difference the two Republicans have over the 2020 election.
Trump added that Brooks erred by hiring new campaign aides who "convinced him to 'stop talking about the 2020 Election.'
In a statement on the withdrawn Trump endorsement, Brooks said he's not changed.
As a lawyer, I've repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) — Former President Donald Trump has pulled an endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks in this year’s Alabama Senate primary, slamming the Republican as “woke” and disloyal to him for doubting his claims about the 2020 presidential election.
“When I endorsed Mo Brooks, he took a 44-point lead and was unstoppable.
He then hired a new campaign staff who ‘brilliantly’ convinced him to ‘stop talking about the 2020 Election,'” Trump said in a statement issued on Wednesday morning.
“Very sad but, since he decided to go in another direction, so have I, and I am hereby withdrawing my Endorsement of Mo Brooks for the Senate.
“Today, I unveil my pledge to America to fire Mitch McConnell,” Brooks said.

     How Trump threw Mo Brooks under the bus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooks and Trump had a phone conversation as recently as last Monday without any mention of the endorsement being in peril, according to Brooks’ campaign.
Hours after rescinding his endorsement of Brooks, Trump put out a follow-up statement that both rubbed salt in Brooks’ wound and reiterated his contempt for McConnell.
But Steve Bannon, another Trump ally, said Brooks would continue to be invited onto his “War Room” show, despite Brooks’ departure from MAGA orthodoxy.
“Trump can giveth, and Trump can taketh away.”It’s too early to tell whether the loss of Trump’s endorsement sounds the death knell for Brooks’ campaign.
For months, Brooks’ campaign was operating without experienced staff and advisers on strategy, media and fundraising.
