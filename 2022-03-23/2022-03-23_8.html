     Accidental injection death of wrong drug: Ex-nurse on trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Murphey had been admitted to the hospital two days earlier after developing a headache and losing vision in one eye.
Vaught could not find Versed in an automatic drug dispensing cabinet because it was listed under the generic name midazolam.
Vaught left the imaging area after injecting the drug, but minutes later another employee noticed Murphey was unresponsive.
She added that the drug she chose was a powder that had to be reconstituted, instead of a liquid.
Defense attorney Peter Strianse told the jury the hospital was at least partially to blame for Murphey's death.

     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — The homicide trial for former Vanderbilt nurse RaDonda Vaught continued in a Nashville courtroom Wednesday.
She is accused of administering a patient a fatal dose of the wrong medication.
She has admitted to using the wrong medication but pleaded not guilty to the charges in 2019.
Her attorney has argued that systemic failures at the Vanderbilt Medical Center contributed to the error.
That’s what Vaught said she did the day she gave a patient a fatal dose of the wrong medication in 2017.

     Live: Trial for RaDonda Vaught, former Vanderbilt nurse, continues into second day of testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — The second day of testimony is underway on Tuesday morning for RaDonda Vaught, a former Vanderbilt University Medical Center nurse on trial for the death of a patient in her care.
WTVF TBI Special Agent Romona Smith shows the jury a vial of vecuronium in court on March 23, 2022.
He said Vaught told him she had mistakenly given Murphey vecuronium.
Vaught told the board that she was distracted while pulling the medication and didn't read the vial to confirm the drug.
One board member said there were just "too many nursing flags" going off that Vaught ignored when administering the medication.

     Summary: As a nurse faces prison for a deadly error, her colleagues worry: Could I be next?
The Nashville District Attorney's Office declined to discuss Vaught's trial.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center has repeatedly declined to comment on Vaught's trial or its procedures.
As the trial begins, Nashville prosecutors will argue that Vaught's error was anything but a common mistake any nurse could make.
Overrides are common outside of Vanderbilt, too, according to experts following Vaught's case.
