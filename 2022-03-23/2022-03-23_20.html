     Halo Episode 1 Review: Contact
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although she’s up to teenage hijinks at the start of the episode, it’s not long before her life becomes irrevocably intertwined with Spartan Master Chief John-117 (Pablo Schreiber).
Like in the games, the Spartans like Master Chief are surgically-enhanced soldiers wearing high-tech powered armor.
Before the alien Covenant attacks Quan’s base and slaughters everyone except her, the colonists consider Master Chief’s division of super-soldiers to be the ultimate enemy.
Complicating things is that the Master Chief is beginning to remember things the UNSC forced him to suppress.
I have to wonder what Halo might look like if it had an Apple-funded budget like the incredibly cinematic Foundation series.

     Halo review – hit sci-fi game morphs into middling $200m TV series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To complicate the picture, the Covenant are obsessed with giant, habitable space structures known as the Halo Array, which were left behind by ancient beings known as the Forerunners.
The game and TV show seem to borrow from all the good places in modern sci-fi.
This is despite the show giving him ample opportunity to remove his helmet, which rarely happens in the game.
If that’s the long-term plan here, neither the show nor Schreiber has quite nailed it yet.
Paramount+ have already commissioned season two, however, so somebody out there clearly thinks they’ve got a hit on their hands.

     'Halo' TV Show Breaks Master Chief's No. 1 Rule -- and I Absolutely Love It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As someone who's played virtually every Halo game and is emotionally invested in the Master Chief, something in my gut told me this was wrong.
Master Chief's face is an early warning to help you adjust to the TV show's big changes to Halo history, dubbed the "Silver Timeline."
Instead, the hope is these story wrinkles and how Master Chief reacts to them provides a compelling character arc.
The growing bond between Master Chief and Ha draws comparisons to The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda, but there are some key differences.
Having the Master Chief remain faceless, detached from everything going on, adds a level of distance that may turn viewers off before they can become emotionally invested in this universe.

Halo TV series cast(Image credit: 343 Industries)Perhaps one of the most important elements to consider when discussing the Halo TV series is its cast.
Halo TV series trailersWhile the Halo TV show was announced in March 2021, we didn’t get our first teaser until November.
This reveal was unfortunately pretty tight-lipped, as was the next trailer that debuted the following month – all they really showed was Master Chief being Master Chief.

     Halo should've killed Master Chief years ago. The TV series does something even better.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Halo TV series on Paramount+ surprises in a number of ways, but the biggest shock of all are the steps the story takes to unmask our inscrutable space marine.
Rather than relegate Chief (Pablo Schreiber), aka John-117, to mythic status on the sidelines, Halo makes him a central player.
The tide only turns when Master Chief and his squad of fellow Spartans show up to save the day.
Kwan Ha Boo (Yerin Ha) is introduced as just as much of a main character as Master Chief himself.
It's an unexpected but perfectly welcome twist to see Halo poking at the murky morality of the UNSC's Spartan program.
