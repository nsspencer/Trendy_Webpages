     Khabib's coach makes big prediction for possible Conor McGregor vs. Jake Paul fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jake Paul would come out on top against Conor McGregor if the pair were ever to meet in a boxing ring.
“I would favour Jake Paul at 175 over Conor in a boxing ring because he’s too big,” said Mendez when speaking to Betway.
Jake Paul hits extremely hard as you can tell by what he’s done.
Jake Paul also isn’t necessarily a novice anymore.
So, it’s a big man versus a little man and the big man just so happens to have more firepower.”

     Report: Conor McGregor Arrested for Dangerous Driving; Bentley Briefly Seized
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo By David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile via Getty ImagesConor McGregor was arrested in Ireland on suspicion of dangerous driving Tuesday.
Robin Schiller of The Independent reported police seized his Bentley for a short time after a traffic stop for alleged traffic offenses.
McGregor was driving to the gym when he was stopped by Gardai for alleged road traffic violations.
In 2018, McGregor pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct after throwing a metal dolly at the window of a bus on which fighters for UFC 223 were passengers.
As far as traffic violations, McGregor was previously fined €400 for speeding in Dublin back in 2017 and had his license suspended for six months for speeding in Kill, County Kildare a year later.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC fighter Conor McGregor was reportedly arrested in Dublin on Tuesday due to dangerous driving, The Irish Independent reported on Wednesday.
According to the Irish Independent, McGregor violated various road traffic laws in his home country.
McGregor was driving to the gym when he was stopped by [Irish police] for alleged road traffic violations,” Kessler said.
This violation, however, will most likely cause McGregor to pay more than his previous fine.
A dangerous driving fine can cost up to €5,000 (roughly $5,500).

     UFC's Conor McGregor arrested for alleged traffic violations in Dublin, Ireland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC star Conor McGregor was arrested for "alleged road traffic violations" Tuesday in his native Dublin, Ireland, his team confirmed Wednesday with ESPN.
"Mr. McGregor was driving to the gym when he was stopped by [Irish police] for alleged road traffic violations," McGregor spokesperson Karen Kessler told ESPN in a statement.
The Garda, Ireland, police force does not, by law, release the names of those arrested.
Margaret Flanagan told ESPN in a statement that a man in his 30s was arrested for "an incident of dangerous driving" in the Palmerstown section of Dublin on Tuesday evening.
In 2019, he pleaded guilty to assault after punching an older man at a Dublin bar and was fined 1,000 euros.

     Conor McGregor arrested: How alleged driving offense complicates UFC return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Irish Independent reported Wednesday that McGregor was arrested in Dublin on Tuesday night for alleged dangerous driving.
Irish police did not confirm that McGregor was arrested but said a man in his 30s was arrested for dangerous driving in Palmerstown on Tuesday evening, the Irish Independent reported.
According to the Irish Independent, McGregor is facing a fine of up to €5,000 (just under $5,500) and/or six months' imprisonment.
The legal process would likely eliminate a summer fight and put any fight in 2022 in jeopardy.
The Irish Independent reported that he appeared in Blanchardstown district court in 2017 and was fined €400 for speeding.
