     Woj: Michael Malone and Denver Nuggets agree to multi-year contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Denver Nuggets and Michael Malone have agreed to a multi-year contract extension.
ESPN Sources: Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone has agreed on a multi-year contract extension: https://t.co/mSwSqwo9uJ — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) March 23, 2022This season is Malone’s seventh with the franchise and he already ranks third in franchise history for all-time wins at 309.
Before this extension his last season on contract was going to be the 2022-23 season.
This season has not been Malone’s greatest season, but it is largely excusable considering the injury issues surrounding the team.
Look for Malone to continue to climb the rankings of Denver Nuggets coaches in terms of both wins, and playoff success for years to come.

     Summary: Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone has agreed to a multiyear contract extension with the team, it was announced Wednesday.
"This extension is well deserved for Coach Malone and one we are very excited to announce," Nuggets governor Stan Kroenke said in a statement.
The Nuggets are 43-30 this season -- sixth in the Western Conference -- without Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. having played a single game together.
Malone is the only coach in league history to twice overcome 3-1 playoff deficits, which he did in the same 2020 postseason run to the Western Conference finals.
In nine years as a coach, including parts of two seasons with the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2015, Malone is 348-304 (.534).

     Nuggets, head coach Michael Malone agree to contract extension, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets have agreed to a contract extension with head coach Michael Malone, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Malone's deal was set to expire after the 2022-23 season, but this new contract will see him staying in charge for the foreseeable future.
In seven seasons with the Nuggets, Malone has helped transform a franchise that hadn't made it past the first round of the playoffs since 2009, let alone come close to making the postseason at all since 2013.
The following season the Nuggets made a run to the Western Conference finals in the Orlando bubble, and have remained a playoff fixture each season.
With two key players out for the majority of the season, the Nuggets have still managed to stay afloat, thanks to the dominant play of Jokic and the coaching of Malone.
