     Heat teammates Jimmy Butler, Udonis Haslem get in verbal altercation during game vs. Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things got heated in the Miami Heat huddle during a timeout in the second half of Wednesday night's game against the Golden State Warriors.
The game was tied 50-50 at halftime, but the Warriors scored the first 19 points of the second half.
Miami star Jimmy Butler and longtime Heat stalwart Udonis Haslem had to be separated by teammates as they exchanged words.
Haslem was heard repeatedly telling Butler "I'll beat your ass," in a video captured by a fan sitting courtside.
Spoelstra suggested Wednesday's blowup could help the Heat in the long run.

Tucker: “You put that [cameras] in the locker room, any NBA team, football team, any team.
We got our butts handed to us two games in a row by teams that didn’t even have their starting players.

     Coup's Takeaways: Shorthanded Warriors Absorb HEAT’s Third Quarter Comeback, Ride 37 Points In Fourth To Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn’t too surprising that they were making a game of this, even on a back-to-back, and had things tied, 50-50, at the half.
What was surprising was when the Warriors went up 69-50 early in the third quarter, especially considering the two banked-in threes that helped them get there.
Also worth a small note that without Tyler Herro, Erik Spoelstra closed with Victor Oladipo at shooting guard, but Miami’s bench was outscored 42-13.
The Warriors did all they could to take away the paint the same as the HEAT try to do to everyone else.
