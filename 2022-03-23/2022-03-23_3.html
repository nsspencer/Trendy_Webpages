     Summary: The philanthropist donated $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit organization announced.
Habitat for Humanity is a global organization that partners with communities to build or improve housing.
In a Medium post, Scott called out the increasing concentration of wealth among a smaller group of people.
In July 2020, Scott gave more than $1.7 billion to diverse organizations, including historically Black colleges and universities.
In December that year, Scott announced she donated an additional $4.2 billion to 384 organizations providing services including food banks, emergency relief funds and debt relief.

     MacKenzie Scott donates $436M to Habitat for Humanity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MacKenzie Scott, one of the richest women in the world, has donated $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, the organization said Tuesday, in one of the billionaire philanthropist’s largest publicly disclosed donations.
Jonathan Reckford, chief executive for Habitat for Humanity International, said the organization received $25 million from the gift from Ms. Scott and her husband, Dan Jewett, while the remaining $411 million will be shared among 84 local Habitat for Humanity affiliates.
Ms. Scott, who divorced Mr. Bezos in 2019, signed the Giving Pledge later that year.
"We chose to make relatively large gifts to the organizations…both to enable their work, and as a signal of trust and encouragement, to them and to others," said Ms. Scott.
In December 2021, Ms. Scott said she would stop going public about her philanthropic gifts and let recipients decide if and when they want to announce the donations, as Habitat for Humanity did Tuesday.

     MacKenzie Scott Donates $436 Million While Bezos Hoards Wealth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated $436 million to Habitat For Humanity, according to an announcement from the housing charity .
Meanwhile, Scott’s ex-husband, Jeff Bezos, is continuing his mid-life crisis, wealth hoarding, and union busting.
By contrast, Scott has given away a lot more money relative to her net worth since her divorce from Bezos in 2019.
Scott, who’s worth roughly $54 billion, has donated about $9 billion to hundreds of organizations since her divorce, according to a tally by Bloomberg News in late 2021.
And Habitat for Humanity, just like all the other organizations Scott has donated money toward, are tremendously grateful.

     MacKenzie Scott donates a record $275 million to Planned Parenthood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Gabriella Borter(Reuters) – Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $275 million to women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, the largest gift from a single donor in the organization’s more than 100-year history, Planned Parenthood said on Wednesday.
The donation, which is part of Scott’s pledge to give away the majority of her wealth, was made to Planned Parenthood’s national office and 21 regional affiliates.
Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other healthcare services at its clinics around the country, is at the forefront of the political battle over abortion rights playing out in U.S. state legislatures and courts.
“We are incredibly grateful for Ms. Scott’s extraordinary philanthropic investment in Planned Parenthood, as a critical part of the public health infrastructure,” Planned Parenthood Chief Executive Alexis MacGill Johnson said in a statement.
On Tuesday, Habitat for Humanity announced that Scott had donated $436 million, which will go toward the organization’s efforts to boost affordable housing and Black homeownership.
