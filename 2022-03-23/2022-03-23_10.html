     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden has formally asked two Trump-appointed members of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness &amp; Nutrition to resign from their posts or be terminated.
It's against the Biden administration's policy for federal candidates to serve on presidential boards, according to a White House official.
"President Trump appointed me to two terms on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness &amp; Nutrition.
The White House just emailed me demanding my resignation by the end of the day," he wrote.
"Clearly, Joe Biden can't be around anyone who doesn't completely fall in line with his fear-mongering authoritarian one-size-fits-all COVID handling.

     ‘Critical time for our security’: President Joe Biden and European leaders to meet at emergency summit to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, President Joe Biden will travel to Brussels to initiate a set of emergency meetings with NATO, the Group of Seven, and the European Union to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and how the allied countries should respond, according to the Associated Press.
The meeting comes a day after the U.S. formally determined that Russian troops have committed war crimes in Ukraine, attributing attacks on citizens in Mariupol.
On Wednesday before leaving for Europe, Biden said the possibility of Russia deploying chemical weapons was a “real threat,” according to Radio Free Europe.
The NATO Secretary-General declined to tell AP reporters whether a nuclear strike would draw the alliance into war with Russia.
Biden is also scheduled to visit Poland on Friday, where he plans to speak with President Andrzej Duda about the Ukrainian effort, the AP reported.

     Summary: Brussels (CNN) President Joe Biden departed Wednesday on one of the highest-stakes presidential trips in recent memory, a moment for the US President to assume leadership of a newly united West.
The war in Ukraine is widely viewed inside the White House as one of the defining challenges for Biden and his presidential legacy.
Earlier in the week, Biden said Putin's stumbles in Ukraine would cause him to resort to more troubling options, with cyber attacks being his primary concern.
US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Wednesday that NATO leaders would approve at the summit the deployment of four additional battle groups in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
NATO leaders have been discussing whether and how Zelensky should participate in this week's summit.

     Biden heads to high-stakes NATO summit amid showdown with Putin over Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden headed to Europe Wednesday as he tries to keep NATO allies and other European partners united against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.
And while Biden will command much of the attention this week, his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, also plans to speak to -- and potentially pressure -- Biden and other NATO leaders.
Throughout the meetings, Biden hopes to achieve "continued coordination and a unified response" to Russia, the White House said.
One challenge he may face Thursday, though, is responding to Zelenskyy's remarks to NATO leaders.
In a call last week, according to the White House, Biden warned him of the consequences of providing aid to Russia.
