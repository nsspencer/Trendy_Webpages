She was nominated for secretary of state by President Bill Clinton and served in the role from 1997 to 2001.
In a State Department briefing Wednesday, spokesperson Ned Price said President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been notified of her death.

     Madeleine Albright, First Woman to Serve as Secretary of State, Dies at 84
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Ms. Albright stepped down as secretary of state in 2001, there was speculation that she might pursue a political career in the Czech Republic.
Ms. Albright said she was flattered but not interested.
In 2008, Ms. Albright supported her longtime friend Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, and then Barack Obama, who won the nomination and the presidency, appointing Mrs. Clinton as his first-term secretary of state.
In 2016, Ms. Albright again supported Mrs. Clinton for the presidency.
An ardent feminist, Ms. Albright apologized in an op-ed in The Times.

     Madeleine Albright, groundbreaking secretary of state and feminist icon, dies at 84

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – Madeleine Jana Korbel Albright, the first female secretary of state, who arrived in the U.S. as a young girl from war-torn Czechoslovakia before becoming a political and feminist icon, died Wednesday at 84.
"She was a trailblazer as the first female secretary of state and quite literally opened doors for a large element of our workforce," Price said.
Early political work for Muskie, Carter administrationBefore becoming the 64th secretary of state, Albright worked for the 1972 presidential campaign of Edmund Muskie, a Democratic U.S. senator from Maine, and later became his chief legislative assistant.
"They got together and said, 'We've had no problems dealing with Ambassador Albright; we wouldn't have any problem dealing with Secretary Albright,'" Albright said.
As secretary of state, Albright was a proponent of military intervention, including in the Kosovo conflict, which ended after 11 weeks of airstrikes.
