     Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston quits after internal inquiry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hillsong Church said an internal investigation into complaints from two women had found that its global senior pastor, Brian Houston, had breached worshippers’ trust.
Hillsong did not reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment from Houston and his contact details.
Houston founded the 150,000-strong church in Sydney with his wife, Bobbie, in the 1980s and set up ministries in Europe, Asia, and North and South America.
Hillsong events have been regularly attended by political leaders, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who led prayers at a 2019 church conference.
In a March 18 statement, Hillsong said its investigation found “inappropriate” text messages from Houston to a female employee resulted in the woman resigning a decade ago.

     Summary: Houston’s resignation was announced by Hillsong Church in a statement Wednesday posted to its website.
"We understand there will be much emotion at this news, and we all share these feelings," Hillsong said in part.
Now with churches in 30 different countries, the church has dealt with a series of controversies in recent years.
Then, in a recent internal probe, the church revealed last week that it had "been dealing with two complaints made against Pastor Brian over the last 10 years."
"We also acknowledge that whatever the circumstances at this time, this person did not deserve to be placed in the situation she found herself in by Pastor Brian," the church added.

     How Brian Houston's Daughter Reacted to Behavior as Hillsong Pastor Resigns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The daughter of Hillsong founder Brian Houston has spoken of her "crushing pain" after her father stepped down as the church's global senior pastor, following an incident with two women that breached the institute's moral code.
The Hillsong Church was founded in Sydney in 1983 and has since expanded into a massive global operation with churches in 25 countries.
On Wednesday, the Church released a statement noting that they had accepted Houston's resignation as global senior pastor.
"At the time, Pastor Brian was under the influence of sleeping tablets, upon which he had developed a dependence.
The Hillsong global board said "that whatever the circumstances at this time, this person did not deserve to be placed in the situation she found herself in by Pastor Brian."

     Summary: Hillsong megachurch founder Brian Houston has resigned amid allegations of inappropriate behavior.
The second incident involved a 2019 complaint regarding a hotel room encounter with an unnamed woman.
In a separate statement on Friday, the Hillsong global board detailed the two incidents that resulted in complaints against Houston.
The first incident in 2013 involved Houston sending inappropriate text messages to a staff member, which resulted in her resignation.
During his time at the church, Houston oversaw the firing of Pastor Carl Lentz in 2020 over the latter's "moral failures".

     Hillsong pastor Brian Houston resigns after revelations of indiscretions with women
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a March 18 statement, the Hillsong board acknowledged it had been “dealing with two complaints made against Pastor Brian over the last 10 years” and said each was investigated by a board member or “a body appointed by the global board” and dealt with confidentially.
The board’s statement said Houston apologized to the staff member, who had resigned because of the flirtation.
The Hillsong board statement said Houston had become “disoriented” after taking more than the prescribed dose of an anti-anxiety prescription, mixed with alcohol.
At that time, neither Houston nor the board mentioned the two complaints against Houston, citing only his need to focus on the trial.
News of Houston’s resignation came the same day as Australian news outlet Crikey published a story alleging the former pastor of the Hillsong church in Dallas, Texas, Reed Bogard, raped a female staff member of the church.
