     MacKenzie Scott donates $436M to Habitat for Humanity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MacKenzie Scott, one of the richest women in the world, has donated $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, the organization said Tuesday, in one of the billionaire philanthropist’s largest publicly disclosed donations.
Jonathan Reckford, chief executive for Habitat for Humanity International, said the organization received $25 million from the gift from Ms. Scott and her husband, Dan Jewett, while the remaining $411 million will be shared among 84 local Habitat for Humanity affiliates.
Ms. Scott, who divorced Mr. Bezos in 2019, signed the Giving Pledge later that year.
"We chose to make relatively large gifts to the organizations…both to enable their work, and as a signal of trust and encouragement, to them and to others," said Ms. Scott.
In December 2021, Ms. Scott said she would stop going public about her philanthropic gifts and let recipients decide if and when they want to announce the donations, as Habitat for Humanity did Tuesday.

     Summary: MacKenzie Scott donated $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, the largest publicly disclosed gift since she pledged in 2019 to give away the majority of her wealth.
“This incredible act of generosity and investment in our work will make an impact throughout our region for decades to come,” said Maureen Sedonaen, head of Habitat for Humanity Greater San Francisco.
Scott, the former wife of Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, has a fortune of $54.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Her gift will help address historic inequities in homeownership rates in the area around San Francisco, Sedonaen said in the statement.
The donation will help build homes for more than 250 working families in San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin, according to the statement.

     MacKenzie Scott Donates $436 Million While Bezos Hoards Wealth

     Summary: Author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated $436 million to Habitat For Humanity, according to an announcement from the housing charity .
Meanwhile, Scott’s ex-husband, Jeff Bezos, is continuing his mid-life crisis, wealth hoarding, and union busting.
By contrast, Scott has given away a lot more money relative to her net worth since her divorce from Bezos in 2019.
Scott, who’s worth roughly $54 billion, has donated about $9 billion to hundreds of organizations since her divorce, according to a tally by Bloomberg News in late 2021.
And Habitat for Humanity, just like all the other organizations Scott has donated money toward, are tremendously grateful.

The $5 million donation is part of a $436 million gift the philanthropist made to Habitat for Humanity International and 84 affiliate organizations in the United States.
"This transformational $5 million represents so much more than a generous donation," Habitat Philadelphia CEO Corinne O'Connell said.
Habitat for Humanity International received $25 million; the remaining $411 million was distributed to the nonprofit's affiliates, the organization said.
The lack of affordable housing in Philly can be tied directly to the city's poverty rate, Habitat Philadelphia says.
