     Summary: WASHINGTON – Madeleine Jana Korbel Albright, the first female secretary of state, who arrived in the U.S. as a young girl from war-torn Czechoslovakia before becoming a political and feminist icon, died Wednesday at 84.
"She was a trailblazer as the first female secretary of state and quite literally opened doors for a large element of our workforce," Price said.
Early political work for Muskie, Carter administrationBefore becoming the 64th secretary of state, Albright worked for the 1972 presidential campaign of Edmund Muskie, a Democratic U.S. senator from Maine, and later became his chief legislative assistant.
"They got together and said, 'We've had no problems dealing with Ambassador Albright; we wouldn't have any problem dealing with Secretary Albright,'" Albright said.
As secretary of state, Albright was a proponent of military intervention, including in the Kosovo conflict, which ended after 11 weeks of airstrikes.
