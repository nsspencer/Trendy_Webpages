In December that year, Scott announced she donated an additional $4.2 billion to 384 organizations providing services including food banks, emergency relief funds and debt relief.

     Summary: MacKenzie Scott, one of the richest women in the world, has donated $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, the organization said Tuesday, in one of the billionaire philanthropist’s largest publicly disclosed donations.
Jonathan Reckford, chief executive for Habitat for Humanity International, said the organization received $25 million from the gift from Ms. Scott and her husband, Dan Jewett, while the remaining $411 million will be shared among 84 local Habitat for Humanity affiliates.
Ms. Scott, who divorced Mr. Bezos in 2019, signed the Giving Pledge later that year.
"We chose to make relatively large gifts to the organizations…both to enable their work, and as a signal of trust and encouragement, to them and to others," said Ms. Scott.
In December 2021, Ms. Scott said she would stop going public about her philanthropic gifts and let recipients decide if and when they want to announce the donations, as Habitat for Humanity did Tuesday.

Of the $436 million total going to Habitat for Humanity, $7.5 million is going to the Habitat for Humanity of Hillsborough County.
Another 25% of the residents in the county are currently living below the asset limited, income constrained, employed threshold, according to Habitat Hillsborough.
“While homeownership can significantly reduce the cost of housing, Hillsborough County has the lowest rate of homeownership (58%) in Tampa Bay, also lower than Florida’s average (66%) or the national rate (64%),” Habitat Hillsborough said.
Additionally, the study on rent proportion versus wages said Tampa rent in 2021 was 42.9% for the entire year.

     Summary: By Gabriella Borter(Reuters) – Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $275 million to women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, the largest gift from a single donor in the organization’s more than 100-year history, Planned Parenthood said on Wednesday.
The donation, which is part of Scott’s pledge to give away the majority of her wealth, was made to Planned Parenthood’s national office and 21 regional affiliates.
Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other healthcare services at its clinics around the country, is at the forefront of the political battle over abortion rights playing out in U.S. state legislatures and courts.

On Tuesday, Habitat for Humanity announced that Scott had donated $436 million, which will go toward the organization’s efforts to boost affordable housing and Black homeownership.
