     Brian Houston Resigns as Senior Pastor of Hillsong Church Amid Controversy — What Happened?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At this time, Brian was the National President of the Assemblies of God in Australia and promptly dismissed his father, without alerting the proper authorities.
Frank's church then merged with Brian's to become Hillsong Church, with Brian as the senior pastor.
Although Frank died in November 2004, his secrets did not die with him.
The new Discovery Plus series Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed aims to reveal all that the church (and Brian) was hiding.

     Australian megachurch founder steps down amid allegations of misconduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Brian Houston, the founder of Australian megachurch Hillsong, stepped down from his role as global senior pastor amid an internal investigation into allegations of misconduct towards two women, the church announced on Wednesday.
"We would like to advise you that Pastor Brian Houston has resigned as Global Senior Pastor of Hillsong Church, and the board has accepted his resignation," the church said in a statement.
We have committed to an independent review of our governance structure and processes," it continued.
On Friday, Hillsong issued its first statement on the matter, saying the founder had "breached" the church's "Pastor's Code of Conduct" following an investigation into harassment complaints from two women.
The first incident occurred "approximately a decade ago" according to the church and "involved "inappropriate text messages from Pastor Brian to a member of staff, which subsequently resulted in the staff member resigning."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last week, the megachurch said an internal probe into allegations of inappropriate behavior revealed that Houston "breached the Hillsong Pastor's Code of Conduct."
Hillsong said Houston had developed a dependency on sleeping pills and was under the influence at the time of the incident.
The church said Houston "immediately apologised to the person," but that the staff member ultimately resigned.
"To this former staff member, we again apologise and would welcome the opportunity to provide further assistance if this is needed," Hillsong said.
In January, Houston announced he would be stepping aside from all ministry responsibilities but did not mention the misconduct complaints.

     Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston quits after internal inquiry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hillsong Church said an internal investigation into complaints from two women had found that its global senior pastor, Brian Houston, had breached worshippers’ trust.
Hillsong did not reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment from Houston and his contact details.
Houston founded the 150,000-strong church in Sydney with his wife, Bobbie, in the 1980s and set up ministries in Europe, Asia, and North and South America.
Hillsong events have been regularly attended by political leaders, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who led prayers at a 2019 church conference.
In a March 18 statement, Hillsong said its investigation found “inappropriate” text messages from Houston to a female employee resulted in the woman resigning a decade ago.

     ‘Disappointed and shocked’: Scott Morrison distances himself from Hillsong pastor Brian Houston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has distanced himself from his friend and mentor, Hillsong pastor Brian Houston, who has resigned from the church over allegedly inappropriate behaviour towards two women.
“I must admit we were very disappointed and shocked to hear the news,” Morrison said.
However, Morrison has made no secret about his close personal and spiritual connection to Houston, who founded the Hillsong church in Sydney in the early 1980s.
“On that occasion, we put forward a number of names that included Brian, but not everybody whose names we put forward were invited,” Morrison said.
Houston was found to have engaged in conduct “of serious concern” by the church, in two separate incidents over the past decade.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The founder and former head of Australia-born megachurch Hillsong has once again made a public show of stepping away from power, this time amid multiple misconduct allegations, in the form of resignation.
An internal probe found that former Hillsong Church senior global pastor Brian Houston had two “very serious” inappropriate interactions with two women.
Alamy Stock PhotoIn addition to Houston’s formal resignation from the church, Hillsong has purged his preaching from its website, the religion-focused news site Protestia reported.
Representatives for Hillsong have repeatedly denied claims that Brian Houston covered it up to The Post.
Given that this matter is now before the court, neither Pastor Brian or Hillsong Church will be making further statements.
