She also just got COVID-19 for the second time in exactly 140 days.
Biden entered office with three vaccines (all extraordinarily successful at stopping severe disease, hospitalization, or death from COVID-19) ready for the entire adult population of the country.
As evidenced by the saga of Psaki, all that insanity didn't even pay off in the end.
Psaki did everything right by the politically perilous metrics the White House decided to hinge its reputation on.
