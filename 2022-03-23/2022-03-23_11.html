     ANA Responds to Criminal Trial of RaDonda Vaught for Fatal Medication Error
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, the American Nurses Association (ANA) released a statement to express nurses’ concerns regarding the trial of former Nashville nurse RaDonda Vaught.
ANA believes that the criminalization of medical errors could have a chilling effect on reporting and process improvement.
ANA cautions against accidental medical errors being tried in a court of law.
Organizational processes and structures must support a “just culture”, which recognizes that health care professionals can make mistakes and systems may fail.
Transparent, just, and timely reporting mechanisms of medical errors without the fear of criminalization preserve safe patient care environments.

     Accidental injection death of wrong drug: Ex-nurse on trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Murphey had been admitted to the hospital two days earlier after developing a headache and losing vision in one eye.
Vaught could not find Versed in an automatic drug dispensing cabinet because it was listed under the generic name midazolam.
Vaught left the imaging area after injecting the drug, but minutes later another employee noticed Murphey was unresponsive.
She added that the drug she chose was a powder that had to be reconstituted, instead of a liquid.
Defense attorney Peter Strianse told the jury the hospital was at least partially to blame for Murphey's death.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second day of testimony finished on Tuesday for RaDonda Vaught, a former Vanderbilt University Medical Center nurse on trial for the death of a patient in her care.
WTVF TBI Special Agent Romona Smith shows the jury a vial of vecuronium in court on March 23, 2022.
He said Vaught told him she had mistakenly given Murphey vecuronium.
The main nurse for Murphey realized it was vecuronium, and that nurse showed the bag to Vaught.
Vaught told the board that she was distracted while pulling the medication and didn't read the vial to confirm the drug.

     In nurse's trial, witness says hospital bears 'heavy' responsibility for patient death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The health department also alerted the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which began a criminal investigation.
"It seemed odd to me that a 'natural death' came as a result of a medication error," she testified.
"In this case, the review led the [Department of Health] to believe that Vanderbilt Medical Center carried a heavy burden of responsibility in this matter," Smith said.
"Overriding was something we did as part of our practice every day," Vaught testified to the nursing board .
But, on Monday, a witness testified that the hospital's medication cabinets were hampered by technical issues at the time of Murphey's death.

     As a nurse faces prison for a deadly error, her colleagues worry: Could I be next?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Vaught accidentally grabbed vecuronium, a powerful paralyzer, which stopped the patient’s breathing and left her brain-dead before the error was discovered.
The Nashville district attorney’s office declined to discuss Vaught’s trial.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center has repeatedly declined to comment on Vaught’s trial or its procedures.
Vaught’s trial will be followed by nurses nationwide, many of whom worry a conviction may set a precedent even as the coronavirus pandemic leaves countless nurses exhausted, demoralized, and likely more prone to error.
The case hinges on the nurse’s use of an electronic medication cabinet, a computerized device that dispenses a range of drugs.
