     Ja Morant Undergoing Testing On Sore Knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins says that star Ja Morant is undergoing an MRI and X-ray on his sore right knee, according to Mark Giannotto of The Memphis Commercial Appeal (Twitter link).
Strangely, this is the second knee injury Morant has had against Atlanta this season.
At the end of November, Morant sustained a left knee sprain against the Hawks that sidelined him for 12 games.
Through 56 games, Morant is averaging 27.6 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 6.7 APG and 1.2 SPG on .493/.340/.762 shooting.
With the star point guard sidelined, backups Tyus Jones and De’Anthony Melton should see an uptick in minutes.

     Summary: Ja Morant Reveals How His Dad Helps Him Handle The Haters: "Sometimes During The Game, He’s Like ‘You Still Overrated, You Still Suck.’"Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY SportsAhead of his game against Brooklyn on Wednesday, Ja Morant spoke about how his family helps to keep him humble.
“Still, to this day, sometimes during the game he’s like ‘you still overrated, you still suck.’ If I can take it from my dad, nobody else opinion pretty much matters,” Morant said.
Morant, 22, is having the best season of his young career so far.
Through 56 games, he's averaging 27.6 points, 6.7 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game on 49% shooting.
“I think the cool thing for a guy like Ja Morant is he got the opportunity to watch Allen Iverson and Derrick Rose and someone like myself.

     How Ja Morant's custom diamond grill from Johnny Dang created a movement for Memphis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The room was dim, with most of the lights focused on the Memphis Grizzlies star, whose wide smile lit up the room.
Because on that big smile, attached to his teeth, was a glistening honeycomb diamond grill created by celebrity custom jeweler Johnny Dang.
The honeycomb zig-zag diamond grill purchased by Morant, Clarke and Jackson has an estimated value between $25,000 and $35,000.
Charlotte's LaMelo Ball made news in 2020 when he purchased a custom VVS diamond grill similar to Morant, Clarke and Jackson's.
In a 2020 YouTube video with Dang, Morant was asked whether he would wear the grill in a game.

     The 50th Memphis Grizzlies win, without Ja Morant, was the most reassuring of all | Giannotto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was watching what you were watching just as soon as the Memphis Grizzlies beat Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets Wednesday night.
The 50th win of this wonderful Grizzlies regular season had as much glitz and glamour as any and, surprisingly, featured a somewhat ominous quote about Ja Morant’s health.
But with Morant out for the third time in four games, Memphis scored 40 points in the first quarter.
It had Melton doing his best Morant impression, dunking on Nets forward James Johnson and scoring for 23 points.
It's not this false narrative that the Grizzlies are somehow better without Morant, even if they improved to 15-2 without him this season.

     Summary: While Kyrie Irving will be in the Nets’ lineup, Ja Morant will be inactive for the Grizzlies.
Morant was ruled out to play against the Nets well in advance of the game.
With Morant sidelined, the Nets will still need to account for the Grizzlies’ tough defense.
The Grizzlies recently got Dillon Brooks back into their lineup after a two-month absence due to an ankle injury.
His contributions will be needed as a volume scorer with Morant sidelined going against two of the NBA’s elite threats at putting the ball in the basket.

     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies are one of the best teams in the NBA this season, and it’s not necessarily solely because of Ja Morant.
In fact, they are playing way better without their superstar, which they proved once again during Wednesday’s contest against the Brooklyn Nets.
The Grizzlies are 15-2 without Ja Morant this season.
Of course it doesn’t mean they don’t need Ja Morant.
After all, it is their young All-Star that strikes fear into the heart of their opponents, and he is their go-to guy when the going gets tough.

The young Grizzlies, who host the Brooklyn Nets Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
The Grizzlies have gone from being perceived as a fun, young team on the rise to one with a target on it.
The Conley trade yielded a 2019 first-round pick Memphis parlayed into Gonzaga big man Brandon Clarke.
Yet with Morant producing ahead of schedule and a deep bench led by Melton, Tyus Jones and rookie Brandon Clarke (added via the Conley trade), Memphis held the No.
