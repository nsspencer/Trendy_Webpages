     You Are Home: Is Harry Styles teasing a new album? – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Pham via Getty ImagesHarry Styles fans are convinced that the singer is teasing a new album with a mysterious online campaign.
The subject of the speculation is a website, Youarehome.co, which right now is only showing a door.
When you click it, it opens, revealing a bunch of illustrations of different kinds of mushrooms.
Then, on Tuesday, Harry’s social accounts followed the Youarehome Twitter and Instagram accounts, indicating that there’s a link between them.
Another possible clue: those photos of Harry in London in February filming something that had him reclining on a huge bed.

     Harry Styles’s New Album Cover Ushers in a Delicate Style Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles is back!
Styles will be releasing his third album, the follow-up to 2019’s critically-acclaimed and Grammy-winning Fine Line, on May 20, titled simply: Harry’s Home.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a new Harry Styles album if it didn’t usher in a fresh style chapter for the famously chic singer too.
Although given Styles’s playful approach to gendered dressing, it’s not like that would have mattered anyway, with the musician wearing a custom look inspired the brand’s spring 2022 collection.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles has announced his third solo album, “Harry’s House,” due to come out May 20.
Fans had been wondering if Styles’ new album might be called “You Are Home,” since he had been dropping clues in a viral campaign leading to a website using that phrase.
Harry Styles ‘Harry’s House’ album cover artwork Courtesy Columbia RecordsIf it seems like Styles never really went away following his previous album, “Fine Line,” which came out in December 2019, it’s because of a series of successful singles hitting radio and touring plans behind that album being delayed by the pandemic.
“Fine Line” generated two singles that reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Adore You,” which peaked at No.
The European leg of the tour begins June 11 in Glasgow and wraps up July 31 in Portugal.
