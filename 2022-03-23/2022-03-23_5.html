     Summary: Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday for the second time in five months, one day before she was scheduled to join President Biden on a diplomatic trip to Europe.
Ms. Psaki took a test for the virus on Tuesday morning and it came back positive, she said in a statement, adding that she would not join Mr. Biden and top officials at a NATO summit where the president will press allies to use more economic sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Ms. Psaki said that she had two meetings with Mr. Biden on Monday that were socially distanced, and that she and the president were not considered to have been in close contact based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
defines close contact as being less than six feet away from an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more in a 24-hour period.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that she has tested positive for Covid-19.
"That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be travelling on the President's trip to Europe," she said.
Psaki also revealed she had "two socially-distanced meetings" with Biden on Monday and that she's sharing the news of her positive test "out of an abundance of transparency".
"In alignment with White House Covid protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test."
The White House chief spokesperson previously tested positive for Covid in October ahead of Biden's trip to Europe for a climate summit.

     Summary: Jen Psaki has gotten vaccinated three times for the coronavirus, and in accordance with White House protocol, the president's press secretary had worn a mask while at work until the end of last month.
She also just got COVID-19 for the second time in exactly 140 days.
Biden entered office with three vaccines (all extraordinarily successful at stopping severe disease, hospitalization, or death from COVID-19) ready for the entire adult population of the country.
As evidenced by the saga of Psaki, all that insanity didn't even pay off in the end.
Psaki did everything right by the politically perilous metrics the White House decided to hinge its reputation on.

     Biden administration to stop reimbursing hospitals for COVID-19 care for uninsured
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The administration and hospitals are urging lawmakers to approve more funding for the program.
Congressional Republicans have called to repurpose COVID-19 money that states haven’t yet spent, but a number of House Democrats have balked at using money promised to states.
About 50,000 hospitals, doctors and other providers have submitted claims requesting funding from the uninsured program since April 2020, the federal official said.
After that, the medical bills for uninsured COVID-19 patients will depend on each hospital’s financial-aid policy and their prices, both of which can vary widely from one hospital to another.
Prices for the same services are also sharply different across hospitals, with the uninsured often facing the highest prices.
