     Jarran Reed gives Packers much-needed help along defensive line
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: News broke Tuesday afternoon that the Green Bay Packers would be signing veteran defensive tackle Jarran Reed to a one-year deal.
This signing may become one of the more important off-season additions Green Bay has made this year.
Jarran Reed is a bonafide starter on the defensive line, playing in all 17 games last year for the Kansas City Chiefs.
üòÅ ‚Äî Kenny Clark (@KCBoutThatLife) March 22, 2022Alongside Packer fans, Kenny Clark took to Twitter after the news broke that his team had signed help along the D-line by tweeting a smiley face which was followed up by Clark saying, ‚ÄúShout out Gute &amp; nem DL gone be crazy‚Äù.
After this acquisition, the Green Bay Packers‚Äô defensive line is pretty formidable; Rashan Gary, Kenny Clark, Dean Lowry, Jarran Reed and Preston Smith makes for a pretty scary front.

     Jarran Reed finds a new employer with Green Bay Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 23, 2022; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Jarran Reed (90) reacts after his sack of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (not pictured) during the second half of the AFC Divisional playoff football game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
Reed signed a deal with the Green Bay Packers on Tuesday in free agency, per NFL reporter Tom Pelissero.
Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Jarran Reed is going back to the NFC after a single season in the AFC.
Green Bay should feel confident that Reed can still be productive up front both in the run game and as a disruptive pass rusher.
Reed had 43 tackles, 12 quarterback hits, and 2.5 sacks for the Chiefs last season.

     5 things to know about new Packers DL Jarran Reed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY ‚Äì The Packers signed free-agent defensive lineman ÔªøJarran ReedÔªø on Wednesday.
Reed played alongside second-team All-Pro Chris Jones on Kansas City's interior line.
In his career, Reed has played in 89 career regular-season games with 80 starts, missing only two games due to injury.
Those demands would presumably decrease in Green Bay with longtime starters Kenny Clark and Dean Lowry anchoring the Packers' defensive line.
Before going to Alabama in 2014, Reed played the previous two seasons at East Mississippi Community College.
