Miami led the Lakers 31-2 in points off turnovers, after forcing 26 while committing only six despite being without point guard Kyle Lowry — who was out for personal reasons.
LeBron James, who led the Lakers with 27 points, couldn't have agreed more — albeit from a different perspective.
The Heat led by 22 points at one point, their third-largest margin of the season and the biggest since Oct. 26.
