     Talbot shines as Senators beat Bruins 3-2 in shootout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OTTAWA, Ontario — Alex DeBrincat had the only goal of the shootout Tuesday night as the Ottawa Senators snapped a three-game slide with a 3-2 win over the Boston Bruins.
Jeremy Swayman made 30 saves for the Bruins, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.
The teams played through a scoreless first period despite a pair of breakaways by Senators forwards Brady Tkachuk and Stutzle.
He had an empty net to deposit the puck as Talbot was moving the other way expecting the puck to come out the other side.
Senators forward Drake Batherson assisted on both second-period goals and increased his point streak to 11 games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWARK, NJ – Here are the Talking Points from the Boston Bruins 3-1 win over the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center on Wednesday night.
GOLD STAR: The Boston Bruins don’t win on Wednesday night if Linus Ullmark wasn’t standing on his head for long stretches of the game when mismanaged pucks were turning into scoring chances for the Devils.
BY THE NUMBERS: 20-1-1 – the amazing record for Linus Ullmark this season as he continues to backstop the Boston Bruins to wins in tightly-contested games like the one against New Jersey on Wednesday night.
We collapsed a lot, we blocked a lot of shots and we did things we had to do to get the results.
I think that’s what you’re going to see moving forward [this season].” –Patrice Bergeron on a game where the Boston Bruins worked through some early puck management issues to outlast the Devils.

     Bruins’ Zacha Snaps Scoring Slump In Shootout Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It had been over a month since Pavel Zacha had lit the lamp for the Boston Bruins, so it was a welcomed sight when it happened in a key spot for the Black and Golds.
The goal snapped an 18-game goal-scoring drought for Zacha and earned the Boston Bruins a point in a 3-2 shootout loss to the Senators at the Canadian Tire Centre in their first game out of the Christmas break on Tuesday night.
“Our goal was to get better every period.
I thought our first was OK, our second wasn’t as good, give credit to Ottawa there, but I thought the third we really got to our game,” said Boston Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery.
Certainly, that was the case for Zacha as he was his best in the final period in the game sandwiched in between games against his old New Jersey Devils team at his old home rink at the Prudential Center.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrice Bergeron broke a third-period tie, and the Boston Bruins defeated the New Jersey Devils 3-1 at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on Wednesday.
Bergeron tipped a point shot by Hampus Lindholm at the front of the net to put the Bruins ahead 2-1 at 15:51.
"It's just too bad, we played a good game today," Devils forward Erik Haula said.
Lindholm intercepted a clearing attempt by Devils forward Michael McLeod at the blue line and skated to the high slot before leaving a short drop pass for Frederic.
… Devils forward Tyce Thompson was minus-1 in 9:53 in his season debut after being recalled from Utica of the American Hockey League on Wednesday.

     Summary: For the second time in three games, the Boston Bruins defeated the New Jersey Devils, 3-1 at Prudential Center on Wednesday night.
The Bruins improved to 28-4-3 this season, while the Devils fell to 22-11-2 on their campaign and notched their sixth-consecutive home loss.
As opposed to their last win over the Devils, it wouldn’t require seven goals for the Bruins to get back in the win column on the road.
However, Patrice Bergeron rewarded a dominant showing from his fellow Boston teammates with a go-ahead goal in the final period.
With both goaltenders supplying elite net defense, it would be Bruins goalie Linus Ullmark who came out on top.

     Summary: Bruins 3 takeaways as Bruins fall in shootout amid Swayman-Talbot duel Here's what we learned from Boston's 3-2 setback in the Canadian capital.
Justin Tang / The Canadian Press via APThe Ottawa Senators did something that no other team could accomplish yet: beating the Boston Bruins twice.
The Bruins struggled in the second in a rare middle-20 relapse where they fought the puck more often than not.
I want a lot of shots, and I want to be challenged,” Swayman said following his 30-save outing.
With the secondary man advantage on the ice, Zacha beat Talbot on the short-side post for his first tally since Nov. 13.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins emerged from their holiday break Tuesday night with just one point after a 3-2 shootout loss to the Senators at Canadian Tire Centre.
Boston came back in the third period to tie the game but couldn’t get the job finished thanks in part to a stellar 49-save performance from Cam Talbot for Ottawa.
The Bruins struggled to find their legs until the third and were able to force overtime, but Talbot ended up being too much in the end.
The goalie made 49 saves which, according to StatsCentre, is the most by a Senators netminder in a regular season win.
It was a barrage of shots, so we gave him our best chance, and I give credit where it?s due.”
