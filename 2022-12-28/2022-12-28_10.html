     Talbot shines as Senators beat Bruins 3-2 in shootout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OTTAWA, Ontario — Alex DeBrincat had the only goal of the shootout Tuesday night as the Ottawa Senators snapped a three-game slide with a 3-2 win over the Boston Bruins.
Jeremy Swayman made 30 saves for the Bruins, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.
The teams played through a scoreless first period despite a pair of breakaways by Senators forwards Brady Tkachuk and Stutzle.
He had an empty net to deposit the puck as Talbot was moving the other way expecting the puck to come out the other side.
Senators forward Drake Batherson assisted on both second-period goals and increased his point streak to 11 games.

     Bruins’ Zacha Snaps Scoring Slump In Shootout Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It had been over a month since Pavel Zacha had lit the lamp for the Boston Bruins, so it was a welcomed sight when it happened in a key spot for the Black and Golds.
The goal snapped an 18-game goal-scoring drought for Zacha and earned the Boston Bruins a point in a 3-2 shootout loss to the Senators at the Canadian Tire Centre in their first game out of the Christmas break on Tuesday night.
“Our goal was to get better every period.
I thought our first was OK, our second wasn’t as good, give credit to Ottawa there, but I thought the third we really got to our game,” said Boston Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery.
Certainly, that was the case for Zacha as he was his best in the final period in the game sandwiched in between games against his old New Jersey Devils team at his old home rink at the Prudential Center.

     Summary: For the second time in three games, the Boston Bruins defeated the New Jersey Devils, 3-1 at Prudential Center on Wednesday night.
The Bruins improved to 28-4-3 this season, while the Devils fell to 22-11-2 on their campaign and notched their sixth-consecutive home loss.
As opposed to their last win over the Devils, it wouldn’t require seven goals for the Bruins to get back in the win column on the road.
However, Patrice Bergeron rewarded a dominant showing from his fellow Boston teammates with a go-ahead goal in the final period.
With both goaltenders supplying elite net defense, it would be Bruins goalie Linus Ullmark who came out on top.

     Summary: Linus Ullmark recorded 30 saves (a good percentage of them being the high-quality variety) and the B’s got the key late goal to beat the New Jersey Devils, 3-1, at the Prudential Center on Wednesday.
Ullmark, the leading Vezina Trophy candidate, improved to 20-1-1 with a 1.94 goals against average and .936 save percentage.
“It’s finding ways to win hockey games,” said Bergeron, when asked what has distinguished this Bruins team on TNT.
The Devils outshot the B’s 14-8 in the first, despite the fact that the B’s had the only power play, which was ineffective.
But they couldn’t cash in on the first and then quickly wiped out their second with a Bergeron penalty.

     Summary: Bruins 3 takeaways as Bruins fall in shootout amid Swayman-Talbot duel Here's what we learned from Boston's 3-2 setback in the Canadian capital.
Justin Tang / The Canadian Press via APThe Ottawa Senators did something that no other team could accomplish yet: beating the Boston Bruins twice.
The Bruins struggled in the second in a rare middle-20 relapse where they fought the puck more often than not.
I want a lot of shots, and I want to be challenged,” Swayman said following his 30-save outing.
With the secondary man advantage on the ice, Zacha beat Talbot on the short-side post for his first tally since Nov. 13.
