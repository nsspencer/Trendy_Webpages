     Summary: The Tennessee Titans have ruled eight players out for their game Thursday night against the Dallas Cowboys and listed three more as doubtful to play.

As such, a number of Titans who are battling through injuries are either out or doubtful for this contest.

     Jeffery Simmons among 4 Titans out on defense, Derrick Henry doubtful
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have ruled out a slew of starters for Thursday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Tennessee's offense could be without Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry, who is listed as doubtful because of a hip injury sustained in Saturday's 19-14 loss to the Houston Texans.
Right tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere (ankle) and Ryan Tannehill (ankle) are the only offensive starters listed as out.
Tannehill had surgery on his ankle last week, leaving rookie Malik Willis to start the final three games of the season.
"You make a decision that is in the best interests of the football team," Vrabel said.

     Summary: The Tennessee Titans will be without their starting running back on Thursday Night Football, as he has been listed as doubtful to play against the Cowboys.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesIt’s a good thing for the Titans that Thursday night’s game against the Cowboys doesn’t particularly matter, because they’re going to be shorthanded.
The injury report for the Titans, who will win the AFC South if they beat the Jaguars in Week 18 regardless of what happens on Thursday night, includes eight players listed as out and three listed as doubtful.
Of greatest interest to NFL fans is that Titans running back Derrick Henry is listed as doubtful.
Also doubtful are cornerback Kristian Fulton and outside linebacker Denico Autry.
Listed as out are quarterback Ryan Tannehill, defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, offensive tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere, safety Amani Hooker, outside linebacker Bud Dupree, linebacker Zach Cunningham, linebacker Dylan Cole and defensive back Josh Thompson.

     Derrick Henry (hip) doubtful vs. Cowboys as eight Titans ruled out for Thursday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derrick Henry has been designated as doubtful to play on Thursday against the Dallas Cowboys, while the Tennessee Titans have ruled out eight other players.
Officially listed as doubtful, it's unlikely the Music City workhorse will play for a Titans squad that will feature second-stringers aplenty.
The Titans (7-8) and Jaguars (7-8) will play in the final week of the season with the division title at stake regardless of their Week 17 outcomes.
Thus, the Titans, who have been banged up most of the season, will face the Cowboys (11-4) with many of their remaining top players sidelined.
The Cowboys have some injury issues, as well, with linebacker Micah Parsons (illness) and running back Tony Pollard (thigh) questionable.
