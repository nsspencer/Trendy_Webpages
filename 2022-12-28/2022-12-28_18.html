That defeat cost them the leadership of the AFC South Division.
Tennessee is tied with Jacksonville at 7-8, and whoever wins the Week 18 matchup will win the AFC South.
They sit in second place in the NFC East, behind the league-leading Philadelphia Eagles, and have already secured a spot in the NFL playoffs bracket.
