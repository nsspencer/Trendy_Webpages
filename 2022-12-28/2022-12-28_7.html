     Terrell Owens, Cowboys reportedly unable to agree on contract details
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys have been checking out their options for reinforcements at wide receiver, but they will not get any from the legendary Terrell Owens.
According to NFL reporter Dov Kleiman, Owens wanted more money from the team, and the contract talks fell apart.
"We've been in constant communication with Jerry Jones' office over the last few days about the possibility of him returning to the Cowboys," Daniel said.
Already in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Owens totaled 1,078 receptions, 15,934 yards and 153 touchdowns throughout his career.
In three seasons with the Cowboys, Owens caught 235 passes for 3,587 yards, and 38 touchdowns.

     Terrell Owens to the Cowboys? Agent claims T.O. has been in contact with Jerry Jones about NFL comeback at 49
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Terrell Owens hasn't been on an NFL roster since 2012, but the Hall of Fame receiver is still looking to return to the NFL.
And there is at least one team that is interested in seeing what Owens can do, according to his agent Gregory D.L.
Daniel told Sports Illustrated's Aaron Wilson that he and Owens had been "in constant communication with Jerry Jones' office" in recent days.
Update: Despite the communication, Terrell Owens won't be signing with the #Cowboys at this time, according to a source.

     Summary: Update: Despite the communication, Terrell Owens won't be signing with the #Cowboys at this time, according to a source.
A return would make Owens, who turned 49 on Dec. 7, the oldest player ever to play in the NFL.
"Terrell is ready to contribute and play any role, big or small," Daniel told SI.com.
"I've already kind of sprinkled some words out there, like, 'Yo, if you guys need a receiver, I'm good," Owens told 95.7 The Game's "The Morning Roast."
Owens told NBC in May that he felt his performance proved he's ready for an NFL comeback.

     Facepalm: Terrell Owens somehow inserted himself into Cowboys' atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Because at 49 years old, Terrell Owens is apparently interested in swapping his gold jacket for a pair of shoulder pads.
https://t.co/73Et4hAciR — Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) December 28, 2022Didn’t even notice that we checked the Terrell Owens square on Cowboys bingo.
The former third-round draft pick turned in stints in the Indoor Football League, American Flag Football League, Canadian Football League, and Fan Controlled Football venture, but maintains that he has been training- including recent workouts with DeSean Jackson- and “is in optimal condition” as he makes his latest comeback attempt.
Owens expressed dismay at his 2009 release from the Cowboys, saying then that owner Jerry Jones had assured him he’d remain with the club.
But with Terrell Owens and Jerry Jones, never say never.
