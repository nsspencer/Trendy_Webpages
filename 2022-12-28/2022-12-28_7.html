     Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is Lucid and Stable` – NBC Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is lucid, conscious and stable but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday, a day after it revealed that the 95-year-old's health had deteriorated recently.
The Vatican later said Benedict's health had deteriorated in recent hours but that the situation was under control as doctors monitored him.
Benedict in 2013 became the first pope in 600 years to retire, and he chose to live out his retirement in seclusion in a converted monastery in the Vatican Gardens.
Few had expected his retirement — now in its 10th year — to last longer than his eight-year reign as pope.
Otherwise, while the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano headlined its Thursday editions with news of Benedict’s health, life continued as normal in the tiny city-state that Benedict and Pope Francis call home.

     Pope Benedict: Former pontiff's condition 'serious but stable', Vatican says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rome CNN —Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is “lucid and vigilant” but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday in an update on the former pontiff’s health.
“Pope Francis renews his invitation to pray for him and accompany him in these difficult hours.”Pope Francis announced Wednesday that his 95-year-old predecessor was “very sick” after a deterioration in his health.
“I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence.
In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing his “advanced age.”Benedict’s announcement marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years.
Benedict later pushed back against those allegations, admitting he had attended the meeting but denying he intentionally concealed his presence.
