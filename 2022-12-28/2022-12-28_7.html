    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U2 feels like the most underserved of the honorees, as the musical tributes roll out, although that’s not entirely the fault of the producers.
Eddie Vedder appears during THE 45TH ANNUAL KENNEDY CENTER HONORS, broadcasting on Wednesday, Dec. 28 (8:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network and stream live and on demand on Paramount+.
(L-R) Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby appear during THE 45TH ANNUAL KENNEDY CENTER HONORS, broadcasting on Wednesday, Dec. 28 (8:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network and stream live and on demand on Paramount+.
This type of performance is something we’re never going to see on the Grammys again, that’s for certain.
So here’s to “The Kennedy Center Honors” as one of the last places where Anna Devere Smith is likely to suddenly show up in our living rooms and make us feel like we should’ve been wearing something a little more formal than our Santa PJs.
