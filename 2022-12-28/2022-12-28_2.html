     Summary: As the Las Vegas Raiders prepare for their Week 17 clash against the 49ers on Sunday, they’ll do so with Jarrett Stidham, not Derek Carr, as their QB1.
Raiders coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that the team will bench Carr for Stidham in the final two games of the 2022 NFL season.
pic.twitter.com/1rdhTSsNKr — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) December 28, 2022Rookie quarterback Chase Garbers will serve as Stidham's backup, while Carr will be inactive for Sunday's Raiders-49ers game.
This season, Carr has thrown a league-leading 14 interceptions, including three on Saturday in Las Vegas' 13-10 Christmas Eve loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Despite their current 6-9 record, Las Vegas hasn't been eliminated from playoff contention officially and still could push to the postseason.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- The Las Vegas Raiders are benching Derek Carr, the team's starting quarterback since 2014, first-year coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday.
Consecutive starts at QB: Active streaks Derek Carr has started 91 straight games, the second-longest active streak among quarterbacks.
The last time he did not start was Week 5 of the 2017 season against the Ravens when EJ Manuel made the start.
Carr has struggled in his first season under the Raiders' new regime of McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler.
Carr has an NFL-high and career-high-tying 14 interceptions, and his passer rating of 86.3 is his lowest since his rookie season.

     Derek Carr benched by Raiders, who was drafted by Saints HC Dennis Allen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that quarterback Derek Carr has been benched for the remainder of the 2022 season, with Jarett Stidham planned to start in his place and Chase Garbers promoted to backup.
Sidelining Carr at this stage protects the Raiders from owning Carr much money in the 2023 offseason, giving them an opportunity to move on.
And Carr, of course, was drafted back in 2014 — during Dennis Allen’s final year with the Raiders, with Allen’s team selecting Carr at No.
Now he’s the New Orleans Saints head coach.
Could Allen make a move for Carr in the months ahead and get them together in New Orleans?

     Raiders to park Derek Carr, start Jarrett Stidham vs. 49ers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders benched Derek Carr to start Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the regular season in what could be the beginning of a changing of the guard at quarterback.
Coach Josh McDaniels said the Raiders are eager to evaluate Stidham and outlined plans for the final two games, which include making Carr inactive on game day.
Stidham, 26, will make his first career start for the Raiders (6-9) on Sunday against the visiting San Francisco 49ers.
"We're gonna go ahead and start Jarrett the last couple of games of the season here," McDaniels said.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham: What's next for QB, plus logical 2023 landing spots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Media, Carr will step away for the final two games of the regular season to avoid distractions.
The veteran just this offseason signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension tying him to Las Vegas through 2025, and was a catalyst for the team's blockbuster acquisition of wide receiver Davante Adams.
While he doesn't necessarily project as the Raiders' QB beyond 2022, it's fair to say the same about his predecessor.
They've got the cap space to make it work.
Coach Dennis Allen, meanwhile, knows Carr from his time as Raiders coach, leading the team in 2014 when Carr was drafted.
