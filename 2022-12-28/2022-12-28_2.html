     Summary: VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Saying that retired Pope Benedict XVI was "very sick," Pope Francis asked people to offer special prayers for him.
"I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for emeritus Pope Benedict," Pope Francis said at the end of his weekly general audience Dec. 28.
The 95-year-old retired pope "is sustaining the church in silence," Pope Francis said.
"Ask the Lord to console him and sustain him in his witness of love for the church until the very end," Pope Francis said.

     Former Pope Benedict is ‘very sick’, Pope Francis says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rome CNN —Pope Francis has said that his predecessor Pope Benedict, the 95-year-old former pontiff who resigned from the post nine years ago, is “very sick” after a deterioration in his health on Wednesday.
“I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence.
He is very sick,” Francis said during his general audience at the Vatican on Wednesday.
In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing “advanced age.”Benedict’s announcement marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years.
Benedict later pushed back against those allegations, admitting he had attended the meeting but denying he intentionally concealed his presence.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis' announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden "worsening" of his health.
Francis, who visited the former pontiff after making the announcement, has often praised Benedict, saying it was like having a grandfather at home.
Conservatives have looked to the former pope as their standard bearer and some ultra-traditionalists even refused to acknowledge Francis as a legitimate pontiff.
They have criticised Francis for his more welcoming approach to gays and to Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church, saying both were undermining traditional values.
