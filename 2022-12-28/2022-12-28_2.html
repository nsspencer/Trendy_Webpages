     Report: Gervonta Davis Arrested on a Battery Domestic Violence Charge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Bello/Getty ImagesUndefeated lightweight boxing champion Gervonta Davis was reportedly arrested Tuesday in Florida on a domestic violence charge.
According to TMZ Sports, police records show Davis was still in police custody as of early Wednesday morning.
The arrest occurred just days before Davis' Jan. 7 fight against Héctor García, which is a tune-up for his clash with undefeated Ryan Garcia scheduled for April 15, according to Coppinger.
In addition to previously holding super featherweight and super lightweight titles, Davis defeated Yuriorkis Gamboa for the vacant WBA (Regular) lightweight title in 2019, and he is still in possession of that championship.
Davis vs. Ryan Garcia is the superfight boxing fans have been waiting for, however, as Garcia has an unblemished record, much like Davis, at 23-0.
