     Raiders to sit Derek Carr: What this means for the QB’s future in Las Vegas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Raiders have decided to sit Derek Carr on Sunday against the 49ers and start backup Jarrett Stidham.
BackstoryIt will only be the fourth game Carr has missed in nine seasons and the first not due to injury.
The move to bench him and start Stidham would appear to be a clear sign that the team plans to move on from Carr in the offseason.
What they’re sayingMcDaniels told reporters Wednesday that the Raiders are going to start Stidham over Carr because “it’s an opportunity to evaluate a younger player.”“We’ll see how this goes going forward.
I’m not going to sit here and predict the future,” McDaniels said when asked about Carr’s future.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was announced on Wednesday that the Las Vegas Raiders would be benching quarterback Derek Carr.
Raiders are benching Derek Carr and turning to Jarrett Stidham as their new starting QB.
Carr has thrown a league-leading 14 interceptions— including three Saturday night during a 13-10 loss to the Steelers.
Since taking over, Las Vegas hasn’t won the division but made the playoffs in both 2016 and 2021.
If Las Vegas decides to move on from Carr, where could he go?

     Derek Carr benched by Raiders, who was drafted by Saints HC Dennis Allen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that quarterback Derek Carr has been benched for the remainder of the 2022 season, with Jarett Stidham planned to start in his place and Chase Garbers promoted to backup.
Sidelining Carr at this stage protects the Raiders from owning Carr much money in the 2023 offseason, giving them an opportunity to move on.
And Carr, of course, was drafted back in 2014 — during Dennis Allen’s final year with the Raiders, with Allen’s team selecting Carr at No.
Now he’s the New Orleans Saints head coach.
Could Allen make a move for Carr in the months ahead and get them together in New Orleans?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders benched Derek Carr to start Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the regular season in what could be the beginning of a changing of the guard at quarterback.
Coach Josh McDaniels said the Raiders are eager to evaluate Stidham and outlined plans for the final two games, which include making Carr inactive on game day.
Stidham, 26, will make his first career start for the Raiders (6-9) on Sunday against the visiting San Francisco 49ers.
"We're gonna go ahead and start Jarrett the last couple of games of the season here," McDaniels said.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.
