     Summary: Mr. Santos, who is Catholic, said he was “Jew-ish” not Jewish.
Questions emerged about Mr. Santos’ claims after he won the race for New York’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island.
I think I’ve gone through this even not being raised a practicing Jew,” Mr. Santos said.
Another New York Republican, Rep.-elect Anthony D’esposito, criticized Mr. Santos’ fabrications but stopped short of calling for an ethics probe.
Mr. Santos has one public supporter on social media.

     Summary: ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard asked George SantosFormer Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tore into George Santos live on Fox News Wednesday night, questioning whether the Republican congressman-elect has any 'shame' over the lies he told about his background.
Gabbard, a former Democrat who recently registered as an Independent and endorsed Republican candidates in the midterms, told Santos: 'This isn't about the Democratic Party.'
Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition has banned Congressman-elect George Santos for fabricating both his work history and his Jewish background.
'Not being raised a practicing Jew, I've always joked with friends and circles, even within the campaign, I'd say, guys, I'm 'Jew-ish.'
Despite the blatant deception, Santos told the Post he has no intention of stepping aside and still intends to take office in the new year.
