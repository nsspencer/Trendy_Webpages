As such, a number of Titans who are battling through injuries are either out or doubtful for this contest.

     Jeffery Simmons among 4 Titans out on defense, Derrick Henry doubtful
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have ruled out a slew of starters for Thursday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Tennessee's offense could be without Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry, who is listed as doubtful because of a hip injury sustained in Saturday's 19-14 loss to the Houston Texans.
Right tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere (ankle) and Ryan Tannehill (ankle) are the only offensive starters listed as out.
Tannehill had surgery on his ankle last week, leaving rookie Malik Willis to start the final three games of the season.
"You make a decision that is in the best interests of the football team," Vrabel said.

     Summary: Star running back Derrick Henry has been downgraded to doubtful for Thursday night's matchup between the Titans and Dallas Cowboys.
That Week 18 battle is why Vrabel is being extra cautious with his players this week.
Even if the Titans lose and the Jaguars win this week, winning in Week 18 would send the Titans to the playoffs.
And if Jacksonville beats Houston this week, both teams will head into their Week 18 matchup with a 3-2 division record.

     Derrick Henry (hip) doubtful vs. Cowboys as eight Titans ruled out for Thursday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derrick Henry has been designated as doubtful to play on Thursday against the Dallas Cowboys, while the Tennessee Titans have ruled out eight other players.
Officially listed as doubtful, it's unlikely the Music City workhorse will play for a Titans squad that will feature second-stringers aplenty.
The Titans (7-8) and Jaguars (7-8) will play in the final week of the season with the division title at stake regardless of their Week 17 outcomes.
Thus, the Titans, who have been banged up most of the season, will face the Cowboys (11-4) with many of their remaining top players sidelined.
The Cowboys have some injury issues, as well, with linebacker Micah Parsons (illness) and running back Tony Pollard (thigh) questionable.
