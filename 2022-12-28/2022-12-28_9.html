     NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens, 49, eyes return to Cowboys: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys were in the market for Odell Beckham Jr., but they may go another, much older route (no pun intended) in the receiver market.
The agent of NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens, who played for Dallas from 2006-08, has been in "constant communication" with the Cowboys regarding a possible return, according to Sports Illustrated.
Daniel claims that Owens recently ran a 4.50 40-yard dash — "which was his warm-up."
Owens ranks third all-time in receiving touchdowns (153) behind Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, while his 15,934 receiving yards trail those of Rice and Larry Fitzgerald.

     Summary: Update: Despite the communication, Terrell Owens won't be signing with the #Cowboys at this time, according to a source.
A return would make Owens, who turned 49 on Dec. 7, the oldest player ever to play in the NFL.
"Terrell is ready to contribute and play any role, big or small," Daniel told SI.com.
"I've already kind of sprinkled some words out there, like, 'Yo, if you guys need a receiver, I'm good," Owens told 95.7 The Game's "The Morning Roast."
Owens told NBC in May that he felt his performance proved he's ready for an NFL comeback.

     Facepalm: Terrell Owens somehow inserted himself into Cowboys' atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Because at 49 years old, Terrell Owens is apparently interested in swapping his gold jacket for a pair of shoulder pads.
https://t.co/73Et4hAciR — Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) December 28, 2022Didn’t even notice that we checked the Terrell Owens square on Cowboys bingo.
The former third-round draft pick turned in stints in the Indoor Football League, American Flag Football League, Canadian Football League, and Fan Controlled Football venture, but maintains that he has been training- including recent workouts with DeSean Jackson- and “is in optimal condition” as he makes his latest comeback attempt.
Owens expressed dismay at his 2009 release from the Cowboys, saying then that owner Jerry Jones had assured him he’d remain with the club.
But with Terrell Owens and Jerry Jones, never say never.
