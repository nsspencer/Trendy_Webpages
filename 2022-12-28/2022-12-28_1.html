    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it turned out, leaving the Celtics for the Lakers was a right decision for Fox.
Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox © Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY via INBA fans may remember Rick Fox as one of the best wing players in the Shaq-Kobe era of the Los Angeles Lakers.
It didn’t take long before all parties came to terms and agreed on a staggering $33 million deal.
So instead of making $33 million, I was pretty much available for $1 million.
With the Lakers, Fox’s role was reduced, but he became part of a dynasty that copped three consecutive NBA titles.
