     Lakers News: Los Angeles Plummets Down Latest ESPN Power Rankings - All Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Your 14-20 Los Angeles Lakers have been absolutely miserable without their best overall player, two-way behemoth Anthony Davis.
A variety of mostly market-based ESPN scribes (Golden State Warriors writer Kendra Andrews, Midwest team writer Jamal Collier, Brooklyn Nets beat reporter Nick Friedell, New Orleans Pelicans beat reporter Andrew Lopez, Southwest scribe Tim MacMahon, Lakers beat reporter Dave McMenamin, Clippers beat reporter Ohm Youngmisuk, and Tim Bontemps) put together today's latest power rankings list, and the Lakers have continued their ignominious slide down it.
Last week, the Lakers were merely ranked in 21st place by the ESPN cognoscenti.
The New Orleans Pelicans, who as you'll recall possess the right to swap draft picks with the Lakers next year, have vaulted up two positions to sixth place.
So they may wind up having one of the best teams this year, and could get an opportunity to act exciting young lottery-level talent next year to boot!

     Lakers News: LeBron James Cagey About Availability Vs. Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will King James suit up on the second night of a back-to-back?
Last night, Los Angeles Lakers All-Star LeBron James led the club's 129-110 victory over the Orlando Magic with a stellar 28 points on 12-of-24 shooting.
Though his 14-20 Lakers don't seem headed to the postseason, LeBron James still seems like he's head to Salt Lake City for the 2023 All-Star Game.
James was asked after the matchup (it sounds like ESPN's Dave McMenamin is inquiring) if he intended to play the second game of L.A.'s back-to-back Florida swing, tomorrow night against the Miami Heat.
Thus far, the 18-time All-Star has sat out for three of the Lakers' four back-to-back game sets this season.

     Summary: LeBron James is on the injury report for Wednesday’s game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat.
On Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Lakers are taking on the Miami Heat in Florida.
For the game, they could be without their best player, as LeBron James is listed as questionable.
Undergo NBA: "LeBron James (ankle) questionable Wednesday."
James won the first two NBA Championships of his career with the Heat (he played with the franchise for four seasons, beginning in 2010-2011).

     NBA Odds: Lakers vs. Heat prediction, odds and pick – 12/28/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Aidan Cotter · 4 min readThe Los Angeles Lakers (14-20) visit the Miami Heat (17-17) on Wednesday night.
He was fully unleashed last night and the results paid dividends for a Lakers team struggling to find consistent offensive production.
That being said, he’s excelled off the bench this year and now finds himself as a major factor in LA’s ability to cover tonight.
The Lakers are very weak down low with Anthony Davis hurt – seeing Robinson up for a big night if Adebayo misses again.
Final Lakers-Heat Prediction &amp; PickAfter LA’s big win last night, I like them to keep things close against a Miami team that struggles offensively.

     Loss to Los Angeles Lakers a blessing in disguise for the Orlando Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 27: Paolo Banchero #5 of the Orlando Magic reacts against the Los Angeles Lakers during the third quarter at Amway Center on December 27, 2022 in Orlando, Florida.
Yet this had the feeling of a loss that did not do a lot to damage the psyche of the Orlando Magic and in actual fact, may have been a blessing in disguise moving forward.
That any game against a perceived inferior opponent was going to result in a Magic win.
The Magic are going to win games against teams they should not be beating (such as the Boston Celtics, who they recently beat twice), and lose games to teams like the Los Angeles Lakers.
A lapse like the Lakers loss serves only to show the group the hard work is not over.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers will hope to complete their back-to-back set with another victory when they take on the Miami Heat Wednesday.
The Lakers hope to have LeBron James in the lineup after he went for 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists in Tuesday’s win over the Magic.
LeBron James injury updatesJames is officially listed as questionable with the ankle injury he’s been nursing for most of the season.
James sat previous back-to-back sets with this ankle injury, so this “questionable” designation can be taken in two different ways.
The Lakers are heavy underdogs against the Heat on the moneyline at DraftKings Sportsbook, and that gap will grow even more if James is ruled out.
