     Andrew Tate Comes At Greta Thunberg – And Misses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest person to learn this lesson is Andrew Tate, noted misogynist and right-wing provocateur who rejects the #MeToo movement and says he believes women are men’s property and shouldn’t drive.
Tate decided to tweet at Greta Thunberg, the acclaimed 19-year-old climate activist who made headlines when she took a year off of school to travel around the world and meet leading climate experts, this morning about how many cars he owns.
“I have 33 cars,” he tweeted.
Who knows what prompted a 36-year-old man to tweet at a teenager about how many cars he owns and how much carbon emissions he’s responsible for?
