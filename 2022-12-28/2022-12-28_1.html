     Lakers News: How Sharing The Ball Saved The Day For L.A.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, your Los Angeles Lakers managed to fend off the Orlando Magic to secure their first win in the past five games, 129-110, and just their second overall since losing All-Star center Anthony Davis to a right foot stress injury.
The team did that, in part, by stepping up their passing game.
The Lakers registered 32 assists on the night, seven better than the Magic.
Predictably, the game's best passers for L.A. were All-Star forward LeBron James, who had five, and Sixth Man of the Year contender Russell Westbrook, who had 13.
For the year, Los Angeles is averaging 24.7 assists a game, the 14th-best such sum in the NBA, per ESPN.

     NBA Odds: Lakers vs. Heat prediction, odds and pick – 12/28/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Aidan Cotter · 4 min readThe Los Angeles Lakers (14-20) visit the Miami Heat (17-17) on Wednesday night.
He was fully unleashed last night and the results paid dividends for a Lakers team struggling to find consistent offensive production.
That being said, he’s excelled off the bench this year and now finds himself as a major factor in LA’s ability to cover tonight.
The Lakers are very weak down low with Anthony Davis hurt – seeing Robinson up for a big night if Adebayo misses again.
Final Lakers-Heat Prediction &amp; PickAfter LA’s big win last night, I like them to keep things close against a Miami team that struggles offensively.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers will hope to complete their back-to-back set with another victory when they take on the Miami Heat Wednesday.
The Lakers hope to have LeBron James in the lineup after he went for 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists in Tuesday’s win over the Magic.
LeBron James injury updatesWednesday PM update - James is listed as available and will suit up for the Lakers tonight.
James is officially listed as questionable with the ankle injury he’s been nursing for most of the season.
James sat previous back-to-back sets with this ankle injury, so this “questionable” designation can be taken in two different ways.

     Loss to Los Angeles Lakers a blessing in disguise for the Orlando Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 27: Paolo Banchero #5 of the Orlando Magic reacts against the Los Angeles Lakers during the third quarter at Amway Center on December 27, 2022 in Orlando, Florida.
Yet this had the feeling of a loss that did not do a lot to damage the psyche of the Orlando Magic and in actual fact, may have been a blessing in disguise moving forward.
That any game against a perceived inferior opponent was going to result in a Magic win.
The Magic are going to win games against teams they should not be beating (such as the Boston Celtics, who they recently beat twice), and lose games to teams like the Los Angeles Lakers.
A lapse like the Lakers loss serves only to show the group the hard work is not over.

     Summary: Sometimes you wonder if the Lakers’ season can be saved.
And sometimes you watch a game like last night’s and hope they’re at least given the chance.
It was the Lakers’ first win in five games, leaving them 14-20 and out of the playoff picture at this point, but it felt notable.
But this time, what, if anything, was Lakers management doing in response to James’ very credible criticism of the roster?
Maybe the most competitive game at CCA so far this season.” – Kings beat writer Andrew Knoll (@AndrewKnollNHL) during last night’s game at Crypto.com Arena.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (14-20) face the Heat (17-17) on Wednesday evening in Miami for their first meeting of the season.
“We did a lot of things we needed to cleanup ourselves, and it was more about us.”The Lakers countered Orlando’s length by scrapping on the glass, outrebounding the Magic 46-37.
“It’s contagious, like you saw tonight.”BACK-TO-BACKFor the fifth time this season, the Lakers are in the midst of a back-to-back set of games, with Miami awaiting.
The Heat, meanwhile, are 3-0 with a rest advantage against a team that played the previous night.
The Heat are much closer to the team that faced L.A. in the 2020 NBA Finals, with the exception of a few players, while only LeBron and (injured) Anthony Davis remain for the Lakers.
