     Derek Carr's potential landing spots in 2023: Raiders QB on his way out of Las Vegas after benching?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants have not tipped their hand on what the plans are for Daniel Jones, whose fifth-year option was not picked up prior to this season.
Jones has played well in 2022, especially when it comes to ball security.
He’s also seen an uptick in his completion percentage and has weaponized his running ability like never before.
The Giants might not be ready to give up on a 25-year-old QB and could franchise tag Jones this offseason.
If not, the Giants’ respectable record this season might not put them in a position to draft his successor immediately.

     Davante Adams: Derek Carr is 'the reason I'm a Raider'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adams wrote on Instagram that Carr, his former college teammate at Fresno State, is the primary reason he wanted the Green Bay Packers to trade him to Las Vegas.
Adams, 30, has 88 catches for 1,290 yards and an NFL high-tying 12 touchdowns in 15 games (all starts) this season.
He was picked off three times in Las Vegas' 13-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday.
Carr signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension in April and is under contract through 2025.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.

     Why Derek Carr and the Raiders are likely headed towards a divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, Davis brings in Patriot acolytes McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler, and lets them make the decision with Carr.
Speaking of second halves, the Raiders this season are 0-4 with a double digit lead at halftime, the first team to wear that dubious crown.
In Mark Davis’ eyes, Carr simply hasn’t been good enough—he never was.
If Carr were to get injured, that $24.9 million goes up to $33 million fully guaranteed.
Carr has withstood the toughest of times with the Raiders.

     Derek Carr steps away from Las Vegas Raiders after surprise benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has missed only three games in nine years, all because of injury.
Now, for the first time, he won’t play because of what coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday were offensive performance reasons.
“I don’t think anybody feels like we’ve done enough offensively certainly in a couple of these games,” McDaniels said.
Carr was not at the Raiders’ facility, and Stidham was expected to address reporters Thursday.
Including three games with the Raiders this season, Stidham has completed 32 of 61 passes for 342 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham: What's next for QB, plus logical 2023 landing spots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Media, Carr will step away for the final two games of the regular season to avoid distractions.
The veteran just this offseason signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension tying him to Las Vegas through 2025, and was a catalyst for the team's blockbuster acquisition of wide receiver Davante Adams.
While he doesn't necessarily project as the Raiders' QB beyond 2022, it's fair to say the same about his predecessor.
They've got the cap space to make it work.
Coach Dennis Allen, meanwhile, knows Carr from his time as Raiders coach, leading the team in 2014 when Carr was drafted.

     Raiders' Davante Adams has straightforward reaction to Derek Carr benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams had a straightforward reaction to Derek Carr benching originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonJosh McDaniels' controversial decision could have long-term consequences in Las Vegas.
But Carr is a popular figure in the locker room and is especially close with top wide receiver Davante Adams, his college teammate at Fresno State who joined the Raiders in 2022 to play with Carr.
"Obviously, I don't think anybody was excited about it in here," Adams said Wednesday of Carr's benching, via ESPN's Paul Gutierrez.
Carr reportedly is stepping away from the team altogether to allow Stidham -- who played under McDaniels in New England -- to take the reins.
If that's the path McDaniels and the Raiders choose, they may be dealing with a disgruntled No.
