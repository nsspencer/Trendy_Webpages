     Derek Carr steps away from Las Vegas Raiders after surprise benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has missed only three games in nine years, all because of injury.
Now, for the first time, he won’t play because of what coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday were offensive performance reasons.
“I don’t think anybody feels like we’ve done enough offensively certainly in a couple of these games,” McDaniels said.
Carr was not at the Raiders’ facility, and Stidham was expected to address reporters Thursday.
Including three games with the Raiders this season, Stidham has completed 32 of 61 passes for 342 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions.

     Davante Adams: Derek Carr is 'the reason I'm a Raider'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adams wrote on Instagram that Carr, his former college teammate at Fresno State, is the primary reason he wanted the Green Bay Packers to trade him to Las Vegas.
Adams, 30, has 88 catches for 1,290 yards and an NFL high-tying 12 touchdowns in 15 games (all starts) this season.
He was picked off three times in Las Vegas' 13-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday.
Carr signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension in April and is under contract through 2025.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.

     Derek Carr's potential landing spots in 2023: Raiders QB on his way out of Las Vegas after benching?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants have not tipped their hand on what the plans are for Daniel Jones, whose fifth-year option was not picked up prior to this season.
Jones has played well in 2022, especially when it comes to ball security.
He’s also seen an uptick in his completion percentage and has weaponized his running ability like never before.
The Giants might not be ready to give up on a 25-year-old QB and could franchise tag Jones this offseason.
If not, the Giants’ respectable record this season might not put them in a position to draft his successor immediately.

     Summary: Viva Tom Brady.
The Raiders wouldn’t bench Carr if he was their surefire franchise quarterback for the foreseeable future.
Josh McDaniels and Tom Brady flourished together for years in New England.
And did the Raiders really bench Carr right now to leave things to chance?
And it makes all the sense in the world that it would start with Tom Brady.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr; QB to step away from team, avoid distraction, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- The Las Vegas Raiders are benching Derek Carr, the team's starting quarterback since 2014, first-year coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday.
A source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Carr and the Raiders agreed that he will step away from the team for the remainder of the regular season to not be a distraction.
He was the lone active Raiders player not to practice Wednesday, with the team listing his absence as "not injury related, personal."
Consecutive starts at QB: Active streaks Derek Carr has started 91 straight games, the second-longest active streak among quarterbacks.
Carr has struggled in his first season under the Raiders' new regime of McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham: What's next for QB, plus logical 2023 landing spots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Media, Carr will step away for the final two games of the regular season to avoid distractions.
The veteran just this offseason signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension tying him to Las Vegas through 2025, and was a catalyst for the team's blockbuster acquisition of wide receiver Davante Adams.
While he doesn't necessarily project as the Raiders' QB beyond 2022, it's fair to say the same about his predecessor.
They've got the cap space to make it work.
Coach Dennis Allen, meanwhile, knows Carr from his time as Raiders coach, leading the team in 2014 when Carr was drafted.
