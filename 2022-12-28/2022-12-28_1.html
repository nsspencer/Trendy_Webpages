     Raiders' Derek Carr decision starts QB carousel Bears can take advantage of
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But it's clear the decision is about ensuring Carr doesn't get injured in the final two games of a lost season for the Raiders.
Some reports have said the door is open on Carr returning to the Raiders in 2023.
With Justin Fields showing he's a franchise quarterback, the Bears will have the option of auctioning off the No.
The Raiders' decision to bench and likely move on from Carr is the first of many dominoes to fall.
Fields' ascensions and the Bears' draft position puts them in an excellent spot to take advantage of quarterback-desperate teams this offseason.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr; QB to step away from team, avoid distraction, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- The Las Vegas Raiders are benching Derek Carr, the team's starting quarterback since 2014, first-year coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday.
A source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Carr and the Raiders agreed that he will step away from the team for the remainder of the regular season to not be a distraction.
He was the lone active Raiders player not to practice Wednesday, with the team listing his absence as "not injury related, personal."
Consecutive starts at QB: Active streaks Derek Carr has started 91 straight games, the second-longest active streak among quarterbacks.
Carr has struggled in his first season under the Raiders' new regime of McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler.

     Derek Carr steps away from Las Vegas Raiders after surprise benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has missed only three games in nine years, all because of injury.
Now, for the first time, he won’t play because of what coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday were offensive performance reasons.
“I don’t think anybody feels like we’ve done enough offensively certainly in a couple of these games,” McDaniels said.
Carr was not at the Raiders’ facility, and Stidham was expected to address reporters Thursday.
Including three games with the Raiders this season, Stidham has completed 32 of 61 passes for 342 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham: What's next for QB, plus logical 2023 landing spots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Media, Carr will step away for the final two games of the regular season to avoid distractions.
The veteran just this offseason signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension tying him to Las Vegas through 2025, and was a catalyst for the team's blockbuster acquisition of wide receiver Davante Adams.
While he doesn't necessarily project as the Raiders' QB beyond 2022, it's fair to say the same about his predecessor.
They've got the cap space to make it work.
Coach Dennis Allen, meanwhile, knows Carr from his time as Raiders coach, leading the team in 2014 when Carr was drafted.

     Summary: Davante Adams didn't force his way to Las Vegas to get a front-row seat to watch his friend get benched.
Such is reality with the Raiders, though, forcing Adams to answer questions about Derek Carr's demotion on Wednesday.
"Him being one of my really good friends and the reason I came here in the first place.
Now, Adams is faced with the possibility of continuing his career in Las Vegas without the person who served as the main reason he wanted to join the Raiders in the first place.
When asked whether Carr's benching changes his long-term outlook in Las Vegas, Adams avoided answering the question directly.

     Raiders' Davante Adams has straightforward reaction to Derek Carr benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams had a straightforward reaction to Derek Carr benching originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonJosh McDaniels' controversial decision could have long-term consequences in Las Vegas.
But Carr is a popular figure in the locker room and is especially close with top wide receiver Davante Adams, his college teammate at Fresno State who joined the Raiders in 2022 to play with Carr.
"Obviously, I don't think anybody was excited about it in here," Adams said Wednesday of Carr's benching, via ESPN's Paul Gutierrez.
Carr reportedly is stepping away from the team altogether to allow Stidham -- who played under McDaniels in New England -- to take the reins.
If that's the path McDaniels and the Raiders choose, they may be dealing with a disgruntled No.
