     Raiders' Davante Adams addresses Derek Carr benching: 'Obviously I support my guy'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders made a massive decision on Wednesday, as head coach Josh McDaniels announced that the team was benching starting quarterback Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham.
This move may not be just for the final two weeks of the regular season, as Carr may have played his last down for the Raiders.
Wednesday, Adams addressed the Carr benching while speaking with reporters at his locker.
"Obviously, I don't think anybody was excited about it in here," Adams said, via Levi Edwards of the Raiders.
While Adams has caught 88 passes for 1,290 yards and a league-leading 12 touchdowns, it hasn't all been smooth sailing.

     Derek Carr's potential landing spots in 2023: Raiders QB on his way out of Las Vegas after benching?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants have not tipped their hand on what the plans are for Daniel Jones, whose fifth-year option was not picked up prior to this season.
Jones has played well in 2022, especially when it comes to ball security.
He’s also seen an uptick in his completion percentage and has weaponized his running ability like never before.
The Giants might not be ready to give up on a 25-year-old QB and could franchise tag Jones this offseason.
If not, the Giants’ respectable record this season might not put them in a position to draft his successor immediately.

     Raiders bench Derek Carr; QB to step away from team, avoid distraction, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- The Las Vegas Raiders are benching Derek Carr, the team's starting quarterback since 2014, first-year coach Josh McDaniels said Wednesday.
A source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Carr and the Raiders agreed that he will step away from the team for the remainder of the regular season so he's not a distraction.
He was the lone active Raiders player not to practice Wednesday, with the team listing his absence as "not injury related, personal."
Consecutive starts at QB: Active streaks Derek Carr has started 91 straight games, the second-longest active streak among quarterbacks.
Carr has struggled in his first season under the Raiders' new regime of McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler.

     Raiders to park Derek Carr, start Jarrett Stidham vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders benched Derek Carr to start Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the regular season in what could be the beginning of a changing of the guard at quarterback.
Coach Josh McDaniels said the Raiders are eager to evaluate Stidham and outlined plans for the final two games, which include making Carr inactive on game day.
Stidham, 26, will make his first career start for the Raiders (6-9) on Sunday against the visiting San Francisco 49ers.
"We're gonna go ahead and start Jarrett the last couple of games of the season here," McDaniels said.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.

     End of a Raiders era? QB Derek Carr benched for rest of season.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At 6-9, with losses in two of their past three games, the Raiders have only a faint hope of making the playoffs.
The 31-year-old Carr will be made inactive, suggesting that the team might want to keep him healthy for an offseason trade.
NFL Network reported Wednesday that Carr and the Raiders mutually agreed after recent discussions that it would help minimize distractions if he stepped away.
pic.twitter.com/1rdhTSsNKr — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) December 28, 2022The franchise’s all-time leader in passing yards (35,222) and passing touchdowns (217), Carr has been with the Raiders since they made him a second-round pick out of Fresno State in 2014.
Another option could be for the Raiders to keep Carr at least one more year, possibly on a restructured contract.

     Derek Carr benched by Raiders; could he reunite with Dennis Allen in New Orleans?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that quarterback Derek Carr has been benched for the rest of the season, with Jarett Stidham to start in his place and Chase Garbers promoted to backup.
Sidelining Carr at this stage protects the Raiders from owing Carr much money in the 2023 offseason, giving them an opportunity to move on.
Carr was drafted by the Raiders in 2014 — Dennis Allen’s abridged final year with the team, at No.
Now he’s the New Orleans Saints head coach.
Carr would give New Orleans an experienced starter under center, though he hasn’t found great success over the tumultuous years with the Raiders.
