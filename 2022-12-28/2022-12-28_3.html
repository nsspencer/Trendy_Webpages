     Greta Thunberg Doesn’t Care About Andrew Tate’s Cars — But Has an Idea of What They’re Overcompensating For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greta Thunberg Claps Back - Credit: Ronald Patrick/Getty ImagesAndrew Tate’s Twitter account was reinstated in late November after Elon Musk lifted a five-year ban put in place largely due to the kickboxer-turned-internet personality’s excessive and often violent misogyny.
Most recently, he’s used his return to the platform to taunt climate activist Greta Thunberg, bragging about his 33 cars and their “enormous emissions” to the 19-year-old who, to his surprise, couldn’t care less.
“Please provide your email address so I can send a complete list of my car collection and their respective enormous emissions,” Tate wrote to Thunberg.
Thunberg is currently heading into the 228th week of a climate strike she started in 2018 at the age of 15.
Meanwhile, Tate couldn’t manage to keep his head afloat during a three-tweet Twitter exchange that he started himself, completely unprovoked.

Eleven months later, she earned more than 1.6 million likes on Twitter by mocking Trump’s fury at losing the 2020 presidential election.
