     Former Pope Benedict's condition worsening, Vatican says as Francis calls for prayers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI's health has suddenly "worsened" in recent hours, the Vatican said on Wednesday after Pope Francis asked for prayers for the former pontiff.
"I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church," Francis said at the end of his general audience earlier on Wednesday.
Later, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni added: "I can confirm that in the last few hours his condition worsened due to age.
Benedict, 95, in 2013 became the first pope in more than 600 years to resign amid the clerical sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the church.
The former pope has largely stayed out of the public eye since his retirement.

     Factbox: Former pope Benedict, his papacy and resignation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: VATICAN CITY, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Former pope Benedict, who Pope Francis said on Wednesday was "very sick", resigned in 2013, the first pontiff in 600 years to take such a step rather than rule for life.
- Benedict, the first German pope in 1,000 years, was elected on April 19, 2005 to succeed the widely popular Pope John Paul II, who reigned for 27 years.
The Vatican under Pope John Paul II had failed to take action against Maciel despite overwhelming evidence of his crimes.
Some loyalists failed to accept that he had resigned the papacy willingly and continued to consider him "my pope".
Pope Francis, by contrast, also loves classical music but appreciates Italian pop songs from the early 1960s and also likes tango music from his native Argentina.

     Former Pope Benedict is ‘very sick’, Pope Francis says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rome CNN —Pope Francis has said that his predecessor Pope Benedict, the 95-year-old former pontiff who resigned from the post nine years ago, is “very sick” after a deterioration in his health on Wednesday.
“I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence.
He is very sick,” Francis said during his general audience at the Vatican on Wednesday.
In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing “advanced age.”Benedict’s announcement marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years.
Benedict later pushed back against those allegations, admitting he had attended the meeting but denying he intentionally concealed his presence.
