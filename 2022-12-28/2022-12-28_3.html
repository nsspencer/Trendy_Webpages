     Greta Thunberg vs. Andrew Tate: Twitter 'Loss' Sees Wikipedia Edit Go Viral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A tweet claiming to show an altered Wikipedia entry showing controversial martial artist-turned-influencer Andrew Tate was knocked out in a kickboxing match with climate activist Greta Thunberg has gone viral on social media.
He said: "Whatever the temptation, Wikipedia vandalism is a very bad thing, so don't do it.
Not even to Andrew Tate's page, because it's not alpha behavior."
Former victims of Wikipedia vandalism include former President Donald Trump, whose page was deleted entirely in July 2015.
As of Thursday afternoon, Tate has not responded to the tweet or the supposed alteration to his Wikipedia page.

Tate’s Twitter account had been banned, unsurprisingly, but was reinstated in late November following Elon Musk’s takeover of the site.

!”Twitter users reacted with delight, jumping at the chance to mock Tate.
But Tate’s style of posting is so strangely sincere, full of wildly insecure boasts and immature taunting, the vast majority of Twitter users read Tate’s response as an earnest expression of offense.

     Breaking Down Andrew Tate’s Batshit Greta Thunberg Response Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the greatest holiday gifts we, as a collective people, got this year was a perfect, no-notes slam dunk on men’s rights podcaster Andrew Tate by teenage climate activist and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Greta Thunberg.
“I’m not a rapist, but I like the idea of just being able to do what I want,” he said.
Related“Please bring me pizza and make sure those boxes are not recycled.”Breaking news: Andrew Tate doesn’t know that pizza boxes can’t be recycled.
Much of Tate’s content revolves around a new-age belief that the modern world is its own kind of matrix.
I wonder why Tate doesn’t address that his favorite theory is actually an allegory for being transgender.
