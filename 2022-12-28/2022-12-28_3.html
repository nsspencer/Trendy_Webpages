     Talbot shines as Senators beat Bruins 3-2 in shootout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OTTAWA, Ontario — Alex DeBrincat had the only goal of the shootout Tuesday night as the Ottawa Senators snapped a three-game slide with a 3-2 win over the Boston Bruins.
Jeremy Swayman made 30 saves for the Bruins, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.
The teams played through a scoreless first period despite a pair of breakaways by Senators forwards Brady Tkachuk and Stutzle.
He had an empty net to deposit the puck as Talbot was moving the other way expecting the puck to come out the other side.
Senators forward Drake Batherson assisted on both second-period goals and increased his point streak to 11 games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zacha scored his fourth goal of the season in Tuesday's 3-2 shootout loss to the Senators.
The 25-year-old had gone 17 games without finding the back of the net before beating Cam Talbot late in the third period to tie the game at 2-2 and earn the Bruins a point.
Zacha was still productive over that goalless stretch however, racking up 11 assists in those 17 contests, and his spot on the second line and second power-play unit gives him deep-league fantasy utility.

     Four Takeaways From Bruins’ Shootout Loss To Senators
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins emerged from their holiday break Tuesday night with just one point after a 3-2 shootout loss to the Senators at Canadian Tire Centre.
Boston came back in the third period to tie the game but couldn’t get the job finished thanks in part to a stellar 49-save performance from Cam Talbot for Ottawa.
The Bruins struggled to find their legs until the third and were able to force overtime, but Talbot ended up being too much in the end.
The goalie made 49 saves which, according to StatsCentre, is the most by a Senators netminder in a regular season win.
It was a barrage of shots, so we gave him our best chance, and I give credit where it?s due.”

     3 takeaways as Bruins fall in shootout amid Swayman-Talbot duel

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins 3 takeaways as Bruins fall in shootout amid Swayman-Talbot duel Here's what we learned from Boston's 3-2 setback in the Canadian capital.
Justin Tang / The Canadian Press via APThe Ottawa Senators did something that no other team could accomplish yet: beating the Boston Bruins twice.
The Bruins struggled in the second in a rare middle-20 relapse where they fought the puck more often than not.
I want a lot of shots, and I want to be challenged,” Swayman said following his 30-save outing.
With the secondary man advantage on the ice, Zacha beat Talbot on the short-side post for his first tally since Nov. 13.
