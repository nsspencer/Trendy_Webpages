    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was announced on Wednesday that the Las Vegas Raiders would be benching quarterback Derek Carr.
Raiders are benching Derek Carr and turning to Jarrett Stidham as their new starting QB.
Carr has thrown a league-leading 14 interceptions— including three Saturday night during a 13-10 loss to the Steelers.
Since taking over, Las Vegas hasn’t won the division but made the playoffs in both 2016 and 2021.
If Las Vegas decides to move on from Carr, where could he go?

     Derek Carr benched by Raiders, who was drafted by Saints HC Dennis Allen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that quarterback Derek Carr has been benched for the remainder of the 2022 season, with Jarett Stidham planned to start in his place and Chase Garbers promoted to backup.
Sidelining Carr at this stage protects the Raiders from owning Carr much money in the 2023 offseason, giving them an opportunity to move on.
And Carr, of course, was drafted back in 2014 — during Dennis Allen’s final year with the Raiders, with Allen’s team selecting Carr at No.
Now he’s the New Orleans Saints head coach.
Could Allen make a move for Carr in the months ahead and get them together in New Orleans?

     Raiders to park Derek Carr, start Jarrett Stidham vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders benched Derek Carr to start Jarrett Stidham for the final two games of the regular season in what could be the beginning of a changing of the guard at quarterback.
Coach Josh McDaniels said the Raiders are eager to evaluate Stidham and outlined plans for the final two games, which include making Carr inactive on game day.
Stidham, 26, will make his first career start for the Raiders (6-9) on Sunday against the visiting San Francisco 49ers.
"We're gonna go ahead and start Jarrett the last couple of games of the season here," McDaniels said.
A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards and 24 touchdowns in 15 games this season.

     Raiders benching QB Derek Carr for final two games of 2022 season; Jarrett Stidham named starter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The veteran Carr signed a three-year, $121.5 million extension with the Raiders in April, which included a no-trade clause.
It's also important to note McDaniels said Carr played "a lot of football," not a lot of good football in 2022.
Carr has completed 60.8% of his passes in 2022, which stands as his second-lowest completion percentage of his nine-year career.
This, and a knack for finding unlikely ways to lose games has led the Raiders to their current standing at 6-9.
We've had a decent year at home so far, and we're going to try and continue that this week."

     Summary: As the Las Vegas Raiders prepare for their Week 17 clash against the 49ers on Sunday, they’ll do so with Jarrett Stidham, not Derek Carr, as their QB1.
Raiders coach Josh McDaniels announced Wednesday that the team will bench Carr for Stidham in the final two games of the 2022 NFL season.
pic.twitter.com/1rdhTSsNKr — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) December 28, 2022Rookie quarterback Chase Garbers will serve as Stidham's backup, while Carr will be inactive for Sunday's Raiders-49ers game.
This season, Carr has thrown a league-leading 14 interceptions, including three on Saturday in Las Vegas' 13-10 Christmas Eve loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Despite their current 6-9 record, Las Vegas hasn't been eliminated from playoff contention officially and still could push to the postseason.
