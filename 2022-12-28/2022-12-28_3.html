As you surely already know, Pope Francis asked on Wednesday for a “special prayer” for his 95-year-old predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
“I would like to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who in silence is supporting the Church.
Remember him – he is very ill – asking the Lord to console him, and sustain him in this witness of love for the Church, until the end.”Members of the Aleteia community can turn to our prayer network of 550 monasteries to entrust to them our intentions.
Today this network turns to us to ask us to join the prayer of all the monks and nuns for Pope Benedict.

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is lucid, conscious and stable but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday, a day after it revealed that the 95-year-old's health had deteriorated recently.
A statement from Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Pope Francis asked for continued prayers “to accompany him in these difficult hours.”AdvertisementOn Wednesday Francis revealed that Benedict was “very ill” and went to see him at Benedict's home in the Vatican Gardens where he has lived since retiring in 2013.
The Vatican later said Benedict's health had deteriorated in the recent hours but that the situation was under control as doctors monitored him.
Word of Benedict’s declining health immediately posed questions about what would happen when he dies, given the unprecedented reality of having a reigning pope presumably presiding over the funeral of a former pope.

     Former Pope Benedict XVI lucid and stable but condition ‘serious’, Vatican says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is lucid, conscious and stable but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday, a day after it revealed that the 95-year-old’s health had deteriorated recently.
READ MORE: Pope Benedict XVI denies wrongdoing after clergy sex abuse report, but expresses ‘profound shame’The Vatican later said Benedict’s health had deteriorated in recent hours but that the situation was under control as doctors monitored him.
Benedict in 2013 became the first pope in 600 years to retire, and he chose to live out his retirement in seclusion in a converted monastery in the Vatican Gardens.
Few had expected his retirement — now in its 10th year — to last longer than his eight-year reign as pope.
Otherwise, while the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano headlined its Thursday editions with news of Benedict’s health, life continued as normal in the tiny city-state that Benedict and Pope Francis call home.

     Summary: Rome CNN —Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is “lucid and vigilant” but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday in an update on the former pontiff’s health.
“Pope Francis renews his invitation to pray for him and accompany him in these difficult hours.”Pope Francis announced Wednesday that his 95-year-old predecessor was “very sick” after a deterioration in his health.
“I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence.
In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing his “advanced age.”Benedict’s announcement marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years.
Benedict later pushed back against those allegations, admitting he had attended the meeting but denying he intentionally concealed his presence.
