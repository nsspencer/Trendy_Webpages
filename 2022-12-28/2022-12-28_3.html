     Heat get past Lakers 112-98, climb over .500 at 18-17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat got a lot of points off turnovers, and nearly went the whole game without giving up any.
Jimmy Butler scored 27 points, Bam Adebayo added 23 points and 14 rebounds and the Heat moved over .500 by topping the Los Angeles Lakers 112-98 on Wednesday night.
LeBron James, who led the Lakers with 27 points, couldn’t have agreed more — albeit from a different perspective.
The Heat led by 22 points at one point, their third-largest margin of the season and the biggest since Oct. 26.
The Heat went 35-19 in those and won’t be home again until Jan. 8 against Brooklyn.

     Summary: In an uncharacteristic response that suggested the totality of the Lakers' situation is draining some of his enthusiasm, he said he no longer wants to play basketball just to play.
"I don't have a number [of years I can keep playing]," James said.
Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder claimed in an interview earlier this month that James wants to play until he's 45.
"I think about how much longer I'm gonna play the game," James said.
"I think about how I don't want to finish my career playing at this level, from a team aspect.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (14-20) face the Heat (17-17) on Wednesday evening in Miami for their first meeting of the season.
“We did a lot of things we needed to cleanup ourselves, and it was more about us.”The Lakers countered Orlando’s length by scrapping on the glass, outrebounding the Magic 46-37.
“It’s contagious, like you saw tonight.”BACK-TO-BACKFor the fifth time this season, the Lakers are in the midst of a back-to-back set of games, with Miami awaiting.
The Heat, meanwhile, are 3-0 with a rest advantage against a team that played the previous night.
