     Tulsi Gabbard's 'Annihilation' of George Santos Receives Unexpected Praise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard has won praise for an interview in which she grilled Republican Representative-elect George Santos after he admitted to "embellishing" his resumé.
Ben Meiselas, co-founder of MeidasTouch, a liberal political action committee, tweeted: "Tulsi Gabbard just knocked out MAGA Fraud George Santos on Fox.
"Do you realize how s***** you need to be to make Tulsi Gabbard look good?"
"Possibly the best effort of the year to hold an interview subject accountable on major television goes to … Tulsi Gabbard?
Gabbard told Santos "this is not about the Democratic Party" and continued to press him on the claims he has admitted to "embellishing."

     GOP in disarray! MTG bashes Tulsi Gabbard over George Santos interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard — now a Fox News host —for giving embattled GOP Rep.-elect George Santos "zero grace" in a recent interview during which Gabbard questioned Santos' integrity over extensive fabrications on his résumé.
Gabbard asked Santos Tuesday evening.
During the interview, Gabbard also questioned Santos about representing himself as an "American Jew" and saying that he had "been to Israel numerous times for educational, business and leisurely trips."
"Not being raised a practicing Jew, I've always joked with friends and circles, even within the campaign, I'd say, guys, I'm 'Jew-ish.'
I think we Republicans should give George Santos a chance and see how he legislates and votes, not treat him the same as the left is."

     Tulsi Gabbard challenges George Santos: ‘Do you have no shame?’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the central question Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii and onetime presidential candidate, had for George Santos, an increasingly controversial Republican congressman-elect from New York.
“Joe Biden,” Santos claimed, without providing an example or evidence, “has been lying to the American people for 40 years.
“I’m Jew-ish,” he said.
“I understand everyone wants to nitpick at me,” he told Gabbard.
I campaigned on inflation, I campaigned on crime, I campaigned on education.”Gabbard persisted, however, saying Santos doesn’t “really seem to be taking [the situation] seriously.

     Summary: Mr. Santos, who is Catholic, said he was “Jew-ish” not Jewish.
Questions emerged about Mr. Santos’ claims after he won the race for New York’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island.
I think I’ve gone through this even not being raised a practicing Jew,” Mr. Santos said.
Another New York Republican, Rep.-elect Anthony D’esposito, criticized Mr. Santos’ fabrications but stopped short of calling for an ethics probe.
Mr. Santos has one public supporter on social media.

     Summary: “You’ve apologized, you said you’ve made mistakes, but you’ve outright lied.
“We can have this discussion that’s going to go way above the American people’s head,” Santos said.
You’re saying that this discussion will go way above the heads of the American people, basically insulting their intelligence.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had applauded Santos’ election to Congress for contributing to the largest Republican Jewish caucus in more than 24 years.
But McCarthy has thus far stayed quiet on the new revelations about Santos — who has publicly voiced his support for McCarthy’s potential House speakership.
