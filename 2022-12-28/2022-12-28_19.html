(betting odds per Bet MGM)Cowboys vs. Titans all-time seriesThe teams have met only 15 times all-time.
Tennessee will work to contain big plays from Dak Prescott but the intermediate passing game underneath should be favorable.
They need to keep taking pressure off and supporting the athletic Willis, operating with a limited passing game.
Cowboys vs. Titans predictionThe Cowboys need to come out passing with Prescott to build a lead and take the Titans out of their comfort zone.

     Derrick Henry (hip) doubtful vs. Cowboys as eight Titans ruled out for Thursday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Titans' season likely to come down to a Week 18 clash for the AFC South title against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tennessee is sitting some key players and Henry is a prime candidate to join them.
The Titans (7-8) and Jaguars (7-8) will play in the final week of the season with the division title at stake regardless of their outcomes this week.
Thus, the Titans, who have been banged up most of the season, will face the Cowboys (11-4) with many of their remaining top players sidelined.
The Cowboys have some injury issues, as well, with linebacker Micah Parsons (hand) and running back Tony Pollard (thigh) questionable.
Pelissero reported Thursday that while Parsons should be good to play through his hand injury, Pollard's status is in doubt.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The last time the Tennessee Titans were in a prime-time game was Week 11.
Best of NFL Nation • RBs Elliott, Pollard prove 2 is better than 1• Should the Titans rest more players?
During practice this week, the Titans' pace looked more like a game-day walk-through because of how many "walking wounded" players they have.
The fourth-year veteran is a prime example of a player the Titans felt they had to rest this week.
Tennessee starting right tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere's ankle injury also warranted him getting rest this week.
