"Terrell is ready to contribute and play any role, big or small," Daniel told SI.com.
"I've already kind of sprinkled some words out there, like, 'Yo, if you guys need a receiver, I'm good," Owens told 95.7 The Game's "The Morning Roast."
Owens told NBC in May that he felt his performance proved he's ready for an NFL comeback.

     Facepalm: Terrell Owens somehow inserted himself into Cowboys' atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Because at 49 years old, Terrell Owens is apparently interested in swapping his gold jacket for a pair of shoulder pads.
https://t.co/73Et4hAciR — Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) December 28, 2022Didn’t even notice that we checked the Terrell Owens square on Cowboys bingo.
The former third-round draft pick turned in stints in the Indoor Football League, American Flag Football League, Canadian Football League, and Fan Controlled Football venture, but maintains that he has been training- including recent workouts with DeSean Jackson- and “is in optimal condition” as he makes his latest comeback attempt.
Owens expressed dismay at his 2009 release from the Cowboys, saying then that owner Jerry Jones had assured him he’d remain with the club.
But with Terrell Owens and Jerry Jones, never say never.
