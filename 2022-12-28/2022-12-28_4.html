     LeBron James scores 27, but Lakers commit 26 turnovers in loss to Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wednesday, though, James’ jersey rested on his wide shoulders, the ones that used to be able to carry any roster he was handed.
James scored 27, playing on the second night of a back to back two days before his 38th birthday, but the Lakers’ 112-98 loss has them closer to the Western Conference basement than to any kind of credible threat.
James and the Lakers would add three more turnovers in the final two minutes — 26 total leading to 29 Miami points.
The Heat committed six turnovers, leading to just two points for the Lakers.
Jimmy Butler led Miami with 27 and Bam Adebayo dominated the paint with 23 points and 14 rebounds.

     Heat get past Lakers 112-98, climb over .500 at 18-17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat got a lot of points off turnovers, and nearly went the whole game without giving up any.
Jimmy Butler scored 27 points, Bam Adebayo added 23 points and 14 rebounds and the Heat moved over .500 by topping the Los Angeles Lakers 112-98 on Wednesday night.
LeBron James, who led the Lakers with 27 points, couldn’t have agreed more — albeit from a different perspective.
The Heat led by 22 points at one point, their third-largest margin of the season and the biggest since Oct. 26.
The Heat went 35-19 in those and won’t be home again until Jan. 8 against Brooklyn.

     NBA Odds: Lakers vs. Heat prediction, odds and pick – 12/28/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Aidan Cotter · 4 min readThe Los Angeles Lakers (14-20) visit the Miami Heat (17-17) on Wednesday night.
He was fully unleashed last night and the results paid dividends for a Lakers team struggling to find consistent offensive production.
That being said, he’s excelled off the bench this year and now finds himself as a major factor in LA’s ability to cover tonight.
The Lakers are very weak down low with Anthony Davis hurt – seeing Robinson up for a big night if Adebayo misses again.
Final Lakers-Heat Prediction &amp; PickAfter LA’s big win last night, I like them to keep things close against a Miami team that struggles offensively.

     Three Things to Know: Lakers at Heat 12-28-22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (14-20) face the Heat (17-17) on Wednesday evening in Miami for their first meeting of the season.
“We did a lot of things we needed to cleanup ourselves, and it was more about us.”The Lakers countered Orlando’s length by scrapping on the glass, outrebounding the Magic 46-37.
“It’s contagious, like you saw tonight.”BACK-TO-BACKFor the fifth time this season, the Lakers are in the midst of a back-to-back set of games, with Miami awaiting.
The Heat, meanwhile, are 3-0 with a rest advantage against a team that played the previous night.
The Heat are much closer to the team that faced L.A. in the 2020 NBA Finals, with the exception of a few players, while only LeBron and (injured) Anthony Davis remain for the Lakers.

     Have Lakers earned a chance to win?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sometimes you wonder if the Lakers’ season can be saved.
And sometimes you watch a game like last night’s and hope they’re at least given the chance.
It was the Lakers’ first win in five games, leaving them 14-20 and out of the playoff picture at this point, but it felt notable.
But this time, what, if anything, was Lakers management doing in response to James’ very credible criticism of the roster?
Maybe the most competitive game at CCA so far this season.” – Kings beat writer Andrew Knoll (@AndrewKnollNHL) during last night’s game at Crypto.com Arena.
