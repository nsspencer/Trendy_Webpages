     Social Media Buzz: Ducks win thrilling Holiday Bowl with 28-27 comeback over North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trailing by 10 with under 10 minutes to play, Bo Nix led a TD drive that cut the lead to 3.
After the defense got a massive stop and forced a field goal from North Carolina, it gave Bo Nix a chance to drive the length of the field with just over 2 minutes remaining.
The Oregon offense did just that, and a touchdown to Chase Cota tied the game with less than 30 seconds remaining.
If that wasn’t entertaining enough, the extra point from Camden Lewis hit the upright and bounced through, giving the Ducks the lead.
Oregon’s defense held, and the Ducks won the Holiday Bowl over North Carolina, 28-27.

     Summary: The Oregon Ducks and the North Carolina Tar Heels will compete for holiday cheer in the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday at Petco Park at 8 p.m.
Given that both teams suffered a loss in their last game, they both have a little extra motivation heading into this game.
The Ducks were within striking distance but couldn't close the gap four weeks ago as they fell 38-34 to the Oregon State Beavers.
Oregon was up 31-17 at the end of the third quarter but couldn't hold on to the lead.
That receiving effort made it the first game that Cota has posted more than 100 yards receiving.
