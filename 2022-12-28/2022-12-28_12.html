     Kanye West Is Missing, According To Former Business Manager
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to reports, St. John said in a court hearing he has not been able to find the producer-turned-rapper-turned-fashion designer for weeks, as he sues him for breach of contract.
St. John claims Kanye West had agreed to pay him a monthly retainer, but since the two had an “aggressive” meeting, West stopped paying him.
With this new position, St. John was to be paid a “monthly retainer fee” of $300,000.
“[St. John] needed a guarantee that [West] wouldn’t abruptly abandon the commercial relationship, in addition to the financial costs and hazards associated with committing to [West] as client.
But Mr. St. John offered to settle for a contract lasting at least 18 months,” the lawsuit read.
