Joel Embiid had 24 attempts on Nov. 13 and Luka Doncic shot 22 free throws in his 60-point triple-double on Tuesday.

     Pelicans' Zion Williamson takes over, has team's final 14 in win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With time ticking away in the fourth quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans trailing the Minnesota Timberwolves, CJ McCollum joked that the Pelicans' game plan became quite simple.
Zion Williamson finished with a career-high 43 points, including the final 14 points for the Pelicans, who stormed back for a 119-118 win.
The 14 consecutive points were the most by a Pelicans player to end a game in franchise history, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.
He joked that he probably owed Williamson an assist since Williamson is typically the one assisting on his 3.
He scored the last 14 points, if I'm not mistaken.

So, good for him.”Russell meant this as a slight to the officiating crew from Wednesday night – and possibly to Zion himself.

AdvertisementWednesday was a special night for Williamson in part because it was his first time reaching the 40-point mark in his career.
But his gradual improvement in all the areas that will be tested in higher-leverage games – his ability to take over games late, his shooting, his defense – are more tangible signs of progress in his journey to greatness.
