     Kanye West missing? His former business manager cant find him in order to sue the rapper
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the various controversieshe's been embroiled in over the past few weeks, Kanye West is nowhere to be found.
Or at least he's not appearing to his former business manager, Thomas St. John, who has been trying to serve him with legal documents.
St. John told a court hearing that he hasn't been able to find the rapper for weeks and is suing him for breach of contract.
"St. John needed a guarantee that West would not abruptly abandon the business relationship, plus the financial costs and risks associated with committing to him as a client.
But Mr. St. John offered to settle for at least an 18-month contract," states the lawsuit, which could not be served on Kim Kardashian's ex-husband.

     Kanye West Is Missing, According To Former Business Manager

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to reports, St. John said in a court hearing he has not been able to find the producer-turned-rapper-turned-fashion designer for weeks, as he sues him for breach of contract.
St. John claims Kanye West had agreed to pay him a monthly retainer, but since the two had an “aggressive” meeting, West stopped paying him.
With this new position, St. John was to be paid a “monthly retainer fee” of $300,000.
“[St. John] needed a guarantee that [West] wouldn’t abruptly abandon the commercial relationship, in addition to the financial costs and hazards associated with committing to [West] as client.
But Mr. St. John offered to settle for a contract lasting at least 18 months,” the lawsuit read.

     Summary: Controversial persona, rapper, and producer extravaganza Kanye ‘Ye’ West has made headlines for weeks on end following his anti-semitic remarks and contentious interviews.
But what is St. John suing West for?
According to the report, St. John claimed to have started working for West in the dual role as a chief financial officer and senior financial advisor back in March of that year.
“[St. John] needed guarantee that [West] wouldn’t abruptly abandon the commercial relationship, in addition to the financial costs and hazards associated with committing to [West] as clients.
While he may not be missing, he is most of all, very obviously avoiding St. John.
