     Kanye West and His Collaborator Have Both Gone Missing In L.A.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West seems to have made himself scarce as a bill collector approached, but his collaborator, Theophilus London, vanished in JulyThe family of rapper Theophilus London filed a missing persons report with the Los Angeles Police Department on Tuesday, saying he has not been seen since July.
London is known as a collaborator on antisemitic former mogul Kanye West’s Donda album and, coincidentally, West was also recently reported missing—by a man who says he’s just trying to collect on a debt.
According to the police, London was last seen on Skid Row around noon on October 15.
“But Mr. St. John offered to settle for a contract lasting at least 18 months.”However, St. John contends, he and Ye later had an “aggressive” meeting, and West stopped paying him.

St. John claims Kanye West had agreed to pay him a monthly retainer, but since the two had an “aggressive” meeting, West stopped paying him.
With this new position, St. John was to be paid a “monthly retainer fee” of $300,000.
“[St. John] needed a guarantee that [West] wouldn’t abruptly abandon the commercial relationship, in addition to the financial costs and hazards associated with committing to [West] as client.
