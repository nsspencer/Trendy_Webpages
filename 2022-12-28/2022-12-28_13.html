     D'Angelo Russell on Zion Williamson: He's playing football, we're playing basketball'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: D'Angelo Russell was critical of how the refs allowed Zion Williamson to play with so much physicality.
Zion Williamson attempted a season-high 19 free throws and scored a career-high 43 points to lead the Pelicans over the Timberwolves 119-118 Wednesday night.
Williamson played bully ball, using his explosiveness, size and power to get to the rim at will.
Jerami Grant attempted 28 free throws in an overtime game between the Blazers and Knicks on Nov. 25.
Joel Embiid had 24 attempts on Nov. 13 and Luka Doncic shot 22 free throws in his 60-point triple-double on Tuesday.

Zion Williamson has been a star from the second he stepped into the league, but last night we watched him become a superstar, and there will be no looking back.
New Orleans Pelicans: Zion Williamson is the team leaderThe Pelicans have used their depth to not only stay alive but thrive during Ingram’s absence.

He has taken over as the leader of the New Orleans Pelicans with Brandon Ingram out and is playing with more confidence than he ever has.

     Pelicans' Zion Williamson takes over, has team's final 14 in win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With time ticking away in the fourth quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans trailing the Minnesota Timberwolves, CJ McCollum joked that the Pelicans' game plan became quite simple.
Zion Williamson finished with a career-high 43 points, including the final 14 points for the Pelicans, who stormed back for a 119-118 win.
The 14 consecutive points were the most by a Pelicans player to end a game in franchise history, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.
He joked that he probably owed Williamson an assist since Williamson is typically the one assisting on his 3.
He scored the last 14 points, if I'm not mistaken.

     Zion Williamson saves Pelicans with one-of-a-kind greatness. ‘I’ve never seen anything like him’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williamson’s spectacular performance in the Pelicans’ 119-118 win over the Timberwolves Wednesday night encapsulated what makes him different from anything NBA fans have seen.
So, good for him.”Russell meant this as a slight to the officiating crew from Wednesday night – and possibly to Zion himself.
Zion over Gobert 🙌 pic.twitter.com/05AkOxky7g — New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) December 29, 2022“I’ve never seen anything like him.
AdvertisementWednesday was a special night for Williamson in part because it was his first time reaching the 40-point mark in his career.
But his gradual improvement in all the areas that will be tested in higher-leverage games – his ability to take over games late, his shooting, his defense – are more tangible signs of progress in his journey to greatness.
