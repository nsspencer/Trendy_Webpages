     Summary: In fact, the Pac-12 hasn’t won a Holiday Bowl since 2014, giving coach Dan Lanning a chance to get the conference back on track against a very solid UNC squad.
In fact, Tar Heels coach Mack Brown spoke to reporters on Monday and commended the job Lanning has done at Oregon in his first season.
“We’re excited to play Oregon,” Brown said.
UNC had a great season as well, with quarterback Drake Maye having an outstanding season that had him, along with Nix, in Heisman consideration throughout the year.
So should be a great game.

     Summary: The Oregon Ducks and the North Carolina Tar Heels will compete for holiday cheer in the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday at Petco Park at 8 p.m.
Given that both teams suffered a loss in their last game, they both have a little extra motivation heading into this game.
The Ducks were within striking distance but couldn't close the gap four weeks ago as they fell 38-34 to the Oregon State Beavers.
Oregon was up 31-17 at the end of the third quarter but couldn't hold on to the lead.
That receiving effort made it the first game that Cota has posted more than 100 yards receiving.
