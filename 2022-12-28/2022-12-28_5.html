     Former pope Benedict 'very sick', Pope Francis calls for prayers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis' announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden "worsening" of his health.
Francis, who visited the former pontiff after making the announcement, has often praised Benedict, saying it was like having a grandfather at home.
Conservatives have looked to the former pope as their standard bearer and some ultra-traditionalists even refused to acknowledge Francis as a legitimate pontiff.
They have criticised Francis for his more welcoming approach to gays and to Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church, saying both were undermining traditional values.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rome CNN —Pope Francis has said that his predecessor Pope Benedict, the 95-year-old former pontiff who resigned from the post nine years ago, is “very sick” after a deterioration in his health on Wednesday.
“I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict who sustains the Church in his silence.
He is very sick,” Francis said during his general audience at the Vatican on Wednesday.
Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington, DC, asked Catholics and “folks of good will to pray for Benedict XVI,” in a Twitter post Wednesday.
In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing “advanced age.”Benedict’s announcement marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years.
