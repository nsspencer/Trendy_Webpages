Erling Haaland enjoyed a happy homecoming as he returned to the city of his birth on Wednesday in the Premier League and scored twice in a 3-1 win for Manchester City against Leeds United.
A quick break saw Jack Grealish square the ball to Haaland to prod the ball into an empty net.

Pascal Struijk did pull one back for Leeds but it was just a consolation as the night belonged to Haaland.
