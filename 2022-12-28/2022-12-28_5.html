     Andrew Tate Comes At Greta Thunberg – And Misses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest person to learn this lesson is Andrew Tate, noted misogynist and right-wing provocateur who rejects the #MeToo movement and says he believes women are men’s property and shouldn’t drive.
Tate decided to tweet at Greta Thunberg, the acclaimed 19-year-old climate activist who made headlines when she took a year off of school to travel around the world and meet leading climate experts, this morning about how many cars he owns.
“I have 33 cars,” he tweeted.
Who knows what prompted a 36-year-old man to tweet at a teenager about how many cars he owns and how much carbon emissions he’s responsible for?

     Fact check: Satirical claim that Greta Thunberg's global warming conference was canceled due to cold weather
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Unfortunately, this Polar Vortex forced Greta and the gang to have to reschedule their Global Warming meeting," reads the post's caption.
But the article shown here is satirical, and USA TODAY found no evidence of any upcoming conference featuring Thunberg – canceled or otherwise.
The satirical article claims the canceled global warming conference was sponsored by the International Global Warming Trust, an organization that doesn't exist.
This is not the first time climate change skeptics have suggested cold weather proves global warming is not real.
Our rating: SatireBased on our research, we rate SATIRE the claim that Thunberg's global climate conference was canceled because of subarctic temperatures.

Tate’s Twitter account had been banned, unsurprisingly, but was reinstated in late November following Elon Musk’s takeover of the site.
Email me at smalldickenergy@getalife.com.”Tate soon responded to Thunberg, writing: “How dare you?
!”Twitter users reacted with delight, jumping at the chance to mock Tate.
But Tate’s style of posting is so strangely sincere, full of wildly insecure boasts and immature taunting, the vast majority of Twitter users read Tate’s response as an earnest expression of offense.

     Summary: Greta Thunberg responded to Andrew Tate on Twitter after he taunted her about his car emissions.
Thunberg replied on Wednesday morning, saying Tate could enlighten her by emailing the list to "smalldickenergy@getalife.com."
