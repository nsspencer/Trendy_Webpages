     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article SharePARIS — Neymar was sent off in Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-1 win against Strasbourg after the Brazil forward’s second-half dive in the penalty area Wednesday in his first match since the World Cup.
The forward remonstrated face to face with referee Clement Turpin but to no avail.
It was Neymar’s fifth red card since joining PSG for a world record fee of 222 million euros ($236 million) in 2017, and he will be suspended for Sunday’s game at second-place Lens.
No other player has been sent off more often in the French league since the 2017-2018 season.
Neymar has 11 league goals and 10 assists for unbeaten league-leader PSG this season.

     Kylian Mbappe's last minute penalty rescues win for 10-man PSG after Neymar sent off for diving
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS -- Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, and Marquinhos were immediately back in action with Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday against RC Strasbourg Alsace in Ligue 1 and it was almost a far from ideal return.
The PSG trio were all in FIFA World Cup action in Qatar yet returned quickly to domestic action as they sought to put their collective disappointment behind them.
However, after that, PSG started to show the anticipated rust which had accumulated over a month or so of collective inactivity during the World Cup.
With that effort chalked off, Mbappe stepped up to convert successfully from the spot -- exactly how he left the World Cup.
"I will never get over it," said Mbappe to journalists of the World Cup final loss to Argentina.

     Kylian Mbappé rescues PSG with last-gasp winner in first match since World Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Just 10 days after suffering disappointment in the World Cup final, Kylian Mbappé rescued Paris Saint-Germain with a last-gasp penalty as his side beat RC Strasbourg 2-1 in Ligue on Wednesday.
Mbappé, who had ended up on the losing side against Argentina in Qatar 2022’s showpiece final despite scoring a hat-trick, didn’t seem to suffer any ill effects in his first match for PSG since the World Cup.
Marquinhos had given PSG a first-half lead but the defender then inadvertently scored an own goal after the break.
With Messi yet to return from celebrating his World Cup victory in Argentina, Mbappé converted the penalty himself to move PSG eight points clear at the top of Ligue 1.
France was beaten by Argentina in arguably the greatest final in World Cup history despite Mbappé’s heroics at the Lusail Stadium.
