     Tennessee Titans show promise in Joshua Dobbs' debut, still lose sixth straight vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joshua Dobbs gave the Tennessee Titans more than they'd been getting at quarterback, but that still wasn't enough to end the losing streak.
The Titans lost 27-13 to the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday at Nissan Stadium, their sixth straight loss.
Henry was one of seven Titans starters who sat out Thursday's game who otherwise might have been able to play had this game affected the Titans' playoff picture.

     Titans to start QB Joshua Dobbs vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Titans officially placed Tannehill on injured reserve Thursday, meaning he will have to miss at least four games before he could return.
Two of those starters who were ruled out -- linebackers Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham -- were placed on injured reserve Thursday.
Dupree missed five games earlier this season after injuring a hip before a pectoral injury landed him on injured reserve.
He missed six consecutive games with an elbow injury after being placed on injured reserve in November.
The Titans activated Cunningham from injured reserve last week only to have him reinjure the elbow against the Houston Texans.

     Dobbs Steps In, Pumps Up Passing Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – In turning to recently signed quarterback Josh Dobbs over rookie Malik Willis, the Tennessee Titans hoped to pump some life into a sputtering passing attack.
It was the sixth-highest passing total of the season for the Titans (7-9), who lost their sixth straight game.
A sixth-year pro making his first NFL start, Dobbs looked like a clear step up from Willis, a third-round pick in this year's draft.
“He played his game,” Woods said.
Given the numbers Dobbs and Willis have posted this season, it seems clear a second straight start for Dobbs would be in the works.

     What Joshua Dobbs, Titans said about Week 17 game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tennessee Titans suffered their sixth-straight loss in Week 17, losing to the Dallas Cowboys 27-13, but in that loss there is a reason for optimism going into a division-deciding Week 18 game against the Jaguars.
That reason for optimism is Joshua Dobbs, who stepped into the starting job a little over a week after joining the team and provided a clear upgrade over rookie quarterback Malik Willis, who didn’t show much in three starts.
“It’s a unique situation and it’s a wonderful opportunity that I really embrace and have a lot of fun with,” Dobbs said.
“There’s obviously things that I know that I can do better and be better at — especially situationally — looking back through the game.
“Just being able to make those plays, make critical plays throughout the game, will propel us to this upcoming week where we actually have a full week to prepare for the game.”Here’s what else Dobbs and the Titans had to say about Week 17:

     QB Josh Dobbs Sparked the Titans, But It Wasn't Enough in a 27-13 Loss to the Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE – The Titans put a new quarterback – Josh Dobbs – in the saddle against the Cowboys.
But in the end, Dobbs and the Titans just didn't have enough firepower – and they made too many mistakes -- in a 27-13 loss at Nissan Stadium.
The former University of Tennessee star kept the football for a souvenir following his touchdown, since it was his first career touchdown pass.
Then, on the final play of the half, the Titans got a 29-yard field goal from Bullock to make it 10-6 at the break.
Another Maher field goal, this one from 45 yards out with 6:24 left, made it 27-13.
