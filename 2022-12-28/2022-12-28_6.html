     Duke football: Blue Devils punctuate surprising season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wednesday's Military Bowl at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Md., was only the 15th Duke football postseason game in history.
In the process, the Blue Devils corralled their FBS-leading 16th fumble recovery this season and set a Military Bowl record with six sacks.
Outside of the David Cutcliffe era (2008-21), when Duke went 3-3 in bowl games (all six appearances came between 2012-18), the Blue Devils hadn't won a bowl game since 1960.
And the 2022 Blue Devils became the seventh Duke football squad in history with at least nine victories — the first since 2014 and only the third since the end of World War II.

     MILITARY MAYHEM: Leonard leads the way as Duke football runs away from UCF to win Military Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ANNAPOLIS, Md.—In qualifying for the postseason, Duke had to defy all odds in its first year under head coach Mike Elko.
But the Blue Devils stood their ground on the ensuing drive, forcing a three-and-out to give Leonard and the offense 1:14 to extend their lead.
Upon review, Calhoun had stepped out of bounds some 20 yards earlier, and the Blue Devils kept possession.
It took 13 plays, 54 yards and an eye-popping 6:58 for the Blue Devils to walk away with a 38-yard field goal from Pelino.
The early lead was short-lived for the Blue Devils.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementThe Knights (9-5, 6-2 AAC) were unable to do the same Wednesday when they fell 30-13 to Duke in the Military Bowl at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.
Bowser, who led the team with 39 rushing yards on 11 carries, passed Denver Broncos running back Latavius Murray for the second-most rushing touchdowns (16) in a single UCF season.
Duke quarterback Riley Leonard ran in from 3 yards out to give Duke 30 points with 2:29 remaining.
The sophomore went 19 of 28 passing for 173 yards while leading the Blue Devils with 63 rushing yards on 10 carries and 2 touchdowns.
Despite ending the year with back-to-back losses in the AAC title game and the Military Bowl, Malzahn said he feels confident about what comes next for his team.

     Summary: Plumlee took a deep shot on 1st down, evading pressure from defensive end RJ Oben, but the throw fell incomplete.
Defensive Lineman DeWayne Carter batted down the next ball, but Plumlee converted on 3rd down to keep the chains moving.
Ryan Smith tackled UCF receiver Johnny Richardson short of the line a few plays later, though, and Duke forced the first punt of the game.
An 87-yard drive for the Blue Devils on their first possession of the game would give Duke a 7-0 lead as Jaquez Moore punched it in from 14 yards out.
The punt was downed by Jaylen Stinson at the 9-yard line as the first quarter came to end.
