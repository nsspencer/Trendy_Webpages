     Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is stable but condition is ‘serious,’ Vatican says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This April 19, 2005, file photo shows Pope Benedict XVI greeting the crowd from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica moments after being elected, at the Vatican.
( / AP)VATICAN CITY — Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is lucid, conscious and stable but his condition remains serious, the Vatican said Thursday, a day after it revealed that the 95-year-old’s health had deteriorated recently.
A statement from Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Pope Francis asked for continued prayers “to accompany him in these difficult hours.”AdvertisementOn Wednesday Francis revealed that Benedict was “very ill” and went to see him at Benedict’s home in the Vatican Gardens where he has lived since retiring in 2013.
The Vatican later said Benedict’s health had deteriorated in the recent hours but that the situation was under control as doctors monitored him.
Word of Benedict’s declining health immediately posed questions about what would happen when he dies, given the unprecedented reality of having a reigning pope presumably presiding over the funeral of a former pope.
