     Titans RB Derrick Henry doubtful vs. Cowboys with hip injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Titans running back Derrick Henry is listed as doubtful for his team’s “Thursday Night Football” matchup against the Dallas Cowboys.
Here’s what you need to know:Henry was limited in practice on Tuesday and Wednesday with a hip injury.
Titans cornerback Kristian Fulton and linebacker Denico Autry are also listed as doubtful for Thursday night.
AdvertisementThe Titans are already without starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill and backup Malik Willis has attempted just 61 passes in his eight appearances.
But the Cowboys game has zero impact on the Titans’ AFC South fate.

     Jeffery Simmons among 4 Titans out on defense, Derrick Henry doubtful
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have ruled out a slew of starters for Thursday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Tennessee's offense could be without Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry, who is listed as doubtful because of a hip injury sustained in Saturday's 19-14 loss to the Houston Texans.
Right tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere (ankle) and Ryan Tannehill (ankle) are the only offensive starters listed as out.
Tannehill had surgery on his ankle last week, leaving rookie Malik Willis to start the final three games of the season.
"You make a decision that is in the best interests of the football team," Vrabel said.

     The reason Derrick Henry isn’t expected to play vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Henry is officially listed as doubtful for the game due to a hip injury, and is not expected to play, according to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.
“My understanding is this is precautionary with Henry who is one of many Titans’ starters who are not set to play in this game,” Pelissero said on Thursday morning.
“Full expectation is [Henry] will be out there in Week 18 for that AFC South title game against the Jaguars,” Pelissero confirmed.
Although listed as doubtful, Henry will almost certainly not play in Week 17.
Derrick Henry provided a familiar stat line against the Texans, rushing 23 times for 126 yards and a touchdown.

     Summary: The Tennessee Titans will move toward a key game against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday with running back Derrick Henry listed as doubtful with a hip injury.
The Titans are just 7-8 in the AFC South but are tied for first place with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Henry, 28, is second in the NFL with 1,429 yards rushing this season.
The Titans already are without quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who is out for the season with an ankle injury.
The rookie out of Michigan has just 50 yards rushing this season on 11 carries.

     Derrick Henry (hip) doubtful vs. Cowboys as eight Titans ruled out for Thursday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Titans' season likely to come down to a Week 18 clash for the AFC South title against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tennessee is sitting some key players and Henry is a prime candidate to join them.
The Titans (7-8) and Jaguars (7-8) will play in the final week of the season with the division title at stake regardless of their outcomes this week.
Thus, the Titans, who have been banged up most of the season, will face the Cowboys (11-4) with many of their remaining top players sidelined.
The Cowboys have some injury issues, as well, with linebacker Micah Parsons (hand) and running back Tony Pollard (thigh) questionable.
Pelissero reported Thursday that while Parsons should be good to play through his hand injury, Pollard's status is in doubt.

     Will Derrick Henry play against the Cowboys on Thursday night?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2019, the Tennessee Titans had a meaningless game on the next-to-last Sunday of the NFL’s regular season.
Against the Saints, Tennessee held out running back Derrick Henry, the NFL’s leading rusher, and lost to New Orleans 38-28.
But the next week, Henry ran for 211 yards and three touchdowns in the Titans’ 35-14 victory over the Texans to put the Titans in the playoffs.
Regardless of what happens against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night, Tennessee must beat the Jacksonville Jaguars in the finale on Jan. 8 to go to the playoffs.
Will the Titans keep Henry sidelined again against the Cowboys to unleash him in the regular-season finale?
