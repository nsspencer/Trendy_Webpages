     Zion Williamson career night draws shade from D'Angelo Russell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And to rub salt on the Timberwolvesâ€™ wounds, Zion Williamson stole a lazy pass from Dâ€™Angelo Russell on the ensuing possession, leading to a go-ahead transition dunk for the 6â€™6 forward.
Speaking with reporters after the game, Russell expressed his frustrations over the physicality of Williamsonâ€™s game.
D'Angelo Russell did NOT hold back on the Wolves' late turnover to Zion Williamson ðŸ—£pic.twitter.com/egZPW2DWLl â€” ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) December 29, 2022Professional athletes are a competitive bunch so of course, losses sting.
Nonetheless, while Dâ€™Angelo Russellâ€™s frustrations may be valid, Zion Williamson is just too talented to chalk up a career night to what the Timberwolves guard alludes to as officiating bias.
The Timberwolves will have an opportunity to bounce back when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a dog fight won by Zion Williamson against a Timberwolves team that gave the Pelicans everything they could handle in New Orleans Wednesday night.
The game came down to the wire, with Anthony Edwards missing a baseline fadeaway as the horn sounded, giving the Pelicans a 119-118 win.
On the next possession, Anthony Edwards exploded down the lane for a huge two-handed dunk with 29 seconds to go to the game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With time ticking away in the fourth quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans trailing the Minnesota Timberwolves, CJ McCollum joked that the Pelicans' game plan became quite simple.
Zion Williamson finished with a career-high 43 points, including the final 14 points for the Pelicans, who stormed back for a 119-118 win.
The 14 consecutive points were the most by a Pelicans player to end a game in franchise history, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.
He joked that he probably owed Williamson an assist since Williamson is typically the one assisting on his 3.
He scored the last 14 points, if I'm not mistaken.
