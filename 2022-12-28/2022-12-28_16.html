Let’s break down the studs and duds as Utah loses its second straight game on the road, despite being the favorite heading into the contest. .Dud: Fourth Quarter BluesUtah’s offense apparently went to bed after the third quarter.
The sharpshooter from Finland was 7-for-13 from long distance while also grabbing 16 rebounds on his way to a 29-point performance.
Dud: Jazz BenchUtah’s bench was outperformed for the second straight game, being outscored 45-32.

     Utah Jazz collapse in the fourth, lose to the Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Utah Jazz were in control against a short-handed Golden State Warriors team, who were also on the second night of a back-to-back, for most of the night tonight.
In the third quarter, the Jazz played well, but could not close the door on the Warriors who just kept hanging around, never letting the lead get higher than 12.
In the fourth quarter, the Jazz went 4/25 from the field, shooting 1/12 from three.
The Warriors played incredible defense down the stretch, slowing the Jazz offense to a crawl.
Honestly, Jazz losing to Warriors is a great move for the tanking crowd.

Golden State has won two straight but still reside in 10th place in the West.
He was only active for one of their previous meetings with Golden State but made the most of it.
It is clear that Golden State wants to run its offense through its two talented guards – and for good reason.

     Utah Jazz preach perspective after 4Q meltdown vs. Warriors

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen shoots between Golden State Warriors guard Donte DiVincenzo, left, and guard Jordan Poole (3) during the second half of an NBA basketball game in San Francisco, Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2022.
(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)San Francisco • Just three weeks ago, the Utah Jazz had arguably their best win of the season — a manic, frantic, epic comeback against the Golden State Warriors, a victory they had no business coming away with.
For most of a game played against a short-handed Warriors team missing stars Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins (among others), the Jazz were solidly if not quite firmly ahead.
And they did, as Golden State got just 34.
One interminable possession aside, Golden State didn’t torture Utah on the offensive glass.

     Analysis: The glass half full view of the Jazz’s loss to the Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Glass half fullIn the loss to the Spurs, the Jazz allowed 74 points in the paint and their defense was pretty suspect throughout the game, and that’s putting it mildly.
In addition to that, Hardy was adamant that he was fine with the Jazz’s execution and their shot selection for the most part Wednesday.
“I think it’s really important for our guys to understand that the result tonight does not necessarily reflect how they approached the game as a team,” Hardy said.
“I thought they dug in, really, really competed against a good team in a hard environment to play in.
They limited the Warriors to just 24 fourth-quarter points and didn’t let any one player hit more than two shots.
