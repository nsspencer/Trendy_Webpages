     Injury Report: Golden State Warriors vs. Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After another solid win vs. the Charlotte Hornets, the shorthanded Golden State Warriors are set to host the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.
In addition to the expected absences of Steph Curry and Andrew Wiggins, the Warriors will be without Klay Thompson, JaMychal Green, and Andre Iguodala.
That said, their young players have been stepping up lately, which is a good sign for when Curry and Wiggins come back.
This game against the Utah Jazz will be another great opportunity for Golden State's young talent to show what they got.

     Utah Jazz collapse in the fourth, lose to the Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Utah Jazz were in control against a short-handed Golden State Warriors team, who were also on the second night of a back-to-back, for most of the night tonight.
In the third quarter, the Jazz played well, but could not close the door on the Warriors who just kept hanging around, never letting the lead get higher than 12.
In the fourth quarter, the Jazz went 4/25 from the field, shooting 1/12 from three.
The Warriors played incredible defense down the stretch, slowing the Jazz offense to a crawl.
Honestly, Jazz losing to Warriors is a great move for the tanking crowd.

After Conley went over the screen, the Jazz point guard had to throw the pass around Warriors center Kevon Looney, which the ball landed perfectly in the hands of Vanderbilt, who finished with a two-handed dunk.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I still got a ton of texts like I did if I would have gotten a head coaching job.
But I was so consumed as a coach,” Fizdale said.
That was short-lived as Frank Vogel was fired as Lakers head coach on April 11, leaving Fizdale’s tenure with the franchise in question.
Although Ham respectfully went in another direction, Atlanta Hawks head coach Nate McMillan was also interested in adding Fizdale to his staff.
Fizdale respects Hardy as the Jazz’s head coach and says he is sensitive to not stepping on his toes.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Just weeks ago, the Golden State Warriors might not have pulled off a win like this without their superstars on the court.
Jordan Poole scored 26 points and converted a key layup with 1:27 left and the undermanned Warriors rallied to beat the Utah Jazz 112-107 on Wednesday night.
DiVincenzo scored 19 points and Jerome 17 with the Warriors completing a back-to-back minus starters Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins.
The Jazz have lost six straight on the Warriors' floor dating to a 129-96 victory on Jan. 22, 2020.
