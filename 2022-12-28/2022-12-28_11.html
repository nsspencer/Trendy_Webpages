     Summary: Laura Kelly banned the social media app TikTok on all state-issued devices.
Republicans have typically led the charge against TikTok, arguing that it's a state security threat because it collects data and its parent company's links to the Chinese Communist Party.
TIKTOK BANNED FROM ALL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DEVICESKelly's move reflects increasing bipartisan agreement and concern about the dangers of the app, which is used by approximately two-thirds of teenagers.
The recently passed $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill included a ban on TikTok on all state-issued government employees' devices.
A bill passed on Tuesday banned TikTok from all House of Representatives devices.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After passing a law that bans TikTok on devices used by government agencies, the U.S. House of Representatives is blocking its members and their staffers from using TikTok on official devices.
“House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,” Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor wrote in the email, according to a copy obtained by Gizmodo.
“Tik Tok is NOT allowed on House mobile devices.
If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.”AdvertisementIn addition, downloading the app in the future will be forbidden.
A spokesperson for the CAO told Gizmodo on Wednesday morning that the policy does not apply to personal devices, only to official House devices.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TikTok has been banned from any devices issued by the US House of Representatives, as political pressure continues to build on the Chinese-owned social video app.
“House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,” NBC quoted the memo as saying.
“If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.” The move was also reported by Reuters.
This month the US senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential contender, unveiled a legislative proposal to ban TikTok from the US entirely.
Biden has revoked presidential orders targeting TikTok issued by his predecessor, Donald Trump, which included requiring TikTok to sell its US business.

     US House bans TikTok from official devices
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington CNN —TikTok has been banned from electronic devices managed by the US House of Representatives, according to an internal notice sent to House staff.
The move comes after more than a dozen states in recent weeks have implemented their own prohibitions against TikTok on government devices.
TikTok has previously called efforts to ban the app from government devices “a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests.” TikTok declined to comment on the House restrictions.
There is no evidence that that has actually occurred, though the company last week confirmed that it fired four employees who improperly accessed the TikTok user data of two journalists on the platform.
Since 2020, TikTok has been negotiating with the US government on a potential deal to resolve the national security concerns and allow the app to remain available to US users.

     TikTok banned on Charlotte city employee work phones, NC lawmakers call on Gov. Cooper to do the same
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a push for national security, NC officials are hoping to get TikTok banned from government-issued devices.
The city of Charlotte has joined the list of these entities and is planning to completely remove TikTok from all city devices by Jan. 6, 2023.
According to a city of Charlotte spokesperson, the move is due to a warning from the FBI about potential national security concerns associated with the app.
In an audit on Wednesday, officials found that many users still had TikTok downloaded on their city devices.
This move comes ahead of a rumored TikTok ban at the federal level.
