     Summary: Kanye West seems to have made himself scarce as a bill collector approached, but his collaborator, Theophilus London, vanished in JulyThe family of rapper Theophilus London filed a missing persons report with the Los Angeles Police Department on Tuesday, saying he has not been seen since July.
London is known as a collaborator on antisemitic former mogul Kanye West’s Donda album and, coincidentally, West was also recently reported missing—by a man who says he’s just trying to collect on a debt.
According to the police, London was last seen on Skid Row around noon on October 15.
“But Mr. St. John offered to settle for a contract lasting at least 18 months.”However, St. John contends, he and Ye later had an “aggressive” meeting, and West stopped paying him.
