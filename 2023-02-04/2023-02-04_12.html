     Line Combinations Worth Trying At 2023 NHL All-Star Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: WYNTThe NHL All-Star Game gives fans and coaches the opportunity to see players play with others that they have not before and may never get to again.
Heading into the 2023 All-Star Weekend in Sunrise, Florida, NoVa Caps comes up with line combinations that we would like to see during Saturday’s game (3 PM ET, ESPN, ESPN+).
Ovechkin is the notorious goal scorer but Hughes is not bad at it himself with 33 in just 49 games this season.
Even though they have focused more on passing lately, Svechnikov scored 30 goals last season, giving the trio a present scoring threat.
Tkachuk (tied for 18th with 25 goals, tied for sixth with 41 points) is among the best in both of those areas and can be a physical specimen.

     NHL All-Star Game 2023 score: Tkachuk brothers lead Atlantic to victory, Matthew takes home MVP on home ice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time since the three-on-three format was implemented, the Atlantic Division has won the NHL All-Star Game with a 7-5 win over the Central Division.
The 2023 NHL All-Star Game got off to a drowsy start with a snoozer between the Central Division and the Pacific Division.
That's exactly what they got when the Metro Division faced off against the Atlantic Division in the second game.
However, the Atlantic Division was paced by hometown hero Matthew Tkachuk, who scored a hat trick of his own in a 10-6 win.
The Atlantic Division was buzzing all afternoon, and it built an early lead over the Central and did not look back.

1:06, second half — Larkin comes right back down the ice and completes a hat trick.
5:51, second half — Rantanen gets the Central on the board so the shutout is off the table for the Atlantic.
9:35, second half — Gaudreau completes the hat trick and he’ll get to donate some money to charity as a result.
Update — Confetti was shot onto the ice so there’s a bit of a delay to the start of the second half.
