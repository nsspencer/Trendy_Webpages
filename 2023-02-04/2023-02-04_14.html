     Summary: For the first time since the three-on-three format was implemented, the Atlantic Division has won the NHL All-Star Game with a 7-5 victory over the Central Division.
The 2023 NHL All-Star Game got off to a drowsy start with a snoozer between the Central Division and the Pacific Division.
That's exactly what they got when the Metro Division faced off against the Atlantic Division in the second game.
The Atlantic Division was buzzing all afternoon, and it built an early lead over the Central and did not look back.
Tkachuk was eventually rewarded for his efforts with the title of All-Star Game MVP and a new car from Honda.
