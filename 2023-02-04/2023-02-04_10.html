     Duke basketball score vs. UNC: Live updates from Blue Devils-Tar Heels rivalry game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tar Heels claimed two historic victories: A 94-81 win in Cameron Indoor in Mike Krzyzewski’s final home game and an 81-77 triumph in the national semifinal that may have tipped the scales of the rivalry for good.
There will be no Coach K or Roy Williams walking through the Cameron Indoor doors on Saturday.
Two years ago, these two coaches faced each other with a combined 70 years of experience, 2,000 wins and eight national titles.
Duke's first-year coach Scheyer and UNC’s Hubert Davis have less than three years combined, although Davis took the Tar Heels to the national title game in his first season.

     Duke vs. UNC basketball clash gets epic Yankees-Red Sox comparison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rivalry between Duke and UNC is being mentioned in the same breath as the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox ahead of Saturday’s much-anticipated college basketball game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Saturday’s game is the first Duke vs. UNC matchup since the ACC teams met in last year’s Final Four.
The Tar Heels topped the Blue Devils in the final game of Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s career.
The first Duke vs. UNC game of the season has plenty of juice, even though both teams are in the middle of somewhat disappointing campaigns.
UNC has the edge in the rivalry with a 143-115 all-time record over Duke.
