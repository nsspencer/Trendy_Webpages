     Summary: The Senior Bowl represents the unofficial kickoff to draft season.
Houston has a member of their 2022 staff on the National Team.
Starting in 2021, the Senior Bowl ditched the North and South team designations in favor of the National and American teams — no different than from 1991-93 when they had the AFC versus the NFC.
The National Team is 2-0 since the name change.

     Summary: This week in Mobile marks an end the the unofficial first leg of the pre-draft process.
Next up: the NFL combine in just a few week's time, followed by pro days and, ultimately, the NFL Draft.
Below are five other players who punctuated a great week of practice with a strong showing in Saturday's game.
NFL teams viewed Wilson as a Day 3 target before he came to Mobile, and now there will be serious conversations about if he can move his way into Day 2.
On-site evaluations usually include interviewing support staff at each college to gauge how the players act inside the building.
