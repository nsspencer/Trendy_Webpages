    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A deflected shot handed Egypt's Al Ahly a late winner as they edged Seattle Sounders 1-0 at the Club World Cup in Morocco on Saturday to book a semifinal against Real Madrid next week.
But the deflection on the goal, it's unfortunate," a dejected Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said.
Al Ahly, competing at an eighth tournament, now meet Real Madrid in Rabat on Wednesday, which follows Tuesday's other semi-final between Flamengo of Brazil and Al Hilal of Saud Arabia.
Asian champions Al Hilal won earlier on Saturday against home team Wydad Casablanca on post-match penalties after a 1-1 draw.
The game had few chances although the Egyptians, who were semifinalists at the last Club World Cup in 2021, enjoyed much possession.

     Club World Cup heartbreak: Seattle Sounders eliminated by Al Ahly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A heartbreaking late concession nixed Seattle Sounders FC ’s dreams at the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco, as the Rave Green fell 1-0 to Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly in the tournament's Second Round.
Saturday's match at Tangier's Ibn Batouta Stadium was locked in a scoreless deadlock until the 88th minute, when Al Ahly midfielder Mohamed Afsha found the decisive breakthrough with a deflected finish after his initial shot rang the crossbar.
The result eliminates Seattle after one match at the prestigious tournament, which they were competing in via a historic 2022 Concacaf Champions League title – Major League Soccer's first-ever team to reach this global stage.
Meanwhile, African regulars Al Ahly advance to a Feb. 8 semifinal bout vs. Spain's Real Madrid.
