     Stephen Curry (knee) exits win, Warriors keep 'fingers crossed'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:55)SAN FRANCISCO -- Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry left the Warriors' 119-113 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at the end of the third quarter after suffering an apparent left knee injury.
Curry sustained the injury with 2:01 left in the third quarter after his left knee collided with Dallas' McKinley Wright IV's knee while Curry was defending him.
So fingers crossed he's OK."Two nights prior, Curry banged that same knee in the second half of Golden State's game against the Denver Nuggets.
However, the trend of Golden State struggling to close games continued.
The Warriors were up 20 when Curry left the game, but the Mavericks cut the game to five with just over 90 seconds to go.

     Draymond Green Is Closing In On Golden State Warriors History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Draymond Green has been one of the most critical players on the Golden State Warriors sine he was drafted out of Michigan State as the 35th overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft.
The 32-year-old is in his 11th season in the NBA and has helped lead the Warriors to four titles in the previous eight seasons.
Right now, Green is closing on making Warriors franchise history, as he can move to sixth on their all-time list for three-pointers made.
The former Defensive Player of The Year came into the night with 598 career three-pointers, which had just five away from passing Tim Hardaway (602).
During Saturday's game against the Dallas Mavericks, Green has gone a perfect 3/5 from downtown (he started out 3/3), so he is just one away from tying Hardaway (and two away from passing him).

     Draymond Green, Steve Kerr unhappy with how Warriors closed out Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Draymond, Kerr unhappy with how Dubs closed out Mavericks originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaThe Warriors came away Saturday night with a much-needed 119-113 win over the Luka Dončić-less Dallas Mavericks at Chase Center.
"I don't think we closed the game well at all," Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters postgame.
However, the Warriors played haphazardly in the fourth quarter, allowing the Mavericks to trim the lead to just five, 116-111, with 1:28 remaining.
What's more, the Mavericks outscored the Warriors 27-17 in the final frame and scored four more points in the paint, 14-10.
Up 14 in the fourth quarter, Golden State squandered the lead, eventually losing 119-114 in overtime, a loss Kerr deemed "unforgivable."
