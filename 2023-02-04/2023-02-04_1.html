     Premier League predictions: Jones Knows thinks Tottenham will get the better of Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We're all set for another enthralling weekend of Premier League action and tipster Jones Knows is back with his array of insights, analysis and betting angles.
I had to do a double take when reading that Leeds have taken the fewest points of any Premier League team away from home this season.
This is a Leeds team that are giving off all the signals that they should rate higher than mere relegation fodder - but it is taking a bit of patience to keep faith with them.
Since their return to Premier League in 2020, Leeds have won all five away games against promoted sides by a 14-3 aggregate.
And remember, Tottenham have won all four meetings with City at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium without conceding.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal lost in the Premier League for just the second time this season as Everton pulled off a surprising 1-0 win over the leaders on Saturday in its first match under new manager Sean Dyche.
AdvertisementWhile Everton climbed out of the relegation zone at least temporarily, Arsenal tasted defeat in the league for the first time since losing at Manchester United on Sept. 4.
Second-place Manchester City can trim the gap to Arsenal to two points with a win at Tottenham on Sunday, though Arsenal would still have a game in hand.
Indeed, frustrations boiled over in stoppage time as Arsenal left back Oleksandr Zinchenko clashed with Everton substitute Neal Maupay off the ball.
“We needed more composure and to control emotionally the game better.

     Summary: AdvertisementPremier League clubs are working on commercial deals, none of which will set pulses racing like the capture of a new centre forward, but they matter a lot in a world where cash is king.
Brentford, Fulham and Wolverhampton Wanderers are also due to see shirt sponsorship agreements expire at the end of this season.
Nottingham Forest, meanwhile, are still attempting to find a deal, having been left without a commercial sponsor this season.
“These clubs look at one another and it’s almost like a transfer market where one deal can shift the expectations of all the other clubs,” says Haddad.
The need to grow commercial deals — at the top and bottom of the Premier League — is only intensifying.

     James Tarkowski scores as Everton stun Premier League leaders Arsenal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Defeat was Arsenal's first since September, and only their second in the league, and opened the door for Manchester City to close the five-point gap at Tottenham on Sunday.
But in between there was much greater optimism with Dyche making an immediate impact despite having just five days to work with his new squad.
Martin Odegaard ballooned over from Eddie Nketiah's cross early in the second half as Arsenal redoubled their efforts with new signings Leandro Trossard and Jorginho soon introduced.
But they had not had a touch before Tarkowski rose above a crowded six-yard box to head home a corner and get the old stadium rocking.
It was the only negative response all afternoon for the hosts, who were cheered from first to last by supporters desperate for some relief from a second successive relegation battle.
