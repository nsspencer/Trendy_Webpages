     Summary: Feb 3, 2023; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Saben Lee tries to cut off Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon (13) during the second half at TD Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsIn something you hardly, if ever, want to hear in early February, the Boston Celtics decided to match the weather outside TD Garden on Friday night.
Back on their home parquet for the first time since Wednesday’s trouncing of Kyrie Irving and the Nets, the Celtics put forth one of their coldest shooting nights of the season and paid for it with a 106-94 loss to the Suns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a dominant performance against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, the Boston Celtics took their foot off the gas in an embarrassing loss to the Phoenix Suns.
The Celtics have now lost four of their last six games, and they are in desperate need of Marcus Smart.
The third quarter saw a shift from the Boston Celtics as they outscored the Suns 29-17 in the quarter.
With an 8-0 run to start the fourth quarter, the Suns pulled away from the Celtics to secure the victory.
The Boston Celtics need Marcus Smart backThe Celtics’ offense has been horrible in this poor six-game stretch, and it has been without Marcus Smart.

     Summary: "Rounding third," Booker said after watching from the bench as his Phoenix Suns teammates beat the Celtics 106-94 on Friday night.
Mikal Bridges scored 25 points and Dario Saric had 14 with 13 rebounds Friday night to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 106-94 victory over Boston and send the NBA-leading Celtics to their fourth loss in six games.
The Celtics scored the first seven points of the game, but quickly gave it all back.
Phoenix scored the next 12, with Ayton putting in three straight baskets to start the run.
The Suns started the second quarter with back-to-back 3-pointers by Ish Wainright and Lee - sparking another 8-0 run that helped them open a 32-20 lead.

     Cold Shooting Sinks C’s on Frigid Night in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a frigid night in Boston, the Celtics' shooting hands couldn't warm up.
The visiting Suns, meanwhile, brought the heat from Phoenix and sizzled their way to a 106-94 win inside TD Garden.
The C’s managed to put up just 44 points in the first half Friday night after pouring in 46 points during the first quarter of their 139-96 win Wednesday night.
Despite being unable to get going early on the offensive end, interim head coach Joe Mazzulla felt that the team “got off to a really good start” on the defensive side of the ball.
The most remarkable aspect of the feat was how Brown matched not only Lewis’ scoring total, but also Lewis’ games total.

     Celtics Overly Reliant on Jayson Tatum as Suns Stall Him in Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Jayson Tatum would not land among the most valuable player candidates if the Celtics did not need his presence to succeed.
The Celtics outscored Phoenix by one point in Tatum’s 37 minutes, underscoring a depth concern for Boston as the trade deadline approaches.
Bridges carries a lighter load than Tatum, who’s been thrust back into a play-making role since Smart’s injury.
Mazzulla trusts that process, maybe too much, and played Tatum for three straight quarters against Brooklyn and Golden State.
Tatum checked out shortly after and Malcolm Brogdon buoyed the offense with paint finishes against a 16-13 Suns push.

Are the Philadelphia 76ers the biggest threat to the Boston Celtics in the NBA’s Eastern Conference?
After a moribund start to their 2022-23 campaign, the Philadelphia 76ers have been on the upswing the past two months, crawling out of the depths of the standings in a very competitive Eastern Conference to pull within striking distance of the East’s top spot.
And while the Celtics have cooled after their red-hot start to the 2022-23 season, they also appear to be back on an upward trajectory.
