     How Manchester United held on to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after Casemiro's red card in Premier League match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United held on for a nervy 2-1 win over Crystal Palace as Casemiro was sent off at Old Trafford in the Premier League.
Marcus Rashford doubled the lead for Erik ten Hag's side in the 62nd minute, poking home a Luke Shaw cross from point-blank range.
Schlupp then scored six minutes later to give Palace a lifeline, awkwardly deflecting a looping ball over the head of David de Gea.
Palace had a few chances to find an equaliser in the closing minutes, but could not capitalise.
United climb to third in the table for the time being ahead of Newcastle's game later today, while Palace have still yet to earn a win in six matches in all competitions in the new year (2D 4L).

     Summary: FIRST HALF – FERNANDES FIRES REDS IN FRONTPrior to kick-off there were poignant scenes around Old Trafford as the club marked our closest home match to the 65th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster.
The manager had called on the players to draw inspiration from the Busby Babes and a fast-starting United netted our quickest Premier League goal of the season.
It came in dramatic circumstances when Marcus Rashford’s cross hit the raised arm of Will Hughes in the penalty area.
Stepping up to take the spot-kick, Bruno Fernandes coolly sent Palace keeper Vicente Guaita the wrong way, striking the ball into the bottom left corner.
On this occasion, David De Gea was able to keep out the attempt.
