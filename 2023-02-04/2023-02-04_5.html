     Lionel Messi is Mr. Reliable! PSG winners, losers &amp; ratings as Argentina star steps up with Mbappe &amp; Neymar out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi scored a second-half winner against Toulouse on Saturday to lift the Ligue 1 leaders in the absence of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.
He floated around, enjoyed a few touches, and served as an unnerving presence, more a warning than an attacking threat.
PSG struggled for a creative spark in the fitness-related absence of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, with Lionel Messi a peripheral figure in the early goings.
Toulouse had one clear chance late on, but Donnarumma equaled a scrappy effort after a scramble in the box.
And it was all about Messi in the end, the Argentine stepping up in the absence of Mbappe and Neymar, dragging PSG to the finish line.

     Messi’s goal helps French leader PSG beat Toulouse 2-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS (AP) — After Lionel Messi’s second-half goal helped a lackluster Paris Saint-Germain beat Toulouse 2-1 to move eight points clear at the top of the French league on Saturday, the team was urged to lighten their superstar’s load.
PSG was without injured forwards Kylian Mbappé and Neymar and relied heavily on Messi, who hit the post during stoppage time.
After Marquinhos hit the post with a header from Messi’s corner, PSG equalized with a fine 20-meter strike from Hakimi in the 38th.
But Marquinhos appeared offside on Messi’s goal, to the frustration of sarcastic-sounding Toulouse coach Philippe Montanier.
Second-placed Marseille needs to beat Nice at home on Sunday to stay five points behind PSG ahead of their clash on Feb. 26.

     Messi to the rescue as PSG extend Ligue 1 lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi scored in the second half to help Paris St Germain recover from a woeful start and extend their Ligue 1 lead to a provisional eight points with a 2-1 home victory on Saturday.
Messi struck the winner after the break with his third goal in his last five league games to put PSG on 54 points from 22 games.
Olympique de Marseille are second on 46 points before hosting Nice on Sunday with third-placed RC Lens travelling to Stade Brestois.
Without Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, both injured, Messi was flanked by Hugo Ekitike in attack with Vitinha just behind.
Rennes are left in fifth place on 40 points, with Lille in sixth, two points behind them.

     Lionel Messi rescues underwhelming PSG without Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in win over Toulouse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain ended Toulouse's impressive unbeaten start to 2023 with a 2-1 win in Ligue 1 at Parc des Princes on Saturday.
However, despite Messi and Hakimi's heroics in the absence of injured superstar pair Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, Les Parisiens still felt extremely labored and underwhelming in victory.
Van den Boomen demonstrated his free kick prowess again late on but this time it passed without incident for the home side.
In many ways, flat showings like this are to be expected when PSG are missing Mbappe and Neymar but Messi adds that extra insurance policy for these sorts of tricky games.
PSG have been labored since the FIFA 2022 World Cup and that appears set to continue despite this success.

     Messi hits winner as PSG come from behind to beat Toulouse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi scored a superb second-half winner as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing the injured Kylian Mbappe and Neymar came from behind to beat Toulouse 2-1 on Saturday and consolidate their lead at the top of Ligue 1.
Messi then put PSG in front just before the hour mark with a glorious first-time strike on his left foot low into the corner of the net from just outside the area.
- Wins for Lyon, Lille -The outcome was rarely in doubt after that with PSG -- who have had some recent wobbles -- deserved winners.
Anthony Rouault did force a good save from Donnarumma deep into injury time before Messi hit the post again right at the death.
Meanwhile Rennes missed out on an 11th consecutive home league win as they went down 3-1 to fellow European hopefuls Lille.
