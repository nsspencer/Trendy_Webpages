     Duke basketball, Jon Scheyer beat North Carolina in Cameron
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DURHAM – Duke basketball and coach Jon Scheyer drew first blood against North Carolina as the storied rivalry began its next chapter without Mike Krzyzewski.
Saturday's 63-57 win gave Scheyer his first career win over the Tar Heels and offered a slight reprieve from the angst of last year's loss in the national semifinal and Coach K's final game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Jeremy Roach, the lone starter returning from last year's Duke team, dealt the final blow, scoring the final four points in the win.
Armando Bacot had 12 points for the Tar Heels as UNC took a 19-12 lead in the opening 10 minutes.
Governor Roy Cooper made an appearance at Cameron as well as UNC quarterback Drake Maye and former Tar Heels QB Sam Howell.

     5 observations from Duke men's basketball's first half against North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dereck Lively II (right) had four blocks in the first half to help Duke keep a one-point lead going into the locker room.
Heading into the break, the Blue Devils have a slim advantage at 33-32.
But really, it’s just a game, one that the Blue Devils have played before and they will play again after.
MatchupsThe Blue Devils played aggressive man defense in the first half in an attempt to stifle a clearly energized North Carolina team, one up for the challenge of hostile territory.
Filipowski alone turned the ball over three times, Nance twice, as the Blue Devils and Tar Heels tallied seven and five turnovers, respectively.
