     Summary: Ryan Bader stops Fedor Emelianenko in the first at Bellator 290For the final time, the legendary Fedor Emelianenko made the walk to the cage on Saturday at Bellator 290, taking on heavyweight champion Ryan Bader.
Bader scored a quick knockout win over Emelianenko in 2019, and it’s the one loss Emelianenko said that he wanted back.
In their first fight, it only took Bader 35 seconds.
Bader unloaded punch after punch and referee Herb Dead stepped in and stopped it.
Midway though the round, Eblen takes Tokov down and repeatedly slammed Tokov to the canvas each time he got up.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through the completion of two close rounds on Saturday, it appeared as if the Bellator MMA middleweight title was up for grabs.
That's when the gas tank and ragdoll wrestling of defending champion Johnny Eblen began to take over.
He mixed calf kicks with well-timed takedown attempts to eventually break the will of Tokov beginning late in Round 3.
Tokov (31-3) saw his seven-fight win streak under the Bellator banner come to a close.
Just eight months removed from dominating Gegard Mousasi to claim the middleweight title, Eblen already had a scenario in mind for his next title defense.
