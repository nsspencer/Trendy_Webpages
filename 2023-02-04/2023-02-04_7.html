     Senior Bowl 2023: National team dominates American in 27-10 victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The National team turned in one of the more decisive performances in recent Reese’s Senior Bowl history, dominating the American team 27-10 on a beautiful day at Mobile’s Hancock Whitney Stadium.
The other three possessions — including both by the American team — ended in punts.
But he did not re-enter the game after Johnson’s pick-six pulled the American team within 20-10.
Bagent led the American team with 138 yards on 17-for-22 passing, while Houston’s Clayton Tune went 9-for-12 for 70 yards.
Cincinnati linebacker Ivan Pace of the National team led all tacklers with 10 stops.

     Summary: The first stage of the 2023 NFL draft process is complete, with another Reese’s Senior Bowl in the books.
RELATED: National team dominates American in 27-10 victorySo who made the biggest impressions during Senior Bowl 2023 week?
His height (officially 5-foot-10 ¼ at the Senior Bowl weigh-in) might be the only knock against him.
Tyjae Spears, RB, Tulane — Spears was the hands-down best player of the week during Senior Bowl practices, picking up right where he left off in his star-making performance vs. USC in the Cotton Bowl.
O’Cyrus Torrence, OL, Florida — The Senior Bowl consistently cranks out elite offensive linemen, and Torrence was the best of the interior group during the week.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Firstly, we've got to mention Nationals QB, Jake Haener, who picked up the MVP award.
From his running game, to calmness in the pocket and of course his arm, it looks like we've got a star in the making.
A division 2 quarterback, Bagent showed a calmness and arm strength that would likely make you think he plays for one of the nation's top programs.
Ultimately, the Senior Bowl was exactly what it's meant to be: a fun, respectful forum in which the next generation of football's stars get to show their mettle.
With that, we thank you for joining us and we hope you enjoyed our coverage of the 2023 Reese's Senior Bowl!

Houston has a member of their 2022 staff on the National Team.
Starting in 2021, the Senior Bowl ditched the North and South team designations in favor of the National and American teams — no different than from 1991-93 when they had the AFC versus the NFC.
The National Team is 2-0 since the name change.
