     Senior Bowl 2023 score: Fresno State's Jake Haener wins MVP as National Team rolls over American Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The National Team rolled over the American Team, 27-10, in the 2023 Reese's Senior Bowl as Fresno State's Jake Haener won MVP after going 12 of 19 for 145 yards and 1 touchdown.
Talent evaluators from all 32 NFL franchises were on hand in Mobile, Alabama, for the entire week of practices leading up to this game.
For most personnel executives, it's all about the practice week, meeting with the players, and watching how they interact with the rest of their team.
It was a lopsided affair between the National (17 points) and American (3 points) teams in the first half.
When that concludes, Pro Days begin in earnest and teams can conduct top-30 visits at respective team headquarters.

     Summary: The Senior Bowl represents the unofficial kickoff to draft season.
Houston has a member of their 2022 staff on the National Team.
Starting in 2021, the Senior Bowl ditched the North and South team designations in favor of the National and American teams — no different than from 1991-93 when they had the AFC versus the NFC.
The National Team is 2-0 since the name change.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Firstly, we've got to mention Nationals QB, Jake Haener, who picked up the MVP award.
From his running game, to calmness in the pocket and of course his arm, it looks like we've got a star in the making.
A division 2 quarterback, Bagent showed a calmness and arm strength that would likely make you think he plays for one of the nation's top programs.
Ultimately, the Senior Bowl was exactly what it's meant to be: a fun, respectful forum in which the next generation of football's stars get to show their mettle.
With that, we thank you for joining us and we hope you enjoyed our coverage of the 2023 Reese's Senior Bowl!
