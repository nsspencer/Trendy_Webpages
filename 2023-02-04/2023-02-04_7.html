     Jurgen Klopp confident he can help Liverpool bounce back from ‘concerning’ run of form
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jurgen Klopp vowed to lead Liverpool out of their alarming slump after they crashed to a wretched 3-0 defeat by Wolves.
AdvertisementAsked if he still had confidence in his own ability to put things right, Klopp said: “Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Ruben Neves wrapped up the points in the second half after Klopp’s men had squandered some glorious chances to reduce the deficit.
Seven or eight players had no part in the first goal, seven or eight had no part in the second goal, but everybody is influenced by it.
GO DEEPER Is Jurgen Klopp really as bad with substitutions as people think?

     Jurgen Klopp: I'm 'angry' after latest Liverpool defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he has no explanation for his side's 3-0 defeat at Wolves on Saturday, adding he was "angry" and "disappointed."
Two goals which cannot happen like that," Klopp told Premier League Productions after the game.
I stand here again and for the first 15 minutes I have no explanation, I'm sorry.
But it's right because when you start like this you don't deserve anything in a Premier League game.
For the moment, I'm so disappointed and angry about the first 15 minutes, I can't find the words for it.

     Sorry Liverpool thrashed 3-0 at Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In their best performance of the season, Wolves cut through Liverpool's shaky defence from the off, missing two good chances before a Hwang Hee-Chan cutback went in off the heel of Joel Matip for a fifth minute own goal.
Defeat left Liverpool 10th on 29 points after a terrible start to 2023 in which they have won just one of seven matches - against Wolves in the FA Cup - in all competitions.
The result was the first time in a decade that Liverpool have lost three consecutive Premier League away games.
"We love super Lopetegui," the Molineux crowd sang to their Spanish manager Julen Lopetegui, who took over in November charged with saving Wolves' Premier League status.
Wolves' boss was thrilled with the performance but cautioned his team still had plenty of work to ensure safety.

     Wolves 3-0 Liverpool: Twelve minutes of misery as Reds hit new low in difficult season
    </h2>

     Summary: If a 3-0 loss at Brighton last month felt like a significant low, then this 3-0 defeat at Molineux was arguably worse.
This latest defeat also marked the first time since 2012 that Liverpool have lost three successive away games in the Premier League.
Twelve minutes of miseryFor Klopp, the damage done against Wolves was self-inflicted with a dreadful opening.
'Sacked in the morning' - can Klopp turn it around?
Asked if he believes in his own ability to turn things around for the Reds, Klopp responded: "Yes.
