     Armie Hammer admits to being emotionally abusive in first interview since scandal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two years after reports began emerging of allegations of strange—and sometimes criminal—behavior against Armie Hammer, the actor has given his first interview, to the online newsletter Air Mail.
In the interview, Hammer discusses a variety of topics about the general trajectory of his life over the last two years, including admitting to being emotionally abusive to some of the women who’ve come forward with allegations against him—but also denying accusations of rape.
After issuing a brief statement, Hammer fell off the radar—other than occasional reports that he was currently working as a Cayman Islands timeshare salesman, of all things.
Stating that “the power dynamics were off” in the relationships, Hammer admitted “one million percent” to being emotionally abusive toward both women.
(The LA District Attorney’s office appears to have opted not to move forward with a case.)
