    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Celtics trade deadline plans are all but certain to be cautiously ambitious — though not according to 98.5 The Sports Hub’s James Stewart, the executive producer of the Felger &amp; Mazz program.
Lower on the list is Immanuel Quickley, whose likely to be promoted to the starting lineup before getting traded, Damon Jones, who has been retired since 2009, and Anthony Davis.
While no context as to how Boston would go about a Davis trade was included, the Houdini is here to stomp out that idea with spiked boots.
The Boston Celtics won’t be acquiring a starterFor those hoping to see the Boston Celtics trade for a needle-moving star, stop dreaming so big about that and save your gaudy visions for the current roster winning a title.
Last season, the Cs had the best starting lineup, and in 2022-23, Derrick White has been a stellar stand-in for the first five.

"I asked a couple people around the league, and league sources indicate the Celtics' interest here is real," Forsberg explained.
There's going to be some competition for Kelly Olynyk, not the least of which will be Miami -- another team that's had him.

     Summary: After a dominant performance against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, the Boston Celtics took their foot off the gas in an embarrassing loss to the Phoenix Suns.
The Celtics have now lost four of their last six games, and they are in desperate need of Marcus Smart.
The third quarter saw a shift from the Boston Celtics as they outscored the Suns 29-17 in the quarter.
With an 8-0 run to start the fourth quarter, the Suns pulled away from the Celtics to secure the victory.
The Boston Celtics need Marcus Smart backThe Celtics’ offense has been horrible in this poor six-game stretch, and it has been without Marcus Smart.

Back on their home parquet for the first time since Wednesday’s trouncing of Kyrie Irving and the Nets, the Celtics put forth one of their coldest shooting nights of the season and paid for it with a 106-94 loss to the Suns.

     Jaylen Brown calls out Celtics inconsistencies: ‘got to be able to get up for games’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – Following a dominant performance against the Brooklyn Nets in their previous game, the Boston Celtics fell flat on Friday night, falling to the Phoenix Suns 104-96.
“I think they came down and outplayed us from start to finish for the most part,” Jaylen Brown said post-game.
Inconsistencies on one end of the floor frequently lead to more inconsistencies on the other end, and that endless spiral is where the Celtics often find themselves trapped.
At their best, the Celtics can go toe-to-toe with anyone, and they might be the favorites to win the title.
You got to be able to get up for games and match other teams’ energy,” Brown stated.

     NBA trade deadline: Five players Brad Stevens and the Celtics could target to help push for a title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With one surprising trade request, Nets star Kyrie Irving ensured that most of the buzz ahead of Thursday’s trade deadline will be centered on Brooklyn.
With that in mind, here are five options president of basketball operations Brad Stevens and his staff might want to consider.
Stevens likes Olynyk, the sweet-shooting 7-footer who spent his first four NBA seasons with the Celtics.
He’s making just $1.8 million this season and would easily fit into one of Boston’s smaller trade exceptions.
Washington: The 6-foot-7-inch forward is still just 24 years old and is making $5.8 million this season.

     Summary: “Rounding third,” Booker said after watching from the bench as his Phoenix Suns teammates beat the Celtics 106-94 on Friday night.
Mikal Bridges scored 25 points and Dario Saric had 14 with 13 rebounds Friday night to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 106-94 victory over Boston and send the NBA-leading Celtics to their fourth loss in six games.
The Celtics scored the first seven points of the game, but quickly gave it all back.
Phoenix scored the next 12, with Ayton putting in three straight baskets to start the run.
The Suns started the second quarter with back-to-back 3-pointers by Ish Wainright and Lee — sparking another 8-0 run that helped them open a 32-20 lead.
