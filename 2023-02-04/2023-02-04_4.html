Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsIn something you hardly, if ever, want to hear in early February, the Boston Celtics decided to match the weather outside TD Garden on Friday night.
Back on their home parquet for the first time since Wednesday’s trouncing of Kyrie Irving and the Nets, the Celtics put forth one of their coldest shooting nights of the season and paid for it with a 106-94 loss to the Suns.

     Summary: Boston Celtics trade deadline plans are all but certain to be cautiously ambitious — though not according to 98.5 The Sports Hub’s James Stewart, the executive producer of the Felger &amp; Mazz program.
Lower on the list is Immanuel Quickley, whose likely to be promoted to the starting lineup before getting traded, Damon Jones, who has been retired since 2009, and Anthony Davis.
While no context as to how Boston would go about a Davis trade was included, the Houdini is here to stomp out that idea with spiked boots.
The Boston Celtics won’t be acquiring a starterFor those hoping to see the Boston Celtics trade for a needle-moving star, stop dreaming so big about that and save your gaudy visions for the current roster winning a title.
Last season, the Cs had the best starting lineup, and in 2022-23, Derrick White has been a stellar stand-in for the first five.

Phoenix Suns' Deandre Ayton (22) dunks in front of Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum (0) during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Friday, Feb. 3, 2023, in Boston.
Boston shot less than 40 percent from the field and was held to under 100 points.
Collectively, Phoenix shot just over 43 percent, which is a below-average performance for them.
But the Suns outhustled and outrebounded the Celtics, which led to Phoenix taking 20 more shots than Boston did.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns never quite found the shooting touch, but Phoenix found their energy to pull away from Boston a couple of different times.
Joe Mazzulla called it “inconsistent execution”, while Jaylen Brown said Boston was “going through the motions”.
For large portions of the game, the Celtics looked like they were at the end of a five-games-in-seven-nights stretch or something.
Boston started out dreadfully cold from the floor, minus Brown, who had 10 points to open the game.

The network recently re-released the documentary ahead of the release of his Netflix documentary due out on Feb. 8, which traces his journey to joining the team and his relationship with its legendary coach and manager Red Auerbach, as well as the extraordinary work he did off the court as an activist.
