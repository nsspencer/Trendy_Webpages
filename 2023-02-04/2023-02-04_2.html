     Summary: Feb 3, 2023; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Saben Lee tries to cut off Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon (13) during the second half at TD Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsIn something you hardly, if ever, want to hear in early February, the Boston Celtics decided to match the weather outside TD Garden on Friday night.
Back on their home parquet for the first time since Wednesday’s trouncing of Kyrie Irving and the Nets, the Celtics put forth one of their coldest shooting nights of the season and paid for it with a 106-94 loss to the Suns.

     Summary: After a dominant performance against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, the Boston Celtics took their foot off the gas in an embarrassing loss to the Phoenix Suns.
The Celtics have now lost four of their last six games, and they are in desperate need of Marcus Smart.

With an 8-0 run to start the fourth quarter, the Suns pulled away from the Celtics to secure the victory.

     Cold Shooting Sinks C’s on Frigid Night in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a frigid night in Boston, the Celtics' shooting hands couldn't warm up.
The visiting Suns, meanwhile, brought the heat from Phoenix and sizzled their way to a 106-94 win inside TD Garden.
The C’s managed to put up just 44 points in the first half Friday night after pouring in 46 points during the first quarter of their 139-96 win Wednesday night.
Despite being unable to get going early on the offensive end, interim head coach Joe Mazzulla felt that the team “got off to a really good start” on the defensive side of the ball.
The most remarkable aspect of the feat was how Brown matched not only Lewis’ scoring total, but also Lewis’ games total.

     Summary: Celtics The Celtics miss Marcus Smart, but that wasn’t why they lost against the Suns The Celtics have lost four out of six without Smart.
Phoenix Suns' Deandre Ayton (22) dunks in front of Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum (0) during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Friday, Feb. 3, 2023, in Boston.
Boston shot less than 40 percent from the field and was held to under 100 points.
Collectively, Phoenix shot just over 43 percent, which is a below-average performance for them.
But the Suns outhustled and outrebounded the Celtics, which led to Phoenix taking 20 more shots than Boston did.

     Never warmed up: 10 Takeaways from Celtics-Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns never quite found the shooting touch, but Phoenix found their energy to pull away from Boston a couple of different times.
Joe Mazzulla called it “inconsistent execution”, while Jaylen Brown said Boston was “going through the motions”.
For large portions of the game, the Celtics looked like they were at the end of a five-games-in-seven-nights stretch or something.
Boston started out dreadfully cold from the floor, minus Brown, who had 10 points to open the game.
When the calendar turned, so did Williams’ play.

     Summary: When the City of Boston honored Hall of Fame Boston Celtics big man Bill Russell with a bronze statue, NBC Boston Sports made a documentary about it.
The statute was created to commemorate Russell’s legendary career as a player and historic role as a humanitarian and activist fighting for civil rights in the 1960s until his passing in July of this year.
The network recently re-released the documentary ahead of the release of his Netflix documentary due out on Feb. 8, which traces his journey to joining the team and his relationship with its legendary coach and manager Red Auerbach, as well as the extraordinary work he did off the court as an activist.
