     McGregor to face Chandler on UFC return, says White
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 4 (Reuters) - Former UFC champion Conor McGregor will make his long-awaited return to the octagon against Michael Chandler after the two have coached in the UFC's "The Ultimate Fighter" reality TV show, UFC president Dana White has announced.
Irishman McGregor, the organisation's former featherweight and lightweight champion and the first UFC fighter to hold two world titles simultaneously, has not fought since suffering a gruesome leg break against Dustin Poirier in July 2021.
The 34-year-old will pit his wits against American Chandler, 36, as the two coach teams of up-and-coming fighters against each other in the TV series, which begins on ESPN on May 30, with the pair scheduled to meet when the season ends.

     Conor McGregor And Michael Chandler To Coach The Ultimate Fighter Season 31
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fighting out of Dublin, Ireland, McGregor made his name in the Octagon by becoming the first person to hold two UFC divisional titles simultaneously, a feat he accomplished by defeating Jose Aldo for featherweight gold and Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt.
In the process, “The Notorious” one became an international superstar, with memorable rivalries with Nate Diaz, Dustin Poirier, and Khabib Nurmagomedov making him a must-see for fight fans.
In 2015, McGregor traveled to Las Vegas to coach a team of UFC prospects against Urijah Faber, and this year, he’s back to do it again.
In 2021, Chandler debuted in the UFC with a first-round knockout of Dan Hooker, kicking off his quest for 155-pound gold.
But before that journey resumes this year, he will coach the next generation of UFC stars on The Ultimate Fighter.

     Summary: Conor McGregor will face lightweight star Michael Chandler once the next season of "The Ultimate Fighter" is concluded.
UFC president Dana White announced McGregor and Chandler as the coaches on social media Saturday.
A former UFC lightweight and featherweight champion, McGregor (22-6) was the first fighter to hold two separate weight division titles in UFC concurrently.
Chandler vows to take the fight to McGregor, going as far to predict a stoppage in the highly-anticipated clash.
"I'm going to get in his face right away, make him take a backwards step right away," Chandler told ESPN.
