     Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Liverpool LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Wolves games always competitive - KloppLiverpool suffered a Molineux nightmare as Jurgen Klopp’s side were outclassed by Wolves.
Joel Matip’s own goal, Craig Dawson’s debut strike and Ruben Neves’ effort sealed a stunning 3-0 win for the hosts as the shambolic Reds continued to sink.
Liverpool are floundering in 10th after a third straight Premier League away defeat and - aside from a spell after the break - were embarrassed by fired-up Wolves.
There is a direction to Wolves which is missing at Liverpool.
They had been plunged back into the relegation zone by Everton’s early win over Arsenal but responded in style, ahead of potential season-defining games with Southampton and Bournemouth.

     Liverpool's season hits new low in Wolves demolition job
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the Liverpool of 2023 – reactive to events, and ever less able to handle the setbacks, of which there have been plenty.
Since their brief rally after Christmas, Klopp’s team have lost away at Brentford, Brighton and now Wolverhampton Wanderers.
A squad that for periods of last season felt like they could win it all.
Yet much of it embodied the way Liverpool have played in their worst moments this season.
“[The] first 12 minutes is absolutely never helpful but especially now in our situation it is absolutely not allowed to happen,” Klopp said.

     Wolves fire three past Liverpool as top-four miles away from Reds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wolves entered the day in the bottom three and exits it in 15th with 20 points.
The Reds have big holes by Darwin Nunez is snakebit in front of goal and Cody Gakpo may get there.
Even more surprising, Wolves are still waiting on a goal from Raul Jimenez, Diego Costa, or injured Pedro Neto.
Liverpool has one win from its last three Premier League outings, but there’s a heaping helping of bad luck to their struggles.
The Reds have 24 goals from open play and 20 allowed in that same situation.
