     Wolves vs Liverpool: Lineups and LIVE updates
    </h2>

     Summary: Jurgen Klopp will be looking for a reaction from his Liverpool side when they travel to Molineux to take on Wolves on SaturdayWith the winter transfer window now closed, Wolves and Liverpool can turn their thoughts back to Saturday's Premier League game at Molineux.
The Reds will be looking to bounce back against Wolves after winning just one of their last six games in all competitions.
Liverpool defeated Wolves in the FA Cup last month, but only after a replay and a VAR blunder rescued their progression late in the first game.
However, the dire goalless draw against Chelsea in their most recent league game won't live long in the memory, and Klopp's men will be hoping to get back to winning ways here.
Things won't get much easier after that either, with the Reds facing Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 first leg on 22nd February.

     Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Liverpool LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Wolves games always competitive - KloppLiverpool suffered a Molineux nightmare as Jurgen Klopp’s side were outclassed by Wolves.
Joel Matip’s own goal, Craig Dawson’s debut strike and Ruben Neves’ effort sealed a stunning 3-0 win for the hosts as the shambolic Reds continued to sink.
Liverpool are floundering in 10th after a third straight Premier League away defeat and - aside from a spell after the break - were embarrassed by fired-up Wolves.
There is a direction to Wolves which is missing at Liverpool.
They had been plunged back into the relegation zone by Everton’s early win over Arsenal but responded in style, ahead of potential season-defining games with Southampton and Bournemouth.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool are back in action travelling to face Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 20th game of the season as the Premier League tips past its half way point.
For Wolves meanwhile it’s also been an unexpectedly difficult season, with Julen Lopetegui’s side currently flirting with the relegation places.
However, their form has improved since the Spaniard signed on and they gave Klopp’s Reds a tough go of it in the FA Cup, pushing them to a replay before falling 1-0 in a game they will have felt unfortunate to lose.
Liverpool then proceeded to be knocked out in the next round by Brighton.
Whatever happens on Saturday, stick with The Liverpool Offside for full coverage of the match.

     Wolves fire three past Liverpool as top-four miles away from Reds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wolves entered the day in the bottom three and exits it in 15th with 20 points.
The Reds have big holes by Darwin Nunez is snakebit in front of goal and Cody Gakpo may get there.
Even more surprising, Wolves are still waiting on a goal from Raul Jimenez, Diego Costa, or injured Pedro Neto.
Liverpool has one win from its last three Premier League outings, but there’s a heaping helping of bad luck to their struggles.
The Reds have 24 goals from open play and 20 allowed in that same situation.
