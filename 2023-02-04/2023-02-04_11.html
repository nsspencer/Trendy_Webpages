     Summary: The win also meant the Scarlet Knights split the season series with Michigan States after losing in the Breslin Center last month.
Neither team shot well −Rutgers shot 37.5 percent, Michigan State 34.5 percent.
It came during a dreadful offensive stretch for Michigan State, the Spartans unable to make shots from outside or around the rim.
With Rutgers up six with 34.5 seconds left, Cam Spencer got a critical rebound off a Michigan State miss.
It looked like Michigan State was putting itself in position to win.

     Michigan State basketball can't find late shots in 61-55 loss to Rutgers in NYC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK – Tom Izzo on Thursday said Michigan State basketball spent much its extra time off working on improving its offense.
The Scarlet Knights shot 57.9% in the second half to finish at 37.5%.
But MSU’s defense bothered the Scarlet Knights, holding them to 1-for-10 from 3-point range and just 24.1% overall in the half.
But the Scarlet Knights suffered a big loss when Mawot Mag collided on a drive with Akins and appeared to suffer a knee injury with 6:25 left before halftime.
But much of it came due to the Spartans and Scarlet Knights suffering bouts of poor shooting, puzzling decision-making and imprecise attempts at execution.
