     Bellator 290 results, highlights: Johnny Eblen batters Anatoly Tokov for decision to retain title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through the completion of two close rounds on Saturday, it appeared as if the Bellator MMA middleweight title was up for grabs.
That's when the gas tank and ragdoll wrestling of defending champion Johnny Eblen began to take over.
He mixed calf kicks with well-timed takedown attempts to eventually break the will of Tokov beginning late in Round 3.
Tokov (31-3) saw his seven-fight win streak under the Bellator banner come to a close.
Just eight months removed from dominating Gegard Mousasi to claim the middleweight title, Eblen already had a scenario in mind for his next title defense.
