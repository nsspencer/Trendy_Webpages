    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pi Day 2022 is Monday, March 14.
Romaniuk shares that apple pie is the most popular pie flavor across the nation â€“ making up more than a quarter of all pie purchases, per the companyâ€™s purchase data.
To determine its findings, Instacart looked at sales data between February 2021 and January 2022 to see which pie flavor in each state had the highest share over the national average.
"When looking at the top uniquely popular pie in each state compared to the nation overall, we found that cherry, pumpkin, apple and pecan are other top flavors people crave," says Romaniuk.
Pumpkin pie was the second most uniquely popular pie, beating out the competition in nine states, all west of Minnesota.

     Summary: National Pi Day is Monday, March 14, a day on which mathematicians honor the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter -- 3.14 -- otherwise known as pi or Ï€.
The first Pi Day celebration took place in 1988 when physicist Larry Shaw noted the link between March 14 and the first three digits of the mathematical constant.
Since then, Pi Day has not only morphed into a menagerie of mathematical events, but also a day to indulge in triangular slices of sweet and savory deliciousness which is why a number of local grocery stores and eateries are offering Pi Day deals.
