    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Pi Day takes place every year on March 14, a nod to the first three digits of the mathematical constant 3.14.
Falling on Albert Einstein’s birthday, Pi Day is celebrated by math fans all around the world – often with pie to celebrate all things pi!
Brainly, the largest online homework help community, surveyed 900 American students about math and pi, and found that math is not universally disliked as the cliche would suggest.
&gt;&gt; The value of pi was first calculated by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.
&gt;&gt; Pi was first baptized with the Greek letter as its name when William Oughtred called it as such in his works dating back to 1647, later embraced by the scientific community when Leonhard Euler used the symbol in 1737.
