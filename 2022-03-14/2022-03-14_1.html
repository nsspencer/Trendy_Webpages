     Summary: National Pi Day is Monday, March 14, a day on which mathematicians honor the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter -- 3.14 -- otherwise known as pi or π.
The first Pi Day celebration took place in 1988 when physicist Larry Shaw noted the link between March 14 and the first three digits of the mathematical constant.
Since then, Pi Day has not only morphed into a menagerie of mathematical events, but also a day to indulge in triangular slices of sweet and savory deliciousness which is why a number of local grocery stores and eateries are offering Pi Day deals.
BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse: Take half off a large pizza when placing a delivery or takeout order on BJ's website or mobile app.
Papa John's: Buy one regular priced large pizza and get a second large one-topping pizza for $3.14.

     Happy Pi Day!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Pi Day takes place every year on March 14, a nod to the first three digits of the mathematical constant 3.14.
Falling on Albert Einstein’s birthday, Pi Day is celebrated by math fans all around the world – often with pie to celebrate all things pi!
Brainly, the largest online homework help community, surveyed 900 American students about math and pi, and found that math is not universally disliked as the cliche would suggest.
&gt;&gt; The value of pi was first calculated by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.
&gt;&gt; Pi was first baptized with the Greek letter as its name when William Oughtred called it as such in his works dating back to 1647, later embraced by the scientific community when Leonhard Euler used the symbol in 1737.
