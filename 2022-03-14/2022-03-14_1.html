     Summary: National Pi Day is Monday, March 14, a day on which mathematicians honor the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter -- 3.14 -- otherwise known as pi or π.
The first Pi Day celebration took place in 1988 when physicist Larry Shaw noted the link between March 14 and the first three digits of the mathematical constant.
Since then, Pi Day has not only morphed into a menagerie of mathematical events, but also a day to indulge in triangular slices of sweet and savory deliciousness which is why a number of local grocery stores and eateries are offering Pi Day deals.

"Pi Day is such a special holiday for the Exploratorium," Samuel Sharkland, program developer at the museum, told ABC News.
