     It’s Pi Day! A brief history to explain our obsession with 3.14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archimedes placed pi between 223/71 and 22/7, so between 3.140 and 3.142, while Ptolemy found the first approximation correct to three decimal places: 3.141.
A millennium would pass before further significant advances led the 14th-century Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama to reach 11 decimal places.
Pi Day falls on March 14, or 3/14 according to the American dating system.
If you count the letters in each word, you’ll get 3.14159265358979323846, which is pi correct to 20 decimal places.
Author Michael Keith indicates the first 10,000 digits of pi through a book, titled Not A Wake (as you can see, its title encodes 3.14).

The first Pi Day celebration took place in 1988 when physicist Larry Shaw noted the link between March 14 and the first three digits of the mathematical constant.
Since then, Pi Day has not only morphed into a menagerie of mathematical events, but also a day to indulge in triangular slices of sweet and savory deliciousness which is why a number of local grocery stores and eateries are offering Pi Day deals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RapidEye/Getty Images(NEW YORK) — Every March 14, mathematicians, scientists and math lovers around the world celebrate Pi Day, a commemoration of the mathematical sign pi.
Her parents told her that, several years after the first Pi Day, she was in elementary school when she realized March 14 is also Albert Einstein’s birthday.
For the next Pi Day, Shaw built the so-called “Pi Shrine,” which is a circular plaque inside one of the museum’s circular classrooms.
The holiday has gotten such recognition that in March 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives designated March 14 as Pi Day.
“Pi Day is such a special holiday for the Exploratorium,” Samuel Sharkland, program developer at the museum, told ABC News.
