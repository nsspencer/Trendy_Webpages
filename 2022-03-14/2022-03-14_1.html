     Maine Math Teacher Is Back at It on Pi Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BIDDEFORD, Maine (AP) — You may have heard through the grapevine that it’s Pi Day.
That means a Maine teacher dubbed the “Pi Guy” is back at it.
Biddeford High School math teacher Jon Jacques always tries to make Pi Day fun through goofy antics, including musical parodies posted online.
This year, he’s provided his take on Marvin Gaye’s “Heard It Through the Grapevine” featuring the Biddeford Singers, jazz band and Pi-inspired lyrics.
In the past, he’s shaved a Pi symbol into his hair, sculpted a Pi out of snow, had a temporary Pi tattoo on his shaved head.

Yes today, March 14, is the celebration of the mathematical symbol pi, which of course is written as 3.14 for short.

     Summary: National Pi Day is Monday, March 14, a day on which mathematicians honor the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter -- 3.14 -- otherwise known as pi or π.
The first Pi Day celebration took place in 1988 when physicist Larry Shaw noted the link between March 14 and the first three digits of the mathematical constant.
Since then, Pi Day has not only morphed into a menagerie of mathematical events, but also a day to indulge in triangular slices of sweet and savory deliciousness which is why a number of local grocery stores and eateries are offering Pi Day deals.
BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse: Take half off a large pizza when placing a delivery or takeout order on BJ's website or mobile app.
Papa John's: Buy one regular priced large pizza and get a second large one-topping pizza for $3.14.

How did Pi Day start?
The museum said Shaw led Pi Day parades there every year until his passing in 2017.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every March 14, mathematicians, scientists and math lovers around the world celebrate Pi Day, a commemoration of the mathematical sign pi.
Her parents told her that, several years after the first Pi Day, she was in elementary school when she realized March 14 is also Albert Einstein's birthday.
For the next Pi Day, Shaw built the so-called "Pi Shrine," which is a circular plaque inside one of the museum's circular classrooms.
The holiday has gotten such recognition that in March 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives designated March 14 as Pi Day.
"Pi Day is such a special holiday for the Exploratorium," Samuel Sharkland, program developer at the museum, told ABC News.
