     LA Chargers sign former Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson to five-year, $82.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers and cornerback J.C. Jackson have agreed to a five-year, $82.5 million contract with $40 million guaranteed.
Jackson is coming off arguably the best season of his career in 2021, leading the Patriots defense from the cornerback position.
The 26-year-old Jackson has been one of the most productive corners in the NFL since entering the league in 2018, and he far exceeded his status as an un-drafted free-agent signing by the New England Patriots.
He was named a Pro Bowler for the first time in his career after setting career highs with 58 tackles and a league-high 23 passes defended, along with eight interceptions.

     Chargers expected to sign former Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson to five-year, $82.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson to a five-year, $82.5 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
The contract includes $28 million in the first year and $40 million over the first two, Rapoport added.
Not done bolstering their defense with Jackson, the Chargers are also expected to sign Rams defensive tackle ﻿Sebastian Joseph-Day﻿ to a three-year, $24 million deal with $15 million guaranteed, Rapoport reported.
Adding Jackson to pair with Pro Bowl safety Derwin James gives the Bolts one of the better secondaries in football.
Jackson is coming off a career year with the Patriots, tallying eight interceptions and an NFL-best 23 passes defensed to earn his first Pro Bowl nod and a second-team All-Pro selection.

     Summary: In the often unpredictable world of NFL free agency, the Chargers on Monday made three moves that were very foreseeable.
They agreed to terms with cornerback J.C. Jackson and interior linemen Sebastian Joseph-Day and Austin Johnson, bolstering a defense that sagged at times in 2021.
Chargers NFL free agency: Chargers need to put money where their defense is With free agency looming, Chargers coach Brandon Staley thinks his defense needs help on all levels, but especially in the middle of the defensive line and at cornerback.
Jackson had more interceptions in 2021 (eight) than all of the Chargers’ defensive backs combined (seven).
After news of Jackson joining the Chargers broke, James tweeted a photo of the two together last month at the Pro Bowl.
