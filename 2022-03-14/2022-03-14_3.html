     Steelers signing former Bears, Bills QB Mitch Trubisky to 2-year, $14 million deal: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Steelers have agreed to terms with former Bills quarterback Mitchell Trubisky on a two-year deal, sources confirmed to The Athletic.
The deal has a $14 million base salary and is worth up to $27 million with incentives, according to a source.
Trubisky spent last season serving as the backup to Buffalo starter Josh Allen.
Prior to signing with the Bills, Trubisky played four seasons with the Bears, who selected him in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft.
Despite a Pro Bowl season in 2018, Trubisky had a tumultuous tenure with the Bears, which included being benched for Nick Foles during the 2020 season.

     Steelers reach agreement with QB Mitchell Trubisky on two-year, $14.25M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Steelers have agreed to a two-year, $14.25 million deal with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky﻿, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.
Trubisky spent his first four seasons in Chicago, making a Pro Bowl in his second season, but struggled down the stretch and fell out of favor with Bears fans.
In his last season as a starter, Trubisky completed 67% of his passes for 205.5 pass yards, 16 passing touchdowns, eight interceptions, and 93.5 passer rating -- nine starts in 2020.
After flashing potential early in his career, Trubisky struggled mightily with his accuracy downfield and never developed as a pocket passer.
The Steelers believe dormant talent remains in the former first-round pick, who does bring mobility coach Mike Tomlin desired in the position.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Bears quarterback Mitch Trubisky will sign a two-year deal with the Steelers, where the expectation is he’ll serve as Pittsburgh’s starter.
It’s been an interesting couple of years for Trubisky, who went from failed No.
2 overall pick with Chicago to backup quarterback with the Bills to likely starter with the Steelers.
There were plenty of Bears fans that were excited about Trubisky getting another chance to start and other fans that made some jokes at his expense.
Here’s how the NFL world reacted to the Trubisky news:

     Mitch Trubisky gets another chance to start — in Pittsburgh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Mitch Trubisky’s second act with the first string will be in Pittsburgh.
But when it happens, Trubisky will get an opportunity he wasn’t afforded last year — to prove he can start.
If Trubisky succeeds, he’d help prove that former coach Matt Nagy was more to blame for the Bears’ offensive struggles.
None of those quarterbacks has a better résumé than Trubisky, who won 29 of 50 starts with the Bears and reached the playoffs twice.
Trubisky will make $14.25 million total — or up to $27 million after incentives, according to NFL Network.

     Mitchell Trubisky addition gives Steelers quarterback flexibility, valuable insurance policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- Less than an hour into the NFL’s legal tampering period on Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to terms with a quarterback.
“I am beyond excited and blessed for the opportunity to be a part of the Pittsburgh Steelers organization,” Trubisky texted to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
They have built one of the best rosters in football, and I can’t wait to contribute and help this team continue their success.”Is Trubisky the next great Steelers quarterback?
Mitchell Trubisky may not be the next great Steelers quarterback, but the odds were that role wasn't going to be filled this year.
It will take adding to the offensive line, inside linebackers, defensive line and secondary, but a strong run game and a championship-level defense can bolster an average passing attack.

     Summary: Plenty of ex-first-round QBs have gotten second chances in new locales, and there have been high hopes for them.
His five-year, $82.5 million deal has $40 million in its first two years, with all of that money fully guaranteed, and over $54 million in its first three years.
So the Jags are getting a good player, albeit one they overpaid for.
• Good for Haason Reddick, scoring a three-year, $45 million deal.
Everyone knew he was a good player coming out of Temple, but his sawed-off build had most project him to play an off-ball linebacker spot.
