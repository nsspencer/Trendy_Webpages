     Summary: The New England Patriots are keeping ﻿Mac Jones﻿' tutor in Foxborough.
The Pats agreed to a two-year contract with backup quarterback ﻿Brian Hoyer﻿, his agent announced Monday morning.
Hoyer backed up Jones last season, appearing in five games and attempting 11 passes.
He last started a game in 2020 for New England -- a 26-10 loss at Kansas City.
Hoyer was a priority for the Pats to retain to ensure Jones is supported by a veteran presence who can help the young QB in the film room.
