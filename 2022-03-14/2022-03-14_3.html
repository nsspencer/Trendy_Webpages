     Report: Former Bears QB Mitch Trubisky to Sign With Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Report: Mitch Trubisky to sign with Steelers originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoMitchell Trubisky has found his new home.
The Steelers are presumably bringing Trubisky in to compete for a starting job now that Ben Roethlisberger has retired.
Trubisky spent the past season as a backup quarterback for the Bills, learning from offensive coordinator Brian Daboll and starting QB Josh Allen.
In four years with the Bears, Trubisky compiled a 29-21 record, threw for 10,609 yards, 64 touchdowns and 37 interceptions.
But Matt Nagy’s offense never blossomed with Trubisky under center, and the team opted to let him walk in 2021, instead of picking up his fifth-year option.

     Steelers signing former Bears, Bills QB Mitch Trubisky: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Steelers have agreed to terms with former Bills quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, sources confirmed to The Athletic.
Trubisky spent last season serving as the backup to Buffalo starter Josh Allen.
Prior to signing with the Bills, Trubisky played four seasons with the Bears, who selected him in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft.
Despite a Pro Bowl season in 2018, Trubisky had a tumultuous tenure with the Bears, which included being benched for Nick Foles during the 2020 season.
The 27-year-old passer has appeared in 57 games and completed 64.1 percent of his passes for 10,652 yards, 64 touchdowns and 38 interceptions.

     QB Mitchell Trubisky says he plans to sign two-year deal with Pittsburgh Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent quarterback Mitchell Trubisky plans to sign a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Monday.
Trubisky said his decision came down to the Steelers and New York Giants.
And they also are expected to sign veteran center Mason Cole to a three-year deal, a source said.
In Pittsburgh, Trubisky will compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting quarterback position as the franchise begins the post-Ben Roethlisberger era.
"Going to Buffalo really opened my eyes," Trubisky told Fowler in February.

     Mitch Trubisky gets another chance to start — in Pittsburgh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mitch Trubisky’s second act with the first string will be in Pittsburgh.
But when it happens, Trubisky will get an opportunity he wasn’t afforded last year — to prove he can start.
It’s the best situation Trubisky could have hoped for, offering him the stability — and the offensive skill players — the Bears never could from 2017-20.
Contract details weren’t immediately available — a sign, perhaps, that Trubisky’s deal isn’t lucrative.
If Trubisky succeeds, he’d help prove that former Bears head coach Matt Nagy was more to blame than the quarterback for the Bears’ offensive struggles.

     Steelers reach agreement with QB Mitchell Trubisky on two-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported Monday that the Steelers agreed to a two-year deal with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky﻿, per sources informed of the deal.
Trubisky spent his first four seasons in Chicago, making a Pro Bowl in his second season, but struggled down the stretch and fell out of favor with Bears fans.
In his last season as a starter, Trubisky completed 67% of his passes for 205.5 pass yards, 16 passing touchdowns, eight interceptions, and 93.5 passer rating -- nine starts in 2020.
After flashing potential early in his career, Trubisky struggled mightily with his accuracy downfield and never developed as a pocket passer.
The Steelers believe dormant talent remains in the former first-round pick, who does bring mobility coach Mike Tomlin desired in the position.
