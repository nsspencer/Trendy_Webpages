     NFL free agency 2022: 9 bold predictions as action is set to begin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NFL year is just days away from kicking off.
Monday signals the opening of the “legal tampering window,” wherein NFL teams and the representatives of free-agent players are permitted to negotiate toward new deals.
Then, Wednesday afternoon, those players are allowed to sign contracts.
If last week is any indication, free agency is shaping up to feature a great deal of intrigue full of comings, goings, and record-setting contracts.

     Welcome to the NFL’s legal tampering period
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the beginning of the offseason, NFL rules strictly prohibit teams from contacting players under contract with other franchises; teams can’t even communicate with agents for such players.
That is, except during one of the most absurd parts of the NFL season: the “legal tampering period,” which begins at 11 a.m. Arrowhead Time on Monday and runs until the beginning of the 2022 league year at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
We’re not supposed to notice that many of these contracts will be announced very soon after the legal tampering period begins — clearly suggesting there was some communication between those teams and agents before the league-approved period began.
As the saying goes, that’s the first rule of the legal tampering period: we don’t talk about the other tampering period.
But most of the so-called “first wave” of free agency — in which the biggest NFL free agents will make the splashiest moves to new teams — will take place in the next couple of days.

     Summary: The NFL’s legal tampering period is set to begin on Monday.
The legal tampering period is a two-day negotiating window, during which NFL teams can begin communicating with representation for pending free agents.
There are a ton of different rules and regulations from the NFL surrounding what exactly the legal tampering period entails.
What you can’t do during the legal tampering period:Teams can’t talk to restricted free agents or exclusive rights free agents during this two-day period.
Given how tight the Chiefs are against the salary cap, I don’t expect them to be super active during the legal tampering period.
