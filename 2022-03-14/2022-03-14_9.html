     Jane Campion apologizes to Williams sisters for ‘thoughtless comment’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a statement, Campion said: “I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved.
“Venus and Serena, what an honor to be in the room with you,” Campion said, before jokingly requesting tennis lessons.
However, you do not play against the guys like I have to.”Cameras showed Serena Williams applauding but Venus Williams seeming uncomfortable.
In careers which include 122 singles titles and three Olympic gold medals between them, the Williams sisters have competed against men, winning several mixed doubles titles.
Many suggested that remark ignored Black women affected by apartheid in South Africa, as well as the many barriers faced by marginalized women in the entertainment industry.

     Summary: However, while accepting the award for best director during Sunday’s ceremony, Campion’s speech turned controversial when she commented on Venus and Serena Williams’ tennis prowess.
You’re absolutely brilliant,” she continued, praising the evening’s SeeHer Award winner before turning her attention to “King Richard” subjects Venus and Serena Williams.
“Venus and Serena, you’re such marvels,” she said, circling back to her earlier talking point.
Some noted that Venus and Serena Williams could not only play against, but most likely beat, the men in their sport, as Campion had just done.
But most commenters simply questioned her decision to bring the Williams sisters and their tennis prowess into that conversation at all.
