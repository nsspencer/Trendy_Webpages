In four seasons with the Buccaneers, Cappa started 46 of 52 games.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals have reached an agreement with free agent right guard Alex Cappa.
$40 million deal with Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
After spending his rookie season on the bench, Cappa emerged as Tampa Bay’s starting right guard in 2019 and has held that spot ever since.
There should be no doubt that Cappa will come in and start for the Bengals at that position with this deal.

     Guard Alex Cappa plans to sign four-year deal with Cincinnati Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tampa Bay Buccaneers free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after free agency opens on Wednesday, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Bengals have also agreed to a three-year, $18 million deal with New England Patriots center/guard Ted Karras, sources told ESPN.
The additions of Cappa and Karras will bolster the Bengals' offensive line as the team tries to improve the protection for quarterback Joe Burrow.
A third-round draft pick out of Humboldt State in 2018, Cappa transitioned from offensive tackle to guard with the Buccaneers and earned a starting role in his second season in 2019.
Cappa and Karras join a Bengals team that reached Super Bowl LVI despite fielding one of the worst blocking units in the NFL, ranking 30th in pass block win rate during the regular season.

     Bengals Free Agency: Alex Cappa shores up right guard position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals wasted no time when the legal tampering aspect of free agency began, agreeing to terms on a deal with offensive guard Alex Cappa.
Bengals free agency kicked off at 12:00 EST and by 12:02, the team had already struck a deal with Cappa to bring him to Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
The right guard position was such a revolving door in 2021, as we saw three different guys start there and none of them were exactly stellar.
Cappa is a durable guard who should be able to give the Bengals stability at the right guard spot for the next four years.

     Instant analysis after Bengals agree to sign Alex Cappa in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals were one of the first teams out the door with a notable agreement to sign a free agent during Monday’s legal tampering window with guard Alex Cappa.
But he is a starting right guard who comes in and is drastically better than anything else the team started at the position last year.
Cappa is a third-round product from the 2018 draft who has started every game for the Buccaneers over the last two seasons.
This also frees up the draft and the rest of free agency a bit as they look to upgrade center, if not left guard and right tackle.
Notable media:#Bengals fans, Alex Cappa is a solid starting RG who has improved every year in NFL.
