     Cameron Smith Survives Sawgrass 18th Near-Disaster To Win The Players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameron Smith sealed the biggest win of his career on Monday at TPC Sawgrass with a birdie-filled display to triumph at the Players Championship.
Smith was five-under-par after six holes but then dropped three shots in a row before another four consecutive birdies.
Known as one of the best putters in the world, Smith was dynamite on the greens and brought the brutally difficult Sawgrass to its knees throughout the round.
It's nice to get it done," Smith said, before emotionally describing how his mother and sister were in the crowd.
Smith wins $3.6m in what is the largest first prize in PGA Tour history.

     Summary: After surprisingly making three straight bogeys to close out his front nine, the Aussie was back at it, making four birdies in a row on Nos.
10-13 to take a two-shot lead.
A pair of 9-iron shots on his approach at the par-4 10th and the tee shot on the par-3 13th set up two of them.
A 14-foot par save on 14 and another eight-footer save on 15—only his second and third pars of the round—kept the momentum and margin intact.
One more stuffed 9-iron—at the par-13 17th to four feet led to one final birdie, which was sorely needed after he bogeyed the last.

     Summary: Cameron Smith has become one of the best players in the world while being one of the most recognizable players on the PGA Tour, largely thanks to the mullet he has been sporting while playing golf.
So why does Cameron Smith wear a mullet for his haircut?
Why Cam Smith has a mullet at the 2022 The Players ChampionshipCam Smith started wearing a mullet back in 2021, just in time for the year-delayed 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Smith was one of the Australian players who represented his country in the men's golf competition.
As a duo, Smith and Leishman’s walk-up song for the first tee each day was “The Mullet Song” by Jay Powell.

     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Cameron Smith made the longest week at The Players Championship worth the wait.
Leading by two on the par-3 17th hole, 135 yards to the hole on an island green, Smith split the difference in the 12 feet that separated the flag from the water.
Smith punched out from the pine straw right of the 18th fairway all the way into the water.
Lahiri, who started the final round with a one-shot lead, birdied the 17th and needed one more to force a playoff.
He was two shots behind and in the same group as Smith when he looked to have a big advantage on the par-5 16th.
