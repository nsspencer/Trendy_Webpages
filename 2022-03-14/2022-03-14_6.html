     Summary: Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting near Ukraine's capital, the network said Monday.
It's not yet clear how he was injured or how severe his injuries are, though he has been hospitalized.
"Earlier today, our correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine," Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said in a memo to employees.
"This is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response," Hall said.
After Greg Gutfeld said the media is airing emotionally manipulating viewers on Ukraine to push a narrative, Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall pushes back: "Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response."
