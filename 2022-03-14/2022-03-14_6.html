     NFL Free Agency 2022: Complete signing tracker and instant grades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The slightly-lower grade here is only because a big money signing for a player coming off injury is a risk.
Two signings in and they’ve secured two really great offensive linemen who can start immediately, and they’re on good deals.
The issue isn’t the player here, it’s signing a running back to a free agent contract that out-strips his production.
Grade: CI really, really like this move because of what it signifies for the rest of Cincinnati’s free agency.
This is a great signing that will hopefully help make Kyler Murray happy.

Suffice to say, it's about to get wild, with dozens of big names still available (check out where Pete Prisco's top 100 free agents have landed here).
