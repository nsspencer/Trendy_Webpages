     Cameron Smith feeling at home in Ponte Vedra and The Players Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whether he's chasing down redfish or red numbers, Ponte Vedra Beach resident Cameron Smith is loving life on the First Coast at The Players Championship.
10 in the World Golf Ranking, the First Coast is becoming more of a home away from his original home in Brisbane, Australia.
Among the best parts: When thunderstorms washed out long stretches of golf around midday Thursday, nearly all of Friday and Saturday morning, Smith didn't have to shake up his usual weekend routine.
After missing the cut in his first two appearances at the May editions of The Players, Smith has started to make the course his own.
Then, on 18, Smith missed wide right into the trees off the tee, so often a sign of impending disaster.

So why does Cameron Smith wear a mullet for his haircut?
Why Cam Smith has a mullet at the 2022 The Players ChampionshipCam Smith started wearing a mullet back in 2021, just in time for the year-delayed 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

As a duo, Smith and Leishman’s walk-up song for the first tee each day was “The Mullet Song” by Jay Powell.
