     Cameron Smith wins 2022 THE PLAYERS Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — In a tournament that ended on a Monday for the first time since 2005, Jacksonville resident Cameron Smith won the 2022 THE PLAYERS Championship.
While it has been hard to keep track of days, the tournament finally took shape Monday morning as the number of players in contention seemed to grow.
The Players is looked upon as the fifth-biggest tournament in the world with its $20 million purse, a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour and three-year exemptions to the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open.
It requires navigating a final round on the Stadium Course at the TPC Sawgrass, famous for its water even in sunshine.

     Here’s why Cameron Smith has a mullet for a haircut at the 2022 The Players Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameron Smith has become one of the best players in the world while being one of the most recognizable players on the PGA Tour, largely thanks to the mullet he has been sporting while playing golf.
So why does Cameron Smith wear a mullet for his haircut?
Why Cam Smith has a mullet at the 2022 The Players ChampionshipCam Smith started wearing a mullet back in 2021, just in time for the year-delayed 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Smith was one of the Australian players who represented his country in the men's golf competition.
As a duo, Smith and Leishman’s walk-up song for the first tee each day was “The Mullet Song” by Jay Powell.

     Summary: And with a Monday round that was fitting of the week, Cameron Smith, the man from Down Under who sports the game’s most wicked mullet, outlasted his mates and won the biggest tournament of his career.
He had one par in his first 13 holes, then made pressure-packed putts to save par from 14 and 8 feet on the 14th and 15th holes.
Then, at the always heart-pounding par-3 17th, he rifled his tee shot right at the flag, the ball coming to rest 4 feet from the cup.
Paul Casey closed with a 69 to finish at 11 under.
Kevin Kisner shot 68 to finish at 10 under.

     Summary: Whether he's chasing down redfish or red numbers, Ponte Vedra Beach resident Cameron Smith is loving life on the First Coast at The Players Championship.
10 in the World Golf Ranking, the First Coast is becoming more of a home away from his original home in Brisbane, Australia.
Among the best parts: When thunderstorms washed out long stretches of golf around midday Thursday, nearly all of Friday and Saturday morning, Smith didn't have to shake up his usual weekend routine.
After missing the cut in his first two appearances at the May editions of The Players, Smith has started to make the course his own.
Then, on 18, Smith missed wide right into the trees off the tee, so often a sign of impending disaster.

     Summary: The win netted Smith $3.6 million but more importantly the biggest trophy of his career and a bump in the Official World Golf Rankings to No.
Lahiri's ensuing approach came nowhere near the hole, and he ultimately settled for par to end the round one shot back of Smith.
Lahiri held the lead entering Monday as golfers sought to finish their third rounds before completing their final 18 holes.
Smith shot 69-66 across his final 36 holes, while Lahiri was still tremendous with 67-69 to claim $2.2 million, more than he's earned across his entire PGA Tour career to this point.
His $3.6 million prize is the largest in golf history for an individual tournament.
