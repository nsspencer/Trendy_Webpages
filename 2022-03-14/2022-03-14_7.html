     Davante Adams, Green Bay Packers clash in extension talks amid franchise tag, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers and Davante Adams remain "far apart" on a long-term agreement that would keep Adams in Green Bay, according to NFL Network insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero.
An extension would help the team get under the salary cap in time for a looming March 16 deadline.
(An exclusive tag would have prevented Adams from shopping himself but it would have cost the Packers more money than the non-exclusive tag).
Without using the tag, Adams would have become an unrestricted free agent Wednesday.
Without a deal, Adams could hold out throughout training camp; he'd need to show up no earlier than Week 1 to receive payment on the $20.5 million deal.

     Summary: The Packers made quarterback Aaron Rodgers happy, but the same can’t be said for his star receiver Davante Adams.
If not, Adams will have to play on the tag — or worst case scenario, sit out the 2022 season.

Rodgers, meanwhile, is still working with the Packers to reach a new deal.

     Davante Adams informs Packers he won't play on franchise tag in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The All-Pro wideout played out the remainder of his four-year, $58 million extension in 2021, finishing third in the NFL in receiving yards (1,553) and fifth in receiving touchdowns (11).
As any wise franchise should, Green Bay wanted to prevent such a scenario and tagged Adams at around $20 million.
But Adams' refusal to play on the franchise tag makes things more complicated.
Just a week ago, the Packers succeeded in avoiding another lengthy standoff with Rodgers, agreeing to a four-year, $200 million extension that decreases his cap number for the 2022 season.
Rodgers' lower cap hit is notable because it was manufactured, in part, to make it easier to tag Adams or sign him to a new deal.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers were able to avoid Davante Adams hitting the open market by placing the franchise tag on him.
Per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Adams informed the Packers he won't play on the franchise tag this season and is seeking a long-term deal to remain with the team.
Adams would make $20.145 million on the tag this season, which would make him the third-highest paid wide receiver in the league.
Adams is only the sixth player in NFL history to record 120 catches, 1,500 yards, and 10 receiving touchdowns in a season.
He leads the NFL in receptions (581), receiving touchdowns (69), and is second in the league in receiving yards (7,192) over that span.

     Summary: On the morning of the start of the NFL’s legal tampering window, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport has reported that Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams will not play on the franchise tag in 2022 and has notified the team of his decision.
Rapoport noted that “this relationship is not in a great place,” in regards to Adams and the Packers front office.
From @GMFB: #Packers star WR Davante Adams has informed the team he won’t play on the franchise tag, and the sides remain far apart on a long-term deal, per sources.
[DeAndre Hopkins] set the stage, whether or not they want to respect that number or whatever...nah, I’m just playing ball.
I’ll be there for sure.”If we believe what Rapoport and Johnson are stating, something has obviously changed between Adams and the team since July of 2021.

     Philadelphia Eagles: A trade for Davante Adams is incredibly unlikely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s how many more yards the Philadelphia Eagles‘ entire wide receiving corps had than Devante Adams recorded for the Green Bay Packers.
The chances of the Philadelphia Eagles actually landing Davante Adams this spring are infinitesimal.
It’s hard to imagine a world where Davante Adams would accept a trade to the Philadelphia Eagles.
Why would Adams want to play for the Eagles – or most teams in the NFL really – when his best chance to become a Super Bowl champion is in Green Bay?
As tough as it may be to admit, the Philadelphia Eagles are not the top landing spot for premier free agent – or trade candidate – wide receivers.
