     Summary: After surprisingly making three straight bogeys to close out his front nine, the Aussie was back at it, making four birdies in a row on Nos.
10-13 to take a two-shot lead.
A pair of 9-iron shots on his approach at the par-4 10th and the tee shot on the par-3 13th set up two of them.
A 14-foot par save on 14 and another eight-footer save on 15—only his second and third pars of the round—kept the momentum and margin intact.
One more stuffed 9-iron—at the par-13 17th to four feet led to one final birdie, which was sorely needed after he bogeyed the last.

     Cameron Smith wins The Players with big putts and gutsy shot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Cameron Smith made the longest week at The Players Championship worth the wait.
Leading by two on the par-3 17th hole, 135 yards to the hole on an island green, Smith split the difference in the 12 feet that separated the flag from the water.
Smith punched out from the pine straw right of the 18th fairway all the way into the water.
Lahiri, who started the final round with a one-shot lead, birdied the 17th and needed one more to force a playoff.
He was two shots behind and in the same group as Smith when he looked to have a big advantage on the par-5 16th.

     Cameron Smith’s career hits new heights with PLAYERS win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two months later, he won the largest prize in the TOUR’s history, taking $3.6 million from THE PLAYERS’ record $20 million purse.
2 in the FedExCup and sixth in the Official World Golf Ranking, the fruits of a newfound dedication to his fitness and improvements to his iron play.
Smith is surrounded by players whose swings have been optimized for maximum distance and who use analytics to determine the most efficient path to the hole.
TPC Sawgrass isn’t known as a place where players can scrape it around, but Smith won THE PLAYERS despite hitting less than half his fairways (24 of 56) and finishing last in driving accuracy among the 70 players who completed all four weather-delayed rounds.
But then he birdied the first four holes of the back nine to separate himself from the field.

     Summary: A rain-plagued Players ended Monday evening with more rain and a masterful finish by Jacksonville resident and Australian native Cameron Smith.
Rough, rain, a crush of contenders, Smith handled everything the Stadium Course had to offer.
So, it was only fitting that another golfer who calls the area home managed to tame the Stadium Course and its elements.
Smith went bogey-bogey-bogey to close his front, including a woeful three-putt on the par-5 ninth.
Dustin Johnson tied the course record with a final round 9-under 63, including holing out for eagle on the par-5 No.
