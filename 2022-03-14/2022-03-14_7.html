     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – A small tweak has made a significant difference for Anirban Lahiri.
Lahiri added a 3 ½-gram lead weight to a 2014 set of Srixon irons and it has rejuvenated his stagnant game.
Not only has he added about 10 yards in length, but most importantly, he’s seen a tighter dispersion.
With 18 holes to go, Lahiri is a stroke clear of the deepest field in golf.
At 9-under 207, he has a one-shot lead over Sam Burns, Paul Casey, Sebastian Munoz and Doug Ghim.
