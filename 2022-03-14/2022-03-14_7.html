     Report: Jaguars to sign Arizona Cardinals WR Christian Kirk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Jaguars are set to sign free agent receiver Christian Kirk, formerly of the Arizona Cardinals.
ET, and it appears that Kirk was one of the first targets Jacksonville wanted to go after.
They are expected to sign former #AZCardinals WR Christian Kirk to a large deal, per me and @TomPelissero.
Over four seasons, Kirk has accounted for 236 receptions, 2,902 yards, 17 touchdowns, primarily playing in the slot during his most-recent season with the team.
For the Jaguars, Kirk represents a player with plenty of upside, but comes with the caveat of not having produced to the level of a player that makes huge money on the open market.

     Christian Kirk signing with Jaguars: Former Cardinals receiver lands monster four-year deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After reportedly landing offensive guard Brandon Scherff, defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi and linebacker Foye Oluokun, the Jaguars have agreed to terms with former Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk on a four-year deal worth up to $84 million, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, the deal is reportedly worth $72 million ($18M annually) with a max of $84 million.
Kirk was selected by the Cardinals in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Texas A&amp;M.
Even with the Cardinals possessing several talented weapons, Kirk found ways to stand out when given the opportunity.
Another interesting facet of this reported addition has to do with a different receiver tied to the Jaguars.

     Summary: The Jaguars are set to sign former Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk (Twitter link via NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero).
[RELATED: Jaguars To Sign Fatukasi]The Jaguars are giving Kirk a four-year, $72MM deal, one that Ian Rapoport of NFL.com indicates (via Twitter) can max out at $84MM.
A lot will be on the former second-round pick’s shoulders, as the Jaguars will expect him to be Trevor Lawrence‘s No.
The cash-strapped Cardinals didn’t have the space to keep him, but the Jaguars were happy to put him on their books.
Without Kirk, the Cardinals will have to find more pass-catchers to support DeAndre Hopkins and Rondale Moore.
