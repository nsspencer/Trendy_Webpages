     Nationals, designated hitter Nelson Cruz agree to 1-year, $15M deal

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1/5Veteran designated hitter Nelson Cruz, who was traded last season to the Tampa Bay Rays, will add some pop to the Washington Nationals lineup in 2022.
File Photo by Steven J. Nesius/UPI | License PhotoMarch 14 (UPI) -- The Washington Nationals and veteran designated hitter Nelson Cruz agreed to a one-year contact for the 2022 season.
The seven-time All-Star spent the first 85 games of last season with the Twins, and was traded to the Rays in July.
Cruz has a career .277 batting average, with 449 home runs, in 17 seasons.
He also is the first full-time designated hitter to sign with a National League team since MLB included a universal designated hitter stipulation as part of its recent labor deal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nelson Cruzâs deal with the Nationals will pay him $12M in 2022, with a $16M mutual option for 2023 ($3M buyout).
Since his first All-Star season in 2009, no one has hit more home runs than Cruz’s 427.
He’s remained a dangerous hitter even into his 40s, coming off a season in which he hit 32 homers for the Twins and Rays.
Nationals President and GM Mike Rizzo held a press conference Sunday in his first meeting with media since the MLB lockout began in early December.
Cruz was only the latest player to sign with the Nationals over the weekend, reportedly joining reliever Steve Cishek (one year, $1.75M) and utility infielder Ehire Adrianza (one year, $1.5M) on major-league deals.

     DH slugger Nelson Cruz, Nationals reach 1-yr deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free agent designated hitter Nelson Cruz and the Washington Nationals have agreed to a one-year, $15 million deal, a person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press on Sunday night.
The 41-year-old Cruz has 449 career home runs and becomes the first full-time DH to join a National League team since MLB's new labor deal included a universal designated hitter.
The slugger hit .265 with 32 home runs and 86 RBIs with the Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Rays in 2021.
Cruz gets a $12 million salary this year, and the deal includes a $16 million mutual option for 2023 with a $3 million buyout.
Prior to that, his previous time with a mitt was 2018 when he made four starts in right field for Seattle.

     Nelson Cruz signs with Washington, Nats' first full-time DH
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nelson Cruz going to the Washington Nationals on a one-year, $15 million contract is a bit of a surprising twist after rumors throughout Sunday that his likely destination was the Los Angeles Dodgers or the San Diego Padres, so the signing leads to two questions:1.
Does the signing mean they have more moves to come to improve a team that went 65-97 last year -- and now no longer has Max Scherzer?
Still, that second-half decline is certainly worrisome, especially for a player his age, and perhaps the initial sign that Father Time is finally catching up to Cruz.
Second, if Cruz is hitting and the Nationals are out of the playoff race, he is valuable trade bait.
The Twins picked up a very good starting pitching prospect in Joe Ryan when they traded Cruz to the Rays, and the Nationals would look to do the same.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports: Nats sign DH Cruz amid flurry of post-lockout moves originally appeared on NBC Sports WashingtonAhead of their first season with a permanent universal DH, the Nationals made a big swing in free agency to address the position by signing veteran slugger Nelson Cruz to a one-year, $15 million deal Sunday with a mutual option for 2023, according to multiple reports.
Nelson Cruzâs deal with the Nationals will pay him $12M in 2022, with a $16M mutual option for 2023 ($3M buyout).
Nationals President and GM Mike Rizzo held a press conference Sunday in his first meeting with media since the MLB lockout began in early December.
The market evidently landed them Cruz, who immediately becomes the Nationals’ best form of lineup protection for young phenom Juan Soto.
Cruz was only the latest player to sign with the Nationals over the weekend, reportedly joining reliever Steve Cishek (one year, $1.75M) and utility infielder Ehire Adrianza (one year, $1.5M) on major-league deals.

     Nationals, DH Nelson Cruz agree to $13M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Designated hitter Nelson Cruz jumped to the National League and the Washington Nationals on Sunday, agreeing to a one-year deal with an option for 2023, according to multiple reports.
At least three other NL teams, preparing to adapt to the new DH rules, were in the bidding for Cruz, according to reports.
Cruz led the American League in home runs with 40 in 2014 while playing for the Baltimore Orioles.
In 2013, as a member of the Texas Rangers, Cruz was among 12 players suspended by Major League Baseball for violating the league’s steroid policy.
Cruz has played for the Milwaukee Brewers (2005), Texas (2006-13), Baltimore (2014), the Seattle Mariners (2015-18), Minnesota (2019-21) and Tampa Bay last season.
