     Nelson Cruz Takes Advantage Of New MLB Rule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New OpportunitiesThe addition of the universal DH is a major step forward for baseball.
Now, players who are aging in the National League have an option to extend their careers and have a chance to do that with all 30 MLB teams.
Not only is the universal DH a huge plus for baseball, but it’s a big advantage for any NL team.
An extra power bat in the lineup can give these teams a huge boost offensively.
This is likely just the start of the flurry of moves we’ve all been expecting since the lockout ended.

     Summary: Nelson Cruzâs deal with the Nationals will pay him $12M in 2022, with a $16M mutual option for 2023 ($3M buyout).
Since his first All-Star season in 2009, no one has hit more home runs than Cruz’s 427.
He’s remained a dangerous hitter even into his 40s, coming off a season in which he hit 32 homers for the Twins and Rays.
Nationals President and GM Mike Rizzo held a press conference Sunday in his first meeting with media since the MLB lockout began in early December.
Cruz was only the latest player to sign with the Nationals over the weekend, reportedly joining reliever Steve Cishek (one year, $1.75M) and utility infielder Ehire Adrianza (one year, $1.5M) on major-league deals.

     Summary: Reports: Nats sign DH Cruz amid flurry of post-lockout moves originally appeared on NBC Sports WashingtonAhead of their first season with a permanent universal DH, the Nationals made a big swing in free agency to address the position by signing veteran slugger Nelson Cruz to a one-year, $15 million deal Sunday with a mutual option for 2023, according to multiple reports.
Nelson Cruzâs deal with the Nationals will pay him $12M in 2022, with a $16M mutual option for 2023 ($3M buyout).
