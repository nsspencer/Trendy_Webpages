     Lakers List LeBron James as Questionable vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the second night of a back-to-back, the Los Angeles Lakers may give LeBron James the night off.
The 37-year-old superstar is listed as questionable for Monday night's game against the Toronto Raptors with right knee soreness, the team announced.
Los Angeles is 6-12 this season without James in the lineup and his absence would certainly make things a lot easier for the Raptors who are looking to make it three straight victories on Monday night.
Toronto, however, could be without Fred VanVleet who is also questionable with right knee soreness.
He sat out Saturday's game against the Denver Nuggets and it's unclear if he'll play in Los Angeles.

     Lakers: LeBron James Seems to Downplay Anthony Davis' Importance in Possible Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They beat the Wizards on Friday night, thanks to LeBron James putting up 50 points.
The Lakers will be getting back Anthony Davis at some point though, which should help them.
But speaking after the loss on Sunday night, LeBron reminded everyone that getting AD back doesn't fix the major issues with the team.
Getting Davis back into the lineup certainly helps, there is no doubt about that.
So while getting AD back will be big for the Lakers, don't expect a drastic change.

     Anthony Davis says Lakers would've beaten Suns in 2021 playoffs if he was healthy: 'They got away with one'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What they could be, with a healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis, well, that's hard to say, but it's surely something a lot better than they are.
7, they'd have to get into the 7-8 play-in game, which will be difficult as they trail the No.
For Davis' part, he still remembers the Suns eliminating the Lakers in six games in the first round of the 2021 playoffs, and he thinks there is some unfinished business there.
But Davis says the Lakers -- and the Suns -- "know" things would've been different had Davis not gotten hurt.
In Games 2 and 3, both Lakers wins, LeBron and AD were a combined plus-46 in their minutes.

We’ll give you the latest point spread, money line odds and over-under number, as well as the information you’ll need to make the smartest bet at Tipico Sportsbook.
Toronto was a .500 team for the first half of the campaign, but it has been playing better since late January.
The Lakers continue to play without superstar big man Anthony Davis, who has a sprained foot but may be nearing a return.
Meanwhile, they may decide to rest James for this contest depending on the condition of his left knee the day after their loss to Phoenix.

     Summary: While the Los Angeles Lakers were blown out by the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night, that didn’t stop LeBron James from setting yet another NBA record.
In perhaps his most impressive feat yet, James became the first player in NBA history to record 10,000 career points, rebounds, and assists.
Following the loss to the Suns, James spoke about what a record like this means to him.
I get a loss for words anytime things like this happen to me just knowing where I come from,” James said.
James discusses Lakers’ mentality issuesThe Lakers were very rarely within striking distance during a 29-point loss to the Suns, and it spoke to a larger point about the Lakers’ game-to-game mentality this season, as James discussed.

     Three Things to Know: Lakers vs Raptors - 3/14/22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (29-38) are set to face the Toronto Raptors (37-30) at 7:30 p.m. Pacific on Spectrum SportsNet.
The Lakers are coming off a Sunday night loss at Phoenix, while the Raptors won consecutive road games at Phoenix and Denver over the weekend.
LeBron said it’s typically the day after games that his knee gets sore, so he won’t know about his availability vs. Toronto until tomorrow.
The Lakers are just 6-12 this season without LeBron, and Anthony Davis played in several of the wins.
VanVleet is questionable to play against the Lakers, having missed seven of their last 11 games with knee soreness, while Anunoby is definitely out with a fractured finger.

     Summary: Draft Talk: Keegan Murray Is NBA ReadyWe’re launching The Ringer’s 2022 NBA Draft Guide this week with 30 of my scouting reports.
This is my 10th year covering the draft, my ninth year publishing a guide, and my sixth with The Ringer.
My first time attending an NBA game was Celtics-Timberwolves on March 22, 2000.
Since All-Star Weekend, the Lakers are 2-0 when LeBron scores at least 50 points … and they’re 0-7 when he doesn’t.
Over his past 15 games, he’s averaging 11.1 points on 54.7 percent true shooting with 2.1 assists and only 1.2 turnovers.
