     Gender and Caste at Holi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Starting at sundown on March 17 this year, people across India, and elsewhere in the world, will celebrate Holi.
But, at least in some places, it’s also associated with drunkenness, harassment of women, and stark divisions by class and caste.
As two accounts of Holi celebrations in northern Indian villages suggest, celebrations can vary greatly from one place to another.
Unlike in most parts of the country, the public celebrations of Holi in Chilkiya are dominated by women.
Bhandari writes that the women of Chilkiya don’t see their Holi celebrations as a defiance of patriarchal norms, but simply as the normal way to mark the holiday.

     Summary: Read AlsoRead AlsoThe festival of colours, Holi, is just a week away and the preparation is in full swing everywhere.
Until the mass production of synthetic colours, people used to play Holi with natural colours made from marigold, turmeric, hibiscus, aparajita and other flowers and herbs.
One should never forget applying sun block or sunscreen before stepping out of the house on Holi.
Make sure your skin has enough oil; this way the colours won’t stick long on your skin.
You can also apply cold-pressed coconut or olive oil on your face and body before playing Holi.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You can also use red sandalwood paste as a Holi colour - it is not only a great natural substitute but also has several skin benefits.
Trade your pitchkaris and water balloons for gulal and natural dry colours or flowers, and it will still feel as much fun as long as you celebrate with loved ones.
We promise!If you must enjoy bonfires during Holi evenings we recommend you do it in an environmentally friendly way.
Don’t throw colours on street animals because that not only wastes colours but also harms and scares the strays.
Share sweets and conversations instead.We hope you have a beautiful and eco-friendly Holi this year.
