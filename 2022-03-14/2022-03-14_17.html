     Cleveland Browns release 5-time Pro Bowl WR Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BEREA, Ohio -- The Cleveland Browns have released wide receiver Jarvis Landry, the team announced Monday.
The Browns had granted Landry permission to try to seek a trade after Cleveland dealt for Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper on Saturday.
"The trade for Jarvis Landry in 2018 was a key moment for our organization," said Browns GM Andrew Berry in a prepared statement.
Landry was set to make $16 million next season but had no guaranteed money left on his deal.
Landry is a five-time Pro Bowler but struggled last season with a knee sprain that he suffered in Week 2, an injury that kept him out five weeks.

     Browns release Jarvis Landry; Bills, Chiefs among reported teams interested in receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Browns made a big splash at wide receiver this offseason, recently agreeing to acquire former Pro Bowler Amari Cooper from the Cowboys.
Now they've cut down the position, on Monday releasing veteran starter Jarvis Landry, CBS Sports NFL insider Josina Anderson confirmed.
Landry was due more than $16M total in 2022, the final season of a five-year, $75.5M deal he signed with the Browns back in 2018.
The Bills and Chiefs are both early suitors for the five-time Pro Bowler, per NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.
Originally a second-round pick of the Dolphins in 2014, Landry spent the first four seasons of his career in Miami, twice eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards as an immediate starter.

     Browns release former Pro Bowl WR Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Landry arrived in Cleveland via trade in 2018 and quickly became the face of former general manager John Dorsey's attempt at a rapid rebuild of the moribund Browns.
Along with Myles Garrett and rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield, Landry became the face of the Browns' bright future.
With the Browns, Landry became a man who was crucial to the locker room, a glue guy who lost his closest teammate when Odell Beckham Jr. forced his way out of Cleveland in 2021.
Landry, meanwhile, played through another significant injury -- this time, a knee and quadriceps issue that cost him five games -- to record a career-low 52 receptions for 570 yards and two touchdowns.
Landry expressed a desire to remain in Cleveland but also acknowledged the reality of the business, publicly placing the ball in the Browns' court via Twitter.

     Cleveland Browns releasing wide receiver Jarvis Landry in cost-saving move
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jarvis Landry provided an undeniable and invaluable spark to assist the Browns in reversing their fortunes four years ago.
The Browns will release Landry in a predictable cost-saving move, a person familiar with the move confirmed Monday afternoon.
Cutting him will cost the Browns just $1.5 million in dead cap and save them $14.879 million in cap space.
Landry requested his release after he couldn't reach an agreement on a restructured contract with the Browns and a trade didn't materialize, a league source said.
The Browns signed him to a five-year, $75.5 million contract extension in April 2018.

     Browns release WR Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Browns went 7-8-1 in Landry's first season, a remarkable turnaround after the team won just once in its previous 32 games before his arrival.
The Browns won 32 games in their four years with Landry on the roster, the most they had won in a four-year period since 1986-89, and Landry was one of the biggest producers in nearly all of the biggest wins in that stretch.
The Browns won, 48-37, in their first playoff win since 1994.
The culture change Landry worked endlessly to bring to the Browns had taken shape, too.
When the Browns needed a rallying voice, Landry was there to speak up.
