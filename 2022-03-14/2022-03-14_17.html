     RUMOR: Chiefs headline 3 teams heavily in play to sign Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wide receiver Allen Robinson is coming off a rather sub-par campaign with the Chicago Bears, but his impressive resume is attracting the interest of numerous teams.
With his days in the Windy City likely done, the Chiefs, Lions, and Browns are all keen on him.
@TomPelissero says the Lions, Browns and Chiefs are among the teams in on Allen Robinson.
— Chris Burke (@ChrisBurkeNFL) March 14, 2022All of these teams could be nice landing spots for Robinson.
As for the Browns, who just brought in Amari Cooper but are probably parting ways with Jarvis Landy, Allen Robinson potentially replaces the aforementioned.

     Allen Robinson’s time with the Chicago Bears is over. Where will the wide receiver land after a strange 2021 season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On an offense that was seeking a spark, one of the team’s most proven playmakers was an afterthought.
Robinson wasn’t given many opportunities to stretch the field.
With two quarterbacks who were new to the Bears in 2021, he didn’t have established trust as a go-to weapon and didn’t see nearly the number of opportunities he once had to make contested catches.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the years, the Bears have NOT been racking up compensatory draft picks.
And in turn, you have to dive into free agency in order to make up for your draft whiffs.
Former Bears WR Allen Robinson figures to be Mr. Popular in free agency circles this week.
Players such as Akiem Hicks, James Daniels, and Jakeem Grant Sr. could all land big deals as free agents and improve the Bears position.
In any case, this is something to keep an eye on as free agency gets cracking tomorrow morning.
