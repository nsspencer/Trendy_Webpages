     Bengals Free Agency: Alex Cappa shores up right guard position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals wasted no time when the legal tampering aspect of free agency began, agreeing to terms on a deal with offensive guard Alex Cappa.
Bengals free agency kicked off at 12:00 EST and by 12:02, the team had already struck a deal with Cappa to bring him to Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
The right guard position was such a revolving door in 2021, as we saw three different guys start there and none of them were exactly stellar.
Cappa is a durable guard who should be able to give the Bengals stability at the right guard spot for the next four years.

     NFL free agency 2022: Bengals signing Alex Cappa to four-year, $40 million deal, as Tom Brady loses O-lineman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati bengals wasted little time improving their offensive line in free agency, agreeing to a four-year, $40 million deal with guard Alex Cappa (per ESPN's Adam Schefter).
Committing just one penalty and allowing five sacks and 32 pressures in 2021, Cappa was part of an offensive line that allowed just 23 sacks -- the fewest in the NFL.
The Bengals offensive line allowed 19 sacks in the postseason, as Joe Burrow was sacked the most by a quarterback in NFL playoff history.
Cincinnati is expected to improve the offensive line in the coming days, which the signing of Cappa is a nice start.
As for the Buccaneers, Tom Brady will be losing both his starting guards from last season as Cappa departs in free agency and Ali Marpet retired.

     Guard Alex Cappa plans to sign four-year deal with Cincinnati Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tampa Bay Buccaneers free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after free agency opens on Wednesday, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Bengals have also agreed to a three-year, $18 million deal with New England Patriots center/guard Ted Karras, sources told ESPN.
Hill to a three-year, $30 million deal including $15 million in the first year, a source said.
The additions of Cappa and Karras will bolster the Bengals' offensive line as the team tries to improve the protection for quarterback Joe Burrow.
A third-round draft pick out of Humboldt State in 2018, Cappa transitioned from offensive tackle to guard with the Buccaneers and earned a starting role in his second season in 2019.

     Summary: Cappa agreed to terms on a four-year, $40 million contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, NFL Network's James Palmer reported.

The Bengals will also sign former New England Patriots offensive lineman Ted Karras to a three-year, $18 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source.
On the opposite side of the line, the Bengals retained defensive tackle B.J.

     Summary: The Bengals made an improbable run the Super Bowl in 2021, leaving the franchise with high hopes heading into 2022.
Here's a breakdown of every 2022 NFL free-agent signing by the Cincinnati Bengals, and how each will impact the upcoming season:Alex Cappa, OGThe Bengals and Cappa have agreed to terms on a four-year, $40 million deal, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Karras started at left guard and right guard for the Patriots in 2021 but has experience at center as well.
What it means: Hill surpassed all expectations when the Bengals traded for him at the end of the 2021 preseason.
Of Cincinnati's first three commitments on Monday (Hill, Karras, Cappa), Hill represents the most risk.

     Instant analysis after Bengals agree to sign Alex Cappa in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals were one of the first teams out the door with a notable agreement to sign a free agent during Monday’s legal tampering window with guard Alex Cappa.
But he is a starting right guard who comes in and is drastically better than anything else the team started at the position last year.
Cappa is a third-round product from the 2018 draft who has started every game for the Buccaneers over the last two seasons.
This also frees up the draft and the rest of free agency a bit as they look to upgrade center, if not left guard and right tackle.
Notable media:#Bengals fans, Alex Cappa is a solid starting RG who has improved every year in NFL.

     Bengals To Sign Alex Cappa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bengals have agreed to sign Alex Cappa (Twitter link via Adam Schefter of ESPN.com).
Some had speculated that Tom Brady‘s un-retirement would help sway Cappa to stay.
Between Cappa and Marpet — who still intends to retire at the age of 28 — the Bucs have some serious holes to fill in free agency.
Cappa rebounded to play all 19 Bucs games last season.
For his career, Cappa has suited up for 52 games (46 starts) across the last four years.
