     Summary: Pep Guardiola Happy With Man City Performance At Crystal Palace...
But Not The GrassThis was the scene at Selhurst Park a few hours before Crystal Palace played Manchester City on Monday.
At least that was the opinion of City manager Pep Guardiola.
A general view of Selhurst Park before Crystal Palace vs Manchester City IMAGO/Action Plus/Katie ChanGuardiola criticized the standard of the playing surface during his post-match press conference after City were held to a 0-0 draw.
City were the dominant side at Selhurst Park, where they had 74% of possession and 18 shots.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Crystal Palace had gone to the Etihad Stadium and won earlier in the season, and a double over Manchester City seemed unlikely.
But Liverpool were not after a Crystal Palace win necessarily — from Jürgen Klopp's perspective, any dropped points would do.
The goalless draw means that Manchester City are still in the lead in the Premier League standings.
They will still need to win all of their games including the trip to Manchester City to guarantee a title win.
Even just the fact that Manchester City have been dealt a dent in their chase could be vital, with Crystal Palace proving again that points can indeed be taken from them.

     Manchester City give Liverpool further hope after puzzling draw with Crystal Palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola had one person in mind when striding onto the Selhurst Park turf at full-time of a goalless draw with Crystal Palace.
He walked past his Manchester City players, who had failed to find the net despite dominating the preceding 90 minutes to leave south London with a 0-0 draw that firmly opens the door for Liverpool in the Premier League title race.
As it was, Guardiola didn't make a single substitution in a game City had to win to maintain a degree of breathing space over Liverpool, the holder's lead standing at four points now.
Kevin De Bruyne and Manchester City were held to a frustrating draw against Crystal Palace.
In tirelessly chasing down City as they probed relentlessly for the opener, the 22-year-old covered 12.5 km -- the highest distance of any Palace player in a Premier League game this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is game on and, should City blow it, they may look back on this as the occasion things turned.
They had a rare off night against an intelligent, punchy Crystal Palace and only created chances consistently during a purple patch in the first half.
An outstretched hand flipped the ball over at close quarters but City, having rocked earlier, were beginning to gain ground.
Palace were listing but regained some stability before the interval, seeing Zaha shoot wide and Joachim Andersen send a teasing delivery beyond lurking teammates.
It was borne out after a second half in which City, for their near-constant possession, only found one gilt-edged chance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: City were forced to settle for a share of the Premier League spoils as we were held to a goalless draw on a frustrating night at Selhurst Park.
Under the stewardship of former City midfielder Patrick Vieira, the Eagles have emerged as a real force to be reckoned with in the Premier League this season.
However, City did everything but find the target in a dominant first period with the only thing missing being our cutting edge.
TeamsCRYSTAL PALACE: Guaita, Mitchell, Clyne, Andersen, Guehi, Olise (Ayew 64), Schlupp, Kouyate, Gallagher, Zaha, Mateta (Edouard 64).
What it meansThe point extends our lead at the top of the Premier League table on Liverpool to four points.
