     Kourtney Kardashian, 42, reveals she and fiancé Travis Barker 'want to have a baby'
    </h2>

     Summary: AdvertisementKourtney Kardashian and her neighbor-turned-fiancé - Grammy-winning drummer Travis Barker - visited a fertility doctor's office in the official trailer for her Hulu reality spin-off The Kardashians, which dropped Monday.
The Poosh founder - turning 43 next month - officially announced: 'Travis and I want to have a baby.'
I don't think I see myself filming on a show in five years,' Kardashian told Variety last Friday.
I still want to work and raise my kids, and I don't know, maybe there is a filming element to that, but I don't know, I guess probably not.'
And unlike her four younger sisters, Kourtney earned an actual college degree in costume design from the University of Arizona.
