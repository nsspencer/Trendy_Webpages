     Benzema scores two for Real Madrid but goes off with injury in win over Mallorca
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karim Benzema grabbed two goals and an assist but also hurt his ankle, with teammate Rodrygo also injured as Real Madrid bear Mallorca 3-0 on Monday.
Real Madrid also lost Rodrygo to an injury after a studs-up challenge from defender Antonio Raíllo, who was booked after catching the Brazilian winger’s right foot.
Rodrygo was carried off the pitch by Real Madrid’s doctors, unable to put his foot on the floor.

     Karim Benzema Equals Two Career PBs As Evergreen Real Madrid Ace Dominates Mallorca
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five days on from his Champions League hat-trick against Paris Saint-Germain, Benzema scored two goals and assisted another as Mallorca were beaten 3-0 in Palma.
By setting up Vinicius Junior for the game's opener on 55 minutes, Benzema took his tally of La Liga assists to 11 in 25 games this season.
That saw Benzema match his personal best, set back in 2012/13 when he got 11 assists in 30 La Liga games.
That was his 23rd La Liga goal of the season and his 32nd for Real in all competitions.
Not since 2011/12 had Benzema scored 32 goals in one season.

     Real Madrid sweat on Karim Benzema, Rodrygo, Ferland Mendy fitness ahead of El Clasico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Real Madrid were left waiting for news on the fitness of Karim Benzema, Rodrygo and Ferland Mendy after all three players went off hurt in their 3-0 win at Mallorca on Monday -- just six days ahead of El Clasico.
Rodrygo had to be helped from the field by medical staff in the 71st minute after a challenge by Mallorca defender Antonio Raillo.
Nine minutes later, Mendy was taken off with an apparent muscular injury, before Benzema was withdrawn with a calf problem.
Rodrygo is stretchered off during Real Madrid's win over Mallorca on Monday.
Real Madrid and Barcelona both go into this weekend's Clasico in impressive form, with Madrid unbeaten in LaLiga since Jan. 2, and Barca -- who beat Osasuna 4-0 on Sunday -- having won their last four league games.

     Summary: Karim Benzema continued his red-hot form with two goals as Real Madrid warmed up for this weekend's Clasico with a 3-0 win at Mallorca on Monday to extend their lead atop LaLiga to 10 points.
For a time, the game was a real battle for Madrid, too, against a Mallorca team that kept their opponents in check and even had the better of the first-half chances.
As the half neared its conclusion, Madrid managed to rediscover their momentum, leaving Mallorca grateful to hear the half-time whistle.
Karim Benzema celebrates scoring his second goal in Real Madrid's win at Mallorca on Monday.

     Summary: Mallorca stepped up their aggressiveness in search of the equalizer, but that only opened things up for Real Madrid and Benzema.
Then he completed his brace when he headed home an accurate pass into the area by Marcelo.
Real Madrid suffered a pair of injuries during the match, with Rodrygo needing help exiting the field after a hard challenge by Jose Raillo and Benzema leaving early with calf injury.
We need to win on Sunday and take advantage of the team being in very good shape physically,” he said.
