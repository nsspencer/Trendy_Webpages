     Report: Jaguars Agree With WR Christian Kirk to a Massive Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 receiver in place, agreeing to terms on Monday with former Arizona Cardinals second-round pick Christian Kirk.
1 pick Trevor Lawrence was hampered week in and week out by miscues from the wideout room.
Operating downfield and in the middle of the field in Arizona's offense, Kirk recorded 77 catches for 982 yards, both career highs, and five touchdowns.
“Well we have to protect him better and we have to get more explosive players around him – guys that can make explosive plays.
That is the mission this offseason in free agency and the draft – to get more explosive players on both sides of the ball, guys that can change games.

     Report: Jaguars to sign Arizona Cardinals WR Christian Kirk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Jaguars are set to sign free agent receiver Christian Kirk, formerly of the Arizona Cardinals.
ET, and it appears that Kirk was one of the first targets Jacksonville wanted to go after.
They are expected to sign former #AZCardinals WR Christian Kirk to a large deal, per me and @TomPelissero.
Over four seasons, Kirk has accounted for 236 receptions, 2,902 yards, 17 touchdowns, primarily playing in the slot during his most-recent season with the team.
For the Jaguars, Kirk represents a player with plenty of upside, but comes with the caveat of not having produced to the level of a player that makes huge money on the open market.

     Christian Kirk signing with Jaguars: Former Cardinals receiver lands monster four-year deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After reportedly landing offensive guard Brandon Scherff, defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi and linebacker Foye Oluokun, the Jaguars have agreed to terms with former Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk on a four-year deal worth up to $84 million, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, the deal is reportedly worth $72 million ($18M annually) with a max of $84 million.
Kirk was selected by the Cardinals in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Texas A&amp;M.
Even with the Cardinals possessing several talented weapons, Kirk found ways to stand out when given the opportunity.
Another interesting facet of this reported addition has to do with a different receiver tied to the Jaguars.

    </h2>

     Summary: Jaguars are giving former Cardinals WR Christian Kirk a four-year deal worth up to $84 million deal, per source.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 14, 2022Former Eagles head coach Doug Pederson got off to a roaring start in 2022 NFL free agency after he landed a linebacker, one of the NFL’s top right guards and a talented slot wide receiver.
The news of the day centers around just how much Pederson paid that receiver, as Jacksonville agreed to a four-year, $72 million deal with former Cardinals wide receiver Christian Kirk.
The contract could reach upwards of $84 million and the $18 million per season average puts Kirk above names like Cooper Kupp, Tyreek Hill and others.
Kirk, 25, logged 77 receptions for 984 yards, both of which were career-highs, as well as five touchdowns in 17 games for the Cardinals in 2021.
