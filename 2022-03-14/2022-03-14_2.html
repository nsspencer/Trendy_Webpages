     Report: Blue Jays Have ‘Remained Aggressive’ in Pursuit of Freddie Freeman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman’s days with the Braves are likely over, according to reports, which opens the door for a mystery team—like the Blue Jays—to make one last push to sign the first baseman.
The Yankees and Dodgers are considered the favorites to sign Freeman, per MLB.com’s Mark Bowman, but the Rays and Blue Jays “have remained aggressive” in pursuit of the 2020 NL MVP.
Toronto has been linked to Freeman—whose parents were both born in Ontario—since before the lockout began in December, though it’s been clear from the start the Blue Jays aren’t considered front-runners.
The 32-year-old slashed .300/.393/.503 with 31 homers last season and would instantly give Toronto one of the scariest lineups in the American League, joining sluggers Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Teoscar Hernandez, and George Springer in the meat of the order.
The Jays are still in need of a quality infielder and could use additional bullpen help.

     Summary: Freddie Freeman's time with the Atlanta Braves may be over.
The Braves have completed a trade with the Oakland Athletics that sends star first baseman Matt Olson to Atlanta for four prospects, including outfielder Cristian Pache and catcher Shea Langeliers.
The Olson trade creates a path for Freeman to sign with his hometown team.

     Summary: Greg Nelson/Sports IllustatedMaybe there is a grand plan to keep Olson and Freeman, but no such signs have been evident from the Braves.
Atlanta whiffed on the chance to lock up Freeman during the season and after the 2021 World Series title.
Game 3: In the third inning of a scoreless game, Freeman takes a down-and-in fastball from Luis Garcia and shoots it to left-center for a single.
Raley throws Freeman six cutters and sliders, the last of which was an outside edge cutter Freeman pokes foul.
Game 6: The Braves lead 5–0 in the fifth when Freeman faces another lefty, Blake Taylor, with a runner on first.

AdvertisementSuddenly, the Dodgers’ chances of signing Freeman, the former MVP first baseman who is one of the biggest remaining free agents on the market, seemed to skyrocket.
And for the next half hour, all eyes were on the Dodgers executives who have been leading the team’s pursuit of the 32-year-old slugger.
The day’s big event was a live batting practice by Kershaw, who was facing hitters for the first time all offseason.

Tough trade to make.”The Braves have other needs.
The Olson trade, the GM said, was the first move that made sense to the organization, as difficult as it was to make.
In 12 seasons with the Braves, Freeman, selected in the second round of the 2007 draft, totaled 1,704 hits, 271 home runs and 941 RBIs.
To be clear: Olson, a slugger, is the best first baseman the Braves could have acquired to replace Freeman.
