     Matt Olson from Oakland Athletics Trade Spells End of Freddie Freeman's Time with Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Jeff Passan of ESPN, the Oakland Athletics and Atlanta Braves came to an agreement for star first baseman Matt Olson.
It seems like the Freddie Freeman era in Atlanta may be over.
Freddie Freeman has been the cornerstone of the Braves for 12 seasons since his debut in 2012.
Now he's a free agent, and Atlanta is finalizing a deal for a player who looks to be his replacement.
With the implementation of the designated hitter in the National League in 2022, it's possible the Braves could employ both players.

     MLB rumors: Braves trade for Matt Olson; Yankees hopes for Freddie Freeman climb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Yankees GM Brian Cashman’s first news conference of the spring was just ending Monday when news broke of another huge trade.
The Atlanta Braves scraped plans to keep face-of-the-franchise free agent first baseman Freddie Freeman by trading for Matt Olson.
Cashman, who made a blockbuster the night before, didn’t know of the Olson deal until NJ Advance Media alerted him after he exited a news conference room.
The GM probably was filled with emotion because Olson and Freeman reportedly have been the Yankees’ biggest targets in their hope of upgrading at first base before Opening Day.
With Olson headed to Atlanta, maybe the Yankees have a better shot at signing Freeman, or maybe the 2020 NL MVP quickly decides to go home and play for the Dodgers.

     Summary: ATLANTA — The Atlanta Braves have acquired Oakland A's first baseman Matt Olson in a trade on Monday.
It means Freddie Freeman's time in Atlanta has likely come to an end.
Olson, who grew up in Gwinnett County and went to Parkview High School, made his MLB debut in 2016.
Oakland will receive OF Cristian Pache, C Shea Langeliers, SP Ryan Cusick and SP Joey Estes, sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan.
Freeman had been on an 8-year, $135 million deal with the Braves that paid him $22 million in base salary last year.

     Yankees Pessimistic On Chances Of Signing Freddie Freeman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees are pessimistic on free agent first baseman Freddie Freeman, according to Jon Heyman of MLB Network.
The Yankees have also thus far said no to an ask of top prospect Anthony Volpe plus more for Oakland first baseman Matt Olson, Heyman explains.
As such, a reunion with free agent Anthony Rizzo is suggested to be “the most realistic” first base addition for the Yankees.
Three days ago, Heyman wrote that the Dodgers and Braves are the most likely landing spots for Freeman, who reportedly has sought a six-year deal.
Other clubs known to be in the mix for Olson include the Guardians, Rangers, Padres, and naturally the Braves if they lose Freeman.

The Braves have completed a trade with the Oakland Athletics that sends star first baseman Matt Olson to Atlanta for four prospects, including outfielder Cristian Pache and catcher Shea Langeliers.

Tough trade to make.”The Braves have other needs.
The Olson trade, the GM said, was the first move that made sense to the organization, as difficult as it was to make.
In 12 seasons with the Braves, Freeman, selected in the second round of the 2007 draft, totaled 1,704 hits, 271 home runs and 941 RBIs.
To be clear: Olson, a slugger, is the best first baseman the Braves could have acquired to replace Freeman.
