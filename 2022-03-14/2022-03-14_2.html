     Welcome to the NFL’s legal tampering period
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the beginning of the offseason, NFL rules strictly prohibit teams from contacting players under contract with other franchises; teams can’t even communicate with agents for such players.
That is, except during one of the most absurd parts of the NFL season: the “legal tampering period,” which begins at 11 a.m. Arrowhead Time on Monday and runs until the beginning of the 2022 league year at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
We’re not supposed to notice that many of these contracts will be announced very soon after the legal tampering period begins — clearly suggesting there was some communication between those teams and agents before the league-approved period began.
As the saying goes, that’s the first rule of the legal tampering period: we don’t talk about the other tampering period.
But most of the so-called “first wave” of free agency — in which the biggest NFL free agents will make the splashiest moves to new teams — will take place in the next couple of days.
