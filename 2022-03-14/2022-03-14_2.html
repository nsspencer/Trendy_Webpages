    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Director Jane Campion has responded to Sam Elliott’s criticism of her film The Power Of The Dog, labelling him “sexist”.
AdvertisementDuring Elliott’s interview on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, the host noted that homosexuality is “what the movie’s about”, the actor going on to call Campion “a brilliant director”.
However, Elliott then added: “What the fuck does this woman from down there [New Zealand] know about the American west?
That fucking rubbed me the wrong way.”Responding to Elliott’s criticism, Campion told Variety: “I’m sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. He’s not a cowboy; he’s an actor.
The Power Of The Dog was one of the big winners at last night’s (March 13) BAFTAs, winning two awards including Best Film and Best Director for Campion.

     Jane Campion Dogs Sam Elliott in The War of The Cowboy Words
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ”I think he was being a little bit of a b-i-t-c-h. Plus he’s not a cowboy, he’s an actor,” says Campion during DGA red carpetActor Sam Elliott made it quite clear that he is not a fan of this year’s multi-award winning and top Oscar nominated cowboy film, The Power of the Dog.
Speaking to Deadline Hollywood on Saturday, Campion pretty much eviscerated Elliott: “I think it’s really unfortunate and sad for him because he’s really hit the trifecta of misogyny and xenophobia and homophobia… I don’t like that.
Since Elliot’s trashing of the movie, many of its stars—Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee—have commented cryptically on the actor’s quite negative pronouncement.
But it’s the film’s director, Campion, who’s certainly gotten the last laugh.
On Sunday March 13, Campion’s winning streak continued as she picked up BAFTA awards for Best Director and Best Picture at the ceremony in London.

“Venus Williams is me after Jane Campion’s unnecessary comment during her #CriticsChoiceAwards speech,” journalist Nola Marianna commented, sharing a photo of the tennis pro appearing to grimace during Campion’s speech.

Keep scrolling for the essential facts you need to know about the Power of the Dog director.
With her nomination this year for The Power of the Dog, Campion achieved an Academy Awards first as the first woman to be nominated for Best Director twice (she was also nominated for her 1993 film The Piano).
The Best Director category at the Oscars is still overwhelming dominated by men (according to Indie Wire, only seven other women have ever been nominated in the category at all).
In addition to her impressive track record directing films, Campion has also basically mastered the art of prestige television.

The remarks began innocently enough, with the filmmaker thanking her presenter, fellow New Zealander Taika Waititi and the Critics Choice Association.
You’re absolutely brilliant,” she continued, praising the evening’s SeeHer Award winner before turning her attention to “King Richard” subjects Venus and Serena Williams.
“Venus and Serena, you’re such marvels,” she said, circling back to her earlier talking point.
Some noted that Venus and Serena Williams could not only play against, but most likely beat, the men in their sport, as Campion had just done.
