     Report: Blue Jays Have ‘Remained Aggressive’ in Pursuit of Freddie Freeman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman’s days with the Braves are likely over, according to reports, which opens the door for a mystery team—like the Blue Jays—to make one last push to sign the first baseman.
The Yankees and Dodgers are considered the favorites to sign Freeman, per MLB.com’s Mark Bowman, but the Rays and Blue Jays “have remained aggressive” in pursuit of the 2020 NL MVP.
Toronto has been linked to Freeman—whose parents were both born in Ontario—since before the lockout began in December, though it’s been clear from the start the Blue Jays aren’t considered front-runners.
The 32-year-old slashed .300/.393/.503 with 31 homers last season and would instantly give Toronto one of the scariest lineups in the American League, joining sluggers Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Teoscar Hernandez, and George Springer in the meat of the order.
The Jays are still in need of a quality infielder and could use additional bullpen help.

     Braves replace Nationals killer Freddie Freeman with Matt Olson at first base
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman will almost certainly call a new city home this season after the Atlanta Braves traded four prospects to the Oakland A’s for first baseman Matt Olson.
But the Rays and Blue Jays have remained aggressive.
The only other first baseman to match those totals was Blue Jays phenom Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
Even without Freeman, the Braves enter the 2022 season with the sixth-best odds on PointsBet sportsbook to run it back.
Freeman may no longer be in the NL East, but the Braves look as dangerous as ever with Olson replacing him at first.

     Life after Freddie Freeman: Braves' deal for Matt Olson means the end of an era in Atlanta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NORTH PORT, Fla. -- Not long before Braves manager Brian Snitker hosted the first team meeting of spring training Monday morning, he texted Freddie Freeman, who was on the other side of the country.
Snitker mentioned that he was about to talk to the players, joking that Freddie still had a few minutes to join the group.
Underneath the humor, the outreach was more about a deeply cherished shared history between Freeman and Snitker.
Snitker focused on great Atlanta players who have moved on before -- Henry Aaron was traded, Chipper Jones retired, etc.
The next time Freddie Freeman -- a lifelong Brave, the team's starting first baseman for the past 11 years -- dons an Atlanta uniform will likely be after he retires.

     Summary: It’s absolutely crazy to think of a day where Freeman is not a Brave but that day is coming, and his market is ramping up.
But let’s be honest here, I don’t think there is really any chance that Freeman becomes a Cub.
Unless the Cubs are playing negotiations with Freeman close to the chest, I don’t think this is a real possibility.
Nonetheless, its good to see the Cubs mentioned in yet another top free agents possible market.
As a Cubs fan, it will be worth it to keep an eye on the Freeman market after this report.

     Summary: ATLANTA — The Atlanta Braves have acquired Oakland A's first baseman Matt Olson in a trade on Monday.
It means Freddie Freeman's time in Atlanta has likely come to an end.
Olson, who grew up in Gwinnett County and went to Parkview High School, made his MLB debut in 2016.
Oakland will receive OF Cristian Pache, C Shea Langeliers, SP Ryan Cusick and SP Joey Estes, sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan.
Freeman had been on an 8-year, $135 million deal with the Braves that paid him $22 million in base salary last year.

The Braves have completed a trade with the Oakland Athletics that sends star first baseman Matt Olson to Atlanta for four prospects, including outfielder Cristian Pache and catcher Shea Langeliers.
The Olson trade creates a path for Freeman to sign with his hometown team.
Matt Olson ATL • 1B • 28 BA .271 R 101 HR 39 RBI 111 SB 4 View ProfileIt's still possible the Braves could re-sign Freeman -- Freeman and Olson could share first base and DH duties with Marcell Ozuna in the outfield full-time -- though it seems very unlikely.
Listen below:For Oakland, the trade is the latest sign they are tearing down their roster and entering a rebuild.

     Summary: Greg Nelson/Sports IllustatedMaybe there is a grand plan to keep Olson and Freeman, but no such signs have been evident from the Braves.
Atlanta whiffed on the chance to lock up Freeman during the season and after the 2021 World Series title.
Game 3: In the third inning of a scoreless game, Freeman takes a down-and-in fastball from Luis Garcia and shoots it to left-center for a single.
Raley throws Freeman six cutters and sliders, the last of which was an outside edge cutter Freeman pokes foul.
Game 6: The Braves lead 5–0 in the fifth when Freeman faces another lefty, Blake Taylor, with a runner on first.

With the Yankees pessimistic on their chances of signing Freeman, here’s the latest…The Blue Jays have conveyed serious interest in Freeman, according to Jon Morosi of MLB Network.
On Friday Morosi suggested Freeman’s signing was imminent and said the Dodgers were making a strong push.
The Rays and Jays “have remained aggressive” on Freeman, according to MLB.com’s Mark Bowman.
He also suggests the Yankees could make sense as a Freeman suitor, but notes that it’s unclear if ownership wants to take on a long-term deal when they’re hoping to work out a long-term extension with Aaron Judge at some point down the line.
