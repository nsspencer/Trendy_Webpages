     Braves acquire slugging 1B Matt Olson, filling spot of free agent Freddie Freeman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Braves have made a decision about the franchise's future at first base.
And it doesn't include five-time All-Star and 2020 National League MVP Freddie Freeman.
The Braves acquired slugger Matt Olson from the Oakland A's for a package of four prospects, headlined by center fielder Cristian Pache, the team announced Monday.
Olson, 27, is a two-time Gold Glover at first base who made his first AL All-Star team last season.
The acquisition of Olson almost certainly takes the Braves out of the bidding for Freeman's services.

     Summary: According to Jeff Passan of ESPN, the Oakland Athletics and Atlanta Braves came to an agreement for star first baseman Matt Olson.
It seems like the Freddie Freeman era in Atlanta may be over.
Freddie Freeman has been the cornerstone of the Braves for 12 seasons since his debut in 2012.
Now he's a free agent, and Atlanta is finalizing a deal for a player who looks to be his replacement.
With the implementation of the designated hitter in the National League in 2022, it's possible the Braves could employ both players.

     Athletics Trade Matt Olson To Braves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As is the case with Anthopoulos, the acquisition of Olson will be a bittersweet one for many Braves fans.
As far as replacements for Freeman go, it’s tough to dream up a better option than the Atlanta-born Olson, however.
This past season, Olson shed the “strikeout-prone” label when he cut his strikeout rate from 27.5% in 2019-20 all the way down to 16.8%.
The Braves will control Olson for at least the next two seasons, as he’s currently sitting on four-plus years of Major League service time.
They’ve secured four new pitching prospects and a pair of ballyhooed close-to-the-Majors position players already (Pache, Langeliers), and things are likely just getting started.
