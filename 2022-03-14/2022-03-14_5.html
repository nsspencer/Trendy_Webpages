     Report: Former Bears QB Mitch Trubisky to Sign With Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Report: Mitch Trubisky to sign with Steelers originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoMitchell Trubisky has found his new home.
The Steelers are presumably bringing Trubisky in to compete for a starting job now that Ben Roethlisberger has retired.
Trubisky spent the past season as a backup quarterback for the Bills, learning from offensive coordinator Brian Daboll and starting QB Josh Allen.
In four years with the Bears, Trubisky compiled a 29-21 record, threw for 10,609 yards, 64 touchdowns and 37 interceptions.
But Matt Nagy’s offense never blossomed with Trubisky under center, and the team opted to let him walk in 2021, instead of picking up his fifth-year option.

     Mitch Trubisky agrees to two-year deal with Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Steelers may have found Ben Roethlisberger’s successor.
Mike Garafolo of NFL Media reports that the Steelers have reached an agreement with Mitch Trubisky.
It’s a two-year deal for Trubisky in Pittsburgh and no financial terms have been disclosed.
Roethlisberger announced his retirement after the Steelers lost to the Chiefs in the playoffs, so Trubisky joins a quarterback depth chart that also includes Mason Rudolph and restricted free agent Dwayne Haskins.
General Manager Kevin Colbert said in February that Rudolph would be the starter if the season were starting, but Trubisky’s arrival represents a big change.

     Mitch Trubisky to sign 2-year contract with Steelers, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills quarterback Mitch Trubisky will sign a 2-year deal with the Steelers, per a report from Mike Garafolo.
When Trubisky was drafted by the Bears second overall in the 2017 NFL Draft, it seemed like a massive reach.
That thought proved to be true, as he was never really able to find consistent success in the Windy City.
He’s 0-2 all-time in playoff games as well and signed a free agent one-year deal with the Buffalo Bills to sit behind Josh Allen last season.
His skill as a rusher will be an extremely new dynamic for the Steelers and really, nobody is going to be as bad as Ben Roethlisberger was last season.

     NFL free agency 2022: Mitch Trubisky signs with Steelers instead of joining Giants as Daniel Jones’ backup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Mitch Trubisky won’t be reuniting with the Giants’ Brian Daboll.
Trubisky instead has found a better landing spot in free agency, according to NFL Network — the Steelers, who just lost Ben Roethlisberger to retirement.
The NFL’s free agency negotiating window opened at noon Monday.
Free agency signings can officially happen beginning at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
From the Giants’ perspective, at least, signing Trubisky — to something like a one-year, $10 million contract — would have made a lot of sense.

     Summary: Mitch Trubisky is getting a second chance to start in the NFL.
It cannot be made official until the start of the league year Wednesday.
But when it happens, Trubisky will get an opportunity he wasn’t afforded last year — to prove he can start.
None of those quarterbacks has a better resume than Trubisky, who won 29 of 50 games with the Bears and started two playoff gamess.
2 pick in 2017, Trubisky was disappointing enough with the Bears, though, that they declined his fifth-year option.

     QB Mitchell Trubisky says he plans to sign two-year deal with Pittsburgh Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent quarterback Mitchell Trubisky plans to sign a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Monday.
Trubisky said his decision came down to the Steelers and New York Giants.
In Pittsburgh, he will compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting quarterback position as the franchise begins the post-Ben Roethlisberger era.
Time away from a starting role paid off for Trubisky, who spent last season as the backup quarterback for the Buffalo Bills.
"Going to Buffalo really opened my eyes," Trubisky told Fowler in February.
