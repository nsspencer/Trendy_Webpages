     Lakers: LeBron James a Game Time Decision Tonight Against Toronto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They'll take on the Raptors at home tonight, a 37-30 team sitting at the seventh seed in the Western Conference.
Speaking with the media on Monday afternoon, Frank Vogel revealed that James would be a true game time decision.
Last week, James had to miss a game against the Rockets after scoring 56 points against the Warriors.
The Lakers went on to lose that game in overtime and would lose another to the Spurs two days later.
We'll see the direction they go tonight should James have to sit again.

     Three Things to Know: Lakers vs Raptors - 3/14/22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers (29-38) are set to face the Toronto Raptors (37-30) at 7:30 p.m. Pacific on Spectrum SportsNet.
The Lakers are coming off a Sunday night loss at Phoenix, while the Raptors won consecutive road games at Phoenix and Denver over the weekend.
LeBron said it’s typically the day after games that his knee gets sore, so he won’t know about his availability vs. Toronto until tomorrow.
The Lakers are just 6-12 this season without LeBron, and Anthony Davis played in several of the wins.
VanVleet is questionable to play against the Lakers, having missed seven of their last 11 games with knee soreness, while Anunoby is definitely out with a fractured finger.

     Lakers suffer another poor first quarter and can’t recover in loss to Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before Monday’s game, Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters that James would work on his body in preparation to play.
“He’s been sore and in a pattern of being sore the day after games,” Vogel said.
(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)The Lakers scored just 12 points in the first quarter, which was tied for a season low in a quarter.
In a season of full of low points, Vogel said “not one” when asked about the most frustrating part of the 2021-22 campaign.
Not well enough in-game but coming back with big games following up some of those situations.”On Monday, the Lakers could not put together such a follow-up performance.

     Phoenix Suns began beatdown of Los Angeles Lakers way before Sunday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS – The Phoenix Suns 140-111 destruction of the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday began way before Sunday's opening tip.
“We have a team full of guys who are highly remorseful after a loss,” Suns coach Monty Williams said after Saturday’s practice.
Lakers coach Frank Vogel called three timeouts in the first quarter to stop Phoenix’s momentum only to see the Suns continue to pummel them.
“DA doesn’t make those kind of statements so he can score more or get more points,” Williams said.
Punishing teams like that.”The Suns scored a season-high 76 points in the paint and outrebounded the Lakers, 51-37.

`"It was a great, great start,'' Toronto coach Nick Nurse told reporters.
And the Raptors love nothing better than playing in Los Angeles -- and against the Lakers in particular.
