     NFL Free Agency 2022: Complete signing tracker and instant grades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The slightly-lower grade here is only because a big money signing for a player coming off injury is a risk.
Two signings in and they’ve secured two really great offensive linemen who can start immediately, and they’re on good deals.
The issue isn’t the player here, it’s signing a running back to a free agent contract that out-strips his production.
Grade: CI really, really like this move because of what it signifies for the rest of Cincinnati’s free agency.
This is a great signing that will hopefully help make Kyler Murray happy.
