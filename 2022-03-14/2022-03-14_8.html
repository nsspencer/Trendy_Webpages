    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not overly strange for cast members on a long-running series to develop a sense of animosity, especially when money is involved.
This happens to be the cause of the rumor, which supposedly surrounds the massive pay gap between original and later cast members (via Geeks).
More specifically, the rumors claim that Bialik made $100,000 an episode, while Cuoco made $1,000,000 and that Bialik did not like it.
Regardless of the pay gap between the two, however, it's clear that they're friends.
When Cuoco got married to her now ex-husband Karl Cook in 2018, Bialik was one of the few "Big Bang Theory" cast members to actually attend (via TV Insider).

     ‘Jeopardy’ Host Mayim Bialik Targeted in Phony CBD Endorsement, False Allegations

     Summary: Online ads claimed that allegations "had been confirmed" against actor and "Jeopardy" host Mayim Bialik.
A search for Bialik’s name led to mentions of Kushly CBD, Green Otter CBD Gummies, Clinical CBD Gummies, and Smilz CBD Gummies.
Martha is now calling for Mayim Bialik to be indicted, saying: “I am happy Mayim Bialik found something to replace prescriptions, but her announcement was a direct breach of contract.

In sum, Bialik did not have any allegations against her “confirmed,” nor did the “Jeopardy” host endorse Premium Jane CBD, Kushly CBD, Green Otter CBD Gummies, Clinical CBD Gummies, and Smilz CBD Gummies.
