     Matt Olson from Oakland Athletics Trade Spells End of Freddie Freeman's Time with Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Jeff Passan of ESPN, the Oakland Athletics and Atlanta Braves came to an agreement for star first baseman Matt Olson.
It seems like the Freddie Freeman era in Atlanta may be over.
Freddie Freeman has been the cornerstone of the Braves for 12 seasons since his debut in 2012.
Now he's a free agent, and Atlanta is finalizing a deal for a player who looks to be his replacement.
With the implementation of the designated hitter in the National League in 2022, it's possible the Braves could employ both players.

The Braves have completed a trade with the Oakland Athletics that sends star first baseman Matt Olson to Atlanta for four prospects, including outfielder Cristian Pache and catcher Shea Langeliers.
The Olson trade creates a path for Freeman to sign with his hometown team.

For Oakland, the trade is the latest sign they are tearing down their roster and entering a rebuild.

     Summary: 1:20pm: The Athletics have announced the trade of Olson to the Braves in exchange for Pache, Langeliers, Estes and Cusick.
1:16pm: The Braves are trading outfielder Cristian Pache, catcher Shea Langeliers, right-hander Joey Estes and right-hander Ryan Cusick to the A’s in exchange for Olson, Passan tweets.
1:09pm: The Braves and A’s have agreed to a trade that will send first baseman Matt Olson from Oakland to Atlanta, reports ESPN’s Jeff Passan (via Twitter).
This past season, Olson shed the “strikeout-prone” label when he cut his strikeout rate from 27.5% in 2019-20 all the way down to 16.8%.
The Braves will control Olson for at least the next two seasons, as he’s currently sitting on four-plus years of Major League service time.
