     Summary: Renaud, 51, had previously reported on the War in Iraq, meth addiction in the American South and natural disasters.
“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud,” said Edward Felsenthal, the editor in chief and CEO of TIME, and Ian Orefice, its COO, in a statement.
“Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but US citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor’s ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness,” Andriy Nebytov said in the post.
Most recently, a law was passed threatening up to 15 years imprisonment for journalists speaking out about the conflict.
A number of media outlets, including the Times, yanked their journalists from Russia on fears of that threat.

     Summary: Brent Renaud, 50, a documentary filmmaker and photographer, was killed in a suburb of Kyiv while working on a film about refugees and migrants leaving Ukraine because of Russia’s invasion.
The strike followed Russian threats to target foreign weapon shipments that are helping Ukrainian fighters defend their country against Russia’s invasion.
More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling training facility, according to the governor of Ukraine’s western Lviv region.
Poland is a key location for routing Western military aid to Ukraine.
“We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support to Russia,” Sullivan said.
