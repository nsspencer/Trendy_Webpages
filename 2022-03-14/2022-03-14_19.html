     Here's what you need to know about Auburn entering Greenville Regional
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 seed, Auburn has secured its highest seeding in the NCAA Tournament since it earned the program’s only No.
1 ranking in both national polls this season and to a fourth 25-plus win season in the past five years.
Watch out for this guy: Walker Kessler.
2 seed, Auburn will be heavily favored to advance to the Sweet 16, but the Tigers haven't been consistent of late.
The sense here is that Auburn will have enough firepower inside between Jabari Smith and Walker Kessler to withstand any upset bid in the first two rounds.

     Iron Bowl Basketball? Auburn’s Bruce Pearl Faces Ex-Arch Enemy In Jacksonville State’s Ray Harper
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Videos by OutKickAuburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl knows that Jacksonville State is not in Florida.
Jacksonville State won the regular season title of the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN), which includes Jacksonville University by the way, with a 13-3 record.
“I don’t know a ton about Jacksonville State,” Pearl said diplomatically, then quickly and skillfully pivoted to another subject.
143 ranking in the nation by the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET) that is used to pick the NCAA Tournament field.
“So, I would venture to say that there’s probably not a team in the country that Jacksonville State or Ray Harper would rather play than Bruce Pearl and Auburn,” Pearl said.
