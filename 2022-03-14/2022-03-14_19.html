     Leaders Man City drop points at Palace to open door for Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Leaders Manchester City were held to a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace on Monday as the Premier League title race took yet another dramatic twist.
City dominated in the first half at Selhurst Park, but could not find a breakthrough.
Palace looked a danger on the break, with Wilfried Zaha firing wide from a good position, but otherwise it was one-way traffic, with City having 14 first-half efforts at goal.
The last side to stop City scoring in the Premier League was Palace in October, and another shutout was looking more likely as chances continued to come and go for City.
"When you play against City you have to concede chances," Palace manager Patrick Vieira told the BBC.

     Summary: Pep Guardiola Happy With Man City Performance At Crystal Palace...
But Not The GrassThis was the scene at Selhurst Park a few hours before Crystal Palace played Manchester City on Monday.
At least that was the opinion of City manager Pep Guardiola.
A general view of Selhurst Park before Crystal Palace vs Manchester City IMAGO/Action Plus/Katie ChanGuardiola criticized the standard of the playing surface during his post-match press conference after City were held to a 0-0 draw.
City were the dominant side at Selhurst Park, where they had 74% of possession and 18 shots.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Crystal Palace had gone to the Etihad Stadium and won earlier in the season, and a double over Manchester City seemed unlikely.
But Liverpool were not after a Crystal Palace win necessarily — from Jürgen Klopp's perspective, any dropped points would do.
The goalless draw means that Manchester City are still in the lead in the Premier League standings.
They will still need to win all of their games including the trip to Manchester City to guarantee a title win.
Even just the fact that Manchester City have been dealt a dent in their chase could be vital, with Crystal Palace proving again that points can indeed be taken from them.

(1:11)Pep Guardiola had one person in mind when striding onto the Selhurst Park turf at full-time of a goalless draw with Crystal Palace.
As it was, Guardiola didn't make a single substitution in a game City had to win to maintain a degree of breathing space over Liverpool, the holder's lead standing at four points now.
In tirelessly chasing down City as they probed relentlessly for the opener, the 22-year-old covered 12.5 km -- the highest distance of any Palace player in a Premier League game this season.
Kevin De Bruyne and Manchester City were held to a frustrating draw against Crystal Palace.
