     ‘Deltacron’ variant of COVID: Where is it? Do vaccines work? What is known so far about the coronavirus strain

     Summary: A new COVID-19 variant called “Deltacron” has been discovered in Europe and the United States.
It is a hybrid between the delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus, also known by scientists as the AY.4/BA.1 recombinant.
Is the Deltacron variant dangerous?
But there are many studies that are under way.”Van Kerkhove, however, added the newly discovered variant is expected to spread, saying “the pandemic is far from over.”Do vaccines work against the Deltacron variant?
Therefore, scientists say the vaccines on the market should work just as well with the new variant as it does with the variants already discovered and in circulation.

     Deltacron: Why Experts Say You Shouldn't Worry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Share on Pinterest Experts say the new Deltacron variant doesn’t appear to be more infectious than previous strains.
Maria Manco/Stocksy UnitedA new variant called Deltacron, which contains genetic material from both Delta and Omicron, has been identified in Europe and the United States.
Infectious disease specialists say there’s no evidence yet that shows this recombinant variant is more transmissible or virulent, but studies are underway to better understand Deltacron’s viral traits.
So far, there’s no evidence suggesting there are any changes in severity or level of infectiousness with this recombinant variant.
There are numerous studies underway to determine if there are any changes in Deltacron’s epidemiology, WHO officials said.

     New “Deltacron” COVID-19 Sub-Variant Could Be as Contagious as Measles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Deltacron COVID-19 variant does not initially appear to be any more severe than Omicron, but it is more transmissible.
The new COVID-19 sub-variant of the Delta and Omicron strains has been circulating since the beginning of the year.
Omicron BA.2, called “Deltacron,” is a recombinant virus that contains the full-length spike protein of Omicron and the backbone of Delta.
The Omicron BA.1 variant caused an unprecedented number of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals, but COVID-19 vaccines remained highly effective against hospitalization and death.
Like Omicron, Deltacron can evade monoclonal antibody treatment.

     ‘Deltacron’ Variant Rare and Not a Major Concern
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new hybrid, first found in samples collected in France in January, is formally called the AY.4/BA.1 recombinant but has been nicknamed Deltacron by some.
“The surface of the viruses is super-similar to Omicron, so the body will recognize it as well as it recognizes Omicron,” Simon-Loriere noted.
That might be because Omicron’s distinctive spike is also partly why it causes less severe disease, scientists suspect.
While the Omicron variant uses that spike to invade cells in the nose and the upper airway, it doesn’t do so well deep in the lungs.
Simon-Loriere and other scientists are conducting lab experiments to learn more about the recombinant variant, but findings will take several weeks.

     Summary: Now, researchers believe it’s a single, hybrid variant that combines genes from both delta and omicron.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization decided to start tracking deltacron, but is not yet calling it a variant of concern.
He added the name of the hybrid variant could change in the future.
“So far it seems like the outside of deltacron is looking almost exactly like omicron,” Chin-Hong said.
The infectious disease specialists did emphasize that the best way to protect yourself from this variant, or any future variants, is to get fully up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — Scientists are learning more about a new COVID variant that has been detected — it’s called ‘Deltacron.’It’s a combination of genes from both delta and omicron variants.
KRON4 spoke with local infectious disease specialists about the new variant, and why the World Health Organization has just acknowledged it.
Because of that, the new variant has been dubbed “deltacron” — although Swartzberg says that name could change.
Chin-Hong says, in this case, that child would be deltacron, but, your body may already be primed to fight off this new variant.
The infectious disease specialists did emphasize that the best way to protect yourself from this variant, or any future variants, is to get vaccinated.

     What Is Deltacron? What to Know as Cases of Rare COVID Strain Confirmed by WHO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cases of a seemingly rare COVID-19 variant known as "deltacron" have emerged in several countries so far this year, but what is it and what do we know so far?
The World Health Organization last week confirmed the emergence of "deltacron" - a hybrid strain that combines both the delta and omicron variants.
Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, called the strain "deltacron," because of its omicron-like genetic signatures within the delta genomes, Bloomberg said.
The patients described in the aforementioned report were infected with a strain that combines the spike protein from an omicron variant with the "body" of delta variant.
The potential "deltacron" cases are being monitored, but she said it is not concerning until a variant has been labeled a variant of interest or concern.
