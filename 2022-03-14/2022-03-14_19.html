     Talking about Rutgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Throughout the course of this past college basketball season, Rutgers has been a frequent topic of conversation.
This past week, Rutgers was talked about quite a bit as a team that could be in or out of the NCAA Tournament.
Last season, Rutgers was a No.10 seed and downed No.7 Clemson before losing a heartbreaker in the waning minute to Houston, who made the Final Four.
And with the national spotlight shining solely on the Scarlet Knights that night, the nation will once again be talking about Rutgers.
Things are really heating up with Rutgers' run into the NCAA Tournament.

     March Madness 2022: Meet Rutgers, the rag-tag group that could bust your NCAA Tournament bracket
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If not for COVID-19, which caused the cancellation of the tournament in 2020, this would be Rutgers’ third consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance under head coach Steve Pikiell.
We’ve got a crash course on the prime Cinderella candidate of the 2022 NCAA Tournament.
He is in a bit of a slump, but when the Scarlet Knights offense had things humming, Mulcahy was scorching hot.
These guys sound pretty good ...At their best, they look like one of the best teams in the country.
Rutgers is predictably unpredictable, a quality it shares with the NCAA Tournament.

     Summary: Save the “take it one game at a time” responses but I like the draw vs. Notre Dame &amp; then Alabama.
Never an easy opponent in the NCAA Tournament but I like they’re both offense first teams that aren’t great defensively.
