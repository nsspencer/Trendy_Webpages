     J.C. Jackson, Chargers Reportedly Agree to 5-Year, $82.5M Contract in Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Stew MilneCornerback J.C. Jackson and the Los Angeles Chargers agreed to a five-year, $82.5 million contract with $40 million guaranteed, according to Josina Anderson of CBS Sports.
Jackson is coming off arguably the best season of his career in 2021, as he led a strong Patriots defense with elite-level play from the cornerback position.
Jackson was undoubtedly a big reason the Patriots made it back to the playoffs as a wild card after missing the postseason in 2020.
Despite being an undrafted player, it didn't take long for Jackson to become a key piece for the New England defense.
The Chargers needed to bring in another quality corner with Chris Harris hitting free agency, and Jackson undoubtedly fits the bill.

     NFL rumors: Free agent J.C. Jackson drawing interest from Chargers, Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New England Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson could be one of the most sought after NFL free agents this week with the market officially opening Wednesday.
Expect the LA Chargers to be heavily involved with free agent corner JC Jackson.
— Mike Giardi (@MikeGiardi) March 13, 2022Sources tell me the #Dolphins are bidders for JC Jackson.
Not sure if they land him, but imagine a secondary with Howard and JC Jackson?
Losing Jackson would be a huge blow to the Patriots secondary -- a group that already lost star cornerback Stephon Gilmore via trade last October.

     J.C. Jackson agrees to 5-year, $82.5 million deal with Los Angeles Chargers, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are giving former New England Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson a five-year, $82.5 million deal that includes $40 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.
Jackson, who just concluded his fourth NFL season with the Patriots, earned his first Pro Bowl selection in 2021.
His eight interceptions were the second most in the NFL, behind Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs' 11.
He started all 17 regular-season games last season, and the team's playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills.
In all, he's played in 67 games, with 42 starts (including playoffs).

     Rumor: Miami Dolphins pushing for cornerback J.C. Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)It appears that the Miami Dolphins are indeed interested in signing free agent J.C. Jackson when the market officially opens on Wednesday.
Imagine the Dolphins secondary with two Pro Bowl corners on the roster?
J.C. Jackson is the up and coming big name while Xavien Howard has been consistent the last few years.
Both will eat up $20 million in cap space and after that, the Dolphins have to figure out what to do with Byron Jones.
Miami has the most available cap space but we need to realize that the cap is not really a set in stone number.

     Chargers To Sign CB J.C. Jackson

     Summary: Jackson is signing with the Bolts, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com tweets.
The ex-Patriot will see $40MM fully guaranteed, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Bolts did not need to give Jackson top-five corner money, it turns out.
To entice Jackson, the Chargers have agreed to give him $28MM in the deal’s first year, Rapoport adds (on Twitter).
With Jackson hitting the open market at 26, it will likely cost close to cornerback-record money to sign him.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson to a five-year, $82.5 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
The contract includes $28 million in the first year and $40 million over the first two, Rapoport added.
Jackson will get $40 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Mike Giardi.
Adding Jackson to pair with Pro Bowl safety Derwin James gives the Bolts one of the better secondaries in football.
Jackson is coming off a career year with the Patriots, tallying eight interceptions and an NFL-best 23 passes defensed to earn his first Pro Bowl nod and a second-team All-Pro selection.
