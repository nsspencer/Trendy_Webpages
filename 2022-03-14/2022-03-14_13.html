     Michigan State Basketball: 3 things to know about first-round foe Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan State basketball is getting an interesting matchup in round one of the NCAA Tournament with A-10 regular-season champ Davidson.
Michigan State played itself into a 7-seed in the NCAA Tournament after arguably the worst stretch in the Tom Izzo era, losing 7-of-10 games to end the regular season.
Michigan State won 3-of-4 games to end the year after losing 7-of-10 and it has some newfound confidence after cutting the turnovers and improving team cohesion.
Now, the Spartans get a date with 10th-seeded Davidson in the first round on Friday night at 9:40 p.m.
He actually leads college basketball from the free throw line, making 107-of-115 shots from the stripe this year.

     Summary: His Michigan men’s basketball team spent most of last March there, returned last week, and is heading back again for this week’s NCAA Tournament.
“We can’t escape that place, man,” Michigan sophomore Hunter Dickinson said.
In the end, just four at-large teams were slotted below the Wolverines, making Michigan the last team to avoid a play-in game.
What was Bankers Life Fieldhouse when Michigan beat Florida State was Gainbridge Fieldhouse when Michigan lost to Indiana last week.
It’s worth noting that Kentucky, a 2 seed in a different region of the NCAA Tournament, was also sent to Indianapolis.

I can’t say the same for Ohio State and Michigan State though.
Ohio State has to play Loyola-Chicago in the first round, and Michigan State has to play Davidson in the first round.
