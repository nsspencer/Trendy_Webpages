     Approval Poll: Bengals sign Alex Cappa, who once tried to play through a broken leg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Within the first five minutes, the Bengals began to improve their offensive line, agreeing to a deal with offensive guard Alex Cappa.
Offensive line coach Frank Pollack is on record saying he wants “glass eaters” on his offensive line and Cappa certainly seems to fit the part:Alex Cappa seriously tried to play with a broken leg against Washington in the wild-card game in 2020.
Like he legit tried to play on a BROKEN LEG.
An instant upgrade for the Bengals’ offensive line.
— JennaLaineESPN (@JennaLaineESPN) March 14, 2022The fans have demanded improvements to the offensive line and the front office appears to share the same sentiment.

     Bengals Free Agency: Alex Cappa shores up right guard position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals wasted no time when the legal tampering aspect of free agency began, agreeing to terms on a deal with offensive guard Alex Cappa.
Bengals free agency kicked off at 12:00 EST and by 12:02, the team had already struck a deal with Cappa to bring him to Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
The right guard position was such a revolving door in 2021, as we saw three different guys start there and none of them were exactly stellar.
Cappa is a durable guard who should be able to give the Bengals stability at the right guard spot for the next four years.
