     J.C. Jackson, Chargers Reportedly Agree to 5-Year, $82.5M Contract in Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Stew MilneCornerback J.C. Jackson and the Los Angeles Chargers agreed to a five-year, $82.5 million contract with $40 million guaranteed, according to Josina Anderson of CBS Sports.
Jackson is coming off arguably the best season of his career in 2021, as he led a strong Patriots defense with elite-level play from the cornerback position.
Jackson was undoubtedly a big reason the Patriots made it back to the playoffs as a wild card after missing the postseason in 2020.
Despite being an undrafted player, it didn't take long for Jackson to become a key piece for the New England defense.
The Chargers needed to bring in another quality corner with Chris Harris hitting free agency, and Jackson undoubtedly fits the bill.

     Chargers To Sign CB J.C. Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson is signing with the Bolts, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com tweets.
The ex-Patriot will see $40MM fully guaranteed, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Bolts did not need to give Jackson top-five corner money, it turns out.
To entice Jackson, the Chargers have agreed to give him $28MM in the deal’s first year, Rapoport adds (on Twitter).
With Jackson hitting the open market at 26, it will likely cost close to cornerback-record money to sign him.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson to a five-year, $82.5 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
The contract includes $28 million in the first year and $40 million over the first two, Rapoport added.
Jackson will get $40 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Mike Giardi.
Adding Jackson to pair with Pro Bowl safety Derwin James gives the Bolts one of the better secondaries in football.
Jackson is coming off a career year with the Patriots, tallying eight interceptions and an NFL-best 23 passes defensed to earn his first Pro Bowl nod and a second-team All-Pro selection.
