     Bengals sign free agent guard Alex Cappa, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals have reached an agreement with free agent right guard Alex Cappa.
$40 million deal with Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
After spending his rookie season on the bench, Cappa emerged as Tampa Bay’s starting right guard in 2019 and has held that spot ever since.
There should be no doubt that Cappa will come in and start for the Bengals at that position with this deal.

     Bengals Free Agency: Alex Cappa shores up right guard position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals wasted no time when the legal tampering aspect of free agency began, agreeing to terms on a deal with offensive guard Alex Cappa.
Bengals free agency kicked off at 12:00 EST and by 12:02, the team had already struck a deal with Cappa to bring him to Cincinnati.
Tom Brady’s loss will be Joe Burrow’s gain: Bucs’ free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Bengals after free agency opens, per league sources.
The right guard position was such a revolving door in 2021, as we saw three different guys start there and none of them were exactly stellar.
Cappa is a durable guard who should be able to give the Bengals stability at the right guard spot for the next four years.

     Guard Alex Cappa plans to sign four-year deal with Cincinnati Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tampa Bay Buccaneers free-agent guard Alex Cappa intends to sign a four-year, $40 million deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after free agency opens on Wednesday, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Bengals have also agreed to a three-year, $18 million deal with New England Patriots center/guard Ted Karras, sources told ESPN.
Hill to a three-year, $30 million deal including $15 million in the first year, a source said.
The additions of Cappa and Karras will bolster the Bengals' offensive line as the team tries to improve the protection for quarterback Joe Burrow.
A third-round draft pick out of Humboldt State in 2018, Cappa transitioned from offensive tackle to guard with the Buccaneers and earned a starting role in his second season in 2019.
