     Lions, Chiefs, and Browns Reportedly Showing Interest in Bears Free Agent WR Allen Robinson II
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: @TomPelissero says the Lions, Browns and Chiefs are among the teams in on Allen Robinson.
— Chris Burke (@ChrisBurkeNFL) March 14, 2022In addition to the Lions’ interest, the Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs are also reportedly pursuing Robinson.
Cleveland just brought in Amari Cooper, but could still use some help atop their wide receiver depth chart.
Detroit is pretty bare at wide receiver outside of the breakout that rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown had late in the season.
As for Kansas City, I don’t see why Allen Robinson would want anything to do with Matt Nagy (who was hired as the Chiefs quarterbacks coach recently).

     Summary: Wide receiver Allen Robinson is coming off a rather sub-par campaign with the Chicago Bears, but his impressive resume is attracting the interest of numerous teams.
With his days in the Windy City likely done, the Chiefs, Lions, and Browns are all keen on him.
@TomPelissero says the Lions, Browns and Chiefs are among the teams in on Allen Robinson.
— Chris Burke (@ChrisBurkeNFL) March 14, 2022All of these teams could be nice landing spots for Robinson.
As for the Browns, who just brought in Amari Cooper but are probably parting ways with Jarvis Landy, Allen Robinson potentially replaces the aforementioned.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On an offense that was seeking a spark, one of the team’s most proven playmakers was an afterthought.
Robinson wasn’t given many opportunities to stretch the field.
With two quarterbacks who were new to the Bears in 2021, he didn’t have established trust as a go-to weapon and didn’t see nearly the number of opportunities he once had to make contested catches.

     Raiders News: Las Vegas ‘in the mix’ for Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFL’s legal tampering period in free agency is about to begin in a matter of hours, so rumors about the Las Vegas Raiders and the 31 other teams in the league are already running rampant.
It’s no secret that the Raiders need a wide receiver this offseason, and with Davante Adams getting the franchise tag last week, ex-Chicago Bears wideout Allen Robinson is one of the top names on the market.
Robinson has 495 career catches for 6,409 yards and 40 touchdowns in his eight-year career, and that came while battling injuries and less than stellar quarterback play.
“The New York Jets, Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders are among the teams who could be “in the mix” to sign Robinson, per Rapoport...the Cleveland Browns are also a team to watch.
“...As for the Raiders, Robinson could potentially be the final piece in turning the Las Vegas receiving corps into an excellent one as it currently features tight end Darren Waller and standout slot receiver Hunter Renfrow﻿.
