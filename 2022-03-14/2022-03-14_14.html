    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What to expect: WyomingAlex Bozich 2 hours ago in CommentaryIndiana will open play in the 2022 NCAA tournament on Tuesday night against Wyoming at the University of Dayton Arena.
As we mentioned in our first look at Wyoming, the Cowboys run a post-up heavy offense that revolves around Maldonado and Ike putting opposing defenses into mismatches.
Ike’s 19.6 points per game lead Wyoming, as do his 9.6 rebounds per game.
Wyoming only played six players double-figure minutes in its last game – a 68-61 loss to Boise State in the conference tournament in Las Vegas.

     Summary: He shoots 55.7 percent from 2-point range and has attempted more than two 3-pointers per game but only made 23.7 percent.
In the end it was likely IU’s non-conference strength of schedule, ranked in the 300s nationally, that the NCAA Tournament Committee struggled with.
Indiana will practice at 6:35 p.m. Eastern on Monday evening at the University of Dayton Arena.
The Hoosiers would no doubt then have a full day on Wednesday of practice, preparation and media obligations.
