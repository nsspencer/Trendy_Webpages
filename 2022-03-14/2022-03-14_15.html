    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mountain West ranked among the top seven leagues in the country per KenPom.com, nearly on par this year with the ACC.
Hunter Maldonado is a bit of a point forwardMaldonado was honored with a First Team All-Mountain West selection last week.
Maldonado was a great 1-2 punch with 6-foot-9, 252-pound sophomore Graham Ike, one of the most improved players in the Mountain West.
The Mountain West has become a very physical league, much like the Big Ten, so Wyoming like Indiana may have to adjust to different officiating.
Maldonado and Ike are the reason, as both earn just under seven three throw attempts per game.

     Summary: He shoots 55.7 percent from 2-point range and has attempted more than two 3-pointers per game but only made 23.7 percent.
In the end it was likely IU’s non-conference strength of schedule, ranked in the 300s nationally, that the NCAA Tournament Committee struggled with.
Indiana will practice at 6:35 p.m. Eastern on Monday evening at the University of Dayton Arena.
The Hoosiers would no doubt then have a full day on Wednesday of practice, preparation and media obligations.
