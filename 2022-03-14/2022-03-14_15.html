     BREAKING: Haason Reddick Leaves Carolina, Signs with New Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reddick proved this past fall that he wasn't just a one-hit wonder.
He racked up 11.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss, and 18 QB hits, becoming one of the most fierce pass rushers in the NFC.
During a Q&amp;A with the media at the NFL Combine earlier this month, Panthers GM Scott Fitterer foreshadowed that Reddick was about to earn a big contract and that it would be a challenge to return to the organization.
"He's had two years in a row of double-digit sacks and he's going to command a lot of money on the market.
We just want the dialogue to be open, give us a chance, and see where it goes."

Reddick agreed to a three-year, $45 million contract with $30 million fully guaranteed at signing, sources told ESPN.
Reddick, who played for Carolina coach Matt Rhule at Temple, embodied everything Rhule wants in terms of toughness and work ethic.
Reddick played at 235 pounds last season but said one of his offseason goals was to add 10 to 15 pounds for 2022.
Reddick has 31 sacks and 50 quarterback hits in five seasons since being selected 13th overall by the Cardinals in the 2017 NFL draft.

     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles are adding a big-name edge rusher in free agency with Philly roots.
NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported Monday that the Eagles agreed to terms on a three-year, $45 million contract with Haason Reddick﻿, per a source informed of the situation.
The 27-year-old is the first big-name edge rusher to agree on a deal.
