    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carolina Panthers edge rusher Haason Reddick plans to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles, he announced on Twitter.
Reddick agreed to a three-year, $45 million contract with $30 million fully guaranteed at signing, sources told ESPN.
Reddick, who played for Carolina coach Matt Rhule at Temple, embodied everything Rhule wants in terms of toughness and work ethic.
Reddick played at 235 pounds last season but said one of his offseason goals was to add 10 to 15 pounds for 2022.
Reddick has 31 sacks and 50 quarterback hits in five seasons since being selected 13th overall by the Cardinals in the 2017 NFL draft.

     Eagles signing Panthers' Haason Reddick to reported three-year, $45M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The veteran Panthers pass rusher, who grew up in New Jersey and played for Temple, has agreed to terms on a three-year, $45 million contract with the Eagles, according to NFL Media's Mike Garafolo.
Reddick's deal is worth up to $49.5M, Garafolo reported, and will average a $15M payout per season, making him one of the top 20 highest-paid pass rushers in the NFL.
The 27-year-old Reddick originally went 13th overall to the Cardinals in 2017, after a promising run as a Temple Owls walk-on.
In 2021, he logged 11 sacks for Carolina, as well as 12 tackles for loss and a career-high 18 quarterback hits.
Only T.J. Watt, Myles Garrett, Trey Hendrickson and Aaron Donald have more sacks since the start of the 2020 season.

     Haason Reddick, Eagles reportedly agree to terms on three-year contract

     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles are signing free agent edge rusher Haason Reddick to a three-year, $45 million contract worth $30 million guaranteed, according to a report from NFL insider Mike Garafolo.
Reddick wouldn’t be a cheap add but the Eagles aren’t reluctant to invest in their pass rush.
The Eagles signing Reddick further cements Barnett’s exit from Philly.
It’ll be interesting to see exactly how Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon utilizes Reddick.
Haason Reddick is self-described as not a DE or OLB but a “weapon” for the Eagles.

     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles are adding a big-name edge rusher in free agency with Philly roots.
NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported Monday that the Eagles agreed to terms on a three-year, $45 million contract with Haason Reddick﻿, per a source informed of the situation.
The 27-year-old is the first big-name edge rusher to agree on a deal.
Developing into a relentless edge rusher, Reddick showed great burst and the ability to cause havoc behind the line of scrimmage.
Upgrading that area was a priority for general manager Howie Roseman, and he made an immediate splash play to open free agency.
