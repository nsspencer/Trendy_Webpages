     Chargers To Sign CB J.C. Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson is signing with the Bolts, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com tweets.
The ex-Patriot will see $40MM fully guaranteed, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Bolts did not need to give Jackson top-five corner money, it turns out.
To entice Jackson, the Chargers have agreed to give him $28MM in the deal’s first year, Rapoport adds (on Twitter).
With Jackson hitting the open market at 26, it will likely cost close to cornerback-record money to sign him.

     Chargers expected to sign former Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson to five-year, $82.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson to a five-year, $82.5 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
The contract includes $28 million in the first year and $40 million over the first two, Rapoport added.
Jackson will get $40 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Mike Giardi.
Adding Jackson to pair with Pro Bowl safety Derwin James gives the Bolts one of the better secondaries in football.
Jackson is coming off a career year with the Patriots, tallying eight interceptions and an NFL-best 23 passes defensed to earn his first Pro Bowl nod and a second-team All-Pro selection.

     What losing J.C. Jackson in free agency means for the Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots’ biggest free agent will be wearing a different uniform in 2022.
Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson is leaving the team in unrestricted free agency to sign a five-year, $82.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Chargers.
He was the Patriots’ best defensive back in 2021, and a big reason for the team’s success on this side of the ball.
Cornerback is now a major needOne year ago, the Patriots had both Jackson and Stephon Gilmore under contract to form arguably the NFL’s best cornerback tandem.
With the two star players no longer available, the Patriots’ cornerback group is now one collective question mark.
