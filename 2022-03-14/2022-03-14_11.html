     Chargers To Sign CB J.C. Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson is signing with the Bolts, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com tweets.
The ex-Patriot will see $40MM fully guaranteed, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Bolts did not need to give Jackson top-five corner money, it turns out.
To entice Jackson, the Chargers have agreed to give him $28MM in the deal’s first year, Rapoport adds (on Twitter).
With Jackson hitting the open market at 26, it will likely cost close to cornerback-record money to sign him.

     AP sources: Chargers, J.C. Jackson agree to 5-year contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cornerback J.C. Jackson agreed to a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers Monday, continuing the franchise's aggressive makeover of the defense.
Jackson's contract will be worth $82.5 million, including $40 million guaranteed, two people familiar with the negotiations confirmed to The Associated Press.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal can't become official until the start of the new league year on Wednesday.
Jackson became one of the top available free agents after the New England Patriots did not apply the franchise tag to him last week.
Jackson joins safety Derwin James in the secondary and upgrades a cornerback position that struggled last season.

     Summary: Louis Riddick explains how the Chargers defense will be bolstered by the addition of J.C. Jackson.
(1:03)The Los Angeles Chargers are giving former New England Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson a five-year, $82.5 million deal that includes $40 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.
Jackson, who just concluded his fourth NFL season with the Patriots, earned his first Pro Bowl selection in 2021.
He started all 17 regular-season games last season and the team's playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills.
Jackson will join safety Derwin James Jr. in the secondary and upgrade a cornerback position that struggled last season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Pro Bowl cornerback J.C. Jackson to a five-year, $82.5 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
The contract includes $28 million in the first year and $40 million over the first two, Rapoport added.
Not done bolstering their defense with Jackson, the Chargers are also expected to sign Rams defensive tackle ﻿Sebastian Joseph-Day﻿ to a three-year, $24 million deal with $15 million guaranteed, Rapoport reported.
Adding Jackson to pair with Pro Bowl safety Derwin James gives the Bolts one of the better secondaries in football.
Jackson is coming off a career year with the Patriots, tallying eight interceptions and an NFL-best 23 passes defensed to earn his first Pro Bowl nod and a second-team All-Pro selection.

     Los Angeles Chargers Sign CB J.C. Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former New England Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson has reportedly agreed to a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers, per Ian Rapoport.
Jackson got the opportunity to replace Stephon Gilmore as the Patriots' top corner in 2021, and he more than rose to the challenge.
Perhaps cornerback wasn't the Chargers' single biggest need, but they had to keep up with the AFC West's arm race somehow.
Adding the top playmaking cornerback in the league to their defense keeps the Chargers in the fight in the AFC West.
The Chargers are not standing pat – adding both Jackson and Khalil Mack to their defense in a week should be huge for their 19th-ranked pass defense from a year ago.
