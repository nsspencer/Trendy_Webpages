     Broncos' Russell Wilson in concussion protocol after hard hit vs. Chiefs, putting Week 15 status in doubt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter against the Chiefs, and was soon ruled out for the rest of the game.
Wilson took a hit on a running play in the red zone and appeared to be knocked unconscious.
Wilson slowly walked off the field under his own power with the Broncos' medical team, but he would not return.
Even with three interceptions off Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Wilson throwing three touchdowns, they were unable to keep up with Kansas City.
Now, all eyes will be on Wilson to see if he'll be able to play in Week 15 against Arizona.

     Summary: It all helped the Chiefs tally their 10th win on the year, marking the eighth-consecutive season that Coach Reid has led Kansas City to 10 or more victories.
Additionally, the Chiefs have now won 14-straight games over Denver, amassing the fifth-longest streak for any team against a single opponent in league history.
Mahomes, meanwhile, moved to 25-3 vs. AFC West opponents in his career, including a 15-0 mark in road divisional games.
Mahomes also topped 4,000 passing yards for the season in Sunday's victory, tallying his NFL-most fourth season with 4,000+ passing yards and 30+ passing touchdowns since 2018.
"Every quarterback who has played in this league a while is going to have a game like that," Reid said.

     Summary: Broncos QB Russell Wilson is shaken up after taking a big hit and does not return to the game.
So, Hackett would neither rule Wilson out for Sunday's game, nor predict whether Wilson would clear the protocol this week.
On a third-and-11 from the Chiefs' 16-yard line, Wilson pulled the ball down and scampered to the Chiefs' 2-yard line.
Wilson was taken to the injury tent on the sideline and then to the Broncos' locker room.
We can say all we want, we're 3-9, they're 9-3 and the guy is out there battling his ass off, trying to win the game," Broncos backup quarterback Brett Rypien said following Sunday's game.

Head Coach Nathaniel Hackett called Wilson's read-option call "one of the best play calls of the night," and Wilson's mobility helped spark the Broncos to their best performance of the season.
The diving effort was the latest example of Wilson's relentless pursuit to help the Broncos get back in the win column.
"I think that really allowed us to get on the ball, really try to be in attack mode.
We know when you're playing the Chiefs, they're going to continually score and they're going to continually be aggressive.

They fell to 3-8 in one-score games — including 1-7 in their last eight games decided by one score.
The total of 11 one-score games is just one off the franchise record of 12, set in 1994 and 2015.
This is notable because against non-AFC West opponents, the Broncos surrender an average of just 1.7 touchdowns per home game in that span.

The Broncos' offense put up a season-high 28 points, while the defense allowed 27 points and picked off Patrick Mahomes three times.
Defense: Josey Jewell | LB | Grade: 71.7Jewell was all over the field for the Broncos' defense and baited Mahomes into a couple of interceptions.
He had a great game clogging up the middle against a tough interior offensive line.
Then he began to turn it around, as did his unit, and the Broncos practically shut down the Chiefs' offense for the second half.
