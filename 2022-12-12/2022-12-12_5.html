     Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried refuses to testify before Senate, committee says

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022.
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is refusing to testify at a hearing this week about his company's implosion, the Senate Banking Committee said Monday.
Attorneys for the crypto platform's founder have also said Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, will not accept service of a subpoena to compel his testimony before the panel, senators said.
Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that will focus on his company's collapse.
In a joint statement, Senate Banking Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and ranking member Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said they have "offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony."

     Summary: Watch Forbes Digital Assets Director Of Research’s live interview FTX Founder Sam Bankman-FriedUntil early November former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried could do no wrong.
Save for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, nobody that young had ever gotten that rich.
But unlike other crypto titans, who have preferred to keep a low profile, Bankman-Fried’s cultivated media attention and was known to be a philanthropist who courted politicians, often via donations.
It all changed on November 2, when a leaked FTX balance sheet became public showing that his entire empire was being propped up by a crypto token, FTT, that he invented and largely controlled.
Its price crash from $26 to below $2 led to a run on FTX and ultimately its bankruptcy.

     Summary: New York CNN —Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after US prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, according to a statement from the government of the Bahamas.
“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,” wrote US attorney Damian Williams.
The New York Times, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the charges against Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.
In the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.
“There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX,” Bankman-Fried told DealBook.
