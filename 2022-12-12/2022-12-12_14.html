     Crowd boos Elon Musk after Dave Chappelle says to ‘make some noise’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The polite version is that it didn’t go quite according to plan when Elon Musk made his most recent stage appearance.
For the first couple of seconds Musk appeared ready to accept a euphoric welcome from the crowd of 18,000.
Then the booing started.
The deafening noise, he reassured his Twitter followers, had in fact been “90% cheers &amp; 10% boos”.
“A good 80% of the stadium boos,” he estimated, noting that once the jeering started Musk withered on stage and turned “into a corncob”.
