     Braves acquire star catcher Sean Murphy from Athletics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Braves acquired star catcher Sean Murphy in a three-way trade with the Oakland Athletics and Milwaukee Brewers that saw nine players switch teams, the organizations announced on Monday.
Murphy, 28, was among the most prized players on the trade market this offseason, and Atlanta -- which dealt young catcher William Contreras to Milwaukee and still has veteran Travis d'Arnaud -- pounced to get him.
In addition to moving Contreras, the Braves are sending left-handed starter Kyle Muller, right-handed starter Freddy Tarnok, veteran catcher Manny Pina and minor league right-hander Royber Salinas to the A's.
Also going to Milwaukee are right-handed relievers Joel Payamps (from Oakland) and Justin Yeager.
Atlanta's pitching depth helped land Murphy, who hit .250/.332/.426 with 18 home runs and played Gold Glove-caliber defense last season.

     Backstop swap: Murphy to ATL, Contreras to Crew in 3-way deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We definitely didn’t go into the winter thinking we had to do something behind the plate,” Anthopoulos said.
“We viewed d’Arnaud, Contreras and Manny Piña, with the DH spot, as a position of strength.
The issue is you can’t control when players come available.
You can say you don’t have a need in [2023] and pass.
But you may not have access to that player again.”

     Sean Murphy trade: Braves land catcher from A's in three-team deal; Brewers get William Contreras
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Braves acquired catcher Sean Murphy from the Oakland Athletics on Monday as part of a three-way trade that also sent All-Star William Contreras to the Milwaukee Brewers.
Since 2020, he's amassed a .235/.326/.422 slash line (113 OPS+) while averaging 14 home runs and providing top-notch defense.
To wit, Murphy ranked in the 86th percentile in framing runs last season, according to Statcast's data.
They've traded Matt Olson (also to the Braves), Matt Chapman, Chris Bassitt, Frankie Montas, and Sean Manaea during that time.
Barring another trade, incumbent regular Travis d'Arnaud likely shifts to a backup role behind Murphy while also perhaps seeing time at DH.

     Sean Murphy traded to Atlanta Braves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After months of speculation that he would be traded, the Athletics finally pulled the trigger, sending star catcher Sean Murphy to the Atlanta Braves.
Whereas Realmuto was able to bring back a top-25 prospect and a young starting catcher with promise, Oakland doesn’t receive a single player in the top-100 prospect rankings.
With the trade, Oakland has finally shipped out the last major remaining piece of their previous playoff roster, following Matt Chapman, Matt Olson, Chris Bassitt, Sean Manaea, and Frankie Montas out the door.
As for the players Oakland is receiving:Muller is the headliner of the group.
Not to be forgotten in the trade, catcher Manny Piña is now on the club as a direct Murphy replacement.
