     The 2023 Golden Globe Nominations Are Here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unbelievably enough, it’s Golden Globes season yet again.
After being pulled from the air in 2022 (more on that here), the ceremony will be hosted by Jerrod Carmichael at Los Angeles’s Beverly Hilton on Tuesday, January 10, and broadcast live on NBC.
Given the banner year for film and TV we’ve had (hello, White Lotus), it’s going to be a particularly exciting ride seeing who goes home with a statuette.
Without further ado, see below for a full list of the 2022 Golden Globe nominees.

     The Biggest Snubs and Surprises of the 2023 Golden Globe Nominations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fresh off last year’s semi-cancellation, the Golden Globes have returned to NBC’s doorstep with flowers, promising they’ve changed.
Banshees led all films with eight nominations, including a double-up in Best Supporting Actor, while Everything Everywhere placed second, its only potential sore spot coming from Stephanie Hsu failing to crack Best Supporting Actress.
’90s nostalgia ruled the Best Actress in a Drama category, where the nominees repped four non-Blondes … plus Ana de Armas!
This is a little surprising and also not at all surprising since the Golden Globes have a long history of embracing Ryan Murphy’s work.
It was nominated for best comedy, and star Jenna Ortega got a nod for best actress in a comedy as well.
