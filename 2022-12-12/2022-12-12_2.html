     Patriots RB Rhamondre Stevenson exits Monday night vs. Cardinals with ankle injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rhamondre Stevenson's stellar second season hit a speed bump on Monday night.
Stevenson suffered an ankle injury in the New England Patriots' 27-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals and was ruled out in the second half.
The Patriots' leading rusher injured his ankle in the first half and drew a questionable designation, but returned to the game briefly.
A 2021 fourth-round pick, Stevenson showed promise as a rookie with 606 yards rushing and five touchdown in 12 games.
Through 12 games this season, he'd already surpassed his yardage total from last year with 734 yards.

     Mac Jones, Patriots use dominant second half to seal win over Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots then turned an interception by rookie cornerback Marcus Jones on the ensuing Cardinals drive into a rushing touchdown.
McMillan's fumble return for a touchdown was the team's fifth non-offensive touchdown of the season, which ties the Cardinals for most in the NFL.
It seldom looks easy for the offense, while the defense delivered the key plays to help the Patriots pull away in the second half.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: The Patriots held the Cardinals to 1-for-4 on fourth down, improving their standing as the league's No.
With the Cardinals' offense laboring all season, the emergence of another playmaker could pay dividends for McCoy going forward.

     Summary: That fumble resulted in a Raekwon McMillan fumble-return touchdown, putting the Patriots ahead in what was previously a tie game.
This stuff isn't just a coincidence, but symptomatic of everything that has been wrong with the Cardinals this season.
New England entered Monday night owning an 0-3 record in exclusive window games this season, losing on Monday Night Football, Thanksgiving and Thursday Night Football in 2022.
His plus-35 rushing yards over expected are the second-most on a single carry for the Patriots this season.
NFL Research: Josh Uche's three-sack performance gave him 10 sacks since Week 8, the most in the NFL in that span.

     Summary: That wasn't even the worst part of their 27-13 loss to the Patriots on Monday night.
Flushed out of the pocket, Murray took off to the right and tried to juke a Patriots defender.
Players from both teams surrounded Murray before he was carted off the field holding a towel to his face.
The Cardinals had an uneven start to the season and the loss to the Patriots was their fifth in six games.
The 36-year-old McCoy had a 1-1 record as the team's quarterback when Murray was out for two games last month.
