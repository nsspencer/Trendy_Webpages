     Cardinals' Kyler Murray carted off field vs. Patriots with non-contact injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray had to be carted off the field after just the third play from scrimmage against the New England Patriots.
After being evaluated on the field, Murray was moved to the cart where his entire team consoled him as he put a towel over his head in clear disappointment.
This isn’t the first injury for Murray this season, as he was forced to miss two games recently because of a hamstring strain.
But even when on the field, Murray hasn’t been his normal self.
All the Cardinals’ struggles this season can’t fall on Murray’s shoulders, as fingers can be pointed in multiple directions.

NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the fear is Murray suffered a serious injury, and an MRI and other tests are forthcoming.
