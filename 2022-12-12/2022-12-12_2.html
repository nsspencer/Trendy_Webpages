     Mac Jones, Patriots use dominant second half to seal win over Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots then turned an interception by rookie cornerback Marcus Jones on the ensuing Cardinals drive into a rushing touchdown.
McMillan's fumble return for a touchdown was the team's fifth non-offensive touchdown of the season, which ties the Cardinals for most in the NFL.
It seldom looks easy for the offense, while the defense delivered the key plays to help the Patriots pull away in the second half.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: The Patriots held the Cardinals to 1-for-4 on fourth down, improving their standing as the league's No.
With the Cardinals' offense laboring all season, the emergence of another playmaker could pay dividends for McCoy going forward.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots traveled out west with the hopes of returning with a 8-6 record and control of their fate in the playoff picture.
Despite battling a slew of injuries, the Patriots dug deep and managed to snag a pivotal road win over the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium in a primetime Monday Night Football game.
But the next man up mentality proved too strong to be outdone for a Patriots team that desperately needed a win.
However, they did what they had to do and finished strong with a victory over a Cardinals team thatâ€™s clearly better than their record indicates.
Here are the winners and losers from the game.

     Patriots RB Rhamondre Stevenson exits Monday night vs. Cardinals with ankle injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rhamondre Stevenson's stellar second season hit a speed bump on Monday night.
Stevenson suffered an ankle injury in the New England Patriots' 27-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals and was ruled out in the second half.
The Patriots' leading rusher injured his ankle in the first half and drew a questionable designation, but returned to the game briefly.
A 2021 fourth-round pick, Stevenson showed promise as a rookie with 606 yards rushing and five touchdown in 12 games.
Through 12 games this season, he'd already surpassed his yardage total from last year with 734 yards.

     Summary: That fumble resulted in a Raekwon McMillan fumble-return touchdown, putting the Patriots ahead in what was previously a tie game.
This stuff isn't just a coincidence, but symptomatic of everything that has been wrong with the Cardinals this season.
New England entered Monday night owning an 0-3 record in exclusive window games this season, losing on Monday Night Football, Thanksgiving and Thursday Night Football in 2022.
His plus-35 rushing yards over expected are the second-most on a single carry for the Patriots this season.
NFL Research: Josh Uche's three-sack performance gave him 10 sacks since Week 8, the most in the NFL in that span.
