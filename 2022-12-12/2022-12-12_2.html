    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hats off to a solid effort for the Denver Broncos, but they fell short for the tenth time in 13 games on Sunday.
The Broncos lost 34-28 to their division rivals, the Kansas City Chiefs.
Russell Wilson had arguably one of his best games in a Broncos uniform, throwing for 247yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game with a concussion.
Backup quarterback Brett Rypien came in to relieve Wilson and threw a touchdown to bring the game within six, but it wasn’t enough.
Usually, Twitter isn’t kind to them, especially after a loss.

     Summary: He hit the 50-yard mark six times in his previous 28 starts — an average of once every 4.67 games.
They fell to 3-8 in one-score games — including 1-7 in their last eight games decided by one score.
The total of 11 one-score games is just one off the franchise record of 12, set in 1994 and 2015.
This is notable because against non-AFC West opponents, the Broncos surrender an average of just 1.7 touchdowns per home game in that span.
Denver surrenders an average of 29.5 points per game to division rivals since 2020, compared with 18.1 to everyone else.

Mahomes also topped 4,000 passing yards for the season in Sunday's victory, tallying his NFL-most fourth season with 4,000+ passing yards and 30+ passing touchdowns since 2018.

     Summary: Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson has entered the NFL’s concussion protocol after being knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs.
There are five phases in the protocol that Wilson would need to pass through in order to be cleared for this week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals.
If Wilson is not cleared before Sunday, Brett Rypien will start in his place.
Broncos wide receiver Kendall Hinton (hamstring) and outside linebacker Jacob Martin (knee) also left Sunday’s game with injuries.
We’ll know more on the injury front when Denver returns to the practice field and releases an updated injury report on Wednesday.

     Summary: Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter against the Chiefs, and was soon ruled out for the rest of the game.
Wilson took a hit on a running play in the red zone and appeared to be knocked unconscious.
Wilson slowly walked off the field under his own power with the Broncos' medical team, but he would not return.
Even with three interceptions off Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Wilson throwing three touchdowns, they were unable to keep up with Kansas City.
Now, all eyes will be on Wilson to see if he'll be able to play in Week 15 against Arizona.

     Summary: DENVER (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs own the Denver Broncos — even when Patrick Mahomes throws three interceptions and a 27-0 lead turns into a nail-biter.
Mahomes counterbalanced his mistakes with a trio of touchdown passes and the Chiefs (10-3) outlasted the Broncos 34-28 on Sunday.
Russell Wilson left with a concussion early in the fourth quarter as Denver (3-10) lost to Kansas City for the 14th consecutive time.
Jeudy’s third TD came from backup Brett Rypien, making it 34-28 shortly after the Broncos lost Wilson to a concussion on a 14-yard scramble to the Chiefs 2.
Mahomes threw for 352 yards and one of his three touchdowns was a no-look hook pass to Jerick McKinnon, who had two TD catches.
