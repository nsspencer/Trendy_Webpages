     Christopher Nolan Says 'Oppenheimer' Is "One of the Most Challenging Projects" in His Career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One thing of which you could never accuse Christopher Nolan is shirking when it comes to special effects.
You can't exactly just get some plutonium and create an atomic bomb (unless you're Doctor Emmett Brown, of course).
And one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever taken on in terms of the scale of it, and in terms of encountering the breadth of Oppenheimer’s story.
"We’re trying to tell the story of somebody’s life, and their journey through personal history and larger-scale history," said Nolan.
Oppenheimer opens in cinemas on July 21, 2023, and you can see the trailer down below.

     Christopher Nolan recreated an atomic test ‘without computer graphics’ for new movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christopher Nolan is hard at work promoting his next film, Oppenheimer, a biopic all about the life of famed nuclear scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer.
This means that he needs a new ridiculous practical effect to brag about, and he may have outdone himself in truly apocalyptic fashion this time.
According to an interview with TotalFilm magazine, Nolan says he recreated an atomic test without “computer graphics.”Now, does this mean that Nolan built a prototype nuclear device to detonate at Los Alamos?
But the best part of his increasingly ridiculous commitment to (mostly) practical effects is that you really can’t rule much out.
Nolan technically just says that he and his team “recreated the Trinity test,” which could mean just the conditions, or the feel, but not the explosion itself.

     Christopher Nolan Used Practical Effects for the Atomic Bomb Scene in Oppenheimer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The director of The Dark Knight trilogy is known for his use of practical effects, and continues this tradition in his upcoming biographical drama.
Christopher Nolan has even gone so far as to use practical effects to re-create the first-ever detonation of a nuclear bomb in his upcoming film, Oppenheimer.
Nolan is known for his monumental practical effects, having bought and crashed a real Boeing 747 for the plane scene in Tenet.
The zero-gravity scene in Inception and the truck flip in The Dark Knight are also notable for their use of practical effects rather than computer-animated ones.
Oppenheimer is directed and written by Christopher Nolan, who produces the film alongside Emma Thomas and Charles Roven.

     Christopher Nolan Recreated a Nuclear Weapon Explosion Without CGI, Developed New IMAX Film for ‘Oppenheimer’: ‘A Huge Challenge’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christopher Nolan revealed to Total Film magazine that he recreated the first nuclear weapon detonation without CGI effects as part of the production for his new movie “Oppenehimer.” The film stars longtime Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, a leading figure of the Manhattan Project and the creation the atomic bomb during World War II.
Nolan has always favored practical effects over VFX (he even blew up a real Boeing 747 for “Tenet”), so it’s no surprise he went the practical route when it came time to film a nuclear weapon explosion.
“I think recreating the Trinity test [the first nuclear weapon detonation, in New Mexico] without the use of computer graphics was a huge challenge to take on,” Nolan said.
“We challenged the people at Kodak photochem to make this work for us,” Nolan said.
For the first time ever, we were able to shoot IMAX film in black-and-white.

     Christopher Nolan Makes His Nuclear Bombs the Old-fashioned Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photo by Toni Anne Barson/FilmMagic and Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty ImagesWhen Christopher Nolan made his previous film, 2020 buddy-time-cop flick Tenet, the action centered around a weapon of mass destruction the likes of which the world had ever seen, one so bad that it would wipe out all of humanity past and future, even Elizabeth Debicki’s son.
Nolan’s next film is the thematically aligned, though less fantastical, Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy and telling the story of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb.
Nolan aims to use practical effects in Oppenheimer, even for large-scale detonations.
“I think recreating the Trinity test without the use of computer graphics was a huge challenge to take on,” Nolan tells Total Film, referring to the first nuclear-weapons test at the Trinity site in New Mexico.
Nolan doesn’t specify how, exactly, his team will pull off this non-computer-generated explosion, but we expect it has something to do with papier-mâché and baking soda.
