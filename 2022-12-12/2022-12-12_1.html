     Cardinals QB Kyler Murray carted off field vs. Patriots with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just three snaps into Monday night's game, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact knee injury and was subsequently carted off the field.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the fear is Murray suffered a serious injury, and an MRI and other tests are forthcoming.
Following the Cardinals' 27-13 loss to the New England Patriots, head coach Kliff Kingsbury said it "doesn't look good," but the team would know more in the morning.
A two-time Pro Bowler in his fourth season, Murray missed two games earlier this season with a hamstring injury and missed three a year ago with an ankle ailment.
"It's tough to see a player like Murray get hurt," Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cardinals season was not lost on the third play of Monday night’s game when quarterback Kyler Murray’s right knee gave way as he tried to cut to avoid a tackler.
But whatever interest remained in the 2022 season was carted off along with Murray, who left with a towel covering his head and face.
“Doesn’t look good,” said coach Kliff Kingsbury, who joined the Cardinals medical team around Murray on the field.
Big things, small things and in-between things.
What would the passing game look like with Murray, Hopkins, Brown and Rondale Moore all healthy?

     Bickley: Kyler Murray injury is cruelest blow of Arizona Cardinals' season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GLENDALE — A season full of hard knocks saved its cruelest blow for Kyler Murray.
The Cardinals quarterback was felled by a non-contact knee injury in the first 71 seconds of a 27-13 loss to the Patriots.
But bad football teams find a way to lose, just like bad football coaches find ways to fail their team.
Entering Monday’s game, the most important priority in Arizona was the elevation of Murray, a quarterback who has regressed after signing a $230 million contract in the offseason.
Ideally, the rest of the regular season would’ve been a chance for Murray to get right, to build confidence and momentum entering the offseason.

     Summary: "As a group we have to buckle down and play well together, practice well together, and finish these last four games out," McCoy said.
I know how much he cares about the game, I know how hard he works.
I think I'll be able to put my arm around him with this because I've dealt with many in my career."
