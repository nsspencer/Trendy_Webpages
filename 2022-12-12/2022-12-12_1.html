     Cardinals' Kyler Murray carted off field vs. Patriots with non-contact injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray had to be carted off the field after just the third play from scrimmage against the New England Patriots.
After being evaluated on the field, Murray was moved to the cart where his entire team consoled him as he put a towel over his head in clear disappointment.
This isn’t the first injury for Murray this season, as he was forced to miss two games recently because of a hamstring strain.
But even when on the field, Murray hasn’t been his normal self.
All the Cardinals’ struggles this season can’t fall on Murray’s shoulders, as fingers can be pointed in multiple directions.

     Summary: Scrambling for three yards on the third play of the game Monday night, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact right knee injury and had to be carted off the field.
Murray was officially downgraded to out for the balance of the game, but now the concern will be how severe the injury is, whether there are any ligaments involved, and what that would eventually mean for his long-term status.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just three snaps into Monday night's game, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact knee injury and was subsequently carted off the field.
Murray scrambled and went down following a 3-yard run on the third play from scrimmage.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the fear is Murray suffered a serious injury, and an MRI and other tests are forthcoming.
A two-time Pro Bowler in his fourth season, Murray missed two games earlier this season with a hamstring injury and missed three a year ago with an ankle ailment.
On Monday, the scene was far different and far more worrisome.

     Cardinals' Kyler Murray carted off vs. Patriots with knee injury; reportedly feared to have torn ACL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just three plays into the prime-time matchup, however, Arizona lost its quarterback, Kyler Murray, to a non-contact knee injury.
Carted to the locker room and replaced by veteran backup Colt McCoy, Murray is believed to have suffered a torn ACL, according to Mike Jurecki.
The Cardinals initially ruled Murray questionable to return, though the QB looked dispirited as he was carted off, covering his head with a towel as teammates consoled him.
Early in the second quarter, the Cardinals officially ruled Murray out, leaving McCoy to fill in for the remainder of the contest.
A torn ACL would sideline the QB for the remainder of 2022 and potentially part of the 2023 campaign considering such damage typically requires nine to 12 months of rehabilitation.
