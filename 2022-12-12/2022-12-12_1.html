     Inactive Analysis: Patriots OTs Trent Brown, Yodny Cajuste Officially Active for Monday Night Football
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a positive note, the Patriots will have offensive lineman Trent Brown (illness) and Yodny Cajuste (calf/back).
Here's the estimated starting offensive line: LT Trent Brown, LG Cole Strange, C David Andrews, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Yodny Cajuste.
If Brown or Cajuste can't play the whole game, expect Connor McDermott to get some run at offensive tackle.
Regardless of who is that immediate option to beat the blitz, Jones will need that safety valve to handle the pressure.
If the Patriots can keep Jones clean long enough to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary, there will be open space against an aggressive Cardinals defense.

     Summary: That fumble resulted in a Raekwon McMillan fumble-return touchdown, putting the Patriots ahead in what was previously a tie game.
This stuff isn't just a coincidence, but symptomatic of everything that has been wrong with the Cardinals this season.
New England entered Monday night owning an 0-3 record in exclusive window games this season, losing on Monday Night Football, Thanksgiving and Thursday Night Football in 2022.
His plus-35 rushing yards over expected are the second-most on a single carry for the Patriots this season.
NFL Research: Josh Uche's three-sack performance gave him 10 sacks since Week 8, the most in the NFL in that span.

     Summary: Rhamondre Stevenson's stellar second season hit a speed bump on Monday night.
Stevenson suffered an ankle injury in the New England Patriots' 27-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals and was ruled out in the second half.
The Patriots' leading rusher injured his ankle in the first half and drew a questionable designation, but returned to the game briefly.
A 2021 fourth-round pick, Stevenson showed promise as a rookie with 606 yards rushing and five touchdown in 12 games.
Through 12 games this season, he'd already surpassed his yardage total from last year with 734 yards.
