     Summary: Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray had to be carted off the field after just the third play from scrimmage against the New England Patriots.
After being evaluated on the field, Murray was moved to the cart where his entire team consoled him as he put a towel over his head in clear disappointment.
This isn’t the first injury for Murray this season, as he was forced to miss two games recently because of a hamstring strain.
But even when on the field, Murray hasn’t been his normal self.
All the Cardinals’ struggles this season can’t fall on Murray’s shoulders, as fingers can be pointed in multiple directions.

     Summary: Scrambling for three yards on the third play of the game Monday night, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact right knee injury and had to be carted off the field.
Murray was officially downgraded to out for the balance of the game, but now the concern will be how severe the injury is, whether there are any ligaments involved, and what that would eventually mean for his long-term status.
