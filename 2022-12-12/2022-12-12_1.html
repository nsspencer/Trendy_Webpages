     Summary: That fumble resulted in a Raekwon McMillan fumble-return touchdown, putting the Patriots ahead in what was previously a tie game.
This stuff isn't just a coincidence, but symptomatic of everything that has been wrong with the Cardinals this season.
New England entered Monday night owning an 0-3 record in exclusive window games this season, losing on Monday Night Football, Thanksgiving and Thursday Night Football in 2022.
His plus-35 rushing yards over expected are the second-most on a single carry for the Patriots this season.
NFL Research: Josh Uche's three-sack performance gave him 10 sacks since Week 8, the most in the NFL in that span.

     Summary: Jones and Parker would not return while Stevenson would give it a go but ultimately return to the locker room for the remained of the contest.
With limited depth at both corner and running back, Marcus Jones and Kevin Harris saw their roles elevated in the game while rookie receiver Tyquan Thornton also saw his snaps increase.
Harris took advantage of the opportunity early, scoring the first touchdown of both the game and his career to give the Patriots a first-half 7-3 lead.
The touchdown also gave the Patriots their first red zone touchdown since Week 9.
He'd later add on a touchdown score of his own in the fourth quarter.
