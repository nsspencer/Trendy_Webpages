     Rookie Rally: Young Patriots Power Crucial Win Over Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even though the New England Patriots offense didn't right the ship in Week 14, their rookies bailed them out and put them back into the playoff picture.
The New England Patriots' offense continued to struggle in Week 14 despite finally connecting on a couple of big plays downfield against a lackluster opponent.
Despite a slow start to the game for the Patriots' (7-6) offense, the young guys stepped up and stole the show.
The Patriots' offense is still something to be desired.

     Mac Jones, Patriots use dominant second half to seal win over Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots then turned an interception by rookie cornerback Marcus Jones on the ensuing Cardinals drive into a rushing touchdown.
McMillan's fumble return for a touchdown was the team's fifth non-offensive touchdown of the season, which ties the Cardinals for most in the NFL.
It seldom looks easy for the offense, while the defense delivered the key plays to help the Patriots pull away in the second half.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: The Patriots held the Cardinals to 1-for-4 on fourth down, improving their standing as the league's No.
With the Cardinals' offense laboring all season, the emergence of another playmaker could pay dividends for McCoy going forward.

     Summary: That fumble resulted in a Raekwon McMillan fumble-return touchdown, putting the Patriots ahead in what was previously a tie game.
This stuff isn't just a coincidence, but symptomatic of everything that has been wrong with the Cardinals this season.
New England entered Monday night owning an 0-3 record in exclusive window games this season, losing on Monday Night Football, Thanksgiving and Thursday Night Football in 2022.
His plus-35 rushing yards over expected are the second-most on a single carry for the Patriots this season.
NFL Research: Josh Uche's three-sack performance gave him 10 sacks since Week 8, the most in the NFL in that span.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jones and Parker would not return while Stevenson would give it a go but ultimately return to the locker room for the remained of the contest.
With limited depth at both corner and running back, Marcus Jones and Kevin Harris saw their roles elevated in the game while rookie receiver Tyquan Thornton also saw his snaps increase.
Harris took advantage of the opportunity early, scoring the first touchdown of both the game and his career to give the Patriots a first-half 7-3 lead.
The touchdown also gave the Patriots their first red zone touchdown since Week 9.
He'd later add on a touchdown score of his own in the fourth quarter.
