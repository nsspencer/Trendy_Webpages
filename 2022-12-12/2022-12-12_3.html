     Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray carted off field with knee injury, later ruled out against Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals' season appeared to go from pretty bad to much worse Monday night.
1 pick of the 2019 draft was in obvious pain before being carted off the field.
Despite the optics, the Cardinals initially characterized Murray's return as questionable with a knee injury.
Murray came into Monday's contest with a career-worst 87.1 passer rating and has often appeared demonstrably at odds with coach Kliff Kingsbury.
The team is tracking toward its worst record since Kingsbury's debut in 2019, when Arizona went 5-10-1, and entered Monday only a half-game out of last place in the NFC West.

     Summary: Just three snaps into Monday night's game, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact knee injury and was subsequently carted off the field.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the fear is Murray suffered a serious injury, and an MRI and other tests are forthcoming.

You hate to see that," Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury told Lisa Salters during the game.
A two-time Pro Bowler in his fourth season, Murray missed two games earlier this season with a hamstring injury and missed three a year ago with an ankle ailment.

     Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffers non-contact knee injury against Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scrambling for three yards on the third play of the game Monday night, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray suffered a non-contact right knee injury and had to be carted off the field.
It is likely the biggest blow in a season full of them, and fitting it came in a loss, with the Cardinals falling to the New England Patriots, 27-13, at State Farm Stadium.
Murray was officially downgraded to out for the balance of the game, but now the concern will be how severe the injury is, whether there are any ligaments involved, and what that would eventually mean for his long-term status.
Colt McCoy, who came in to replace Murray, is now the starter, with Trace McSorley as the backup.
