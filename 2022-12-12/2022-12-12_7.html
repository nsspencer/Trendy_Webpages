     Scientists hail nuclear fusion ‘milestone’ — but it may take decades to see its benefits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since the 1950s, supporters of the technology have claimed that fusion could someday produce energy that’s cheap and essentially limitless.
Even private developers of fusion energy say the breakthrough — while significant — is consistent with what the industry expected and doesn’t necessarily speed up the timeline for commercial deployment.
In 2012, the National Ignition Facility’s director predicted that fusion technology would be commercially viable in 10 years, meaning about now.
Questions also remain on how safe fusion reactors would be, given that tritium, one of the main fuels in fusion reactors, is radioactive and the fusion process itself produces dangerous amounts of heat and pressure, Lyman said.
The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act of 2019 directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to create a licensing framework for advanced reactors — a definition that includes fusion — by 2027.

     In a breakthrough experiment, nuclear fusion finally makes more energy than it uses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers with the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, Calif., have ignited controlled nuclear fusion that resulted in the net production of energy.
The fission reactors used to generate nuclear energy rely on heavy atoms, like uranium, to release energy when they break down into lighter atoms, including some that are radioactive.
Controlled nuclear fusion, on the other hand, doesn’t produce such long-lived radioactive waste, but it’s technically much harder to achieve in the first place.
In nuclear fusion, light atoms fuse together to create heavier ones.
But this latest fusion burst still didn’t produce enough energy to run the laser power supplies and other systems of the NIF experiment.

     What is nuclear fusion?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s anticipated Granholm will announce federal scientists successfully achieved a net energy gain in a nuclear fusion reaction for the first time.
Government scientists are expected to make a major announcement Tuesday regarding a breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, according to a report from the Financial Times.
Nuclear fusion is the same energy that powers the sun and stars, and is created when nuclei from two light atoms combine at high speeds.
Nuclear fusion also uses fewer resources than other clean energy options like solar or wind power.
Scientists have been investigating nuclear fusion since the 1950s, and despite the anticipated breakthrough, the technology is still years away from commercial implementation.

     Breakthrough in nuclear fusion could mean ‘near-limitless energy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest to unlock a “near-limitless, safe, clean” source of energy: they have got more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in.
However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition.
The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated.
And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves.
“The efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,” he said.

     Summary: A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape.
Now that we know how nuclear fusion will benefit the environment, let’s shift our attention to the stocks that are very likely to enable the process to benefit investors’ pockets.
Amazon (AMZN)At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion.
Companies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years.
Takeaway: Chevron and Amazon May Benefit Significantly from Nuclear FusionIt has been established that despite the recent breakthrough, nuclear fusion technology still has some time until it is widely commercialized.
