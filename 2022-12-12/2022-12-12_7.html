     Cris Collinsworth clarifies Tua Tagovailoa concussion remark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late in the third quarter, Collinsworth praised Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa as he fought through two defenders while scrambling for the first down.
“Watch this one, for a guy who’s been knocked out twice this season with concussions,” Collinsworth said of Tagovailoa.
Tagovailoa, however, returned to the game after passing concussion protocol and was later diagnosed with a back injury.
Outrage ensued over the fact that Tagovailoa was able to start just four days after suffering an apparent head injury against the Bills.
And more than two months later, Collinsworth appeared to get a stern reminder that Tagovailoa’s head incident against Buffalo resulted in a back injury, not a concussion.

     Tua Tagovailoa says Dolphins offense 'not up to our standard' in loss to Chargers: 'Very disappointing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tua Tagovailoa authored the worst game of his career in Sunday night's 23-17 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, unable to find the mark and getting outdueled by Justin Herbert.
"It's very disappointing for us to go out there as an offense and kind of show what we showed," Tagovailoa said.
"That's not up to our standard, that's not how we play football here, and that was very disappointing."
Tua's 35.7 completion percentage was the worst by a Dolphins QB since David Woodley (31.0) in Week 15, 1980, per NFL Research.
Tagovailoa struggled from the outset against a Chargers defense missing a host of key pieces.

     NFL star Justin Herbert praised as "prime Tom Brady" while Tua Tagovailoa slammed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into the 2020 season, the two top quarterbacks in the class has been Herbert from Oregon, and Tua Tagovailoa, who ousted Jalen Hurts as Alabama's starting quarterback.
Herbert and Tagovailoa would continue to split opinions, but it would be the Hawaiian who went first, going to Miami at five with Herbert drafted by the LA Chargers at six.
Speaking on The Volume, John Middlekauff said: "Tua, for the last two weeks, has been horrendous, he's been God awful, terrible.
"The MVP of the Miami Dolphins was never Tua, it was Tyreek Hill [who is] I dunno, one of the greatest f****** wide receivers in the history of the league.
When you see him and he's on, like tonight, that's like Josh Allen, that's like Patrick Mahomes, that's like Tom Brady in his prime.

     Summary: Tua Tagovailoa was not good in the Dolphins’ Week 13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, a defeat that halted Miami’s win streak at five games.
Tagovailoa didn’t throw any interceptions against the Chargers, unlike his two-pick performance against the Niners.
of his 28 pass attempts for a mere 145 yards with a touchdown in the Fins’ 23-17 loss at SoFi Stadium.
After Miami’s second consecutive loss, Tagovailoa didn’t sugarcoat the brutal offensive showing.
“It’s very disappointing for us to go out there as an offense and kind of show what we showed,” Tagovailoa told reporters, per NFL.com.

     Questions about Tua Tagovailoa Have Returned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins came out to Los Angeles and were demolished by the Chargers yesterday and Tua Tagovailoa didn’t look great in the loss.
Doug Gottlieb was never completely sold on Tagovialoa’s skillset despite the progress he had made, and it appears he’s sliding back into his old ways.
Whether his early season success was earned or just a flash in the pan, it’s fair to wonder if he can lead the Dolphins to postseason success with his inconsistent play.
Doug Gottlieb: “All the questions about Tua are very much back.
These last two games have...Either his confidence runs hot and cold, and when he’s not confident he can’t hit the broad side of a barn, or he’s just not that good...”

     Sean Payton Has Brutally Honest Tua Tagovailoa Admission
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)Because of his size and accuracy, Tua Tagovailoa has often been compared to Drew Brees.
Sean Payton disagrees with that comparison.
The former New Orleans Saints head coach appeared on The Herd with Colin Cowherd after Tagovailoa struggled in Sunday night's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.
Payton added that Tagovailoa might not be as strong as his old star quarterback, but he didn't ask Brees to run an RPO offense that Tua steers for the Miami Dolphins.
Even if he's not a left-handed Brees, Tagovailoa has excelled for the 8-5 Dolphins this season.

     The real winner of Justin Herbert vs. Tua Tagovailoa was Brandon Staley’s defense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The war for the soul of football Twitter was fought on Sunday night between the Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.
However, as the dust settled on the game, it was Brandon Staley and the Chargers defense that stole the show.
In man coverage, there’s no man to put in conflict, because they’re guarding a man.
The Dolphins slide their protection to the right, expecting the left side of the line to sort out anything weird that happens.
The Niners game for Miami could be washed away as a bad game, but this Chargers game just feels odd watching it over again.

While Herbert sizzled, Tagovailoa and the Miami offense performed like they were stuck in mud most of the night.
