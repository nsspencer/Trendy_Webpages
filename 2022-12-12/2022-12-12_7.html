     The Element Of High On Life That Has Critics Divided
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to the "High on Life" Metacritic score, there is a lot to love about this first-person shooter.
However, some critics have argued that the comedy in "High on Life" isn't for everyone.
For example, Chris Carter at Destructoid wasn't very impressed with "High on Life" overall, awarding it a 5.5 out of 10.
This wasn't a case of not enjoying Squanch's sensibilities, either, as Carter noted that he thought "Trover Saves the Universe" was much more successful in the comedy department.
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell at Eurogamer was another critic who didn't enjoy the humor of "High on Life," calling it a "botched attempt to rebottle 'Rick and Morty' as a first-person shooter."

Whether they play it through Xbox Game Pass or not, gamers should make it a point to play High on Life ASAP.

     Review: High on Life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn’t a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.
Like many Roiland joints, High on Life is filled with twists, meta humor, and Easter eggs.
Where High on Life really falters is enemy variety.
One big issue with High on Life (and where the game mainly slipped for me) is jank.
As-is, High on Life is great weekend Game Pass pickup, and something to go into with caution if you’re a fan of Roiland’s work.

     High on Life Review: A Steady Buzz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guns are just a tool for killing in every other shooter, but that’s not how it is in developer Squanch Games’ High on Life.
High on Life falls into some of the same comedic pitfalls as Roiland’s other work, but that perspective has led to one unique first-person shooter.
M16s don’t usually blabber or shoot out slime, either, which is another avenue where High on Life’s weirdness shines through.
Its brand of comedy might be a bit played, but High on Life still has quite an identity.

It's on this side of Rick and Morty that High on Life draws most frequently.

Though High on Life will largely be judged on its humor, its strengths as an adventure game shouldn’t be overlooked.
