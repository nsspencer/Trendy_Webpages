     Zion Williamson, Pelicans look like true contender in West after beating Suns again for seventh straight win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Sunday's victory, the Pelicans improved to 18-8 and now sit alone atop the Western Conference with a one-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies.
Paul and Co. had their chance at revenge on Sunday, but couldn't take it, in large part due to another contentious moment involving Paul and Williamson.
Williamson continued his impressive run of form, finishing with 35 points, eight rebounds and three assists on 14-of-21 from the field.
This was his second consecutive 35-point game and his fourth 30-point outing during the Pelicans' winning streak.
With Brandon Ingram sidelined for this run, Williamson has become a true No.

     Summary: Like Jose Alvarado, Marshall raises the energy and competitive spirit at every practice.
This team enjoys being around each other so much because guys like Marshall and Alvarado make it fun to come to work.
However, the Pelicans have developed arguably the deepest bench in the NBA by finding players like Marshall on the scrap heap.
But Pelicans coach Willie Green values Marshall because, as he has said on multiple occasions, Marshall had to earn his way into the league.
Fans should expect him to go to Marshall over Murphy or Daniels in certain situations, which may surprise some.

     Summary: Zion Williamson watched his second 3-pointer go down, turned toward the Pelicans’ defensive end and threw a triumphant punch into the air.
Adding perimeter scoring to his already formidable play in the paint, Williamson scored 35-points for a second straight game, and New Orleans beat the short-handed Phoenix Suns 129-124 in overtime on Dec. 11 for their seventh straight victory.
"The Suns, they’ve earned their resume; they’re a great team," Williamson said.
Paul initially appeared to have drawn a foul on a missed 3-pointer, but the Pelicans challenged the call.
... Brandon Ingram (left foot) missed his seventh straight game and fellow wing player Herb Jones (left ankle) missed his fifth straight.
