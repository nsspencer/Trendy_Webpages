     Tom Cruise told Emily Blunt to 'stop being such a p***y' about 'Edge of Tomorrow' battle-suits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's no secret that Tom Cruise's endurance threshold is much higher than that of the average actor in Hollywood.
Perhaps he's forgotten that the rest of us aren't in perfect shape, because when Emily Blunt complained about the weight of the battle-suits in Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise basically told her to suck it up and quit whining.
I would love it, Doug Liman would love it, Tom would love it.
"It's one of these things where if Tom, Emily and I were to say, 'We're ready to pull the trigger on this script,' it's Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, the film gets made," Liman remarked to Collider several months prior.
If you can get Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt to commit to the movie, it's going to happen."

“And you know, when you hear the word tactile, you’re like, that sounds nice and cozy,” Blunt continued.
It was so heavy.”Blunt said the first time she put on the suit she started to cry in front of her co-star.
OK?” Blunt relayed, which led Hayes to gasp and Bateman to joke, “Nice, good for Tom.”“And I did laugh and then we got through it,” Blunt said.
