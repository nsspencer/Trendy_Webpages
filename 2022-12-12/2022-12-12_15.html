     Summary: Whether she’s stepping out of the darkness or delivering her hopeful monologue about the robins, Sandy is the score’s ray of light, which contrasts with the melancholy glow of Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini), whose crooning of the title tune is accompanied in the film by Badalamenti himself on the piano.
This landmark began a decades-long teaming of director and composer that rivaled the genius of Hitchcock and Herrmann, Spielberg and Williams, Burton and Elfman.
“We have sex from the trumpet, fear from the synth and rock ’n’ roll from the plucking bass,” he wrote.
“What do you get when you mix sex, fear and rock ’n’ roll together?
You get Laura Palmer.”

     Angelo Badalamenti, ‘Twin Peaks’ composer and David Lynch collaborator, dead at 85
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Angelo Badalamenti, the composer and David Lynch collaborator best known for scoring “Twin Peaks,” “Wild at Heart” and “Blue Velvet,” has died.
“The family of composer Angelo Badalamenti confirms that he passed away December 11 of natural causes surrounded by his family,” Laura Engel of Kraft-Engel Management, his agent and dear friend since 2005, told The Times on Monday.
Badalamenti stayed on to compose the entire orchestral score for “Blue Velvet” and appeared in the movie as a piano player under the professional name Andy Badale.
When his music was combined with Lynch’s “Blue Velvet,” audiences got to experience a gorgeous melody atop a disturbing, abstract underlay.
The composer also won the 1991 Grammy for pop instrumental performance for his “Twin Peaks Theme,” beating Kenny G, Phil Collins, Quincy Jones and Stanley Jordan.

The hair on his arms was up and he had tears in his eyes: ‘I see Twin Peaks.

     Summary: Angelo Badalamenti, the composer best known for creating otherworldly scores for many David Lynch productions, from “Blue Velvet” and “Twin Peaks” to “Mulholland Drive,” has died.
During the summers he would play piano at resorts in the Catskills for the Borscht Belt acts.
“They were shooting down in North Carolina, and so they flew me down to meet with Isabella and to see what I could do.
When I got there, we went into a little room with just Isabella and me and a piano.
When it came to how he approached his scores, he said he was always at the service of the director's vision.

     Angelo Badalamenti, composer of unsettling film soundtracks, dies at 85

     Summary: Mr. Badalamenti scored nearly 50 films and worked with directors including Paul Schrader and Danny Boyle.
“He’s got this musical soul, and melodies are always floating around inside,” Lynch told People magazine in 1990.
In 1985 Mr. Badalamenti received a phone call from Fred C. Caruso, who was producing “Blue Velvet,” Lynch’s innovative exploration of suburban secrets and murder.
And in the wake of “Twin Peaks” fever, he was invited to write the opening “torch theme” for the Barcelona Summer Olympics in 1992.
“We just adore each other,” Mr. Badalamenti told a reporter in 2017.
