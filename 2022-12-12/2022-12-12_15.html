     US scientists may have reached a breakthrough in nuclear fusion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuclear fusion — when two hydrogen nuclei combine to form a single helium atom, releasing a burst of energy — is a prospect that has both tantalized and eluded scientists for decades.
The Department of Energy said it will announce a “major scientific breakthrough” on Tuesday at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
“The goal was to do essentially what they have just done,” he said, adding this approach is one of a few leading methods to producing nuclear fusion.
Efforts to successfully create a net gain nuclear fusion reaction have spanned the public and private sectors.
According to a 2022 survey conducted by the Fusion Industry Association, more than 30 companies are working on developing nuclear fusion technology, representing over $4.8 billion in funding.

     Breakthrough in nuclear fusion could mean ‘near-limitless energy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest to unlock a “near-limitless, safe, clean” source of energy: they have got more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in.
However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition.
The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated.
And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves.
“The efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,” he said.

     What is nuclear fusion?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s anticipated Granholm will announce federal scientists successfully achieved a net energy gain in a nuclear fusion reaction for the first time.
Government scientists are expected to make a major announcement Tuesday regarding a breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, according to a report from the Financial Times.
Nuclear fusion is the same energy that powers the sun and stars, and is created when nuclei from two light atoms combine at high speeds.
Nuclear fusion also uses fewer resources than other clean energy options like solar or wind power.
Scientists have been investigating nuclear fusion since the 1950s, and despite the anticipated breakthrough, the technology is still years away from commercial implementation.

     Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough to Supercharge Chevron, Amazon — Here’s How
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape.
Chevron (CVX)One of the world’s largest energy companies, Chevron, has made several significant investments in the area of clean energy.
Amazon (AMZN)At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion.
Companies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years.
Takeaway: Chevron and Amazon May Benefit Significantly from Nuclear FusionIt has been established that despite the recent breakthrough, nuclear fusion technology still has some time until it is widely commercialized.

     US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.
Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.
With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms.
This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.
“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said.
