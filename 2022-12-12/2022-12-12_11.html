     Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried refuses to testify before Senate, committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022.
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is refusing to testify at a hearing this week about his company's implosion, the Senate Banking Committee said Monday.
Attorneys for the crypto platform's founder have also said Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, will not accept service of a subpoena to compel his testimony before the panel, senators said.
Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that will focus on his company's collapse.
In a joint statement, Senate Banking Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and ranking member Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said they have "offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony."

     New FTX CEO to tell Congress about bankrupt crypto firm's 'spending binge,' loans to insiders
    </h2>

     Summary: Ray lists those items among five things that he and his team have discovered since replacing Bankman-Fried last month, when the company filed for bankruptcy.
The crypto trading firm imploded in spectacular fashion following a run on assets similar to a bank run.
The firm made more than $1 billion in "loans and other payments...to insiders."
Alameda's role as a market maker for crypto inspired it to place money into other exchanges that were "inherently unsafe."
The committee made Ray's opening testimony public on Monday, a day before the hearing that will focus on FTX's collapse.

     FTX founder Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bankman-Fried’s arrest comes the night before he was scheduled to testify remotely in front of the House Financial Services Committee, which is investigating the collapse of his multibillion-dollar crypto empire.
Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters said in a statement that she was disappointed he would not testify but that she remained committed to getting to the bottom of what happened at FTX.
Bankman-Fried — who until early November was the toast of Washington policy circles — has faced mounting allegations that he misused FTX customer assets to prop up his investment firm Alameda Research.
In prepared testimony for the Financial Services panel, the company’s new CEO John Ray III, wrote that Alameda used client funds to engage in margin trading, exposing customers to massive losses.
“I didn’t ever try to commit fraud on anyone,” Bankman-Fried said at the DealBook Summit in late November — three weeks after FTX filed for bankruptcy.

     Summary: Bankman-Fried, disgraced former CEO of FTX crypto exchange, arrested in BahamasEnlarge this image toggle caption Arturo Holmes/Getty Images Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesSam Bankman-Fried, the notorious former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas, the office of the attorney general of The Bahamas said on Monday night.
Williams expects to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning, and he "will have more to say at the time."
In a statement, the prime minister of the Bahamas stressed the country is cooperating with law enforcement and regulators in the United States, but its own "regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX continue."
Just one month ago, FTX, a $32 billion behemoth in virtual currencies, filed for bankruptcy after suspicions rose that it was insolvent and also moving money around illegally.
Bankman-Fried has denied that he has avoided coming to the United States over the last month for fear of being arrested.

     Sam Bankman-Fried, former FTX CEO, arrested in the Bahamas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — The former CEO of failed cryptocurrency firm FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, the U.S. and Bahamian authorities said Monday.
Bankman-Fried had been under criminal investigation by U.S. and Bahamian authorities following the collapse last month of FTX.
Bahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the Bahamas would “promptly” extradite Bankman-Fried to the U.S. once the indictment is unsealed and U.S. authorities make a formal request.
Meanwhile Bahamian authorities plan to continue their own investigation into Bankman-Fried.
Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole.

     FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO who was hailed as crypto’s savior just a few months ago, was arrested on Monday night on criminal charges, according to a statement from the Royal Bahamas police force.
According to the New York Times, the criminal charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.
Last year, Bankman-Fried was anointed by Forbes as “the world’s richest 29-year-old,” with a net worth over $22 billion.
But his empire started to unravel after FTX was accused of being secretly insolvent—and of lending FTX customer funds to Alameda Research.
This Time, Blame FTX and Sam Bankman-FriedDespite FTX’s collapse, Bankman-Fried continued to give interviews to the press from his home in the Bahamas, arguing that he did not know how much financial trouble both of his companies were in.

     Summary: The charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, according to the New York Times , citing a person familiar with the matter.
His arrest is the first concrete move by regulators to hold individuals accountable for the multibillion-dollar implosion of FTX last month.
Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder said that the United States was "likely to request his extradition."
The Royal Bahamas police force confirmed his arrest and said he would appear in magistrate court in Nassau on Tuesday.
The Bahamas and the United States have had an extradition treaty in place since the early 20th century, when the Bahamas was still under British control.
