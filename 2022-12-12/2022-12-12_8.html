     Pelicans Shut Down Suns 'Boo Machine' Theory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans were accused of using a noise machine to enhance the boos raining down on Chris Paul.
The New Orleans Pelicans just finished off a two-game weekend sweep of the Phoenix Suns.
Dec 11, 2022; New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Chris Paul (3) talks to a referee during the first quarter against the New Orleans Pelicans at Smoothie King Center.
Mandatory Credit: Andrew Wevers-USA TODAY Sports“They are booing, but they got a machine in here that kinda echoes the boos, okay?” Johnson said.
The teams will face off again on Saturday where the Suns must win in order to avoid losing the season series.

     Zion Williamson, Pelicans look like true contender in West after beating Suns again for seventh straight win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Sunday's victory, the Pelicans improved to 18-8 and now sit alone atop the Western Conference with a one-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies.
Paul and Co. had their chance at revenge on Sunday, but couldn't take it, in large part due to another contentious moment involving Paul and Williamson.
Williamson continued his impressive run of form, finishing with 35 points, eight rebounds and three assists on 14-of-21 from the field.
This was his second consecutive 35-point game and his fourth 30-point outing during the Pelicans' winning streak.
With Brandon Ingram sidelined for this run, Williamson has become a true No.

     Suns announcer made strange accusation about Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suns announcer made strange accusation about PelicansOne Phoenix Suns announcer did not handle the team’s disappointing weekend trip to New Orleans very well.
The Suns played the Pelicans in a two-game set (on Friday and then again on Sunday).
The hostilities continued in Sunday’s game with the Pelicans crowd giving a harsh reception to Suns guard Chris Paul, pelting him with boos throughout.
At one point in the second quarter, Suns color commentator Eddie Johnson made a bizarre accusation — he accused the Pelicans of somehow using a boo “machine” to amplify the noise.
Paul, who played the first six seasons of his career in New Orleans, has since given Pelicans fans plenty of authentic reasons to hate him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson watched his second 3-pointer go down, turned toward the Pelicans’ defensive end and threw a triumphant punch into the air.
Adding perimeter scoring to his already formidable play in the paint, Williamson scored 35-points for a second straight game, and New Orleans beat the short-handed Phoenix Suns 129-124 in overtime on Dec. 11 for their seventh straight victory.
"The Suns, they’ve earned their resume; they’re a great team," Williamson said.
Paul initially appeared to have drawn a foul on a missed 3-pointer, but the Pelicans challenged the call.
... Brandon Ingram (left foot) missed his seventh straight game and fellow wing player Herb Jones (left ankle) missed his fifth straight.

     Summary: Like Jose Alvarado, Marshall raises the energy and competitive spirit at every practice.
This team enjoys being around each other so much because guys like Marshall and Alvarado make it fun to come to work.
However, the Pelicans have developed arguably the deepest bench in the NBA by finding players like Marshall on the scrap heap.
But Pelicans coach Willie Green values Marshall because, as he has said on multiple occasions, Marshall had to earn his way into the league.
Fans should expect him to go to Marshall over Murphy or Daniels in certain situations, which may surprise some.
