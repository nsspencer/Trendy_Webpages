     Summary: Dave Chappelle prides himself on meeting controversy head on, but even he seemed taken aback at the crowd’s reaction when he introduced Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk to the Chase Center stage on Sunday night.
A stunned silence and then an avalanche of boos greeted Musk as he sauntered up to the stage.
While there certainly were many cheers among the boos, it was nowhere near the 90% that Musk claimed on Twitter.
For the honor of bringing him on stage, Chappelle did ask the Tesla co-founder for a favor, to unban his friend Kweli from Twitter.
Trying to salvage the show from getting completely out of hand, Chappelle quipped that the fighters must be antifa protesters.

The crowd at the Chase Center loudly booed Musk, who had spent much of the weekend wading into the culture wars, making transphobic statements and seemingly echoing QAnon tropes.
Video of the incident at Sunday’s Chappelle show captured by people in attendance shows the controversial Twitter owner taking the stage and yelling Chappelle’s famous Rick James impression: “I’m rich, b***h.” Afterward, Musk got loudly booed for several minutes.
That’s the sound of pending civil unrest.”After more jeers, Chappelle ended his show with a reprimand and a prayer.
Musk continued his culture war campaign on Monday, once again warning about the thread of what he calls “the woke mind virus.”
