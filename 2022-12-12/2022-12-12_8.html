Arizona Cardinals can take full advantage of Pats strugglesNot only are the Patriots struggling in prime time this season, they are also having a hard time getting anything going offensively.

     Cardinals Gameday: Here's Your One Chance to Rescue Hope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a long stretch of time off, the Arizona Cardinals have the perfect opportunity to rescue some hope from the fan base.
There's only five games left in the Arizona Cardinals' 2022 season, and what a rollercoaster it's been.
So much has gone wrong for the Cardinals thus far, yet on this particular Monday night, Kingsbury and company have an opportunity to restore some hope to the desert.
It's been over 14 days since Arizona's loss to Los Angeles in Week 12, giving the Cardinals plenty of time to prepare for New England.
If you're the Cardinals, a win on Monday night wouldn't sell hope of extending your season past Week 18.
