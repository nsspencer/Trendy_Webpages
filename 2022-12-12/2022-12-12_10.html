     Megan Thee Stallion’s Friend to Testify She Saw Tory Lanez Fire Gun
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harris was Megan’s best friend and assistant at the time, and her first-person account is considered crucial considering Lanez’s insistence he’s not the triggerman.
Bott said Harris will testify she freaked out when Lanez approached the two women after he fired five shots.
Bott told jurors that Harris quickly sent three highly critical text messages to Megan’s bodyguard Justin Edison in the five minutes following the shooting.
In his opening, Bott said a highly intoxicated Peterson brandished the gun after Megan dissed his musical talent.
According to Megan, Peterson offered both women money for their silence, an allegation Peterson denies.
