     Bankman-Fried: My FTX testimony won’t satisfy lawmakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is warning Congress that his upcoming appearance before the House Financial Services Committee is unlikely to contain many bombshells about how his Bahamas-based crypto exchange went bust.
In a Twitter Spaces event on Monday, Bankman-Fried said he wanted lawmakers to know that his remote appearance on Tuesday was “going to be frustrating and underwhelming in some ways, because I wasn’t gonna be able to answer questions that I would really want to be able to and — frankly — really should be able to.”Bankman-Fried — who, along with FTX, is the subject of multiple criminal and civil investigations — balked at an invitation from Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) earlier this month and agreed to testify after she threatened him with a subpoena.
The former billionaire and political megadonor had been one of the crypto industry’s most high-profile executives in Washington before his company ran aground amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement last month.

     Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried refuses to testify before Senate, committee says

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022.
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is refusing to testify at a hearing this week about his company's implosion, the Senate Banking Committee said Monday.
Attorneys for the crypto platform's founder have also said Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, will not accept service of a subpoena to compel his testimony before the panel, senators said.
Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that will focus on his company's collapse.
In a joint statement, Senate Banking Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and ranking member Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said they have "offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony."

     Summary: Bankman-Fried, disgraced former CEO of FTX crypto exchange, arrested in BahamasEnlarge this image toggle caption Arturo Holmes/Getty Images Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesSam Bankman-Fried, the notorious former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas, the office of the attorney general of The Bahamas said on Monday night.
Williams expects to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning, and he "will have more to say at the time."
In a statement, the prime minister of the Bahamas stressed the country is cooperating with law enforcement and regulators in the United States, but its own "regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX continue."
Just one month ago, FTX, a $32 billion behemoth in virtual currencies, filed for bankruptcy after suspicions rose that it was insolvent and also moving money around illegally.
Bankman-Fried has denied that he has avoided coming to the United States over the last month for fear of being arrested.

     FTX founder Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bankman-Fried’s arrest comes the night before he was scheduled to testify remotely in front of the House Financial Services Committee, which is investigating the collapse of his multibillion-dollar crypto empire.
Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters said in a statement that she was disappointed he would not testify but that she remained committed to getting to the bottom of what happened at FTX.
Bankman-Fried — who until early November was the toast of Washington policy circles — has faced mounting allegations that he misused FTX customer assets to prop up his investment firm Alameda Research.
In prepared testimony for the Financial Services panel, the company’s new CEO John Ray III, wrote that Alameda used client funds to engage in margin trading, exposing customers to massive losses.
“I didn’t ever try to commit fraud on anyone,” Bankman-Fried said at the DealBook Summit in late November — three weeks after FTX filed for bankruptcy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — The former CEO of failed cryptocurrency firm FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government, the U.S. and Bahamian authorities said Monday.
Bankman-Fried had been under criminal investigation by U.S. and Bahamian authorities following the collapse last month of FTX.
Bahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the Bahamas would “promptly” extradite Bankman-Fried to the U.S. once the indictment is unsealed and U.S. authorities make a formal request.
Meanwhile Bahamian authorities plan to continue their own investigation into Bankman-Fried.
Bankman-Fried said recently that he did not “knowingly” misuse customers’ funds, and said he believes his millions of angry customers will eventually be made whole.

     Lawmakers to hold FTX hearing despite former CEO arrest

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — (AP) — The House Financial Services Committee plans to hold a hearing into the collapse of crypto exchange FTX on Tuesday, but its star witness will be missing.
Sam Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee, along with the company's current CEO, John Ray III.
FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when the firm ran out of money after the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and chairwoman of the financial services committee, said while she understands that Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, she is “disappointed” that the arrest happened before he got to testify.
He previously testified in favor of certain bills that would regulate the crypto industry in ways that favored FTX.

     Summary: The charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, according to the New York Times , citing a person familiar with the matter.
His arrest is the first concrete move by regulators to hold individuals accountable for the multibillion-dollar implosion of FTX last month.
Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder said that the United States was "likely to request his extradition."
The Royal Bahamas police force confirmed his arrest and said he would appear in magistrate court in Nassau on Tuesday.
The Bahamas and the United States have had an extradition treaty in place since the early 20th century, when the Bahamas was still under British control.

     Senators say Bankman-Fried is refusing subpoena to testify about FTX collapse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a Monday statement, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and ranking Republican Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.) blasted Bankman-Fried for “an unprecedented abdication of accountability” after rejecting several requests to testify at hearings about the collapse of FTX.
While Bankman-Fried is set to testify virtually before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, he has refused to commit to appearing before the Senate Banking panel.
The Banking Committee is set to hold its own hearing on the FTX collapse Thursday, but Bankman-Fried suggested during a Monday livestream on Twitter that he was too busy to appear.
Brown and Toomey said Monday they gave Bankman-Fried a chance to testify on Dec. 20 instead, but that offer was also refused.
It is unclear what consequences Bankman-Fried or his counsel could face for rejecting service— or, the actual physical presentation—of the subpoena.

“We have offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony… and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony.
In FTX’s heyday, Bankman-Fried regularly appeared on congressional panels, charming lawmakers and pushing for light-touch regulation of the nascent industry.
Key questions that lawmakers and prosecutors are expected to focus on relate to the potential misuse of customer funds.
