     ‘The Voice’: Brayden Lape asks why Gwen Stefani didn’t turn for him in audition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brayden Lape put coach Gwen Stefani on the spot on the season finale of “The Voice” Monday night.
“I feel like I was your number one fan on the show,” Stefani told him.
During his blind audition in the beginning of the season, only Blake Shelton turned for the 15 year-old Michigan native.
“You’re literally following your heart up until this moment and it lead you to The Voice,” Shelton said to Lape.
To vote for Lape, fans can head to NBC.com/VoiceVote or vote on the official Voice app.

     Brayden Lape Calls Out Gwen Stefani in One of the Sharpest Barbs of ‘The Voice’ Season!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I thought that was a good opportunity to mess around with her a little bit," Brayden said.
For his first song of two on the season 22 The Voice finale, Team Blake Shelton’s Brayden Lape performed “Humble and Kind” by Tim McGraw, which he dedicated to his hometown who he explained had supported him all his life.
Then it was time to critique his performance and coach Gwen Stefani started to say, “I was thinking what would I say because I was thinking I was your No.
Look, you’re in the finals.”After the show, Parade got a chance to talk to Brayden to ask him what he was thinking when he confronted Gwen.
For his second and final competitive performance on The Voice, Brayden performed “Wild as Her” by Cory Kent.
