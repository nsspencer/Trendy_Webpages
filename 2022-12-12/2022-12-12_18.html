     76ers Superstar Isn’t Slowing Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Embiid scored 53 points and 12 rebounds in the huge victory against the Hornets.
This isn’t the first time this season that Embiid has exploded with these sorts of numbers but it’s still wildly impressive.
In fact, he is the first 76ers player with multiple 50-point games since Allen Iverson.
Both of those guys are well-deserving of the trophy but maybe we should be talking about Embiid a lot more.
Embiid’s current career average is 26.4 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 3.4 assists and he’s producing 33.4 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 4.8 assists in 2022-23.

     Summary: For the first time in weeks, Philadelphia 76ers’ sophomore guard Jaden Springer took the floor for an actual basketball game.
While practicing with the Sixers’ G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats, Springer suffered a quad strain.
Following Philadelphia’s big victory over the Hornets on Sunday night, Springer was assigned to the Delaware Blue Coats.
In his G League action with the Blue Coats this season, Springer drained 44 percent of his shots, averaging 16 points per game.

     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers star big man Joel Embiid delivered another huge game on Sunday in a win over the Charlotte Hornets at home.
Embiid also made history for the Sixers as he joined Allen Iverson and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in franchise history to have two 50-point games over a 9-game stretch.
He was just phenomenal all night long and the Sixers continue to benefit from his star play.
As well as a big performance from Embiid, Philadelphia received 19 points, 16 assists, and nine rebounds from James Harden while De’Anthony Melton hit four triples in the third quarter.
NBA Twitter was set ablaze for what Embiid did as they had a ton of reaction on the night:

     76ers vs. Hornets: Montrezl Harrell Praised By Sixers Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seemed for a small stretch of games that Paul Reed had won the backup center position officially, surpassing Montrezl Harrell.
Without Reed in the primary rotation for the night, the veteran center Montrezl Harrell garnered all of the backup center minutes when the thriving Embiid went off the floor.
When the Hornets came to South Philly on Sunday night, Harrell earned nearly 13 minutes of playing time and performed like he had something to prove.
Per usual, Harrell brought some much-needed high energy off the bench for the Sixers when his number called.
“He was great,” said Sixers center Joel Embiid.

"We had good intent tonight," Hornets coach Steve Clifford said.
It was part of a three straight possessions stretch that ended with Embiid scoring and going to the line for the old-fashioned 3-point play.
But Embiid put the game out of reach by scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter before being pulled with two minutes left.
TIP-INSHornets: LaMelo Ball missed his 11th straight game with a left ankle sprain.
