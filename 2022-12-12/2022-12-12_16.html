     Mac Jones caught swearing multiple times in Patriots win, says he’s not frustrated
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second week in a row, Patriots quarterback Mac Jones was caught dropping an f-bomb on the game field.
The Patriots offense struggled in their 27-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals and once again, we saw this quarterback explode.
The second expletive came on that same drive.
As the Patriots went on to win, Jones was also seen hugging and smiling with Patricia.
Today, I thought we all did a good job with trying to play the next play, play the next series.

     Summary: Patriots ESPN pregame show questions Bill Belichick, and sheds more light on Matt Patricia-Mac Jones relationship “It’s complete hubris to say that that doesn’t matter."
Bill Belichick, Matt Patricia, and Mac Jones were put under the microscope by ESPN’s “Monday Night Countdown” show before the game against the Cardinals.
“It’s complete hubris to say that that doesn’t matter, expertise doesn’t matter,” Young said.
“If I’m Matt Patricia, I want to stay in my lane.
The idea that it doesn’t matter, you can just come wherever you want and just coach, is just not true.

     Frustrated Mac Jones drops hot-mic F bomb, waves off Patriots Matt Patricia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears the source of that frustration can be traced to de facto offensive coordinator Matt Patricia.
That was fairly evident in New England's "Monday Night Football" game vs. the Cardinals.
Mac Jones waving off Matt Patricia a few seconds after dropping a hot-mic F-bomb on #MNF is the perfect way to sum up this #Patriots season.
But, how his passes were completed is notable, and possibly a source of Jones' frustration.
#Patriots QB Mac Jones on his visible frustration in tonight’s game: “This is an emotional game and everyone feeds off emotion.

     An upset Mac Jones had some more choice words for Patriots sideline on Monday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Patriots quarterback Mac Jones was once again frustrated with the New England offense during Monday night's win over the Cardinals, and once again got caught shouting a naughty word to one of his coaches.
There was a lot more quick plays from the New England offense on Monday night, as they settled for mostly screen plays rather than deep balls down field.
Jones did have a pair of big passes in the game, both of which went to Hunter Henry for 30+ yards.
He called a great game," Jones continued.
But something is still off with the New England offense, and the relationship between Jones and Patricia will remain a hot topic until the unit starts scoring on a consistent basis.

     Summary: Mac Jones wore his emotions on his sleeve Monday night while at times potentially prompting parents to cover their children’s ears.
The Patriots cornerback was seen and heard shouting multiple expletives during the Patriots’ needed 27-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals.
But ESPN cameras also captured a relieved Jones happily embracing the much-maligned Patricia during the final moments of the Patriots’ win.
“At the end of the day, this is an emotional game,” Jones told Salters.

     Summary: National Football League Mac Jones-Matt Patricia dynamic grows more awkward, even in win 6 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkMac Jones was furious … Again.
The New England Patriots quarterback was clearly displeased with his coaching staff against the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night.
It just doesn’t seem like Jones had the patience for Patriots offensive coordinator Matt Patricia, whose playcalling has been conservative and unimaginative.
"A play is a play," Jones told ESPN.
During the third quarter, the awkward dynamic between Patricia and Jones seemed like it might hit a boiling point.
