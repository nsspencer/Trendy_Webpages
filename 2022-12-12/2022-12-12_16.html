     Look: Mac Jones NSFW Message Caught On Live Mic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Bryan M. Bennett/Getty Images) Bryan M. Bennett/Getty ImagesMac Jones has had a number of instances this season where his frustration with the Patriots' offensive coaching staff has been obvious.
Early in the third quarter, Jones was forced to burn a timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty.
Jones also appeared to hand wave Patricia off as he made his way back into the huddle.
Like we said, Jones has expressed frustration with Patricia and his playcalling before.
Despite some of this discord, the Patriots still lead the Arizona Cardinals 20-13 at the start of the fourth quarter.

     Summary: Report reveals how Mac Jones feels about Matt PatriciaThere was some tension between Mac Jones and Matt Patricia during New England’s 33-26 loss to Minnesota in Week 13, but apparently there are no hard feelings.
Ahead of the Week 14 “Monday Night Football” game between the Patriots and Arizona Cardinals, ESPN reporter Lisa Salters shared a follow-up report on the matter.
“As for his relationship with Patricia, Jones told us, ‘I talk to Matty P. every day.
“While he said there have definitely been growing pains this season, Jones said, ‘now it feels like a good time to turn the corner.
Patricia and Joe Judge were seemingly in a tryout for the spot, with Patricia winning out.

     An upset Mac Jones had some more choice words for Patriots sideline on Monday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Patriots quarterback Mac Jones was once again frustrated with the New England offense during Monday night's win over the Cardinals, and once again got caught shouting a naughty word to one of his coaches.
There was a lot more quick plays from the New England offense on Monday night, as they settled for mostly screen plays rather than deep balls down field.
Jones did have a pair of big passes in the game, both of which went to Hunter Henry for 30+ yards.
He called a great game," Jones continued.
But something is still off with the New England offense, and the relationship between Jones and Patricia will remain a hot topic until the unit starts scoring on a consistent basis.

     Frustrated Mac Jones drops hot-mic F bomb, waves off Patriots Matt Patricia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears the source of that frustration can be traced to de facto offensive coordinator Matt Patricia.
That was fairly evident in New England's "Monday Night Football" game vs. the Cardinals.
Mac Jones waving off Matt Patricia a few seconds after dropping a hot-mic F-bomb on #MNF is the perfect way to sum up this #Patriots season.
But, how his passes were completed is notable, and possibly a source of Jones' frustration.
#Patriots QB Mac Jones on his visible frustration in tonight’s game: “This is an emotional game and everyone feeds off emotion.

Mac Jones waving off Matt Patricia a few seconds after dropping a hot-mic F-bomb on #MNF is the perfect way to sum up this #Patriots season.
At 6-6 heading into Monday night’s game, the Patriots’ playoff hopes are fading fast.
But if were to ask Patriots fans, moving off both Patricia and Judge for an actual offensive-minded coordinator would make sense.

     NFL fans thought Mac Jones lobbed a furious f-bomb at Matt Patricia as the Patriots’ offense sputtered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The past few weeks have been rough on the New England Patriots.
Be it the timeout, the play-calling, and or the general malaise of what is usually one of the NFL’s worst offenses; something appeared to tick Mac Jones off.
Mac Jones just dropped what might be the most aggressive f bomb in sports TV history.
If it’s any consolation for Jones and Patricia — who fans thought Jones was referring to with his f-bomb — the Patriots would rattle off 17 unanswered points after Jones’ short audible tirade en route to a 27-13 win and a 7-6 overall record.
And it seemed the quarterback and offensive coordinator were in a good place later, too:After a testy game from Mac Jones, here's a look at the QB and Matt Patricia showing some love for each other.

Bill Belichick, Matt Patricia, and Mac Jones were put under the microscope by ESPN’s “Monday Night Countdown” show before the game against the Cardinals.
“It’s complete hubris to say that that doesn’t matter, expertise doesn’t matter,” Young said.
“If I’m Matt Patricia, I want to stay in my lane.
The idea that it doesn’t matter, you can just come wherever you want and just coach, is just not true.
