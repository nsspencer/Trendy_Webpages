     76ers' Jaden Springer: Gets light minutes in blowout win

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Springer played the final 1:41 of Sunday's 131-113 win over the Hornets, finishing with one turnover and no other statistics.
Springer recently missed time with a quadriceps injury, but he's been available for the 76ers' last three games and finally got the chance to play in garbage time of Sunday's contest.
The 2021 first-round pick has made only five appearances at the NBA level through his first two professional seasons and is likely to be assigned to the G League's Delaware Blue Coats in the near future in order to pick up meaningful playing time.
