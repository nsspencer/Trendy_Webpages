     Bishop Gomez: Our Lady of Guadalupe is ‘our mother’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 70-year-old archbishop, the former president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that the Blessed Virgin Mary loves everyone as a mother.
“Mary of Guadalupe opens her arms with tenderness and compassion and embraces us all with motherly love.”He described Mary’s “beautiful mission” as bringing Jesus to each person.
“In all her apparitions, the Virgin Mary’s message has always been like that of Tepeyac: She is the mother of all humanity, the mother of every person of every race and language,” he said.
When the bishop asked for a sign that the apparition was real, Juan Diego went back to Tepeyac, and Mary appeared once again.
When he returned with the bouquet in his tilma, or cloak, the bishop fell to his knees when he saw Castilian roses and an image of Our Lady.

     New Our Lady of Guadalupe tradition brings diverse campus community together
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those in attendance sang before a painting depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe, created by students Carolina Lopez-Vivar and Frank Hernandez.
Referencing the call of Pope Francis, Bishop Dorsonvlle reminded the students during his homily to be prophets in the world.
“This particular Marian devotion has become a source of faith and hope for so many in this part of the world,” Bishop Dorsonville said during his homily.
The University, Bustamante said, was a natural site for such devotions to develop.
“We come from different cultures and backgrounds, and all are equally embraced and welcomed under the mantle of Our Lady.

     Our Lady of Guadalupe gives urgency to the Church's mission, Bishop Cepeda says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In her apparitions to the humble Juan Diego, Our Lady of Guadalupe shared the divine plan and mission for the Church in the Americas, Bishop Cepeda said in his homily, translated from Spanish.
“She is with us, as she indicated to St. Juan Diego in her apparitions, giving him motherly advice,” Bishop Cepeda said.
Although an important feast day for those of Mexican descent, the apparitions are a reminder for the entire Church of Mary's protection and companionship, Bishop Cepeda said.
Our Lady’s appearance to Juan Diego is also a reminder of the urgency to live and pass on the mission of God, Bishop Cepeda added.
Let us thank our Lady as she calls each one of us on mission, Bishop Cepeda said.

     Pope at Mass: ‘Our Lady of Guadalupe shows God’s closeness to humanity’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Francis presides over Mass for the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and urges people across the Americas to look to her as a model for building a culture that cares for everyone, including migrants seeking a better life.
By Devin WatkinsAs the Church celebrated the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Monday, Pope Francis presided over Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica.
In his homily, the Pope recalled God’s closeness as shown through the Mother of His Son.
Recovering meaning and dignityTurning to the apparitions of Our Lady of Guadalupe in what is now Mexico in 1531, Pope Francis said the Blessed Virgin Mary went to the Americas to offer God’s consolation at a time of historical upheaval.
Despite these many omens of desolation, said the Pope, God reminds us that even now is a “propitious time of salvation” as the Lord calls us embrace fraternity and set aside selfishness.
