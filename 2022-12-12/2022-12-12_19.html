     DeAndre Hopkins leads the Cardinals in receiving on Monday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: by Scott Youngson | Cardinals Correspondent | Mon, Dec 12th 11:46pm ESTDeAndre Hopkins caught seven of 11 targets for 79 yards and lost a fumble in the Cardinals' 27-13 loss to the Patriots on Monday.
Fantasy Impact:Hopkins's volume remained high even though Kyler Murray left the game early with a knee injury.
It doesn't seem to matter who's under center for the Cardinals for Hopkins to dominate the targets.
He'll have a tough test next week when Arizona travels to Denver to take on the Broncos and their top-rated pass defense.

     Cardinals' DeAndre Hopkins: Paces pass-catching corps in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hopkins brought in seven of 11 targets for 79 yards and lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown in the Cardinals' 27-13 loss to the Patriots on Monday night.
Hopkins recorded all his numbers in conjunction with veteran quarterback Colt McCoy, who was called on after Kyler Murray suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury on the Cardinals' third play of the game.
Hopkins' lost fumble was returned 23 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter by Raekwon McMillan to snap a 13-13 tie, but his reception, yardage and target totals were all team-high figures on the night.
With double-digit looks in five of his first seven games of the season, there's little doubt the star wideout will remain an integral part of the air attack irrespective of who's under center.

     DeAnde Hopkins, Colt McCoy take blame for Cardinals' loss but it wasn't just them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona, though, still had its chances to not only stay in this game but win it with backup Colt McCoy under center.
“I try to be perfect, and I let myself down today,” said Hopkins, who finished with a game-high seven receptions for 79 yards.
I haven’t fumbled all year, so this was definitely a reminder of ‘just protect the ball.’ ”The Cardinals couldn’t do that on their next possession, either.
On second-and-13 from the Patriots’ 40, McCoy spotted Hopkins open deep down the field, but as he was throwing the ball he got hit by linebacker Josh Uche.
Five plays later, Patriots’ rookie running back Pierre Strong Jr. ran three yards up the middle for a touchdown and that was it.

     Summary: The Cardinals' season has been a dud so far, but Hopkins continues to put up big numbers.
The Cardinals (4-8) host the New England Patriots (6-6) on Monday night.
Hopkins spent his first seven seasons with the Houston Texans before coming to the Cardinals in 2020.
“Everybody loves him, respects him and understands what he brings to the team,” Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray said.
Most recently, former Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson said on his “All Things Covered” podcast that “Kyler Murray don’t care about nobody but Kyler Murray.” Hopkins was quick to defend his quarterback on social media and in person.
