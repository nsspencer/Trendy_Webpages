     FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested by The Royal Bahamas Police Force following reports that the United States filed criminal charges against the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, and is likely to request his extradition.
As TechCrunch previously reported, Reuters reported last month that Bankman-Fried secretly transferred $10 billion in FTX client funds to affiliated trading firm Alameda Research.
Bankman-Fried told the publication that the transfer of the funds was a misreading of the “confusing internal labeling.” He has repeatedly claimed ignorance of any wrongdoing.
Axios reported earlier today that Bankman-Fried “continued to decline to testify in front of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, and that his lawyers are refusing to accept a subpoena,” according to a new statement from Sens.

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022.
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is refusing to testify at a hearing this week about his company's implosion, the Senate Banking Committee said Monday.
Attorneys for the crypto platform's founder have also said Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, will not accept service of a subpoena to compel his testimony before the panel, senators said.
Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that will focus on his company's collapse.
In a joint statement, Senate Banking Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and ranking member Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said they have "offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony."

     FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Live Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch Forbes Digital Assets Director Of Research’s live interview FTX Founder Sam Bankman-FriedUntil early November former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried could do no wrong.
Save for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, nobody that young had ever gotten that rich.
But unlike other crypto titans, who have preferred to keep a low profile, Bankman-Fried’s cultivated media attention and was known to be a philanthropist who courted politicians, often via donations.
It all changed on November 2, when a leaked FTX balance sheet became public showing that his entire empire was being propped up by a crypto token, FTT, that he invented and largely controlled.
Its price crash from $26 to below $2 led to a run on FTX and ultimately its bankruptcy.

The Bahamas and the United States have had an extradition treaty in place since the early 20th century, when the Bahamas was still under British control.

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency platform FTX, says he will indeed testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday but indicated he will do so virtually.
“I’m going to be calling in,” Bankman-Fried said on the “Unusual Whales” finance podcast.
He stepped down as CEO as the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month following mass withdrawals from customers.
John J. Ray III, a restructuring expert who took over as chief executive from Bankman-Fried to lead the company through bankruptcy, is also slated to appear at Tuesday’s hearing.
Ray previously oversaw Enron’s liquidation when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and a number of other major companies.

Spokespeople for the prime minister of the Bahamas, the attorney general of the Bahamas and the House Financial Services Committee did not respond to requests for comment.
Bankman-Fried’s arrest is made more pointed by his longtime reputation as a savior of troubled crypto companies.
In the wake of the FTX bankruptcy, that deal was called off.
Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019 as an exchange that made money by facilitating trades of cryptocurrencies and taking transaction fees.

     Summary: New York CNN —Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after US prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, according to a statement from the government of the Bahamas.
“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,” wrote US attorney Damian Williams.
The New York Times, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the charges against Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.
In the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.
“There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX,” Bankman-Fried told DealBook.

“We have offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony… and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony.
In FTX’s heyday, Bankman-Fried regularly appeared on congressional panels, charming lawmakers and pushing for light-touch regulation of the nascent industry.
