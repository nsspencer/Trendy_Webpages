     Questions about Tua Tagovailoa Have Returned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins came out to Los Angeles and were demolished by the Chargers yesterday and Tua Tagovailoa didn’t look great in the loss.
Doug Gottlieb was never completely sold on Tagovialoa’s skillset despite the progress he had made, and it appears he’s sliding back into his old ways.
Whether his early season success was earned or just a flash in the pan, it’s fair to wonder if he can lead the Dolphins to postseason success with his inconsistent play.
Doug Gottlieb: “All the questions about Tua are very much back.
These last two games have...Either his confidence runs hot and cold, and when he’s not confident he can’t hit the broad side of a barn, or he’s just not that good...”

Please judge quarterbacks when life isn’t perfect – when their o-line is banged up, when they’re under pressure, when they’re trailing late in games.

     Tua Tagovailoa says Dolphins offense 'not up to our standard' in loss to Chargers: 'Very disappointing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tua Tagovailoa authored the worst game of his career in Sunday night's 23-17 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, unable to find the mark and getting outdueled by Justin Herbert.
"It's very disappointing for us to go out there as an offense and kind of show what we showed," Tagovailoa said.
"That's not up to our standard, that's not how we play football here, and that was very disappointing."
Tua's 35.7 completion percentage was the worst by a Dolphins QB since David Woodley (31.0) in Week 15, 1980, per NFL Research.
Tagovailoa struggled from the outset against a Chargers defense missing a host of key pieces.

     Cris Collinsworth clarifies Tua Tagovailoa concussion remark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late in the third quarter, Collinsworth praised Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa as he fought through two defenders while scrambling for the first down.
“Watch this one, for a guy who’s been knocked out twice this season with concussions,” Collinsworth said of Tagovailoa.
Tagovailoa, however, returned to the game after passing concussion protocol and was later diagnosed with a back injury.
Outrage ensued over the fact that Tagovailoa was able to start just four days after suffering an apparent head injury against the Bills.
And more than two months later, Collinsworth appeared to get a stern reminder that Tagovailoa’s head incident against Buffalo resulted in a back injury, not a concussion.

     Summary: The war for the soul of football Twitter was fought on Sunday night between the Los Angeles Chargers and Miami Dolphins.
However, as the dust settled on the game, it was Brandon Staley and the Chargers defense that stole the show.
In man coverage, there’s no man to put in conflict, because they’re guarding a man.
The Dolphins slide their protection to the right, expecting the left side of the line to sort out anything weird that happens.
The Niners game for Miami could be washed away as a bad game, but this Chargers game just feels odd watching it over again.
