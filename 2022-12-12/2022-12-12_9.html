     High On Life achievement takes aim at Fallout, lets you shoot a kid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re someone who’s new to the Fallout series – or, new enough that you didn’t play anything before Fallout 3 – you’re not going to understand this unusual dig at Bethesda and the Fallout series from Squanch Games and High On Life.
If you have played the older isometric RPGs from Interplay Productions, you’ll know exactly what this is about.
High On Life has an achievement for players killing Slumsley – an apparent child in-game – called “Fallout Doesn’t Let You Do This”.
As explained in this Kotaku article from 2015, the Fallout fandom was quite up in arms when it came to killing children and its removal in Fallout 3.
This achievement is available from around half-an-hour in, but you can find out more about the complete High On Life length and how long this game takes to beat here.

     Review: High on Life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn’t a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.
Like many Roiland joints, High on Life is filled with twists, meta humor, and Easter eggs.
Where High on Life really falters is enemy variety.
One big issue with High on Life (and where the game mainly slipped for me) is jank.
As-is, High on Life is great weekend Game Pass pickup, and something to go into with caution if you’re a fan of Roiland’s work.

     High on Life Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The more guns players collect in High on Life, the more creative they can get with the game's combat.
Very early on in the game, High on Life players collect a bloodthirsty, psychopathic knife that is obsessed with stabbing people.
High on Life is an easy recommendation, especially considering it's a day one Xbox Game Pass game and can be played without paying full price.
Whether they play it through Xbox Game Pass or not, gamers should make it a point to play High on Life ASAP.
High on Life launches December 13 for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: High on Life doesn't care whether you think it's terrible, so why should I waste your time spelling it out?
Tallying its faults is giving High on Life more attention than the game proposes to deserve, so take the hint and click away.
Watch on YouTube Here's some High on Life gameplay in action - be warned dialogue is NSFW.
It's on this side of Rick and Morty that High on Life draws most frequently.
High on Life is 10-to-15 hours of things he'd do away with, which is why it hates itself so much.

     High on Life Review: A Steady Buzz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guns are just a tool for killing in every other shooter, but that’s not how it is in developer Squanch Games’ High on Life.
High on Life falls into some of the same comedic pitfalls as Roiland’s other work, but that perspective has led to one unique first-person shooter.
M16s don’t usually blabber or shoot out slime, either, which is another avenue where High on Life’s weirdness shines through.
Its brand of comedy might be a bit played, but High on Life still has quite an identity.
Disclosure: The publisher provided a PC copy for our High on Life review.

     High on Life review: Rick and Morty and Metroid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: High on Life takes a lot of design cues from Metroid Prime, delivering a first-person adventure game with an emphasis on platforming.
Though High on Life will largely be judged on its humor, its strengths as an adventure game shouldn’t be overlooked.
As an adventure game, High on Life excels most of all when it comes to its aesthetic.
Though High on Life will largely be judged on its humor, its strengths as an adventure game shouldn’t be overlooked.
Like Rick and Morty’s Pickle Rick episode, High on Life doesn’t build to a grand punch line.
