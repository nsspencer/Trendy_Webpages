     Sacred hares, banished winter witches and pagan worship – the roots of Easter Bunny traditions are ancient
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Tok ThompsonThe Easter Bunny is a much celebrated character in American Easter celebrations.
On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind.
In European traditions, the Easter Bunny is known as the Easter Hare.
Accounts from the 1600s in Germany describe children hunting for Easter eggs hidden by the Easter Hare, much as in the contemporary United States today.
Written accounts from England around the same time also mention the Easter Hare, particularly in terms of traditional Easter hare hunts, and the eating of hare meat at Easter.
