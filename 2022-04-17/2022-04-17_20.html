     When Outlander Will Return With A Tense New Episode For Claire And Jamie After The Big Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The episode description from Starz reveals:Claire struggles with her demons as a nefarious rumor begins to spread on the Ridge.
Tensions rising isn’t a good thing, considering how high they already were after Malva made her claim about Jamie.
After her brutal assault at the end of Season 5, Claire has enough demons without blaming herself for Malva.
On top of evidently dealing with suspicions, the Fraser's have to figure out who the real killer is.
Whether or not the Beardsleys are responsible remains to be seen, but the promo suggests that one or both will at least be suspects.
