Patrick Vieira's Palace had defended well to contain Chelsea until Loftus-Cheek broke the deadlock and were nearly rewarded for a gritty display, with Cheikhou Kouyate twice coming close.
I thought the Carabao (League) Cup final was a fantastic game that could have gone either way.

     Ruben Loftus-Cheek Recalls Crystal Palace Loan Spell Ahead of Chelsea's FA Cup Semi-Final Against Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ruben Loftus-Cheek has discussed his loan spell at Crystal Palace as Chelsea face the Eagles in the FA Cup semi-final.
The Englishman spent the 2020-21 season on loan at Selhurst Park as he overcame an injury suffered after a breakthrough season at Stamford Bridge.
Speaking exclusively to Chelsea's 5th Stand app, Loftus-Cheek looked back on his loan spell at Crystal Palace and discussed friendships he holds within their current squad.
IMAGO / SportimageThe midfielder has found himself as part of Thomas Tuchel's first team plans this season after returning from his loan spell at Fulham, one rather more unsuccessful than his time at Crystal Palace.
Loftus-Cheek will be hoping to get one over his former side as he looks to make the FA Cup final with Chelsea.

     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Complete the sale of Chelsea inside four weeks and the new ownership will have an FA Cup final against Liverpool to attend.

Chelsea lost the 2021 FA Cup final to Leicester.
The Women’s FA Cup holders beat Arsenal 2-0 on Sunday to set up a final meeting with Manchester City at Wembley on May 15 — the day after the men’s showpiece in the same venue.
