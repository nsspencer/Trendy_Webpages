The Easter egg hunt is one of several dives Slate stages every year to promote marine animal protection and reef conservation with a fun twist.
Slate participated himself as the Easter Bunny in dive gear for the event.

     Easter Bunny Makes Stops Around Schuylkill County for Annual Tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thanks to non-profit, Dustin's Adventureland, the Easter Bunny made his annual tour of Schuylkill County.
For the third year in a row, Dustin's Adventureland organized a tour of Schuylkill County for the Easter Bunny.
Due to the pandemic, they were unable to have the egg hunt, thus the Skook Easter Bunny Tour was born.
The tour began Friday "north of the mountain" where the Easter Bunny visited the communities of Shenandoah, Girardville, Ashland, and Mahanoy City.
The escorts for the Easter Bunny varied from parade to parade with first responders joining in to help.

     Make your own chocolate Easter bunny - The Coastland Times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The custom of chocolate eggs came along centuries after the Easter bunny, originating in the 19th century in France and Germany.
As Easter celebrations evolved, chocolate eggs were not the only delicacy; chocolate Easter bunnies also were shared and enjoyed.
While there are scores of mass-produced chocolate bunnies available for purchase, and local establishments also make Easter bunnies and other sweet treats, families may want to try making their own chocolate Easter bunnies this year.
The first step to creating chocolate Easter bunnies is to select the type of chocolate you prefer.
For an even more festive effect, seal a lollipop stick in a chocolate bunny and use it to secure the Easter bunny to the top of a cake.

You can talk to a little girl in a party dress searching for eggs about the true meaning of anything.
Grownups’ baskets are full of the same rotten eggs: Ukraine, killer caterpillars, Omni this, Omni that, long COVID, short COVID, and the new boy on the block, BA.2.
Of course I know what Easter is really about; I was an altar boy before most of you were born.
I’m Irish, don’t you see, and I really don’t know how to do anything else.

     Sacred hares, banished winter witches and pagan worship – the roots of Easter Bunny traditions are ancient
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Tok ThompsonThe Easter Bunny is a much celebrated character in American Easter celebrations.
On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind.
In European traditions, the Easter Bunny is known as the Easter Hare.
Accounts from the 1600s in Germany describe children hunting for Easter eggs hidden by the Easter Hare, much as in the contemporary United States today.
Written accounts from England around the same time also mention the Easter Hare, particularly in terms of traditional Easter hare hunts, and the eating of hare meat at Easter.

With hundreds of children anxiously awaiting along the banks of the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal, the Easter Bunny made a grand entrance via a Freedom Boat Club pontoon.
Upon disembarking, the Easter Bunny received celebrity treatment, as he was surrounded by excited children all the way to his designated area for photographs.
Families could also take a crack at guessing the number of jelly beans in a container, paint Easter eggs or wait in line for a special balloon creation.
