We were here last season in the FA Cup final, we are here again, and that means an unbelievable lot to us because the FA Cup is the most prestigious, the most traditional cup in the world maybe, played at Wembley.
Chelsea punched their way past Crystal Palace on Sunday to reach the FA Cup final for the third consecutive time.
And this will be a third FA Cup final in a row after losing to Arsenal in 2020 under Lampard and Leicester City last year, heightening the sense of Chelsea coming full circle.

Chelsea lost the 2021 FA Cup final to Leicester.

Why Arsenal Could Win This MatchThis Arsenal season has been streaky.
They did not capitalize on Tottenham dropping points versus Brighton at home because they lost to Southampton away from their Emirates, but they have a new chance now.
It might look surprising, especially after the Saints taking all the points on Saturday versus the Gunners, but we are backing Arsenal to win in their match versus Chelsea.
