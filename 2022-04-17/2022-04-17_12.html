     Police Search for Suspects After Two Killed in Mass Shooting at Pittsburgh Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police were looking for suspects and appealing for witnesses to come forward after two young men were shot to death after a large party in Pittsburgh degenerated into a barrage of gunfire shortly after midnight on Easter Sunday, the police said.
Eight more people suffered gunshot wounds, while another five were injured as they attempted to flee the scene.
“How can you even have a holiday when something traumatic happened like this?”The incident is the fourth mass shooting to occur within the last week.
Just a day earlier, nine people were shot at a crowded South Carolina mall in Columbia, and at least nine others were shot at a club in rural Hampton County.
On Tuesday, 10 passengers were shot inside a subway car in New York City.

     2 dead, multiple people hurt in shooting at party at Pittsburgh Airbnb rental
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two juveniles were killed and at least eight people were wounded when a barrage of 50 gunshots broke out early Sunday inside a Pittsburgh Airbnb rental house, where police said roughly 200 people were having a party.
The Pittsburgh shooting unfolded around 12:30 a.m., when police were notified of multiple ShotSpotter gunfire-detection alerts in the East Allegheny neighborhood on the city's North Side, the Pittsburgh Police Department said in a statement.
Shell casings collected at the scene indicate multiple weapons were fired, including rifles, a police commander told ABC affiliate station WTAE in Pittsburgh.
"Airbnb strictly bans parties, and we condemn the behavior that is alleged to have prompted this criminal gun violence."
He said a special meeting of public safety and key community members is being scheduled to discuss a citywide effort to combat gun violence.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH (AP) — Shots fired at a house party in Pittsburgh early Sunday left two minors dead and at least eight more people wounded, police said.
A police release initially said nine people had been injured by gunfire, but Schubert revised the numbers at the press conference.
Others were injured jumping from windows, falling down steps or just trying to seek cover or escape, Schubert said.
Officials asked anyone with information, including video or photographs from people who were at the party, to send them to authorities.
Breit said Airbnb was cooperating with authorities: “We share the Pittsburgh community’s outrage regarding this tragic gun violence.
