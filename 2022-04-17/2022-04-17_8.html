“You put a broke-down car in front of somebody and a brand-new foreign vehicle.

     Summary: The Chicago Bulls will take on the Milwaukee Bucks Sunday evening in the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs.
The Bulls dove headfirst from the top of the East to the sixth seed, only winning eight games after the All-Star break.
If the Bulls’ current trend holds true, the Bucks will demolish them in the first round, setting up a second-round showdown against either the Boston Celtics or the Nets … rough.
To end the regular season, his shooting hit a rock bottom.
It isn’t realistic for the Bulls to beat the Bucks up down low or even match their paint points.

     Summary: Recent history for the Bulls first round playoff series against the, sigh, defending NBA champion Bucks, is not encouraging.
We know the numbers with this matchup, if not a rivalry other than for the Milwaukee fans trying to beat Bulls fans to the Ticketmaster call-in that always has so many Bulls fans at Bucks games.
The Bucks swept the regular season series 4-0, the last two games Bucks dominations with Brook Lopez working back into the lineup.
Holiday probably is the second most important player in the series for the Bucks because of his defense.
DeRozan was the Bulls' pack mule this season, fourth in the league in minutes played and 16th in games played.
