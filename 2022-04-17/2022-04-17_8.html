     Chicago Bulls vs. Milwaukee Bucks Game One Open Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls are in the playoffs for the first time since the 2016-2017 season.
ESPN experts released picks for each first round matchup and remarkably all 22 of the people polled had the Bucks beating the Bulls.
Only four of those experts had the Bulls winning more than one game in the series and eight had the Bucks sweeping the series.
The Bucks swept the Bulls in the regular season this year and two of those games weren’t competitive.
But, because I’ll probably lose my Bulls fan card if I pick the Bucks, we’re going Bulls in six.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson Allen pulling a WWE move on Alex Caruso during the Chicago Bulls’ first game against the Milwaukee Bucks this season wasn’t a shocker for two reasons.
Chicago Bulls hit gold in the 1980sThe Bulls finally did something right in 1984, drafting the GOAT Michael Jordan.
It was so obvious that they were tanking, the Chicago Stadium fans began chanting, “Tulane Bulls, Tulane Bulls,” in the team’s final game.
The Bulls got their wish, playing a tough Bucks team whom they had a full fist fight with in the regular season.
Bulls vs Bucks modern era hasn’t been as physical, but the rivalry is still thereThe Bulls and Bucks lost the contender flair once their generational talents left.
