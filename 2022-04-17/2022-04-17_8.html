     Summary: [ THE RUN-IN: Premier League title race | Top-4 battle | Relegation battle ]For Chelsea, it represents a chance to return to the FA Cup final, to erase memories of their disappointing defeat to Leicester City a year ago.
For Crystal Palace, a victory would see first-year manager Patrick Vieira them club back to the FA Cup final for the first time since 2016 (lost to Manchester United) and just the second time in club history (1990 FA Cup final, also lost to Manchester United).
Vieira has already worked a minor miracle to clear out a rebuild nearly half of Crystal Palace’s squad in his debut season, thus raising expectations for next season, even before reaching the FA Cup semifinals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea booked their place in the FA Cup final after a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Wembley.
Second half goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount were enough for the Blues, who secured their place in their third consecutive FA Cup final.
Palace started strongly and caused Chelsea a lot of problems in the first half, going close through Cheikhou Kouyate from a set piece.
However, Thomas Tuchel's side came out of the blocks fast in the second half, and with 25 minutes to go they finally broke through thanks to a sweet half-volley from Loftus-Cheek.
The result sets up another date at Wembley with Liverpool, with the sides playing out a remarkable EFL Cup final only a few months ago.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going two-for-three on picks was a small consolation for the UCL exit, and the plus juice on Chelsea moneyline was especially sweet.
Cup matches can sometimes be tricky to predict, but I think the European Champions will be highly motivated to bounce back as quickly as possible.
Here is your gambling guide for the FA Cup semifinal contest between Chelsea and Crystal Palace at Wembley StadiumPalace, while currently sitting 13th in the Premier League table, has been one of the most free-flowing attacking teams in the English top flight this season.
Chelsea is leading the aggregate scoreline, 4-0, while the Eagles have managed only four shots on target in the two previous matches combined.
Instead, I’m going to continue playing it safe and take the Club World Cup champions on the moneyline at -165 odds.

A ticket to take on Liverpool in the final awaits the winner of this all-London FA Cup semifinal.
Here are three things to look for in Chelsea’s FA Cup semifinal against Crystal Palace:1.
He’s started just three Champions League games, he was on the bench in the Carabao Cup final and he’s missed important matches against title contenders like Liverpool.
That being said, the 28-year-old has helped elevate the Blues to some important victories, including the FIFA Club World Cup.

     Summary: (Getty Images)Ruben Loftus-Cheek capped his impressive comeback with a first Chelsea goal since May 2019 as the Blues defeated Crystal Palace 2-0 to reach their third successive FA Cup final.
Loftus-Cheek’s thunderbolt finish dragged the Blues out of a sluggish performance and into a 16th FA Cup final, with Mason Mount’s angled effort sealing the deal.
England midfielder Loftus-Cheek spent the 2017-18 season on loan with the Eagles, even forcing his way to the World Cup after his campaign at Selhurst Park.
But the 26-year-old showed no split loyalty in dumping his former side out of England’s premier cup competition.
Loftus-Cheek’s first Chelsea goal since the 1-1 Europa League draw with Eintracht Frankfurt on May 9, 2019 spurred the Blues on past their clear fatigue and into yet another final.

It was a nervy start as Chelsea dominated possession during the opening period but could not break through the Palace defence, with the south London side looking dangerous on the counterattack.
Mount doubled their lead shortly after, weaving through the Palace defence before slotting the ball past Butland into the corner.
