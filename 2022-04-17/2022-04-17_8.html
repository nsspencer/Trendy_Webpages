    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, Varner, the 54-hole leader, was hunting for his first PGA Tour win and had been fueled through Saturday by a second-round ruling that had irritated him.
That fuel ran out on Sunday, when he was one of just two players in the top 10 who failed to break 70.
His round of one-under 70 concluded with a stretch of nine straight pars.
It was his iron game that let him down—on hole after hole on the back nine, he left himself with extremely long birdie putts and could do no better than a two-putt.
On the 18th, needing birdie to tie, his 36-footer slid by on the right side, consigning him a T-3 finish.

     Summary: Jordan Spieth birdied the 72nd hole then parred in a playoff for his 13th PGA Tour win.
He made an even bigger shot at Harbour Town’s signature hole in a playoff to win the RBC Heritage.
In the playoff, Cantlay also hit into the front bunker, with his lie looking like a fried egg.
Others besides Cantlay, who missed a 15-footer for birdie on his 72nd hole, had a chance to catch Spieth.
“What a great tournament to win,” Spieth said.

     Summary: When he was too aggressive with his birdie putt at the 11th, Spieth missed the comebacker from 5 feet to drop to 11 under.
“It’s striking to see him struggle with the putter,” CBS Sports analyst Dottie Pepper said before Spieth attempted a 13-foot birdie putt.
Shane Lowry climbed to 14 under after a 20-foot birdie putt at 11 and gained a two-stroke edge.
On the first playoff hole, both players hit into the front greenside bunker at 18.
This approach on the first playoff hole sealed the victory @RBC_Heritage.

     Summary: Just over 12 months later, he took the RBC Heritage in a sudden death playoff over Patrick Cantlay the week after teeing it up at Augusta National.
He couldn't get it anywhere close to the hole, and Spieth stole a tournament he perhaps shouldn't have won.
It had been over a year since Spieth last won on the PGA Tour as he took the Texas Open last Easter Sunday.
The RBC Heritage marked his second win since the 2017 Open Championship but the 13th overall in his career.
