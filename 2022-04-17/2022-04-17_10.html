     Summary: 1 among playoff teams in defensive efficiency after placing near the bottom of the top 10 during the regular season.
The Bucks dipped to the No.14 in defense during the 2021-22 regular season.
"Sometimes you got to win ugly," Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.
Overall, the Bulls shot 32.3% from the field and 18.9% from 3.
But considering the Bulls had a chance to win Game 1 down the stretch, Sunday's game felt like a missed opportunity to DeRozan.

     Bulls lose playoff opener to Bucks. Could Bulls’ ‘Big Three’ be one-and-done after this series?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘‘We’ve done enough talking,’’ LaVine said several times in the weeks leading up to the Bulls’ first playoff appearance since 2017.
Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 16 rebounds, and the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks recovered after blowing a 16-point lead to beat the Bulls 93-86 in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.
So while the Bulls have spent all week saying the right things about their first-round playoff series against the defending champion Bucks, it’s time for action.
Most prognosticators have the Bucks eliminating the Bulls, but there’s a bigger picture to consider.
So, yes, this is only a first-round playoff series.

On a night the Bulls shot 32.3 percent overall and an unsightly 18.9 percent from 3-point range, the Bulls’ “Big Three” shot 21-for-71 overall and 4-for-22 from 3-point range.
You just gotta fight through it.”Added LaVine, on his miss: “I thought it was a good shot.
The Bucks’ “Big Three” didn’t exactly light the world on fire offensively either.
