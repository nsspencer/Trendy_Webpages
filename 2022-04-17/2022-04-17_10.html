     Sloppy start dooms Shea Patterson, Michigan Panthers in opening USFL loss to Houston Gamblers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Michigan Panthers fumbled on their first play as a new USFL franchise.
And while quarterback Shea Patterson jumped on that ball, sloppy play ultimately doomed the Panthers in their first game of USFL action since 1986.
The Panthers put the ball on the ground several times during the season-opening clash with the Houston Gamblers in Birmingham, turning the ball over three times as Houston won the game 17-12.
Patterson finished the game 17-for-24 for 192 yards a touchdown.
Former Florida State standout Reggie Northrup scooped up the loose ball and took it 87 yards for a touchdown.

     Michigan Panthers comeback, led by Shea Patterson, falls just short in USFL opener, 17-12
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Michigan Panthers' first game of the 2022 USFL season was delayed by nearly an hour due to inclement weather.
After forcing a punt on the first defensive possession of the season, Patterson took the field and the offense went backwards.
On the first play of the second quarter, however, Patterson tripped, got up and tried to extend the play on second-and-goal.
After an interception by Jameson Houston, Michigan got to the Houston 34-yard line where a fourth-down attempt was stuffed.
Next up, the Panthers (0-1) play the New Jersey Generals, who lost their opener Saturday night to Birmingham, on Friday at 8 p.m. (USA Network).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if he'd got both feet in, a chop-block penalty on the Panthers would've negated it, and that was the ballgame.
"Now, in the game of football, you don't turn the football over like we did and win very many (games)."
The Panthers' two turnovers came early in the second quarter, with the Panthers' on the Gamblers' 4.
Then, Michigan's Jameson Houston picked off a pass from Houston quarterback Clayton Thorson, giving the Panthers' new life.
And on the final drive, Patterson had led the Panthers' to the Gamblers' 14, before he fumbled a snap, pushing the Panthers back to the 21.
