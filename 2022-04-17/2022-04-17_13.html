    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount has called on his team mates to snap their losing streak in cup finals at Wembley Stadium and avenge their League Cup final loss to Liverpool when the two teams meet again in the FA Cup showpiece next month.
Mount scored the second goal in Chelsea’s hard-earned 2-0 victory over Palace at Wembley on Sunday to send them to their third straight FA Cup final.
“It’s definitely time for us to win a final at Wembley.
For myself it’s been five finals at Wembley, five finals I’ve lost,” said Mount, who has finished as a runner-up in three domestic finals since his breakthrough at Chelsea in 2019-20.
“I am happy to be a part of it (the FA Cup final) again.
