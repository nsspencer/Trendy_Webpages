     Summary: Get the latest on Cristiano Ronaldo, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for freeSupporters have delivered a split verdict on Erik ten Hag after watching the Manchester United manager-elect slip to defeat with Ajax in the Dutch Cup final on Sunday afternoon.
Ajax saw a would-be equaliser from Davy Klaassen chalked off by VAR as Ten Hag relinquished his hold on the trophy.
READ MORE: Erik ten Hag pattern with Ajax hints at first Manchester United transferHowever, the signs are that he will take over the reigns after Manchester Evening News reported last month that Ten Hag was a preferred candidate for the vacancy.
Mauricio Pochettino was the other front-runner and Ajax chief Gerry Hamstra shared an update on Ten Hag to United before the Rotterdam showpiece.
But were Ajax simply unlucky or Ten Hag play any part in PSV fighting back?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool and Manchester United have a rivalry that is storied.
Probably, it is one of the most fiercest rivalries in England and has produced several classics over the years.
On March 22, 2015, rivals Liverpool and Manchester United locked horns in a Premier League tie at the Anfield.
A brace from Juan Mata helped the Red Devils pick up a narrow yet important win which helped them to retain their place in the top four.
The Liverpool legend replaced Adam Lallana at the break but was shown a red card for a double challenge on Juan Mata and Ander Herrera.

     Summary: Liverpool are back in Premier League action on Tuesday as they face Manchester United in the Premier League and we can bring you our early prediction for the starting XI to take the field at Anfield.
After securing a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday, beating rivals Manchester City 3-2 at Wembley, the Reds can go back to the top of the Premier League with a victory against the Red Devils.
Despite Ibrahima Konate's impressive goalscoring performances of late, Joel Matip should return to partner Virgil van Dijk.
ForwardsIt seems that it is Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane plus one upfront when it comes to Klopp selecting his favoured starting XI.

     Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his third goal against Norwich.
CNN —Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club’s bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Despite a career highlight reel of free-kick goals, Ronaldo had not scored directly from one since September 2020 for Portugal.
No other United teammate has breached double figures in the league, with teammate and compatriot Bruno Fernandes the club’s second highest on nine goals.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's last meeting with Liverpool was a match to forget for almost everyone at Old Trafford.
It will be Ralf Rangnick's first contest against Liverpool and to ensure that his side are competitive, he could refer back to what went wrong in October.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge at the time and opted for 4-2-3-1, but his midfield department in particular suffered at the hands of a Jurgen Klopp tactical move.
The 63 year-old can solve the problem in a number of different ways, with a midfield three potentially on the cards.
By doing so, Liverpool would again have less space to maximise.

     Did Paul Pogba fail Manchester United or did they fail him?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly six years after the world-record £89.3m fee, the #Pogback hashtag and Stormzy announcement, and not to mention a substantial cut for Mino Raiola, Paul Pogba’s Manchester United career is finally approaching its ugly end game.
Having not reacted up to that point, Pogba responded just before he disappeared from view, cupping his right hand to his ear.
There was also the revelation, on the eve of a Manchester derby that Pogba decided in United’s favour, that Raiola had offered him to Manchester City.
But perhaps most importantly of all, Pogba has struggled to fulfil the most basic and fundamental of requirements: to be available.
In that respect, it is difficult to separate Pogba’s struggles at United from those of countless other major signings during the post-Ferguson era.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, Pogba cut his usual relaxed figure and wowed with a few moments of outrageous skill on the pitch.
The relationship between Pogba and United supporters has been frosty for the best part of three years.
Almost nothing has gone right for Pogba and United since, bar a decent patch of form after the lockdown in summer 2020.
Pogba will leave United this summer with just Europa League and League Cup winners' medals around his neck.
He's now 29 and, with his talent, should have been winning multiple league titles at club level.
