     Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift Manchester United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club's bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Having fired his 806th career goal en route to a hat-trick against Spurs in March, Ronaldo endured a torrid afternoon at Everton in his next league game after a defeat and an incident involving a young fan's mobile phone.
Ronaldo celebrates with his teammates after scoring his third goal.
The 37-year-old was on the scoresheet inside five minutes against Norwich, tapping home after teammate Anthony Elanga had dispossessed defender Ben Gibson close to goal.

After securing a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday, beating rivals Manchester City 3-2 at Wembley, the Reds can go back to the top of the Premier League with a victory against the Red Devils.
Despite Ibrahima Konate's impressive goalscoring performances of late, Joel Matip should return to partner Virgil van Dijk.
ForwardsIt seems that it is Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane plus one upfront when it comes to Klopp selecting his favoured starting XI.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's last meeting with Liverpool was a match to forget for almost everyone at Old Trafford.
It will be Ralf Rangnick's first contest against Liverpool and to ensure that his side are competitive, he could refer back to what went wrong in October.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge at the time and opted for 4-2-3-1, but his midfield department in particular suffered at the hands of a Jurgen Klopp tactical move.
The 63 year-old can solve the problem in a number of different ways, with a midfield three potentially on the cards.
By doing so, Liverpool would again have less space to maximise.

     Paul Pogba’s spat with Manchester United was the final straw, a new contract is now impossible
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OLD TRAFFORD – A Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick to seal a crucial victory would normally have Mancunians buzzing louder than ever on a sunny Easter weekend.
The scene down Deansgate in the aftermath would then resemble the strip in Magaluf, only with Ronaldo songs replacing the techno music.
Yet, the overriding feeling around Old Trafford as Ronaldo dragged another inept Manchester United display over the line against Norwich on Saturday was one of previously unseen vitriol, with one player in particular the target for supporter angst.
“I don’t think it makes sense to target any individual player,” Ralf Rangnick said.
But it has become ostensibly clear Pogba has downed tools in recent months, when fit, and fans have seen enough.

     Did Paul Pogba fail Manchester United or did they fail him?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly six years after the world-record £89.3m fee, the #Pogback hashtag and Stormzy announcement, and not to mention a substantial cut for Mino Raiola, Paul Pogba’s Manchester United career is finally approaching its ugly end game.
Having not reacted up to that point, Pogba responded just before he disappeared from view, cupping his right hand to his ear.
There was also the revelation, on the eve of a Manchester derby that Pogba decided in United’s favour, that Raiola had offered him to Manchester City.
But perhaps most importantly of all, Pogba has struggled to fulfil the most basic and fundamental of requirements: to be available.
In that respect, it is difficult to separate Pogba’s struggles at United from those of countless other major signings during the post-Ferguson era.
