     Police Search for Suspects After Two Killed in Mass Shooting at Pittsburgh Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police were looking for suspects and appealing for witnesses to come forward after two young men were shot to death after a large party in Pittsburgh degenerated into a barrage of gunfire shortly after midnight on Easter Sunday, the police said.
Eight more people suffered gunshot wounds, while another five were injured as they attempted to flee the scene.
“It’s heartbreaking,” the city’s police chief, Scott E. Schubert, said.
“How can you even have a holiday when something traumatic happened like this?”The incident is the fourth mass shooting to occur within the last week.
Just a day earlier, nine people were shot at a crowded South Carolina mall in Columbia, and then at least nine others were shot at a club in rural Hampton County, S.C. On Tuesday, 10 passengers were shot inside a subway car in New York City.

     Multiple suspects sought as mass shooting at Pittsburgh Airbnb house party leaves two dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two young men were killed and at least nine others injured in a mass shooting early Sunday in Pittsburgh, police said.
The shooting happened just after 12:30 a.m. during a party at a short-term rental property in the city’s North Side, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police said in a news release.
Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said multiple shooters were suspected due to different shell casings found at the scene, NBC affiliate WPXI reported.
The short-term rental business has a strict ban on parties, it said, and is taking action against the person who booked the space.
Airbnb said it was working with authorities and "we hope the people responsible for this bloodshed will be found quickly."
