     Jayson Tatum's game winner lifts Celtics over Nets in Game 1: 'It doesn't get any better than that'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum secured the game-winning layup at the buzzer, propelling the Boston Celtics to a 115-114 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.
"It doesn't get any better than that ‚Äî a buzzer-beater in a playoff game in front of our fans," Tatum said postgame.
It's also the first Celtics buzzer-beater in the playoffs since Paul Pierce against the Miami Heat in 2010.
Irving flipped off several Celtics fans during the game and said postgame that he was responding to their harsh words.
Kevin Durant, who joined the 30,000 career total points club (regular season and playoffs) during Sunday's game, recorded 23 points.

     Celtics vs. Nets takeaways: C's steal Game 1 on Jayson Tatum's buzzer-beater

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- We expected Celtics-Nets to be an entertaining series, but Game 1 set a pretty high bar.
Kyrie thrives in Boston spotlightThe Celtics had an 11-point lead entering the fourth quarter, but Irving erased it in a hurry.
His dagger 3-pointer with 45 seconds remaining put the Celtics' backs against the wall prior to Tatum's heroics.
Fortunately for Boston, Smart and Horford both came to play.
Horford's sharpshooting helped the Celtics stay in the game early when shots weren't falling for Boston.

     Summary: With just a few minutes to go in Game 1 of Boston‚Äôs first-round series against Brooklyn, the Celtics were on the verge of kicking the game away.
Boston‚Äôs crunch-time offense, a weakness in an otherwise stellar second half of the season, looked ragged.
They got the ball to Durant, the Nets‚Äô impossibly long superstar who was matched up with Jayson Tatum, the Celtics‚Äô equally long star.
‚ÄúLast second,‚Äù Smart said.
It fueled him, or as he said after the game, he ‚Äúembraced‚Äù the ‚Äúdark side.‚ÄùBoston‚Äôs perimeter defense is elite.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum hits a spinning layup at the buzzer to win Game 1 for the Celtics vs. the Nets.
Tatum made a layup at the buzzer on a pass from Marcus Smart to give Boston a dramatic 115-114 victory on Sunday in Game 1 of the first-round playoff series.
Durant and Irving still found ways to score, but they had to exert increased energy to get off their attempts.
The Celtics immediately went on a 9-2 run, before the Nets clawed back to tie the game up at 61 at the half.
"Stayed with it, took their shot and found a way to finish the game," Horford said.

     5 takeaways after an outstanding Celtics-Nets Game 1 in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That play leads off our five takeaways as we try to catch our breath in anticipation of Wednesday‚Äôs Game 2 at TD Garden:1.
Brown hit Marcus Smart, who passed on a shot to find a cutting Tatum, who spun around Irving for the buzzer-beating layup.
Udoka spoke before the game about the extra time Boston had in preparing for Brooklyn, and surely slowing down Durant was a topic of conversation.
So, naturally, increased physicality accompanies it, along with loose whistles from a tightly-officiated game in the first half.
By the time the game reached the 6:25 mark of the opening quarter, Boston had already entered the bonus, while Brooklyn sat just one foul away.
