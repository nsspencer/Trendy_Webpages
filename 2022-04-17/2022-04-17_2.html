     Summary: BOSTON -- We expected Celtics-Nets to be an entertaining series, but Game 1 set a pretty high bar.
Kyrie thrives in Boston spotlightThe Celtics had an 11-point lead entering the fourth quarter, but Irving erased it in a hurry.
His dagger 3-pointer with 45 seconds remaining put the Celtics' backs against the wall prior to Tatum's heroics.
Fortunately for Boston, Smart and Horford both came to play.
Horford's sharpshooting helped the Celtics stay in the game early when shots weren't falling for Boston.
