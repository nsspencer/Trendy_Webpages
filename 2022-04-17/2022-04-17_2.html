     Here's What Steve Nash Said About Kyrie Irving Before The Nets Played The Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Nash spoke to reporters before the Brooklyn Nets played the Boston Celtics in Game 1.
The Brooklyn Nets are in Massachusetts to take on the Boston Celtics on for Game 1 of their first-round playoff series on Sunday afternoon.
Before the game, head coach Steve Nash addressed the media, and said that he was not worried about Kyrie Irving heading into the series (he used to play for the Celtics, and the crowd is always hostile towards him).
"I don't worry about Kyrie," Nash said.
"Kyrie's been here a number of times , he's been here provably in a playoff sense and hostile environments dozens of times."

     Celtics vs Nets NBA Playoffs Series Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics, by contrast, won 28-of-35 to close the season after an 18-21 start, rising from No.
The Nets’ late-season recovery continued with a 40-point bruising of the Cavaliers in Brooklyn on Tuesday to officially secure the No.
On Saturday, Udoka teased defensive packages the team rarely played in all season as a possible adjustment later in the series.
With many clutch time finishes inevitable in this series, his ability to play next to Smart in smaller lineups will swing games for the Celtics.
The Celtics went 7-8 in clutch finishes after the new year and got outscored by 6.9 points per 100 possessions.

     Summary: BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - APRIL 17: Jayson Tatum #0 of the Boston Celtics takes a shot oaver Andre Drummond #0 of the Brooklyn Nets during the third quarter of Round 1 Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Eastern Conference Playoffs at TD Garden on April 17, 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts.
(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Marcus Smart hit Jayson Tatum for a cutting layup with zero seconds left on the clock, and the second-seeded Boston Celtics beat the Brooklyn Nets 115-114 in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.
The bucket spoiled Nets star and Boston villain Kyrie Irving's game-high 39 points.
Celtics star Jaylen Brown scored a quick layup out of a timeout.
The Celtics took their time on the final possession and nearly ran out of it, but a driving Smart found Tatum for a spinning layup as the clock hit zeroes.
