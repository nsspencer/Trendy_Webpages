     Summary: BOSTON ‚Äî There has been no love lost between Kyrie Irving and the Celtics fanbase over the past three years and that trend continued on Sunday afternoon at the TD Garden.
Irving was greeted with boos throughout starting lineup intros and constant ‚ÄòKyrie sucks‚Äô chants over the better part of three quarters.
New paradigm, baby.‚ÄùIt was the second straight year during which Irving made a controversial move at the TD Garden in the first round series.

I can speak on so many different things, but I‚Äôm going to choose not to.

What you guys saw and what you guys think is entertainment, or the fans think is entertainment ‚Äì all is fair in competition.
If somebody is going to call me out on my name, I'm going to look at them straight in the eye and see if they're really about it.

     Summary: With just a few minutes to go in Game 1 of Boston‚Äôs first-round series against Brooklyn, the Celtics were on the verge of kicking the game away.
Boston‚Äôs crunch-time offense, a weakness in an otherwise stellar second half of the season, looked ragged.
They got the ball to Durant, the Nets‚Äô impossibly long superstar who was matched up with Jayson Tatum, the Celtics‚Äô equally long star.
‚ÄúLast second,‚Äù Smart said.
It fueled him, or as he said after the game, he ‚Äúembraced‚Äù the ‚Äúdark side.‚ÄùBoston‚Äôs perimeter defense is elite.
