    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘‘We’ve done enough talking,’’ LaVine said several times in the weeks leading up to the Bulls’ first playoff appearance since 2017.
Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 16 rebounds, and the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks recovered after blowing a 16-point lead to beat the Bulls 93-86 in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.
So while the Bulls have spent all week saying the right things about their first-round playoff series against the defending champion Bucks, it’s time for action.
Most prognosticators have the Bucks eliminating the Bulls, but there’s a bigger picture to consider.
So, yes, this is only a first-round playoff series.

Chicago Bulls hit gold in the 1980sThe Bulls finally did something right in 1984, drafting the GOAT Michael Jordan.
It was so obvious that they were tanking, the Chicago Stadium fans began chanting, “Tulane Bulls, Tulane Bulls,” in the team’s final game.
The Bulls got their wish, playing a tough Bucks team whom they had a full fist fight with in the regular season.

     Summary: BOX SCORE:Bucks 93, Bulls 86The Bulls expect long-limbed, second-year forward Patrick Williams to become a lockdown defender, but the youngster had little hope in guarding two-time MVP Antetokounmpo.
Antetokounmpo had a double-double by the opening minutes of the second quarter.
The Bulls trimmed the lead down to 44-39 when Zach LaVine hit a three-pointer and then two free throws.
After their hot start, the Bucks were 6 for 22 (27.2%) overall in the second quarter.
Lopez added 18 points and Holiday 16 for the Bucks.

     Summary: Recent history for the Bulls first round playoff series against the, sigh, defending NBA champion Bucks, is not encouraging.
We know the numbers with this matchup, if not a rivalry other than for the Milwaukee fans trying to beat Bulls fans to the Ticketmaster call-in that always has so many Bulls fans at Bucks games.
The Bucks swept the regular season series 4-0, the last two games Bucks dominations with Brook Lopez working back into the lineup.
Holiday probably is the second most important player in the series for the Bucks because of his defense.
DeRozan was the Bulls' pack mule this season, fourth in the league in minutes played and 16th in games played.
