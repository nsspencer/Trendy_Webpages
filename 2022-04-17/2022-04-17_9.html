     Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift Manchester United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club's bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Having fired his 806th career goal en route to a hat-trick against Spurs in March, Ronaldo endured a torrid afternoon at Everton in his next league game after a defeat and an incident involving a young fan's mobile phone.
Ronaldo celebrates with his teammates after scoring his third goal.
The 37-year-old was on the scoresheet inside five minutes against Norwich, tapping home after teammate Anthony Elanga had dispossessed defender Ben Gibson close to goal.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool are back in Premier League action on Tuesday as they face Manchester United in the Premier League and we can bring you our early prediction for the starting XI to take the field at Anfield.
After securing a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday, beating rivals Manchester City 3-2 at Wembley, the Reds can go back to the top of the Premier League with a victory against the Red Devils.
Despite Ibrahima Konate's impressive goalscoring performances of late, Joel Matip should return to partner Virgil van Dijk.
ForwardsIt seems that it is Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane plus one upfront when it comes to Klopp selecting his favoured starting XI.

     Paul Pogba’s spat with Manchester United was the final straw, a new contract is now impossible
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OLD TRAFFORD – A Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick to seal a crucial victory would normally have Mancunians buzzing louder than ever on a sunny Easter weekend.
The scene down Deansgate in the aftermath would then resemble the strip in Magaluf, only with Ronaldo songs replacing the techno music.
Yet, the overriding feeling around Old Trafford as Ronaldo dragged another inept Manchester United display over the line against Norwich on Saturday was one of previously unseen vitriol, with one player in particular the target for supporter angst.
“I don’t think it makes sense to target any individual player,” Ralf Rangnick said.
But it has become ostensibly clear Pogba has downed tools in recent months, when fit, and fans have seen enough.

     Summary: Ralf Rangnick is losing patience with his Man Utd players, criticising their physicality and admitting nobody in the Premier League concedes goals like them.
"It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."
The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title.
"I mean, everybody has seen today's game," Rangnick said.
Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League.

PSV came from behind with two goals in as many minutes to defeat Erik Ten Hag's sideAjax had cause to be aggrieved as well.
They scored two goals disallowed by the most fractional of VAR offside calls.
Ajax believed they’d doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time, only for the video technology to intervene and deny them.
Ajax had further reason to believe the day was cursed when a second goal was disallowed by VAR for an offside minutes later.
