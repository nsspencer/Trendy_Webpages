     Terrell Owens catches touchdown pass in Fan Controlled Football League game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The year is 2022, not 2002, but Terrell Owens is still catching touchdown passes.
Owens, 48, declared his return to the gridiron earlier this month by joining the Fan Controlled Football League, which began its second season Saturday.
Once Owens stopped playing, he moved into the broadcast booth and interviewed players and coaches during the game.
The Fan Controlled Football League features seven players from each team on the field (three-man lines) on a 50-yard field.
Owens was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018 after a career that spanned from 1996 to 2010 with five All-Pro selections.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 48-year-old Terrell Owens caught a touchdown in his Fan Controlled Football debut on Saturday night.
I mean, obviously a little rusty, just got to get a little timing with some of the quarterbacks.
One can only imagine the conversations between Owens and Manziel.
I mean, there is a 19-year gap between the two, but it’s two of the biggest personalities in NFL history.
Terrell Owens and Johnny Manziel are on the Zappers, and they have seven games remaining.

     Terrell Owens caught a touchdown in his Fan Controlled Football debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bombastic receiver, who last played in the NFL 12 years ago, caught a touchdown pass in his Fan Controlled Football league debut on Saturday night, going up in the corner of the end zone to haul in a throw from Laquan Horton.
Owens plays for the Zappers, a team that counts Vikings running back Dalvin Cook and Mets pitcher Trevor May amongst its owners.
The FCF is a spring football league trying to gain traction, in which fans control a seven-on-seven game, voting on offensive plays in real-time.
Terrell Owens (81) playing for the Zappers in a Fan Controlled Football game on April 16, 2022.
Of course, such a scenario would be a step above the Fan Controlled Football league, and it borders on impossible to suggest Owens would even be able to play in the CFL, let alone the NFL.
