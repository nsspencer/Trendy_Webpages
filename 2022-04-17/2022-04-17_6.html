     Summary: Ultimately, only Cantlay could, shooting a three-under 68.
The U.S. Ryder Cup teammates each found the fairway off the tee when replaying the 18th hole, but each hit their approach shots in the front greenside bunker.
It turned out Cantlay's ball was plugged, so when Spieth blasted his sand shot to tap-in range for par, Cantlay knew his work was cut out for him.
He could only get his ball 30 feet past the hole, then missed the par effort left.

He couldn't get it anywhere close to the hole, and Spieth stole a tournament he perhaps shouldn't have won.

The RBC Heritage marked his second win since the 2017 Open Championship but the 13th overall in his career.
