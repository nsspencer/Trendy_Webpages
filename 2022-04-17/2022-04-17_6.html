     Jordan Spieth claims 2022 RBC Heritage via playoff with Patrick Cantlay for first win as a father
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam SchupakGolfweekDespite struggling with his putting all week, Jordan Spieth sank the putt when it mattered most.
That was enough to finish at 13-under 271 and return to 18 and make a par this time at the first playoff hole to defeat Patrick Cantlay and win the PGA Tour’s 2022 RBC Heritage.
To make matters worse, he missed an 18-inch par putt at the last and entered the final round trailing by three strokes.
He missed a 5-foot par putt.
“It’s striking to see him struggle with the putter,” CBS Sports analyst Dottie Pepper said before Spieth attempted a 13-foot birdie putt.

     Jordan Spieth is the RBC Heritage champ thanks to his own unique bravado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, Varner, the 54-hole leader, was hunting for his first PGA Tour win and had been fueled through Saturday by a second-round ruling that had irritated him.
That fuel ran out on Sunday, when he was one of just two players in the top 10 who failed to break 70.
His round of one-under 70 concluded with a stretch of nine straight pars.
It was his iron game that let him down—on hole after hole on the back nine, he left himself with extremely long birdie putts and could do no better than a two-putt.
On the 18th, needing birdie to tie, his 36-footer slid by on the right side, consigning him a T-3 finish.

     Summary: Jordan Spieth birdied the 72nd hole then parred in a playoff for his 13th PGA Tour win.
He made an even bigger shot at Harbour Town’s signature hole in a playoff to win the RBC Heritage.
In the playoff, Cantlay also hit into the front bunker, with his lie looking like a fried egg.
Others besides Cantlay, who missed a 15-footer for birdie on his 72nd hole, had a chance to catch Spieth.
“What a great tournament to win,” Spieth said.

     Summary: Tour Confidential: Jordan Spieth is back again, Tiger, Phil and rulesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailJordan Spieth hits his tee shot on Sunday on the 9th hole at Harbour Town Golf Links.
Sens: The question is where: on the PGA Tour or in one of Norman’s LIV Golf events.
The one-off nature of the events will make for some interesting potential waiver requests with the PGA Tour, though.
As a result, if you’re a PGA Tour pro playing well, savor that moment!
But at the same time, one thing I have always thought about is that most pro athletes retire from their sport and … play golf.
