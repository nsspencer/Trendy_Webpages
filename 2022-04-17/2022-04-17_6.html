    </h2>

     Summary: MIAMI -- The Heat's defense might have suffocated Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young all game in Sunday's 115-91 Game 1 win of their first-round series, but the East's No.
His 8.3% shooting mark was tied for the worst field goal percentage of his career -- including the regular season and playoffs -- according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.
The Heat switched 21 times against Young in Game 1, according to Second Spectrum, allowing 0.8 points per direct pick.
During the regular season, Young averaged 0.96 points per direct pick against all opposing defenses that switched against him, showing Miami's expertise in that department on Sunday.
"You have to win four games to win a series, you don't win one and win it all," Young said.
