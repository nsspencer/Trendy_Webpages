Patrick Vieira's Palace had defended well to contain Chelsea until Loftus-Cheek broke the deadlock and were nearly rewarded for a gritty display, with Cheikhou Kouyate twice coming close.
I thought the Carabao (League) Cup final was a fantastic game that could have gone either way.

     By reaching FA Cup final, Chelsea can redeem a season derailed by uncertainty and ownership drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Expectations are palpably lower at Palace -- this was only their second FA Cup semifinal since 1995 -- and Tuchel possesses a squad with much greater depth as a result.
We were here last season in the FA Cup final, we are here again, and that means an unbelievable lot to us because the FA Cup is the most prestigious, the most traditional cup in the world maybe, played at Wembley.
Chelsea punched their way past Crystal Palace on Sunday to reach the FA Cup final for the third consecutive time.
And this will be a third FA Cup final in a row after losing to Arsenal in 2020 under Lampard and Leicester City last year, heightening the sense of Chelsea coming full circle.
"But this is what a cup final is about -- it is about winning.
