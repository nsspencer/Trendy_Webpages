     Terrell Owens catches touchdown in fan-controlled spring football league
    </h2>

     Summary: Terrell Owens is adamant that he could make it back to the league one day.
For now, the 48-year old legend is playing in the Fan Controlled Football League with the FCF Zappers, a unique organization that has some aspects controlled by a fan vote.
"If Tom Brady can do it, if they can marvel at some of the things he's done, I'm no different than Tom," Owens told ESPN.
"So if (an opportunity to play in the NFL) arises or comes about because of playing in Fan Controlled Football league because they see me take hits ... then so be it.
