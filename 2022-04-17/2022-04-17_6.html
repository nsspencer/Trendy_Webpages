     Summary: The Manchester United no.7 scored his 60th career treble to inspire the Reds to a 3-2 win over Norwich City on Saturday afternoon.
Three goals came from Ronaldo, and three points came to United, who now sit fifth in the Premier League table with hopes of achieving a top-four finish slightly bolstered.
It was Mata who stood alongside Cristiano as a well-positioned free-kick waited to be struck in the 76th minute.
Ronaldo scored it to complete a significant personal achievement and, more importantly, the victory.
Mata has scored some stunning free-kicks for United in his time at Old Trafford, and he could only watch and applaud Ronaldo’s effort.

     Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his third goal against Norwich.
CNN —Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club’s bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Despite a career highlight reel of free-kick goals, Ronaldo had not scored directly from one since September 2020 for Portugal.
No other United teammate has breached double figures in the league, with teammate and compatriot Bruno Fernandes the club’s second highest on nine goals.

     Ralf Rangnick critical of Manchester United: Nobody in Premier League concedes goals like this

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ralf Rangnick is losing patience with his Man Utd players, criticising their physicality and admitting nobody in the Premier League concedes goals like them.
"It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."
The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title.
"I mean, everybody has seen today's game," Rangnick said.
Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League.

PSV came from behind with two goals in as many minutes to defeat Erik Ten Hag's sideAjax had cause to be aggrieved as well.
They scored two goals disallowed by the most fractional of VAR offside calls.
Ajax believed they’d doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time, only for the video technology to intervene and deny them.
Ajax had further reason to believe the day was cursed when a second goal was disallowed by VAR for an offside minutes later.
