     Summary: Nine people were shot and another five were injured while fleeing a shooting Saturday at Columbiana Centre mall with no deaths, according to the Columbia Police Department.
Investigators believe three people displayed guns inside the mall and investigators are working to determine how many people fired, according to the statement.
Holbrook said the injuries were mostly from gunfire, with victims from age 15 to 73, and several were injured as people were fleeing.
"This was not a situation where someone showed up and at random fired a gun to hurt people," Holbrook said.
The mall released a statement through the police department: “Today’s isolated, senseless act of violence is extremely upsetting and our thoughts are with everyone impacted.
