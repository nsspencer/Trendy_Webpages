     Summary: Ultimately, only Cantlay could, shooting a three-under 68.
The U.S. Ryder Cup teammates each found the fairway off the tee when replaying the 18th hole, but each hit their approach shots in the front greenside bunker.
It turned out Cantlay's ball was plugged, so when Spieth blasted his sand shot to tap-in range for par, Cantlay knew his work was cut out for him.
He could only get his ball 30 feet past the hole, then missed the par effort left.

     Summary: To make matters worse, he missed an 18-inch par putt at the last and entered the final round trailing by three strokes.
When he was too aggressive with his birdie putt at the 11th, Spieth missed the comebacker from 5 feet to drop to 11 under.
Shane Lowry climbed to 14 under after a 20-foot birdie putt at 11 and gained a two-stroke edge.
But Straka missed a 10-foot par putt at 18 and fell back into a seven-way tie for third.
On the first playoff hole, both players hit into the front greenside bunker at 18.

     2022 RBC Heritage leaderboard: Jordan Spieth edges Patrick Cantlay in playoff for another Easter Sunday win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just over 12 months later, he took the RBC Heritage in a sudden death playoff over Patrick Cantlay the week after teeing it up at Augusta National.
He couldn't get it anywhere close to the hole, and Spieth stole a tournament he perhaps shouldn't have won.
It had been over a year since Spieth last won on the PGA Tour as he took the Texas Open last Easter Sunday.
The RBC Heritage marked his second win since the 2017 Open Championship but the 13th overall in his career.
"Last week was really a killer for me: my favorite tournament in the world, not getting to play the weekend.
