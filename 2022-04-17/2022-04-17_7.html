     Terrell Owens caught a touchdown in his Fan Controlled Football debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bombastic receiver, who last played in the NFL 12 years ago, caught a touchdown pass in his Fan Controlled Football league debut on Saturday night, going up in the corner of the end zone to haul in a throw from Laquan Horton.
Owens plays for the Zappers, a team that counts Vikings running back Dalvin Cook and Mets pitcher Trevor May amongst its owners.
The FCF is a spring football league trying to gain traction, in which fans control a seven-on-seven game, voting on offensive plays in real-time.
Terrell Owens (81) playing for the Zappers in a Fan Controlled Football game on April 16, 2022.
Of course, such a scenario would be a step above the Fan Controlled Football league, and it borders on impossible to suggest Owens would even be able to play in the CFL, let alone the NFL.
