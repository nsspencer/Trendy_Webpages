     Jordan Spieth is the RBC Heritage champ thanks to his own unique bravado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, Varner, the 54-hole leader, was hunting for his first PGA Tour win and had been fueled through Saturday by a second-round ruling that had irritated him.
That fuel ran out on Sunday, when he was one of just two players in the top 10 who failed to break 70.
His round of one-under 70 concluded with a stretch of nine straight pars.
It was his iron game that let him down—on hole after hole on the back nine, he left himself with extremely long birdie putts and could do no better than a two-putt.
On the 18th, needing birdie to tie, his 36-footer slid by on the right side, consigning him a T-3 finish.

He improved his career playoff record on the PGA TOUR to 5-3.
On the first playoff hole (18th hole) against Cantlay, both players ended up in the bunker in front of the green.
Those 17 individuals have now combined to capture 96 all-time PGA TOUR victories.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When he was too aggressive with his birdie putt at the 11th, Spieth missed the comebacker from 5 feet to drop to 11 under.
“It’s striking to see him struggle with the putter,” CBS Sports analyst Dottie Pepper said before Spieth attempted a 13-foot birdie putt.
Shane Lowry climbed to 14 under after a 20-foot birdie putt at 11 and gained a two-stroke edge.
On the first playoff hole, both players hit into the front greenside bunker at 18.
This approach on the first playoff hole sealed the victory @RBC_Heritage.

     Summary: Tour Confidential: Jordan Spieth is back again, Tiger, Phil and rulesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailJordan Spieth hits his tee shot on Sunday on the 9th hole at Harbour Town Golf Links.
Sens: The question is where: on the PGA Tour or in one of Norman’s LIV Golf events.
The one-off nature of the events will make for some interesting potential waiver requests with the PGA Tour, though.
As a result, if you’re a PGA Tour pro playing well, savor that moment!
But at the same time, one thing I have always thought about is that most pro athletes retire from their sport and … play golf.
