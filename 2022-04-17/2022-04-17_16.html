     Danny Elfman Flexes Musical Muscles At Coachella With “Unhinged Hardcore” Version Of ‘Simpsons’ Theme; Songs From ‘Pee Wee,’ ‘Nightmare’ And ‘Batman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coachella Night 2 was, by many accounts, dominated by the festival’s youngest and oldest performers.
Headliner Billie Eilish, 20, delivered what was deemed a strong, history-making performance as the festival’s youngest-ever headliner.
The latter included an “unhinged hardcore remake” of his Simpsons theme, the Spider-Man main title, “Breakfast Machine” from Pee Wee’s Big Adventure, “Ice Dance/The Grand Finale” from Edward Scissorhands, “Alice’s Theme” from Alice in Wonderland as well as his Batman theme and “Jack’s Lament/This Is Halloween/What’s This?” from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
“It was a very strange, downright bonkers show indeed,” wrote Yahoo’s Lyndsey Parker, but it was far from “little.”See his performance of the Simpsons theme — complete with big-screen animation from the show — and a bit of “Dead Man’s Party” below.
Nothing quite like The Simpsons Theme being performed live at Coachella by Danny Elfman !!
