     Cincinnati Reds' Hunter Greene sets new MLB record with 39 pitches of 100+ mph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB.com's Sarah Langs confirmed that Greene's 34th pitch of 100+ miles per hour set a new MLB record for a start.
Greene left the game with one out in the bottom of the 6th inning, having thrown 80 pitches.
"A great outing - you can't do much better than that against that lineup," Reds manager David Bell said of Greene's start after the game.
Really good slider.
His fastball had great life on it, and he was also locating it - which makes for a tough at-bat.

     Reds Rookie Hunter Greene Made MLB History Against Dodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Reds rookie Hunter Greene made his MLB debut against the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves last week, then drew the Los Angeles Dodgers in what marked the first of what should be several homecomings.
The Reds selected Greene out of Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks with the second overall pick in the 2017 MLB Draft.
He grew up attending games at Dodger Stadium and was looking forward to facing the Dodgers.
Greene finished with six strikeouts and kept the game knotted in a scoreless tie until Turner’s home run in the sixth inning.

     Hunter Greene broke an MLB record for 100 MPH pitches, including a 102 MPH scorcher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We talked last week about how Hunter Greene’s pitching debut for the Cincinnati Reds proved he can exceed the hype.
And in his second start, facing the super-dangerous Los Angeles Dodgers?
I’d say he exceeded the hype that he had exceeded last week.
Greene set an MLB record on Saturday for number of pitches thrown in the triple digits, and even though he didn’t get a W in the 5-2 loss to the National League juggernaut, he still put up a terrific line with 5.1 innings pitches, two earned runs on just a two-run homer given up to Trea Turner, five hits, no walks and six Ks.
But it’s one pitch that you have to see, along with a bunch of others:

     Summary: Cincinnati rookie Hunter Greene strikes out Freddie Freeman with three pitches over 100 mph to add to his huge game.
(0:16)LOS ANGELES -- On a cool Southern California evening, Cincinnati Reds rookie Hunter Greene brought some record-setting heat.
The moment finally hit Greene in the third inning, but only emotionally.
"I wish we would have come out with a win, but it was a really, really fun time," Greene said.
The Dodgers added two more runs, one charged to Greene, when Chris Taylor hit a two-run single with two outs.

     Reds notebook: A secret adjustment was key to Hunter Greene's success with his fastball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES – David Bell noticed a change during the last two innings Hunter Greene pitched in spring training on the final day the Cincinnati Reds were in Arizona.
Greene, in his final tune-up prior to the regular season, was roughed up in his first two innings against the Seattle Mariners.
As hitters focus more on trying to catch up to the fastball, Greene’s slider becomes more effective.
“I’ll leave it at that.”A key for Greene is his ability to locate his fastball on the inside part of the plate.
"We do need to make a decision, (Monday) at the latest, to get him back as soon as possible if he does have to go on the IL," Bell said.

     Hunter Greene destroys records, but Reds drop 5th straight game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The record for pitches thrown 100+ MPH was 33 from Jacob DeGrom.
Tonight, Hunter Greene threw 39 pitches above 100+ in his hometown of Los Angeles.
The Reds offense was completely shut down again in Los Angeles until a too little, too late rally in the 9th.
The Reds collected just four hits on the night in route to their 5th straight loss to fall to 2-7 on the young season.
No matter how much of a struggle it is right now for this team, Hunter Greene should give Reds fans plenty to feel good about for the future.
