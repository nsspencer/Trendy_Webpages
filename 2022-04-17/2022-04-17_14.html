     USFL’s second day delayed by weather
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe USFL scheduled three games for today at Protective Field in Birmingham.
The first game, Houston Gamblers vs. Michigan Panthers, was scheduled for a noon Eastern Time kickoff, but has been delayed by bad weather in Birmingham.
It is not clear when the game, which airs on NBC and Peacock, will actually kick off.
The USFL decided to play all of its games in Birmingham to cut costs for its opening season.
But there are risks involved in that approach, and we’re witnessing one of them right now.
