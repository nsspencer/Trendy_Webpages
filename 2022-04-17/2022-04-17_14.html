     Summary: Two young men were killed and at least nine others injured in a mass shooting early Sunday in Pittsburgh, police said.
The shooting happened just after 12:30 a.m. during a party at a short-term rental property in the city’s North Side, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police said in a news release.
Airbnb condemned the shooting in a statement Sunday, offering the company's condolences to the families of the victims.

Airbnb said it was working with authorities and "we hope the people responsible for this bloodshed will be found quickly."
