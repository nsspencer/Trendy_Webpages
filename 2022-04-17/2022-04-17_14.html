     Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift Manchester United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club's bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Having fired his 806th career goal en route to a hat-trick against Spurs in March, Ronaldo endured a torrid afternoon at Everton in his next league game after a defeat and an incident involving a young fan's mobile phone.
Ronaldo celebrates with his teammates after scoring his third goal.
The 37-year-old was on the scoresheet inside five minutes against Norwich, tapping home after teammate Anthony Elanga had dispossessed defender Ben Gibson close to goal.

     Ralf Rangnick critical of Manchester United: Nobody in Premier League concedes goals like this

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ralf Rangnick is losing patience with his Man Utd players, criticising their physicality and admitting nobody in the Premier League concedes goals like them.
"It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."
The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title.
"I mean, everybody has seen today's game," Rangnick said.
Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League.

     Paul Pogba’s spat with Manchester United was the final straw, a new contract is now impossible
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OLD TRAFFORD – A Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick to seal a crucial victory would normally have Mancunians buzzing louder than ever on a sunny Easter weekend.
The scene down Deansgate in the aftermath would then resemble the strip in Magaluf, only with Ronaldo songs replacing the techno music.
Yet, the overriding feeling around Old Trafford as Ronaldo dragged another inept Manchester United display over the line against Norwich on Saturday was one of previously unseen vitriol, with one player in particular the target for supporter angst.
“I don’t think it makes sense to target any individual player,” Ralf Rangnick said.
But it has become ostensibly clear Pogba has downed tools in recent months, when fit, and fans have seen enough.
