     How the New Orleans Pelicans can upset the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans will enter the NBA playoffs as the 8th seed and huge underdogs against the Phoenix Suns.
Booker scored 30 in a loss against the Pelicans, and New Orleans will probably have to live with big games from him.
Jonas Valanciunas and Jaxson Hayes have to dominate the boardsIn their win over Phoenix this season, the Pels out-rebounded the Suns 53-37, including 16 offensive rebounds for New Orleans.
This is an area where they have an advantage over the smaller Suns, who start Jae Crowder at power forward.
Valanciunas grabbed 17 rebounds in the win and will have to handily dominate Ayton on the boards for the Pelicans to have a fighting chance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight, the Phoenix Suns square off against the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the NBA playoffs.
Although the Suns remain heavily favored in this series, the Pelicans are a well-coached, up-and-coming team that cannot be taken lightly.
Mikal Bridges vs Brandon IngramThe Warden vs mini-KD in Brandon Ingram represent possibly the most important matchup in this series.
Deandre Ayton vs The NOLA BigsOffensive rebounding and second chance points are a major part of the Pelicans’ offense.
This year was no different, as he averaged 20.7 points and 14.7 boards per game in his four contests vs the Suns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — It does not feel after Game 1 of a first-round opener that the Phoenix Suns won’t beat the New Orleans Pelicans.
Behind an explosion of a fourth quarter from Chris Paul that landed him 30 points by the end of the game, Phoenix won comfortably, 110-99 on Sunday at Footprint Center.
Anytime a team can hold an opponent to 38% shooting for a game, a lot is going right.
The Suns won the paint points, 50-38, with the Pelicans’ own interior defense more wide open than any swinging saloon door from any old Western movie of your choosing.
Coming off a game that saw his team hold the Pelicans to 38% shooting, you’d imagine the Suns won’t be the ones making wholesale changes to their gameplans.

“Classic Chris,” Suns coach Monty Williams said.
The ageless veteran will turn 37 later in these playoffs if the Suns advance far enough, but once again looked a decade younger.
He scored 17 straight points for the Suns at one point in the fourth.
Suns big man Deandre Ayton was particularly dominant on the defensive end with four blocks, and had 21 points and nine rebounds.

At every Suns home game, the Footprint Center's center-hung video board gives fans a glimpse inside the team's energetic pregame huddle.
While many Suns players have intricate handshakes that involve dance moves, two-time All-Star Devin Booker keeps it simple with a dap and a hug.
