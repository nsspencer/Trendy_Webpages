     Soccer-Chelsea beat Palace to book Liverpool clash in FA Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Second-half goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount saw Chelsea overcome Crystal Palace 2-0 in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday and set up a showdown with Liverpool.
Former Palace loanee Loftus-Cheek put Chelsea ahead after 65 minutes when Kai Havertz’s cross from the right took a deflection out to the winger, who hammered a shot that hit defender Joachim Andersen and flew into the net.
Mount added a crucial second goal just over 10 minutes later and sealed the victory for Chelsea, playing Timo Werner’s ball from the edge of the box past Andersen with his first touch and burying it past goalkeeper Jack Butland with his second.
Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea ground down a hard-working Palace team and will meet Liverpool at Wembley again in a re-match of the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties in February.

     Summary: This is a player who has had to endure so much since making his Chelsea debut eight years ago.
They looked weary after having their hearts broken by Real in the Champions League but Palace could not take advantage.
The only thing that seems certain is Chelsea must trust Tuchel, who has guided them to six major finals.
There was no way back for Palace, for whom Eberechi Eze was disappointing, even though Vieira responded by introducing Michael Olise and Christian Benteke.
The midfielder was too quick for Palace and his cool finish ensured that Chelsea will be back at Wembley to face Liverpool again.

     Summary: Expectations are palpably lower at Palace -- this was only their second FA Cup semifinal since 1995 -- and Tuchel possesses a squad with much greater depth as a result.
We were here last season in the FA Cup final, we are here again, and that means an unbelievable lot to us because the FA Cup is the most prestigious, the most traditional cup in the world maybe, played at Wembley.
Chelsea punched their way past Crystal Palace on Sunday to reach the FA Cup final for the third consecutive time.
And this will be a third FA Cup final in a row after losing to Arsenal in 2020 under Lampard and Leicester City last year, heightening the sense of Chelsea coming full circle.
