     Summary: BOSTON -- While Celtics vs. Nets produced a thrilling heavyweight bout Sunday at TD Garden, there was an equally entertaining undercard: Kyrie Irving vs. the fans.
Celtics fans, as expected, booed Irving mercilessly throughout Game 1 of Boston's first-round NBA playoff matchup with Brooklyn.
So, why engage with Celtics fans in this way and invite even more vitriol?
"It's the same energy they have for me, and I'm gonna have the same energy for them.
Celtics fans likely will continue to jeer Irving in Game 2 on Wednesday night.

     Summary: Jayson Tatum secured the game-winning layup at the buzzer, propelling the Boston Celtics to a 115-114 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.
"It doesn't get any better than that ‚Äî a buzzer-beater in a playoff game in front of our fans," Tatum said postgame.
It's also the first Celtics buzzer-beater in the playoffs since Paul Pierce against the Miami Heat in 2010.
Irving flipped off several Celtics fans during the game and said postgame that he was responding to their harsh words.
Kevin Durant, who joined the 30,000 career total points club (regular season and playoffs) during Sunday's game, recorded 23 points.

     Summary: After an 82-game regular season and a riveting play-in tournament, the 2022 NBA Playoffs have finally begun.
While the NBA doesn't often see many major first-round upsets, this year we have some intriguing matchups that could lead to some unexpected results.
The Nets were a preseason favorite to win the title, but endured injuries, part-time players and a mid-season trade that led them to a disappointing regular season.
They showed off their firepower in the play-in win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, however, with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving comprising anything but a normal seventh seed.
With the playoffs set to begin on Saturday, our CBS Sports NBA experts have taken a stab at predicting every first-round series.
