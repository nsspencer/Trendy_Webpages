    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We start off Easter Sunday with cool and breezy conditions with some sunshine, but that sunshine will be quickly replaced by clouds later this morning and into this afternoon as upper level energy passes through the region.
Highs south reach the upper 40s to mid 50s, 40 across the north along with a gusty northwest wind.
Other than a stray shower early tonight, clouds will clear which will allow temperatures to drop into the mid to upper 30s across much of southern New England, upper 20s to low 30s north.
Thankfully, it’s looking like a great day for the runners with cool temperatures, morning sunshine, some afternoon clouds, and light winds!
It’ll be chilly in Hopkinton with temps starting out in the mid 30s early, rising into the upper 30s to around 40 by mid-morning when the race goes off.
