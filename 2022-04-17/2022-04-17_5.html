     Jayson Tatum's game winner lifts Celtics over Nets in Game 1: 'It doesn't get any better than that'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum secured the game-winning layup at the buzzer, propelling the Boston Celtics to a 115-114 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.
"It doesn't get any better than that — a buzzer-beater in a playoff game in front of our fans," Tatum said postgame.
It's also the first Celtics buzzer-beater in the playoffs since Paul Pierce against the Miami Heat in 2010.
Irving flipped off several Celtics fans during the game and said postgame that he was responding to their harsh words.
Kevin Durant, who joined the 30,000 career total points club (regular season and playoffs) during Sunday's game, recorded 23 points.

     Summary: BOSTON -- While Celtics vs. Nets produced a thrilling heavyweight bout Sunday at TD Garden, there was an equally entertaining undercard: Kyrie Irving vs. the fans.
Celtics fans, as expected, booed Irving mercilessly throughout Game 1 of Boston's first-round NBA playoff matchup with Brooklyn.
So, why engage with Celtics fans in this way and invite even more vitriol?
"It's the same energy they have for me, and I'm gonna have the same energy for them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just a few minutes to go in Game 1 of Boston’s first-round series against Brooklyn, the Celtics were on the verge of kicking the game away.
Boston’s crunch-time offense, a weakness in an otherwise stellar second half of the season, looked ragged.
They got the ball to Durant, the Nets’ impossibly long superstar who was matched up with Jayson Tatum, the Celtics’ equally long star.
“Last second,” Smart said.
It fueled him, or as he said after the game, he “embraced” the “dark side.”Boston’s perimeter defense is elite.

Nets vs. CelticsCeltics win series (-130, DraftKings)It’s never easy betting against Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in a seven game series, but based on the numbers, I have to do it.
The Celtics are the more complete team and if they’re capable of decreasing the efficiency of Durant and Irving just slightly, they should win this series.
Tatum’s 54-point game against the Nets in March showed that he can be the best player in this series.
In four games against the Bulls the season, the Bucks won all them by an average margin of 14.7 points.
