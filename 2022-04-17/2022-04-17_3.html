     Victorville mall-shooting victim, 9, gets Easter surprise with beloved characters, gifts
    </h2>

     Summary: Marqel Cockrell, a 20-year-old co-owner of the shoe store Sole Addicts in the Mall of Victor Valley, was arrested in Nevada a few hours after the shooting.
The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department says the shooting was aimed at shoplifters fleeing his store.
Williams brought gifts while wearing an Easter Bunny costume — with an extra outfit underneath that traditional garb, the trademark suit of Marvel character Deadpool.
Cockrell, 20, fled to Nevada after he struck the little girl — but will be extradited to California to face an attempted murder charge.

As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated.

In the scriptures leading up to His crucifixion, Jesus warned His followers that this would happen on three separate occasions (Luke 9:21-27; Luke 9:43b-50; Luke 18:31-34).
When we choose Jesus as Savior, we are accepting the promise of God’s word: eternal life (John 14:1-6).

     Summary: The pope makes an Easter plea for peace in Ukraine, citing a nuclear riskEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Alessandra Tarantino/APVATICAN CITY — On what is supposed to be Christianity's most joyful day, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in the "senseless" war in Ukraine and in other armed conflicts raging in the world, and cited the "troubling" risk of nuclear warfare.
Applause erupted from many of the 50,000 people in the square and on a nearby avenue when he mentioned Ukraine.
"Please, please, let us not get used to war,'' Francis pleaded, after denouncing "the flexing of muscles while people are suffering."
Yet again, the pontiff decried the war in Ukraine without citing Russian President Vladimir Putin for the decision to launch the invasion and attack against Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The leader of the Anglican church said Easter is a time for peace and not "blood and iron."

Yet something happens on Easter morning.
In some ways, churchgoers are not unlike Jesus' disciples on Easter morning -- they're finding unexpected joy after living so long with fear, Vile says.
Where the story of Easter and the pandemic meetThere are, of course, many challenges ahead for Christian churches on this Easter morning.
But even for those who have been lost, the symbol of the empty tomb on Easter morning is more powerful than the story of the pandemic, Robinson says.

     Summary: During the 18th and 19th centuries, German immigrants imported the idea of an Easter hare giving eggs to children to the United States.
In this Easter postcard, an Easter bunny paints an Easter egg as a baby chick watches below.
According to Hann, Queen Victoria had German ancestry and is seen as popularizing Easter egg hunts in England.
Children rush to pick up Easter eggs provided by the New Denver church.
As time passed, what was originally a German tradition of hunting for Easter eggs became more widespread and practiced outside of Europe.
