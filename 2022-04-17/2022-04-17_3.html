     Summary: How Cristiano Ronaldo Earned £850,000 From Goal Bonuses In Man United's Win Over NorwichCristiano Ronaldo is said to have earned an extra £850,000 in goal bonuses during Manchester United's 3-2 win over Norwich on Saturday.
Ronaldo scored his 60th career hat-trick to help United pick up three Premier League points at Old Trafford.

     Summary: The Manchester United no.7 scored his 60th career treble to inspire the Reds to a 3-2 win over Norwich City on Saturday afternoon.
Three goals came from Ronaldo, and three points came to United, who now sit fifth in the Premier League table with hopes of achieving a top-four finish slightly bolstered.
It was Mata who stood alongside Cristiano as a well-positioned free-kick waited to be struck in the 76th minute.
Ronaldo scored it to complete a significant personal achievement and, more importantly, the victory.
Mata has scored some stunning free-kicks for United in his time at Old Trafford, and he could only watch and applaud Ronaldo’s effort.

     Cristiano Ronaldo scores another hat-trick to lift Manchester United's top four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second Premier League hat-trick in three games to fire Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich at Old Trafford on Saturday, strengthening the club's bid to qualify for the Champions League.
Yet a near-perfect weekend for Ronaldo and United saw top-four competitors Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both suffer defeat, as United move into fifth with six games left.
Having fired his 806th career goal en route to a hat-trick against Spurs in March, Ronaldo endured a torrid afternoon at Everton in his next league game after a defeat and an incident involving a young fan's mobile phone.
Ronaldo celebrates with his teammates after scoring his third goal.
The 37-year-old was on the scoresheet inside five minutes against Norwich, tapping home after teammate Anthony Elanga had dispossessed defender Ben Gibson close to goal.

     Summary: Liverpool are back in Premier League action on Tuesday as they face Manchester United in the Premier League and we can bring you our early prediction for the starting XI to take the field at Anfield.
After securing a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday, beating rivals Manchester City 3-2 at Wembley, the Reds can go back to the top of the Premier League with a victory against the Red Devils.
Despite Ibrahima Konate's impressive goalscoring performances of late, Joel Matip should return to partner Virgil van Dijk.
ForwardsIt seems that it is Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane plus one upfront when it comes to Klopp selecting his favoured starting XI.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OLD TRAFFORD – A Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick to seal a crucial victory would normally have Mancunians buzzing louder than ever on a sunny Easter weekend.
The scene down Deansgate in the aftermath would then resemble the strip in Magaluf, only with Ronaldo songs replacing the techno music.
Yet, the overriding feeling around Old Trafford as Ronaldo dragged another inept Manchester United display over the line against Norwich on Saturday was one of previously unseen vitriol, with one player in particular the target for supporter angst.
“I don’t think it makes sense to target any individual player,” Ralf Rangnick said.
But it has become ostensibly clear Pogba has downed tools in recent months, when fit, and fans have seen enough.

     Summary: Ralf Rangnick is losing patience with his Man Utd players, criticising their physicality and admitting nobody in the Premier League concedes goals like them.
"It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."
The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title.
"I mean, everybody has seen today's game," Rangnick said.
Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League.
