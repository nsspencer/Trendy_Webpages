In the scriptures leading up to His crucifixion, Jesus warned His followers that this would happen on three separate occasions (Luke 9:21-27; Luke 9:43b-50; Luke 18:31-34).
When we choose Jesus as Savior, we are accepting the promise of God’s word: eternal life (John 14:1-6).

     Summary: The pope makes an Easter plea for peace in Ukraine, citing a nuclear riskEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Alessandra Tarantino/APVATICAN CITY — On what is supposed to be Christianity's most joyful day, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in the "senseless" war in Ukraine and in other armed conflicts raging in the world, and cited the "troubling" risk of nuclear warfare.
Applause erupted from many of the 50,000 people in the square and on a nearby avenue when he mentioned Ukraine.
"Please, please, let us not get used to war,'' Francis pleaded, after denouncing "the flexing of muscles while people are suffering."
Yet again, the pontiff decried the war in Ukraine without citing Russian President Vladimir Putin for the decision to launch the invasion and attack against Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The leader of the Anglican church said Easter is a time for peace and not "blood and iron."
