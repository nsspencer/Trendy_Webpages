     State Police Issue Playful Warning to Easter Bunny During Holiday Weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Connecticut State Police issued a playful warning to the Easter Bunny this weekend after it allegedly had been seen hiding eggs and delivering baskets of candy in Lisbon.
Troopers in Troop E said they were called to Route 169 in Lisbon around 5 p.m. on Saturday after getting a report of a suspicious incident.
According to state police, it was reported that a suspicious being was driving a Jeep and had been hiding eggs, delivering baskets of candy and sneaking around backyards of local homes.
The rabbit claimed it had been trying to get a jump start on the Easter holiday.
Since the rabbit did not have a proper solicitor's permit, authorities said a written warning was issued.

     Easter egg mix-up: Parent dressed as Easter bunny hands out condoms at Texas elementary school
    </h2>

     Summary: A Texas parent caused a fervor this week after handing out Easter eggs to kids at the Gullet Elementary School campus in Austin.
According to a text thread among Jensen and other parents at the school, it all seems to have been a mistake.
Now, the Austin Independent School District is reevaluating its safety protocols following the incident, according to a report by M. Acosta of KXAN.
“We are working to review our safety protocols to ensure this does not happen again,” a district spokesperson told KXAN.
“Radicalized leftist parents &amp; school admins are out of control, attempting to exploit our children while in school,” Bush tweeted.

     Sacred hares, banished winter witches and pagan worship – the roots of Easter Bunny traditions are ancient
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Tok ThompsonThe Easter Bunny is a much celebrated character in American Easter celebrations.
On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind.
In European traditions, the Easter Bunny is known as the Easter Hare.
Accounts from the 1600s in Germany describe children hunting for Easter eggs hidden by the Easter Hare, much as in the contemporary United States today.
Written accounts from England around the same time also mention the Easter Hare, particularly in terms of traditional Easter hare hunts, and the eating of hare meat at Easter.
