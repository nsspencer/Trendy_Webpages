     Summary: Jill and I join fellow Christians around the world in celebrating Easter Sunday — a day of joy and hope, of renewal and rebirth.
As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated.
But we know this Holy Day falls on heavy hearts for those who have lost loved ones and those among us living in the dark shadow of war, persecution, and poverty.
From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding.
Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.

In the scriptures leading up to His crucifixion, Jesus warned His followers that this would happen on three separate occasions (Luke 9:21-27; Luke 9:43b-50; Luke 18:31-34).
When we choose Jesus as Savior, we are accepting the promise of God’s word: eternal life (John 14:1-6).

     Summary: The pope makes an Easter plea for peace in Ukraine, citing a nuclear riskEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Alessandra Tarantino/APVATICAN CITY — On what is supposed to be Christianity's most joyful day, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in the "senseless" war in Ukraine and in other armed conflicts raging in the world, and cited the "troubling" risk of nuclear warfare.
Applause erupted from many of the 50,000 people in the square and on a nearby avenue when he mentioned Ukraine.
"Please, please, let us not get used to war,'' Francis pleaded, after denouncing "the flexing of muscles while people are suffering."
Yet again, the pontiff decried the war in Ukraine without citing Russian President Vladimir Putin for the decision to launch the invasion and attack against Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The leader of the Anglican church said Easter is a time for peace and not "blood and iron."

     Summary: The pontiff had just finished celebrating Easter Mass in the square packed by faithful for the holiday for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020.
Applause erupted from many of the crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number 100,000 in the square and on a nearby avenue, when he mentioned Ukraine.
“Let us all commit ourselves to imploring peace, from our balconies and in our streets,” Francis said.
The manifesto’s text, sounding a grim warning against the consequences of nuclear warfare, was issued a few months after Einstein died.
After Easter morning Mass, Francis boarded the white popemobile for a whirl through the square among the cheering ranks of the crowd.

     Summary: His church had canceled in-person worship, but staffers had gathered inside the sanctuary to record a live online service.
Yet something happens on Easter morning.
In some ways, churchgoers are not unlike Jesus' disciples on Easter morning -- they're finding unexpected joy after living so long with fear, Vile says.
Where the story of Easter and the pandemic meetThere are, of course, many challenges ahead for Christian churches on this Easter morning.
But even for those who have been lost, the symbol of the empty tomb on Easter morning is more powerful than the story of the pandemic, Robinson says.

This Sunday, the Phoenix congregation is set to celebrate its first Easter Sunday Mass since the blaze in a newly constructed church.
Before the pandemic, John Prosek, liturgist at St. Joseph, said there would normally be about 500 people at an Easter service.
While plenty of other places of worship were shut down because of the pandemic, St. Joseph's congregation was working hard to rebuild after the fire.

     Summary: During the 18th and 19th centuries, German immigrants imported the idea of an Easter hare giving eggs to children to the United States.
In this Easter postcard, an Easter bunny paints an Easter egg as a baby chick watches below.
According to Hann, Queen Victoria had German ancestry and is seen as popularizing Easter egg hunts in England.
Children rush to pick up Easter eggs provided by the New Denver church.
As time passed, what was originally a German tradition of hunting for Easter eggs became more widespread and practiced outside of Europe.
