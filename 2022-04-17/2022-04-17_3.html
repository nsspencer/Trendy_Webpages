"I don't worry about Kyrie," Nash said.
"Kyrie's been here a number of times , he's been here provably in a playoff sense and hostile environments dozens of times."

     Celtics ownership reportedly urged team to be buyers ahead of season-changing trade deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics Celtics ownership reportedly urged team to be buyers ahead of season-changing trade deadline The Celtics held the best record in the league following the deadline.
When the trade deadline was approaching in late January into early February, it didn’t look like the Celtics would be buyers.
Things began to turn around in late January and early February when the team won eight of nine games heading into the Feb. 10 trade deadline.
“We were losing some leads in games, and offensively stuff didn’t fit all the time,” Udoka told Himmelsbach.
As the Celtics had the quintessential buyers’ trade deadline (trading more players than acquiring players and trading draft picks), they started to enter the league’s elite.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum had a great series against the Brooklyn Nets in last year's NBA ... [+] playoffs, but it wasn't enough to lift up his teammates.
The key to winning this series might just be Jayson Tatum.
MORE FROM FORBES The Boston Celtics Were Right To Play For The Second SeedLast year, the Jaylen Brown-less Celtics entered the playoffs as underdogs and, to nobody’s surprise, were eliminated by the Nets despite Tatum putting up a monster offensive effort.
The Celtics are, unquestionably, a better team than the Nets, particularly given how utterly dysfunctional Brooklyn is on an institutional level.
This is why Tatum, the Celtics’ best player and a borderline league MVP candidate for his second-half heroics, might be the key to them getting their revenge on Brooklyn.
