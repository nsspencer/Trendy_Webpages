As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated.

From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding.
Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.

     Summary: The pope makes an Easter plea for peace in Ukraine, citing a nuclear riskEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Alessandra Tarantino/APVATICAN CITY — On what is supposed to be Christianity's most joyful day, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in the "senseless" war in Ukraine and in other armed conflicts raging in the world, and cited the "troubling" risk of nuclear warfare.
Applause erupted from many of the 50,000 people in the square and on a nearby avenue when he mentioned Ukraine.
"Please, please, let us not get used to war,'' Francis pleaded, after denouncing "the flexing of muscles while people are suffering."
Yet again, the pontiff decried the war in Ukraine without citing Russian President Vladimir Putin for the decision to launch the invasion and attack against Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The leader of the Anglican church said Easter is a time for peace and not "blood and iron."

When we choose Jesus as Savior, we are accepting the promise of God’s word: eternal life (John 14:1-6).

Yet something happens on Easter morning.
In some ways, churchgoers are not unlike Jesus' disciples on Easter morning -- they're finding unexpected joy after living so long with fear, Vile says.
Where the story of Easter and the pandemic meetThere are, of course, many challenges ahead for Christian churches on this Easter morning.
But even for those who have been lost, the symbol of the empty tomb on Easter morning is more powerful than the story of the pandemic, Robinson says.
