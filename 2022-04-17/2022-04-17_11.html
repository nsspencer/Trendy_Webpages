     9 People Wounded in South Carolina Mall Shooting, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLUMBIA, S.C. — A holiday weekend was punctured by violence as nine people were shot at a crowded South Carolina mall on Saturday and five others were injured in an ensuing stampede during the gunfire, the authorities said.
The police said they believed the shooting, at the Columbiana Centre mall, was not random and likely was connected to an “ongoing conflict” among people who knew each other.
Investigators, relying on statements from witnesses and surveillance video, believe that at least three people displayed firearms inside the mall.
At least one weapon was recovered, and a preliminary examination of ballistic evidence indicates that at least two firearms were used by two people, the police said.
One person who was initially detained by the police, Jewayne M. Price, will be charged with unlawful carrying of a pistol, the police said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nine people were shot and another five were injured while fleeing a shooting Saturday at Columbiana Centre mall with no deaths, according to the Columbia Police Department.
Investigators believe three people displayed guns inside the mall and investigators are working to determine how many people fired, according to the statement.
Holbrook said the injuries were mostly from gunfire, with victims from age 15 to 73, and several were injured as people were fleeing.
"This was not a situation where someone showed up and at random fired a gun to hurt people," Holbrook said.
The mall released a statement through the police department: “Today’s isolated, senseless act of violence is extremely upsetting and our thoughts are with everyone impacted.
