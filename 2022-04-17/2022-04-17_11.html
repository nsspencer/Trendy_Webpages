    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To some, it might seem strange that the Easter Bunny, which is a mammal, would lay eggs, which is not a mammal trait.
However, it might be a case of combining traditions, as eggs are also significant to modern Easter celebrations.
History notes that decorating eggs dates back to the 13th century when eggs were previously a forbidden food during Lent.
To celebrate the end of Lent, people would paint and decorate the eggs and eat them on Easter in celebration.

     Summary: One such story is that of the Easter Bunny, a magical rabbit that appears annually bearing eggs.
Why does the Easter Bunny deliver eggs?
The idea that the Easter Bunny delivers eggs to children can be traced back to the 18th century.
As with the Easter Bunny, eggs are another common springtime symbol, a motif for new life.
So, that's why the Easter Bunny is said to deliver eggs to children.

     Holiday history: Stories behind the Easter Bunny, eggs

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As you’ve probably guessed, the Easter Bunny doesn’t exactly make an appearance in the Bible.
So, just where do the traditions come from that we so commonly see today, like the Easter Bunny and Easter eggs?
Easter Bunny historyUnfortunately, the exact origin of the Easter Bunny is not well known -- but some sources provide a guess at why the creature became such a prominent symbol of the Christian holiday.
Easter eggsThe editors at History.com say that Easter eggs are likely connected to pagan traditions, and egg decorating dates back hundreds of years.
Editors say that eggs were a forbidden food during Lent, and Christians would celebrate Easter by painting and decorating the eggs to then eat on the holiday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Tok ThompsonThe Easter Bunny is a much celebrated character in American Easter celebrations.
On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind.
In European traditions, the Easter Bunny is known as the Easter Hare.
Accounts from the 1600s in Germany describe children hunting for Easter eggs hidden by the Easter Hare, much as in the contemporary United States today.
Written accounts from England around the same time also mention the Easter Hare, particularly in terms of traditional Easter hare hunts, and the eating of hare meat at Easter.

     Summary: The eggs that were laid during that week were then specially identified as “Holy Week” eggs, and decorated as a result.
(Photo by Evans/Three Lions/Getty Images)(Original Caption) Imperial Easter Egg.
22nd March 1940: Four enterprising boys evacuated from Stoke Newington, London, to Hertfordshire use Easter eggs to play a game of marbles.
The rabbit is said to lay eggs as well as decorate and hide them, which is understood to be a Protestant rejection of the Catholic Easter customs, and in some European countries, other animals like the fox, or the cuckoo, brought the Easter eggs.
Easter follows Lent in the Christian calendar, which is the period of 40 days before Easter, which traditionally is observed by acts of penance and fasting.

     Summary: During the 18th and 19th centuries, German immigrants imported the idea of an Easter hare giving eggs to children to the United States.
In this Easter postcard, an Easter bunny paints an Easter egg as a baby chick watches below.
According to Hann, Queen Victoria had German ancestry and is seen as popularizing Easter egg hunts in England.
Children rush to pick up Easter eggs provided by the New Denver church.
As time passed, what was originally a German tradition of hunting for Easter eggs became more widespread and practiced outside of Europe.
