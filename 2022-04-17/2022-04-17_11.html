     Summary: The Ever Forward is finally free from the Chesapeake Bay — one month laterEnlarge this image toggle caption Julio Cortez/AP Julio Cortez/APAfter a month of being lodged in Maryland's Chesapeake Bay, the Ever Forward cargo ship is finally free.
"A tremendous team effort with a little help from the Easter Sunday rising tide in the Chesapeake Bay.
Crews worked for weeks to pluck the ship free.
They used "every facet of the sector including dredging, marine construction, tugs, barges (deck barges, crane barges, and pull barges)," Doyle said.
The saga of the Ever Forward was reminiscent of the Ever Given, which is also owned by the Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp.

     Cargo ship stuck in Chesapeake Bay freed after a month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 130-ton Ever Forward cargo ship that has been mired in the mud of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland for more than a month was dislodged and refloated early Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
David O’Connell, commander of Coast Guard Sector Maryland-National Capital Region, said in a statement.
The Ever Forward, which is owned by Evergreen Marine Corp., was being towed by five tugboats to a ship parking area near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
The Coast Guard said the Ever Forward got stuck on March 13 in about 23 feet of water off Downs Park in Pasadena, Maryland, about 20 miles south of Baltimore.
No one was injured, and inspections showed that no fuel or pollution leaked from the ship into the Chesapeake Bay, according to the Coast Guard.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ever Forward container ship was freed Sunday morning after being stuck in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland for over a month, the U.S. Coast Guard Mid-Atlantic told WTOP.
The cargo ship was freed around 7 a.m. after having run aground in the bay 35 days ago when the salvage operation began on March 13.
Kind of the same thing on a grander scale here,” Coast Guard Captain David O’Connell told CBS on Saturday.
Maryland’s Governor Larry Hogan thanked the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Port of Baltimore and the U.S. Coast Guard for their work to refloat the ship.
“We appreciate the steady partnership with the Coast Guard, Evergreen Marine Corporation and all the other agencies that worked to prevent pollution and protect the Chesapeake Bay,” said Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles.

“Ah,” said James, a 30-year Coast Guard veteran.
Once the Coast Guard signs off on this inspection — expected to be finished by Monday — the ship is free to carry on, James said.
Back at Downs Park, a group of container ship tourists straggled onto the shore, looking a bit beleaguered.
The Glen Burnie couple come to the park most weekends, and they were deeply worried about the ship potentially spilling fuel.
