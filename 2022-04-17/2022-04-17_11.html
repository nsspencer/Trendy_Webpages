     Thomas Tuchel 'Happy' to Reach FA Cup Final With Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas Tuchel has admitted he is happy to have reached the FA Cup final with Chelsea following their victory over Crystal Palace.
Speaking to ITV Sport after the match, Tuchel admitted his pride to reach the FA Cup final for his second year in a row, and Chelsea's third.
IMAGO / Action PlusWhen asked about his emotions after reaching the final, Tuchel admitted: "Good.
To play a third final in Wembley, second in the FA Cup."
Chelsea will now face Liverpool in the final, seeking revenge for the Carabao Cup final loss back in February, where Kepa Arrizabalaga's spot kick miss saw the Blues fall to defeat.

     New owner incoming, Chelsea into FA Cup final with Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Complete the sale of Chelsea inside four weeks and the new ownership will have an FA Cup final against Liverpool to attend.
Goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount ensured the eight-time FA Cup winners will be back at Wembley on May 14 to face Liverpool which beat them at the national stadium on penalties in the League Cup final in February.
A week that featured a Champions League quarterfinal elimination at Real Madrid ended on a high for Chelsea reaching a sixth final in a year under Tuchel — with the FIFA Club World Cup, European Cup and UEFA Super Cup lifted.
Chelsea lost the 2021 FA Cup final to Leicester.
The Women’s FA Cup holders beat Arsenal 2-0 on Sunday to set up a final meeting with Manchester City at Wembley on May 15 — the day after the men’s showpiece in the same venue.

     By reaching FA Cup final, Chelsea can redeem a season derailed by uncertainty and ownership drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Expectations are palpably lower at Palace -- this was only their second FA Cup semifinal since 1995 -- and Tuchel possesses a squad with much greater depth as a result.
We were here last season in the FA Cup final, we are here again, and that means an unbelievable lot to us because the FA Cup is the most prestigious, the most traditional cup in the world maybe, played at Wembley.
Chelsea punched their way past Crystal Palace on Sunday to reach the FA Cup final for the third consecutive time.
And this will be a third FA Cup final in a row after losing to Arsenal in 2020 under Lampard and Leicester City last year, heightening the sense of Chelsea coming full circle.
"But this is what a cup final is about -- it is about winning.

     Soccer-It’s time for Chelsea to win a final at Wembley, says Mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount has called on his team mates to snap their losing streak in cup finals at Wembley Stadium and avenge their League Cup final loss to Liverpool when the two teams meet again in the FA Cup showpiece next month.
Mount scored the second goal in Chelsea’s hard-earned 2-0 victory over Palace at Wembley on Sunday to send them to their third straight FA Cup final.
“It’s definitely time for us to win a final at Wembley.
For myself it’s been five finals at Wembley, five finals I’ve lost,” said Mount, who has finished as a runner-up in three domestic finals since his breakthrough at Chelsea in 2019-20.
“I am happy to be a part of it (the FA Cup final) again.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas Tuchel praised Chelsea's focus and composure as they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 on Sunday to earn an FA Cup final showdown with quadruple chasers Liverpool.
It will be Chelsea's fifth FA Cup final in the last six years as they look to make amends for losing in the showpiece against Arsenal and Leicester in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The Reds have already beaten Chelsea in the League Cup final on penalties this season and Tuchel knows how tough it will be to avenge that loss.
We were unlucky to lose in the shoot-out in the League Cup.
But that is what a cup final is about.
