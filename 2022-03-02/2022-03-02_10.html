Third-degree burns, in which multiple layers of skin are destroyed, are the most harmful of the two.
In a statement published on its website yesterday, the company said it would offer a $299 refund to Fitbit Ionic customers and "the health and safety of Fitbit users is our highest priority."
"If you own a Fitbit Ionic, please stop using your device," the company added.
Indeed, the Fitbit Ionic recall is not the only recent tech product recall due to issues with apparent overheating lithium-ion batteries.

     Rep. Van Taylor has apologized for an affair with the widow of an ISIS member from Texas and will halt his run for re-election, conceding the GOP runoff to former Collin County judge Keith Self, according to the Dallas Morning News.
What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponents in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

     COLLIN COUNTY (WBAP/KLIF News) – Less than 24 hours after being forced into a primary runoff this week, U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly ended his campaign after allegations of infidelity with a former jihadist dubbed the ‘ISIS bride’ surfaced.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.
Joya gained national attention for her role as a former jihadist who was once married to a commander for the Islamic State.
Taylor was set to face off against Republican candidate Keith Self in a May 24th runoff elections.
The Collin County native has represented the 3rd Congressional District in the Dallas suburbs since 2018.

     Fitbit is recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally because the fitness product's lithium-ion battery can overheat, posing a burn hazard, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced on Wednesday.
Consumers were urged to stop using the Ionic smartwatches and to contact Fitbit to receive pre-paid packaging to return the device, for which they'll be refunded $299, the notice stated.
The recall involves only the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch, sold with a polyurethane band and a 1.4-inch color LCD screen.

     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor drops his Texas reelection bid and admits to an affairEnlarge this image toggle caption Caroline Brehman/AP Caroline Brehman/APDALLAS — U.S. Rep. Van Taylor of Texas said Wednesday that he was ending his reelection campaign and admitted having an affair following reports that he had been in a relationship with the widow of an American-born recruiter for the Islamic State group.
The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
But it didn't happen like that," Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.

     But the thing that I’m most stoked about — as a huge fan of the film — is the amount of people who are about to discover Mike Faist‘s performance as Riff.
Mike Faist’s Riff will haunt you well after West Side Story is over, and he deserves way more shine for that.
After all, he loathes his Puerto Rican neighbors and seems more fluent in the language of violence than his native English.
But Faist plays Riff as a terrified little boy lashing out as a last means of survival.
Mike Faist might not win an Oscar for West Side Story, but his Riff is officially one of the great movie musical performances of all time.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘West Side Story’ on HBO Max and Disney+, Steven Spielberg’s Mostly Dazzling Update of a Classic Musical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The recent resuscitation of the Hollywood musical continues with Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, which debuts on HBO Max and Disney+ after a Christmastime theatrical release inspired overwhelming critical praise, seven Oscar nominations and paltry box office returns.
WEST SIDE STORY: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
The Gist: Chunks of New York City’s Upper West Side look like a war zone.
Four of them snap their fingers as they strut, all musical-like, and soon they become a dozen dancers.
The restless visual artistry of West Side Story finds Spielberg in top form, and he gives the melodrama the vigorous 21st-century thematic how’s-your-father it needs.

     How ‘West Side Story’ Revives a Lost Style of Dance-centric Musical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "West Side Story" choreographer Justin Peck pays homage to Jerome Robbins and more mid-century choreographers with his fresh take.
The dance in Spielberg’s “West Side Story” is different from what we’ve seen in movie musicals in the last half century.
Separate WorldsDance was treated like an added attraction in the earliest Hollywood musicals.
When Worlds CollideRobbins met his future “West Side Story” collaborator Leonard Bernstein in 1943, when they were both just 25.
Asked if he sees a future with more large-scale, dance-forward musicals like “West Side Story,” Peck sounded cautiously hopeful.
