     West Side Story: The Brilliance and Tragedy of Its Disney+ Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     Does The Cast Really Sing In West Side Story?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As West Side Story heads to streaming platforms, viewers might be wondering whether the cast really sings in the film.
Directed by Steven Spielberg, the romantic drama is the 2021 adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name.
In a musical remake such as West Side Story, it is especially important that the cast is skilled in performing holistically.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYStarring Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler, West Side Story is inspired by Shakespeare’s tragedy Romeo and Juliet.
Lastly, the cast is joined by a veteran West Side Story member, Rita Moreno.

     ‘West Side Story’ should have let Anybodys sing ‘Cool’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.

     Mike Faist’s Riff Will Haunt You Long After ‘West Side Story’ is Over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But the thing that I’m most stoked about — as a huge fan of the film — is the amount of people who are about to discover Mike Faist‘s performance as Riff.
Mike Faist’s Riff will haunt you well after West Side Story is over, and he deserves way more shine for that.
After all, he loathes his Puerto Rican neighbors and seems more fluent in the language of violence than his native English.
But Faist plays Riff as a terrified little boy lashing out as a last means of survival.
Mike Faist might not win an Oscar for West Side Story, but his Riff is officially one of the great movie musical performances of all time.

     How ‘West Side Story’ Revives a Lost Style of Dance-centric Musical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "West Side Story" choreographer Justin Peck pays homage to Jerome Robbins and more mid-century choreographers with his fresh take.
The dance in Spielberg’s “West Side Story” is different from what we’ve seen in movie musicals in the last half century.
Separate WorldsDance was treated like an added attraction in the earliest Hollywood musicals.
When Worlds CollideRobbins met his future “West Side Story” collaborator Leonard Bernstein in 1943, when they were both just 25.
Asked if he sees a future with more large-scale, dance-forward musicals like “West Side Story,” Peck sounded cautiously hopeful.
