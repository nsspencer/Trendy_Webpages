     One sweet update the remake made to the original film gives Tony and Maria a little more quality time together.
In the original, Tony visits Maria at the bridal shop where she works, where they reenact a wedding and get to know each other.
In the remake, Tony takes Maria to a church on a date, where they sing "One Hand, One Heart," thus adding a little more depth to their short-lived relationship.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     Some burns were particularly severe, with four reports of second-degree burns and two reports of third-degree burns.
Third-degree burns, in which multiple layers of skin are destroyed, are the most harmful of the two.
In a statement published on its website yesterday, the company said it would offer a $299 refund to Fitbit Ionic customers and "the health and safety of Fitbit users is our highest priority."
"If you own a Fitbit Ionic, please stop using your device," the company added.
Indeed, the Fitbit Ionic recall is not the only recent tech product recall due to issues with apparent overheating lithium-ion batteries.

     Rep. Van Taylor has apologized for an affair with the widow of an ISIS member from Texas and will halt his run for re-election, conceding the GOP runoff to former Collin County judge Keith Self, according to the Dallas Morning News.
What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponents in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

     COLLIN COUNTY (WBAP/KLIF News) – Less than 24 hours after being forced into a primary runoff this week, U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly ended his campaign after allegations of infidelity with a former jihadist dubbed the ‘ISIS bride’ surfaced.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.
Joya gained national attention for her role as a former jihadist who was once married to a commander for the Islamic State.
Taylor was set to face off against Republican candidate Keith Self in a May 24th runoff elections.
The Collin County native has represented the 3rd Congressional District in the Dallas suburbs since 2018.

     Landing the role of Jets leader Riff in West Side Story has taken Mike Faist from the New York stage to the movie big league — and a Bafta nomination.
Mike Faist is speaking to Screen International from outside Columbus, Ohio — where he is visiting family members — when he breaks off to find a gift he received.
“The movies that I grew up with were the old MGM films with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, and West Side Story, and Steven Spielberg movies like the Indiana Joneses.
Faist was still playing Connor when asked to send in a tape for the lead role of Tony.
But Faist was reluctant when he was asked to go in and dance with everyone vying for the Jets roles.

     Fitbit is recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally because the fitness product's lithium-ion battery can overheat, posing a burn hazard, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced on Wednesday.
Consumers were urged to stop using the Ionic smartwatches and to contact Fitbit to receive pre-paid packaging to return the device, for which they'll be refunded $299, the notice stated.
The recall involves only the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch, sold with a polyurethane band and a 1.4-inch color LCD screen.

Wednesday's recall comes eight years after Fitbit recalled its Fitbit Force activity-tracking wristband after the company received about 9,900 reports of the wristband irritating skin and 250 reports of blistering.

     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor drops his Texas reelection bid and admits to an affairEnlarge this image toggle caption Caroline Brehman/AP Caroline Brehman/APDALLAS — U.S. Rep. Van Taylor of Texas said Wednesday that he was ending his reelection campaign and admitted having an affair following reports that he had been in a relationship with the widow of an American-born recruiter for the Islamic State group.
The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
But it didn't happen like that," Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.

     Just before Tuesday’s primary, the conservative news outlet National File revealed Taylor’s affair with British native Tania Joya — the widow of John Georgelas, an American who joined ISIS in 2013.
Taylor reportedly had the affair with Tania Joya, whose ex-husband joined ISIS in 2013.
Toward the end of their affair, Joya asked Taylor for help paying off some bills and she claimed he agreed and gave her $5,000, but only if she kept her mouth shut.
@RepVanTaylor/Twitter“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Taylor’s decision came a day after the Republican primary election in Texas.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘West Side Story’ on HBO Max and Disney+, Steven Spielberg’s Mostly Dazzling Update of a Classic Musical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The recent resuscitation of the Hollywood musical continues with Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, which debuts on HBO Max and Disney+ after a Christmastime theatrical release inspired overwhelming critical praise, seven Oscar nominations and paltry box office returns.
WEST SIDE STORY: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
The Gist: Chunks of New York City’s Upper West Side look like a war zone.
Four of them snap their fingers as they strut, all musical-like, and soon they become a dozen dancers.
The restless visual artistry of West Side Story finds Spielberg in top form, and he gives the melodrama the vigorous 21st-century thematic how’s-your-father it needs.

     How ‘West Side Story’ Revives a Lost Style of Dance-centric Musical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "West Side Story" choreographer Justin Peck pays homage to Jerome Robbins and more mid-century choreographers with his fresh take.
The dance in Spielberg’s “West Side Story” is different from what we’ve seen in movie musicals in the last half century.
Separate WorldsDance was treated like an added attraction in the earliest Hollywood musicals.
When Worlds CollideRobbins met his future “West Side Story” collaborator Leonard Bernstein in 1943, when they were both just 25.
Asked if he sees a future with more large-scale, dance-forward musicals like “West Side Story,” Peck sounded cautiously hopeful.
