     Star-Studded Lakers Are Fighting Just to Make the Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Lakers are on the verge of missing the N.B.A.
After their most recent outing, a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, LeBron James sounded defiant.
“Until you stump me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance,” James said, his voice echoing in a cavernous portion of the arena.
He added: “As long as we’ve got more games to play, we still have a chance.
At 27-34, with the ninth-best record in the Western Conference, they still have a chance to make the playoffs, and they have James, who has led unlikely groups to postseason success before.

     Lakers: It Sounds Like Russell Westbrook Wants Out of Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russell Westbrook experiment in Los Angeles has failed.
For most of the season, analysts and Lakers members have argued that he just needed to get time with this team to figure things out.
Well, here we are almost at the end of the season, and Russ is nowhere close to finding it.
In the Lakers' loss to the Mavericks last night, Russ sunk just 5 of his 17 shots from the field.
"In any case, there is mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer, sources said."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But that's difficult to do when you have a team built around LeBron James.
The Herd's Colin Cowherd had an easy (albeit wishful) solution to it all: trade him back to Miami.
“I don’t think Miami is dynamic enough at point guard.
But he is still LeBron James, the guy that led Miami to 4 NBA Finals appearances and back-to-back titles.
The draft pick compensation that would go along with a LeBron trade would be enough to secure the health of their future.

     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     Russell Westbrook, Lakers have 'mutual interest' in finding point guard a new team this offseason, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russell Westbrook shot 5-of-17 from the field on Tuesday in a disappointing 109-104 home loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
Bleacher Report's Jake Fischer reports that there is "mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer," potentially ending one of the most disastrous experiments in Lakers history.
The Lakers were legally able to trade only one first-round at the deadline: either 2027 or 2028.
What stretching Westbrook would do is prevent the Lakers from maximizing their impending flexibility in 2023 or use Westbrook's salary as a tool for an offseason trade.
If Westbrook is going to leave this team in the offseason, it is going to come through a trade.
