That was the storyline, anyway, right?

But then that minimizes a few things we saw as U-M rolled over MSU at Crisler Center, 87-70.

While the play on the court is important, the bench celebrations are just as important and Michigan understood the assignment.
Hosting their in-state rival Michigan State Spartans, the Wolverines were dominant from start to finish.

Martelli talked about the streaky season for Michigan after the win over Michigan State.

     Final Michigan State Spartans 70 Michigan Wolverines 87Michigan basketball toppled Michigan State on Tuesday night and here are three things that we learned from the Wolverines win.
Going into Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, it really felt like the season was on the line for the Wolverines.
The Wolverines were projected in the field by Joe Lunardi of ESPN prior to the win and this should give them a little bump.
But first, let’s take a look back at three things we learned in Michigan basketball’s massive win over Michigan State on Tuesday night.
This time around, Dickinson made Izzo pay, and the Spartans inability to guard Dickinson is the main reason they lost.

     Hunter Dickinson plays villain as Michigan picks up rivalry win against Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The big fella dropped 33 points and snagged nine boards in a 87-60 win for the Michigan Wolverines against their rival, the Michigan State Spartans.
“That’s the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry,” Dickinson said postgame when asked about his trash talk.
From the very start, Dickinson was chirping at the Michigan State bench after every bucket, and seemed to get under Tom Izzo’s skin a little bit.
“Yeah, yeah I did,” Dickinson said when asked if he thought was effective getting Izzo and the Spartans riled up a bit.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, you heard his quote, he’s going to shake hands regardless,” Dickinson said.

     ‘A WWE villain’: Michigan’s Hunter Dickinson scores and roars vs. Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ANN ARBOR -- Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo had plenty to say to Michigan sophomore Hunter Dickinson in the postgame handshake line during their first meeting this season.
On Tuesday, Dickinson’s performance -- and Michigan’s victory -- left Izzo speechless.
Dickinson poured in a career-high 33 points against Michigan State.
To Dickinson’s delight, Michigan State tried covering him with a single defender, and it didn’t work.
If Dickinson can duplicate his Michigan State performance, Michigan has a good chance.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.
