Over the course of the last few weeks, the 44-year-old rapper has been spotted hanging out with model Chaney Jones—and even seemed to make things Instagram official on Mar.
As for what's really going on between Ye and his latest "muse," a source close to the musician says that they're simply "having fun."

     “I don’t know if I would ever say, ‘Oh my God, this person looks like me.’ I think if someone has dark hair and tan skin people are going to say, ‘Oh, that looks like Kim.’ And that’s not fair, because there are so many people who are just themselves,” Kim said.

     Meet Chaney Jones—Kanye West’s Kim Kardashian Lookalike Gal PalKanye’s Instagram model squeeze is a dead ringer for Kim K.(Getty Images)Kanye West’s new flame looks awfully familiar.
The billionaire rapper, Yeezy mogul and subject of Netflix’s new documentary series Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy recently shared a paparazzi photo showing him alongside model Chaney Jones.
As others have noted, Jones bears a striking resemblance to West’s estranged wife, Kim Kardashian.
Because the original caption referred to Jones as West’s “new boo,” many assume West’s reposting effectively confirms the new relationship.
A hearing scheduled for this week is expected determine whether Kardashian will be granted her request to be declared legally single.
