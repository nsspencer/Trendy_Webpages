     Star-Studded Lakers Are Fighting Just to Make the Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Lakers are on the verge of missing the N.B.A.
After their most recent outing, a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, LeBron James sounded defiant.
“Until you stump me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance,” James said, his voice echoing in a cavernous portion of the arena.
He added: “As long as we’ve got more games to play, we still have a chance.
At 27-34, with the ninth-best record in the Western Conference, they still have a chance to make the playoffs, and they have James, who has led unlikely groups to postseason success before.

     Draymond Green Blasts Lakers Fans For Booing LeBron James
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This poor play, often magnified by poor effort, has warranted boos from the Lakers faithful on several recent occasions.
According to Draymond Green, this behavior from the fanbase is pathetic.
On a recent podcast episode, Draymond Green blasted the Lakers fans who have been booing the team, specifically highlighting an instance where LeBron James was on the receiving end of these boos.
"I thought that was pathetic," Draymond said.
Draymond Green has never been one to hold back his thoughts, and he spoke very directly on the way he felt about Lakers fans booing LeBron James and their team.

     Lakers: It Sounds Like Russell Westbrook Wants Out of Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russell Westbrook experiment in Los Angeles has failed.
For most of the season, analysts and Lakers members have argued that he just needed to get time with this team to figure things out.
Well, here we are almost at the end of the season, and Russ is nowhere close to finding it.
In the Lakers' loss to the Mavericks last night, Russ sunk just 5 of his 17 shots from the field.
"In any case, there is mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer, sources said."

     But that's difficult to do when you have a team built around LeBron James.
The Herd's Colin Cowherd had an easy (albeit wishful) solution to it all: trade him back to Miami.
“I don’t think Miami is dynamic enough at point guard.
But he is still LeBron James, the guy that led Miami to 4 NBA Finals appearances and back-to-back titles.
The draft pick compensation that would go along with a LeBron trade would be enough to secure the health of their future.

In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     Three Things to Know: Lakers at Clippers - 3/3/22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers (27-34) face the Clippers (33-31) on Thursday evening for a road game at Crypto.com Arena, with LAL suddenly 4.5 games back of LAC.
While the Clippers have won four straight, including a final-minute win over the Lakers last week, LAL have lost three in a row.
Afterwards, Vogel said both are expected to be available for Thursday’s matchup against the Clippers, should he choose to use them.
Gabriel spoke of several connections he has on the team, including college teammate at Kentucky Malik Monk, and alum, Anthony Davis.
L.A. had another chance to win, but Anthony missed a deep three with four seconds left.

     Los Angeles Lakers’ Future Looks Grim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James faced reporters Tuesday, a microphone in his hand, another loss on his résumé and a list of reasons to remain optimistic about the Lakers’ season on his brain.
Anthony Davis, out with a foot injury, isn’t close to returning, and the Lakers weren’t particularly good when he played.
They could make the playoffs—if the season ended today, L.A. would face New Orleans in the play-in—but the Lakers are going nowhere.
The combined salaries of James, Westbrook and Davis are around $130 million.

     League insiders remain dubious that Pelinka is truly entrenched as Los Angeles' lead executive beyond this season.
The whispers have been quiet on who could serve as Los Angeles' next play-caller.
"He wasn't returning some teams calls at [this year's] deadline," one general manager told B/R.
Los Angeles' most realistic option may ultimately be stretching Westbrook's $47 million player option for the 2022-23 season.
Reading Into LeBron's Future in LAJames does, for now, appear destined to remain in Los Angeles for the coming years.

     Russell Westbrook, Lakers have 'mutual interest' in finding point guard a new team this offseason, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russell Westbrook shot 5-of-17 from the field on Tuesday in a disappointing 109-104 home loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
Bleacher Report's Jake Fischer reports that there is "mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer," potentially ending one of the most disastrous experiments in Lakers history.
The Lakers were legally able to trade only one first-round at the deadline: either 2027 or 2028.
What stretching Westbrook would do is prevent the Lakers from maximizing their impending flexibility in 2023 or use Westbrook's salary as a tool for an offseason trade.
If Westbrook is going to leave this team in the offseason, it is going to come through a trade.

     LeBron James won’t give up on Lakers season ‘until I’m 12 feet under’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James’ confidence is at an all-time high – even as the Lakers struggles put them just two games away from falling out of the play-in tournament.
“We still have games to play,” he said after the Lakers’ 10th loss in the past 13 games.
“Until you stomp me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance.
The Clippers beat the Lakers 105-102 last Friday, when James missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer to tie the game.
We’ve beaten the best teams; we’ve lost to some of the worst teams.

     Even after another tough loss, LeBron James and Lakers aren’t giving up on season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers have lost three consecutive games coming out of the NBA All-Star break and 11 of their last 15 games.
“Cause we still have games to play,” James said after scoring 26 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.
Russell Westbrook, who missed 12 of his 17 shots and scored just 12 points, explained why he remains confident.
… Big second, too many points,” Westbrook said.
During the 28-point loss to the Pelicans on Sunday night, a video surfaced on Monday of James, Westbrook and Trevor Ariza having an exchange with some fans sitting behind the Lakers’ bench.
