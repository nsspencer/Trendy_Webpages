     U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) announced Wednesday that he was ending his campaign to seek reelection to Congress after admitting to infidelity.

I am truly sorry, and I hope in time I can earn their forgiveness," Taylor said in his letter.
NBC 5 has reached out to the Texas Secretary of State's Office to see what happens next in the Dist.
Though Taylor said he's ending his bid for a third term he's expected to serve out his current term which ends in January 2023.

     Rep. Van Taylor has apologized for an affair with the widow of an ISIS member from Texas, and will halt his run for re-election, conceding the GOP runoff to former Collin County judge Keith Self, according to the Dallas Morning News.
What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponent’s in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping to reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

     Texas Rep. Van Taylor drops reelection bid day after primary over affair with ‘ISIS bride’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just before Tuesday’s primary, the conservative news outlet National File revealed Taylor’s affair with British native Tania Joya – the widow of John Georgelas, an American who joined ISIS in 2013.
Taylor reportedly had the affair with Tania Joya — whose ex-husband joined ISIS in 2013.
Toward the end of their affair, Joya asked Taylor for help paying off some bills and she claimed he agreed and gave her $5,000, but only if she kept her mouth shut.

Taylor’s decision came a day after the Republican primary election in Texas.

     He conceded the race to runner up Keith Self, a former Collin County Judge, who said elected leaders should be held accountable to the values they espouse.
The Texas 3rd Congressional District stretches from Plano, McKinney and Allen across Collin and Hunt Counties to Commerce.
Self won nearly 27% of the vote, putting him and second place and propelling him into the runoff election.
Taylor’s backgroundTaylor handily won competitions for this congressional seat in 2018 and 2020, when the district was wholly contained within Collin County.
Previous maps located the district wholly in increasingly diverse Collin County.

     Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
But as it turned out, nearly half the votes were cast on election day and he hadn’t banked enough of a lead to withstand the fallout.
After Joya’s revelations surfaced, his election day share of the vote plunged to 45.2%.
