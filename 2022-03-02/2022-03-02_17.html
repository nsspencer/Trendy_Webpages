     Bad Bunny takes on Brad Pitt in 'Bullet Train' action movie trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Many people know Bad Bunny as a chart-topping rapper who further globalized Latin urban music and solidified reggaeton's place in the mainstream music scene.
But the Puerto Rican artist will now star in Sony Pictures' upcoming action-thriller film "Bullet Train" alongside an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt and Joey King.
Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, made this acting debut last year during the third season of Netflix's "Narcos: Mexico."
But "Bullet Train" takes Bad Bunny to modern-day Japan.
It stars Pitt as Ladybug, an experienced assassin who boards a bullet train and encounters several other professional killers.

     FA Cup 2022 Match Coverage: Liverpool vs. Norwich City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following their League Cup triumph against Chelsea over the weekend, Liverpool turn their attention to the FA Cup and one of the three other trophies Jürgen Klopp’s big red machine are still in the running for as we head towards the final months of the 2021-22 European football season.
Their opponents, Norwich City, are a Premier League side but one that won’t be expected to be in the top flight next season given they sit dead last in the table.
They’ve also lost to Liverpool three times already this season, twice in the league and once in the early rounds of the League Cup.
The combined scoreline of those three games adds up to a rather lopsided 9-1 in favour of Liverpool.
Stick with The Liverpool Offside for full coverage of Wednesday night’s match under the lights at Anfield.

     ‘Bullet Train’ Trailer: Brad Pitt Is On A Bloody Wild Ride In Sony Action Pic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brad Pitt is on one bloody mission in Bullet Train.
It’s clearly not an easy first day back at work for Pitt, an experienced assassin who finds himself among several other professional killers with a similar mission on the titular train.
Fate,” one character tells Pitt’s character in the trailer set to a Japanese-language cover of “Stayin’ Alive.” “Well that’s a sh*t deal,” he replies.
Brittany Morrissey is the executive overseeing the project for Sony Pictures.
Columbia’s Bullet Train hits theaters on July 15.

     Brad Pitt fights off other assassins in Bullet Train trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     Bullet Train’s first trailer is a warning about quiet cars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.

     Jürgen Klopp showed his hand in Liverpool vs Norwich as 10-minute cameo confirms major switch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But an interesting substitution against Norwich City on Wednesday night might be an indication that Liverpool fans will see more of Mané in the position.
Interestingly, Díaz slotted in on the left flank, while Mané replaced Origi's central position in the front three.
But the fact that Klopp decided to keep Mané in a central position is perhaps a suggestion of where the Liverpool boss sees his long-term future at the club.
Based on his performances so far, Mané suits the central position well.
The new position change could ensure the longevity of his career, with the central position better suited to his qualities at the moment and that can only be a good sign for Liverpool.

Set to a foreign language cover of The Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” Bullet Train is hyping untold levels of fun.
Still, Bullet Train has style, one that’s been sorely lacking in most mainstream action movies today.
Brad Pitt stars Bullet Train, based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle.
Sony Pictures Joey King also stars in Bullet Train as “Prince.” Sony Pictures Hiroyuki Sanada, also seen in movies like The Wolverine and Army of the Dead, stars in Bullet Train in a major capacity.

Liverpool shouldn’t take Norwich lightly but they should have enough quality to see this one through.
It was Takumi Minamino scoring again in the 39th minute after a well worked corner kick from Tsmikas.
Second HalfLiverpool began the second half much as they ended the first half but couldn’t turn anything into quality chances.
Liverpool’s final two changes came in the 83rd minute when Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz replaced Origi and Diogo Jota.
