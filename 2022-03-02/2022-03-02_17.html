     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.

     So I decided to see what the doom and gloom area of my brain thought about the Milwaukee Bucks.
Finding the biggest area of concern for the Milwaukee BucksWouldn’t it be funny if I just said “injuries” and that was the end of the article?
Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.

     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.
