     Many people know Bad Bunny as a chart-topping rapper who further globalized Latin urban music and solidified reggaeton's place in the mainstream music scene.
But the Puerto Rican artist will now star in Sony Pictures' upcoming action-thriller film "Bullet Train" alongside an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt and Joey King.
Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, made this acting debut last year during the third season of Netflix's "Narcos: Mexico."
But "Bullet Train" takes Bad Bunny to modern-day Japan.
It stars Pitt as Ladybug, an experienced assassin who boards a bullet train and encounters several other professional killers.

     0 of 3Sam Forencich/Getty ImagesPut a fork in the 2021-22 New York Knicks.
Mathematically they are still alive, and it's a safe bet head coach Tom Thibodeau will have his team hard-charging through the finish line.
But what, other than fan loyalty, would lead you to believe this club is capable of turning this around?
Wednesday's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers tipped off a seven-game road trip against mostly good-to-great opponents.
The biggest questions surrounding this team have nothing to do with the remainder of this season but rather how they can avoid another flop like this.

     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.

     Brad Pitt is on one bloody mission in Bullet Train.
It’s clearly not an easy first day back at work for Pitt, an experienced assassin who finds himself among several other professional killers with a similar mission on the titular train.
Fate,” one character tells Pitt’s character in the trailer set to a Japanese-language cover of “Stayin’ Alive.” “Well that’s a sh*t deal,” he replies.
Brittany Morrissey is the executive overseeing the project for Sony Pictures.
Columbia’s Bullet Train hits theaters on July 15.

The Knicks realize they may have to plan for life without starting center Mitchell Robinson, the longest-tenured current Knick.
The free-agent options at center are plentiful — some cheap, some pricey; some young, some old.
On Feb. 13, The Post reported Robinson and the Knicks weren’t on solid ground regarding a new contract and he likely will hit the road if he reaches unrestricted free agency without an extension.
ESPN subsequently confirmed Sunday that talks haven’t gotten anywhere close.

     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     Following a much-needed victory against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, the Milwaukee Bucks would be put to the test as the Miami Heat came to Fiserv Forum on Wednesday.
With that Bucks looking to gain ground in the Eastern Conference standings against the top-seeded Heat, they would have to turn their intensity up a notch.
After trading punches for the entirety of the matchup, the Milwaukee Bucks escaped with a 120-119 win over the Miami Heat in a game that came down to the very last second.
The Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat lit it up from 3-point land, which propelled a high scoring affairThe Bucks and Heat have both been known for letting it fly from downtown at a high rate over the past several seasons, and that tradition certainly carried on last night.
For the Milwaukee Bucks to win a game where their opponent shot 47.7 percent from long range is truly an eye-catching feat.

     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.

     "... You don't see high assists because of the amount of free throws we got."
The Knicks have said Rose remains out indefinitely.
"Yeah, I wish I could answer that, but I can't," Thibodeau told reporters Friday when asked if Rose could return in March.
Rose's four assists per game is less than only Julius Randle on the team, who is averaging 5.3 per game.
The Knicks had a defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possession) of 107.8 last year, fourth in the NBA.

Set to a foreign language cover of The Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” Bullet Train is hyping untold levels of fun.
Still, Bullet Train has style, one that’s been sorely lacking in most mainstream action movies today.
Brad Pitt stars Bullet Train, based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle.
Sony Pictures Joey King also stars in Bullet Train as “Prince.” Sony Pictures Hiroyuki Sanada, also seen in movies like The Wolverine and Army of the Dead, stars in Bullet Train in a major capacity.

“[Head coach Tom Thibodeau] had to call a timeout in the first minutes of the second half because we weren’t fighting enough.
We’re not getting stops at critical moments.
Teams are getting on runs.”The fall from grace on the defensive side of the ball has been astounding for a Knicks team that had the NBA’s best defense last season.
We got to find a way to get one.’’With 20 games to go, the Knicks are certainly up against it.

Finding the biggest area of concern for the Milwaukee BucksWouldn’t it be funny if I just said “injuries” and that was the end of the article?
Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

     Milwaukee vs. Miami: Bucks Pull Off Wild Comeback vs. Heat, 120-119
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.

     Knicks Floated as ‘Homecoming’ Landing Spot for Ex Top-10 Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks have some decisions to make in the upcoming offseason, and one of the most important ones is what to do with their center Mitchell Robinson.
One name who has been floated is Orlando Magic center Mo Bamba, somebody who the New York Post’s Marc Berman says is open to the idea.
Another HomecomingGiven how disastrous the Kemba Walker homecoming has been in New York, the Knicks might be hesitant on another.
“Mo has played better this year, but it’s still difficult to project him as a starting center for a good team at this point,” said the scout.
“Last offseason was Bamba’s first healthy summer to put in the type of strength and conditioning work needed to be a solid starting center in the league.

     Bucks show championship mettle in comeback win over Heat: 'We made the decision that we're just going to go'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE — Down by one point with just 13.5 seconds remaining and the Miami Heat inbounding the ball from the sideline on their own end of the floor, the Bucks had just improbably forced a jump ball.
Is Khris (Middleton) going to get the ball?
Is Giannis going to get the ball?
Is Jrue (Holiday) going to have the ball?
Like, who’s gonna get the ball?”Bucks wing Khris Middleton agreed: “At that point, we said it was gonna be no timeout.
