     Bad Bunny takes on Brad Pitt in 'Bullet Train' action movie trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Many people know Bad Bunny as a chart-topping rapper who further globalized Latin urban music and solidified reggaeton's place in the mainstream music scene.
But the Puerto Rican artist will now star in Sony Pictures' upcoming action-thriller film "Bullet Train" alongside an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt and Joey King.
Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, made this acting debut last year during the third season of Netflix's "Narcos: Mexico."
But "Bullet Train" takes Bad Bunny to modern-day Japan.
It stars Pitt as Ladybug, an experienced assassin who boards a bullet train and encounters several other professional killers.

     0 of 3Sam Forencich/Getty ImagesPut a fork in the 2021-22 New York Knicks.
Mathematically they are still alive, and it's a safe bet head coach Tom Thibodeau will have his team hard-charging through the finish line.
But what, other than fan loyalty, would lead you to believe this club is capable of turning this around?
Wednesday's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers tipped off a seven-game road trip against mostly good-to-great opponents.
The biggest questions surrounding this team have nothing to do with the remainder of this season but rather how they can avoid another flop like this.

     ‘Bullet Train’ Trailer: Brad Pitt Is On A Bloody Wild Ride In Sony Action Pic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brad Pitt is on one bloody mission in Bullet Train.
It’s clearly not an easy first day back at work for Pitt, an experienced assassin who finds himself among several other professional killers with a similar mission on the titular train.
Fate,” one character tells Pitt’s character in the trailer set to a Japanese-language cover of “Stayin’ Alive.” “Well that’s a sh*t deal,” he replies.
Brittany Morrissey is the executive overseeing the project for Sony Pictures.
Columbia’s Bullet Train hits theaters on July 15.

The Knicks realize they may have to plan for life without starting center Mitchell Robinson, the longest-tenured current Knick.
The free-agent options at center are plentiful — some cheap, some pricey; some young, some old.
On Feb. 13, The Post reported Robinson and the Knicks weren’t on solid ground regarding a new contract and he likely will hit the road if he reaches unrestricted free agency without an extension.
ESPN subsequently confirmed Sunday that talks haven’t gotten anywhere close.

     Brad Pitt fights off other assassins in Bullet Train trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     Bullet Train’s first trailer is a warning about quiet cars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.

     "... You don't see high assists because of the amount of free throws we got."
The Knicks have said Rose remains out indefinitely.
"Yeah, I wish I could answer that, but I can't," Thibodeau told reporters Friday when asked if Rose could return in March.
Rose's four assists per game is less than only Julius Randle on the team, who is averaging 5.3 per game.
The Knicks had a defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possession) of 107.8 last year, fourth in the NBA.

     Here’s everything we know about Bullet Train, including its release date, plot synopsis, cast, and more.
Set to a foreign language cover of The Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” Bullet Train is hyping untold levels of fun.
Still, Bullet Train has style, one that’s been sorely lacking in most mainstream action movies today.
Brad Pitt stars Bullet Train, based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle.
Sony Pictures Joey King also stars in Bullet Train as “Prince.” Sony Pictures Hiroyuki Sanada, also seen in movies like The Wolverine and Army of the Dead, stars in Bullet Train in a major capacity.

     “I just think we got to be fighting on the defensive end,’’ Knicks forward Julius Randle said.
“[Head coach Tom Thibodeau] had to call a timeout in the first minutes of the second half because we weren’t fighting enough.
We’re not getting stops at critical moments.
Teams are getting on runs.”The fall from grace on the defensive side of the ball has been astounding for a Knicks team that had the NBA’s best defense last season.
We got to find a way to get one.’’With 20 games to go, the Knicks are certainly up against it.

     Last night the Knicks were the Schmo to the 76ers’ marquee, the heel to their hero, the coyote to the roadrunner.
The Sixers were better on 2s, way better on 3s and far better at the line.
Those forgotten schmos, however anonymous, however forgotten, helped in their own way to build WWE into the mega-machine it is today.
Over at The Strickland I’m leading a reveal of the top-75 Knicks of all-time.
The loss last night was game one of a seven-game road trip for the Knicks.

     Harden had 26 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists as he led the Sixers to a 123-108 win over the Knicks at home.

I felt the energy, I felt the love, so I just wanted to come out there and show my love back.

     Knicks Floated as ‘Homecoming’ Landing Spot for Ex Top-10 Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks have some decisions to make in the upcoming offseason, and one of the most important ones is what to do with their center Mitchell Robinson.
One name who has been floated is Orlando Magic center Mo Bamba, somebody who the New York Post’s Marc Berman says is open to the idea.
Another HomecomingGiven how disastrous the Kemba Walker homecoming has been in New York, the Knicks might be hesitant on another.
“Mo has played better this year, but it’s still difficult to project him as a starting center for a good team at this point,” said the scout.
“Last offseason was Bamba’s first healthy summer to put in the type of strength and conditioning work needed to be a solid starting center in the league.
