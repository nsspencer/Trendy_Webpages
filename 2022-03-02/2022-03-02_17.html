     Ken Paxton, George P. Bush in GOP runoff for Texas attorney general
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, weakened by legal problems and allegations of official misconduct, finished first in Tuesday's GOP primary but was denied outright victory, pushing him into a runoff against George P. Bush.
With almost three-fourths of the state's precincts reporting, Paxton had about 43% of the vote, sending the two-term incumbent into a May 24 runoff against Bush, the Texas land commissioner who had 22% of the vote.
Election results:See the 2022 Texas Primary Election resultsFormer Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, fell short in the four-way primary.
"Only one in three Republicans know that Ken Paxton is facing three felony counts in Houston court and facing an FBI investigation looking into bribery and corruption, so part of that is on me," he told reporters Tuesday night.
Meantime, the Democratic race for attorney general appeared to be headed to a runoff as well.

     Ken Paxton And George P. Bush Advance To May Runoff In GOP Texas Attorney General Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN (CBSDFW.COM/CNN) – It will take a runoff election for Texas Republicans to decide on their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of an outright victory in Tuesday’s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May.
With more than 93% of the state’s precincts reporting, Paxton had about 42.7% of the vote, versus Bush who had 22.8% of the vote.
Paxton led the four-candidate field by a comfortable margin, despite feisty and well-funded challenges from Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert.
His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP’s effort to yet again sweep statewide offices.
Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state’s high court, is a relative moderate.

     On the same conservative radio show, Bush revealed he would be contacting Donald Trump to ask the former president to reconsider his endorsement of Paxton.
During two terms leading the General Land Office, Bush has faced criticism over Hurricane Harvey relief efforts and a major renovation of the Alamo historic site.
In Tuesday’s primary election, Paxton captured 43% of the vote, while Bush won around 23%, according to unofficial results.
During an interview on a conservative radio show Wednesday, he accused Bush of not having the experience to be the state’s attorney general.
Yet after courting the former president’s backing early on in the attorney general’s race, Trump endorsed Paxton last summer.

     Today Texans are headed to the polls to vote in the states first primary of the 2022 midterm election season.
CNN —Texas Republicans will need a May runoff to decide their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of clinching a majority in Tuesday’s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May, CNN projects.
The Republican primary for the 28th District was not decided Tuesday, with Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, advancing to the runoff, CNN projects.
He will win his primary outright to move on the general election where he will face Mayra Flores, who will best three other candidates in the GOP primary, CNN projects.
Greene and North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn were also opposing GOP leadership in the race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Kevin Brady in Texas’ 8th District.
