     Arkansas basketball: Eric Musselman sounds off on NCAA Tournament, NET rating after LSU win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arkansas basketball coach Eric Musselman is leading one of the nation's hottest teams following Wednesday night's 77-76 win over LSU in the home finale, and he hopes the NCAA Tournament selection committee is keeping a close eye on the Razorbacks' play down the stretch.
"You beat a really good team like Kentucky and your NET … what is that thing?
I’ll be real interested because (LSU’s) NET is real high.
"I hope there’s common sense and now just some NET number … I mean, Saint Mary’s beat Gonzaga and their NET barely moved.
Here's the rest of Musselman's key points following the Razorbacks' win over the Tigers.

     Why BofA Downgrades SoFi Technologies, Despite Upbeat Q4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: SOFI) reported strong fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Tuesday.
The SoFi Technologies Analyst: Mihir Bhatia downgraded the rating for SoFi Technologies from Buy to Neutral while keeping the price target unchanged at $14.
The SoFi Technologies Thesis: Shares of the company jumped 18% in after-hours trading and the risk-reward seems “more balanced from here,” Bhatia said in the downgrade note.
Although SoFi Technologies has executed well to date, the 2022 guidance is back-end loaded and “we think it could take some time for investors to gain confidence it can be achieved,” he added.
SOFI Price Action: Shares of SoFi Technologies had risen by 6.79% to $11.96 at publication Wednesday morning.

     LSU put itself in prime position but foul calls and paint struggles piled up and were the ultimate difference makers in a 77-76 loss to the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Coming out the gate into the second half, LSU was shot out of a cannon, going on a 7-0 run to take a 42-35 lead.
“Our problem is not staying in the game, but finishing a game,” Eason said after the game.
In a hard-fought loss, the Tigers paint struggles were too much.
