     Chelsea advances in the FA Cup over Luton with a comeback win, with goals from Saul, Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku.
Chelsea have won the FA Cup five times under Abramovich.
The vocal Chelsea fans were silenced early on as Reece Burke staked Luton Town to a 1-0 lead in the second minute, his fine glancing header from a corner kick beating Kepa Arrizabalaga at his far post.
Timo Werner scores Chelsea's second goal in an FA Cup win over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road.
Michael Regan/Getty ImagesWerner drew Chelsea level in the 68th minute with a composed finish after settling a perfectly weighted ball over the top of the Luton Town defence from Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

     And sure enough, the home side set about their Magic of the Cup moment by taking an early lead from a set piece, inside of two minutes.
Chelsea were able to quickly settle down however, despite the cobbled-together lineup, and after letting a couple chances go begging, equalized through Saul with his first goal for the club.
Then, completely against the run of play, Luton had yet another Magic of the Cup moment, taking advantage of a misplayed offside trap to run behind and slot into the back of the net through Chelsea fan Harry Cornick.
And it didn’t take long for us to then take the lead for the first time, with Werner turning provider this time and Lukaku finishing things off.
The home side had run out of Magic by then, and we’d see things out with ease.

     The first change is in goal, where Kepa Arrizabalaga comes in for Edouard Mendy, and it looks likely to be a back four in front of him.
Antonio Rudiger retains his place in the side, with fellow centre-back Malang Sarr joining him.
Kenedy makes his first appearance since returning from loan in January on the left flank, with Callum Hudson-Odoi returning on the right.
The second player to keep their place from the weekend is Mason Mount, with forwards Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku both being introduced in the front three, after impressing from the bench at Wembley.
Teenage left-back Dylan Williams is named on the bench for Chelsea's senior team for the first time following his January move from Derby County.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chelsea are through to the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 3-2 win over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road on Tuesday evening.
A classy finish from loanee Saul Niguez in the 27th minute brought parity, before Harry Cornick sprung the offside trap in minute 40 to put The Hatters ahead.
Chelsea came out after the break with fresh impetus, but found themselves struggling to unlock a resolute Luton backline.
It wasn't pretty by any stretch, but it was a battling performance just three days removed from a monumental tussle that drained the Chelsea squad.
Harvey Vale - 6/10 [62]This was a decent enough showing from the young man, getting a good attempt off of his own.
