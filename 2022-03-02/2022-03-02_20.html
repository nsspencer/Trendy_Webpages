     Arkansas basketball: Eric Musselman sounds off on NCAA Tournament, NET rating after LSU win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arkansas basketball coach Eric Musselman is leading one of the nation's hottest teams following Wednesday night's 77-76 win over LSU in the home finale, and he hopes the NCAA Tournament selection committee is keeping a close eye on the Razorbacks' play down the stretch.
"You beat a really good team like Kentucky and your NET … what is that thing?
I’ll be real interested because (LSU’s) NET is real high.
"I hope there’s common sense and now just some NET number … I mean, Saint Mary’s beat Gonzaga and their NET barely moved.
Here's the rest of Musselman's key points following the Razorbacks' win over the Tigers.

     LSU put itself in prime position but foul calls and paint struggles piled up and were the ultimate difference makers in a 77-76 loss to the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Coming out the gate into the second half, LSU was shot out of a cannon, going on a 7-0 run to take a 42-35 lead.
“Our problem is not staying in the game, but finishing a game,” Eason said after the game.
In a hard-fought loss, the Tigers paint struggles were too much.

     March 2 is recognized state-wide as Texas Independence Day, marking the anniversary of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico in 1836, which established the Republic of Texas.
For many proud, native Texans — like myself — every day is Texas Independence Day, but this year will be spent “con más ganas” as my family recently discovered that we’re related to an important Texas Revolution war hero.
One of the army’s first headquarters was located at a Flores family ranch.
After winning independence and establishing the Republic of Texas, Flores went on to serve as 1st Lieutenant in Seguín’s Company and married Concepción Rojo, Seguín’s sister.
The relationship between Mexico and Texas goes way back, and since this freshman class is 32% Hispanic, it felt appropriate to highlight this aspect of Hispanic heritage on Texas Independence Day.
