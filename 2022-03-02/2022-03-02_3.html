     Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: A complete timeline of their relationship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Romance rumorsKardashian and Davidson kissed on “SNL” before they started dating.
NBCKardashian and Davidson were first seen together in October 2021 in an “SNL” sketch in which they kissed as Jasmine and Aladdin on the magic carpet.
Later that month, photos surfaced of the pair holding hands on a Halloween ride in Buena Park, Calif., though a source told People they were “just friends” at the time.
“Pete arranged a dinner on the rooftop privately,” a restaurant source told Page Six at the time.
The judge also honored her request to change her name back from “Kim Kardashian West” to “Kim Kardashian.”

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Kim Kardashian Is Reportedly Trying to Protect ‘Tender’ Pete Davidson Amid Kanye West Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.

     Russia Gains Strategic Advantage by Taking Southern City of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kherson, a key strategic point along the Black Sea, has been captured by Russia, making it the first major Ukrainian city to fall to invading Russian forces.
As the fighting raged into its seventh day, throngs of the Russian military were seen advancing upon the city of approximately 300,000 people.
The capture of Kherson represents a major strategic victory for the Russian army as it continues its efforts to annex Ukraine.
Kherson's fall comes as the Russian military continues an aggressive assault on another major Ukrainian metropolis—Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.
The continued assault could make Kharkiv the second major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands.

     Kim Kardashian Legally Single After Judge Grants Her Request Amid Divorce From Kanye West (UPDATE)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is legally single.
TMZ reports that Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Steve Cochran on Wednesday approved Kardashian’s request to be granted single status in the eyes of the law amid her divorce proceedings with Kanye West.
Although the couple haven’t completely settled their financial and custody issues, the ruling will allow both parties to become legally divorced.
The ruling arrives over two months after Kardashian requested the judge to restore her single status.
“For so long, I did what made other people happy,” Kardashian said.

     Kherson mayor indicates the city has fallen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kherson Ihor Kolykhaiev has said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” — indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.
The announcement on his Facebook page follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city.
Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000.
On Wednesday in Kyiv, the mayor had disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainian forces were still fighting in parts of the city.
The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday.
