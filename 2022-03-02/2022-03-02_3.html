     James Harden Makes Home Debut vs. Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 76ers (37-23) will seek their fourth consecutive victory Wednesday at The Center, as James Harden makes his home debut as a Sixer.
Joel Embiid has continued his MVP-caliber season alongside Harden, scoring 34 points, 10 rebounds, and three assists Friday and 37 points, nine rebounds, three assists, a steal, and four blocks Sunday.
“The biggest takeaway is we got two wins, really good wins,” Harden said.
Embiid leads the NBA in scoring (29.8 ppg) while Harden is second in the league in assists (10.3 apg).
Fournier completed his line with two rebounds, two assists, and a steal, while Barrett added five rebounds, six assists, and two steals.

     PHILADELPHIA -- After a third straight sterling performance in a 76ers uniform -- but a first in front of the fans here inside Wells Fargo Center -- James Harden declared Philadelphia feels like home.
Just the love, the support, man, from looking around, hearing, 'We love you James.'
James Harden was thrilled by the welcome Philadelphia fans gave him on Wednesday night.
Wednesday's 25-point performance from Maxey was his third straight with more than 20 points since Harden entered the lineup.
Ultimately, though, Philadelphia is going as far as its new superstar tandem of Harden and Embiid can take them.
