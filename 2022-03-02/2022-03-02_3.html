     Kim Kardashian Is Reportedly Trying to Protect ‘Tender’ Pete Davidson Amid Kanye West Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.

     AdvertisementKim Kardashian has been pictured for the first time since it was revealed she is officially single again amid her contentious divorce battle with ex-husband Kanye West.
Yesterday, Kardashian — wearing a black blouse and her hair swept back — appeared via video at a court in downtown LA.
The first was Kanye request to prevent Kim from transferring assets out of any trust — a request Kim has fired back at due to their existing prenup, which already keeps their trusts and assets separate.
