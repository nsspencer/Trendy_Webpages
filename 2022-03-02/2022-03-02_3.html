     Romance rumorsKardashian and Davidson kissed on “SNL” before they started dating.
NBCKardashian and Davidson were first seen together in October 2021 in an “SNL” sketch in which they kissed as Jasmine and Aladdin on the magic carpet.
Later that month, photos surfaced of the pair holding hands on a Halloween ride in Buena Park, Calif., though a source told People they were “just friends” at the time.
“Pete arranged a dinner on the rooftop privately,” a restaurant source told Page Six at the time.
The judge also honored her request to change her name back from “Kim Kardashian West” to “Kim Kardashian.”

     Kim Kardashian Is Reportedly Trying to Protect ‘Tender’ Pete Davidson Amid Kanye West Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.
