     Later, West posted an apology to Kardashian but the drama only intensified.
On March 2nd, West posted a music video for his song "EAZY" off his album Donda 2.
The music video has been under fire due to the graphic contents, including the violent kidnapping of Davidson.
The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has shown support for her boyfriend as she liked director James Gunn's tweet, defending Davidson amid the release of the music video.
On social media, Kardashian posted pictures while she hiking with members of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC) and people who were previously incarcerated.

     Kim Kardashian Is Reportedly Trying to Protect ‘Tender’ Pete Davidson Amid Kanye West Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.

     Kim Kardashian Legally Single After Judge Grants Her Request Amid Divorce From Kanye West (UPDATE)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is legally single.
TMZ reports that Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Steve Cochran on Wednesday approved Kardashian’s request to be granted single status in the eyes of the law amid her divorce proceedings with Kanye West.
Although the couple haven’t completely settled their financial and custody issues, the ruling will allow both parties to become legally divorced.
The ruling arrives over two months after Kardashian requested the judge to restore her single status.
“For so long, I did what made other people happy,” Kardashian said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AdvertisementKim Kardashian has been pictured for the first time since it was revealed she is officially single again amid her contentious divorce battle with ex-husband Kanye West.
Yesterday, Kardashian — wearing a black blouse and her hair swept back — appeared via video at a court in downtown LA.
The first was Kanye request to prevent Kim from transferring assets out of any trust — a request Kim has fired back at due to their existing prenup, which already keeps their trusts and assets separate.
Despite the ongoing divorce drama with Kanye, Kim has continued to devote herself to the causes near and dear to her heart.
