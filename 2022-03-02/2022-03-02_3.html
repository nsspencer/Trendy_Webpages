     Kim Kardashian Is Reportedly Trying to Protect ‘Tender’ Pete Davidson Amid Kanye West Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.

The Los Angeles Lakers waived Jordan on Tuesday, using the roster spot to sign veteran guard DJ Augustin.
Jordan started 19 games this season before dropping out of the team's rotation.
Jordan was All-NBA first team with the Clippers in 2016, and he was a two-time All-NBA defensive first-team choice in 2015 and 2016.

Superior Court Judge Steve Cochran also granted Kardashian's request to drop the "West" from her married name, Kim Kardashian West.
So, what's next for Kim Kardashian now that she is legally single?
Relaunching KKW BeautyBack in summer 2021, Kardashian announced KKW Beauty [Kim Kardashian West] would temporarily be "ceasing operations" from August 1, 2021.

     Maxey has all of the requisite ability to become the Philadelphia 76ers’ third star.
Allow me to present you with the stat line of a player from the Philadelphia 76ers’ second-straight win over the New York Knicks.
No, those numbers belong to Tyrese Maxey, and they aren’t an anomaly either.
Look, I get what Stephen A Smith was going for; I really do.
But to call Tyrese Maxey overrated or incapable of shouldering a bigger load now that James Harden had arrived is simply untrue; Maxey is playing like the Philadelphia 76ers’ third-best star and should be considered as such until he proves folks otherwise.

     Kim Kardashian supports Pete Davidson on Twitter after Kanye West's disturbing video, plus more news
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian likes a pro-Pete Davidson tweet after Kanye West's controversial video release As Kanye West continues to make his feelings about Pete Davidson public through his music and on social media, Kim Kardashian gave her boyfriend a subtle show of support on Twitter on March 3.
"For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know," James wrote on the platform.
Pete had briefly returned to Instagram since he and Kim started dating, but he deactivated his account again amid Kanye's ongoing public attacks.
With her new single status, Kim will reportedly drop "West" from her last name.
After announcing Diablo Cody would write the screenplay in 2020, Madonna reportedly began working with Erin Cressida Wilson instead.

     Last night the Knicks were the Schmo to the 76ers’ marquee, the heel to their hero, the coyote to the roadrunner.
The Sixers were better on 2s, way better on 3s and far better at the line.
Those forgotten schmos, however anonymous, however forgotten, helped in their own way to build WWE into the mega-machine it is today.
Over at The Strickland I’m leading a reveal of the top-75 Knicks of all-time.
The loss last night was game one of a seven-game road trip for the Knicks.

     James Harden's honeymoon with 76ers continues as he energizes Philly fans in win over Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA -- The honeymoon phase between James Harden and the Philadelphia 76ers is still going strong.
Both of those guys have excelled playing alongside Harden early on, which isn't super surprising, as Harden's sheer presence out on the floor has opened things up for all of his new teammates.
In addition to his defensive dedication, what has been especially impressive about Harden's early games with the Sixers is how smoothly everything seems to be coming together.
That hasn't been the case here, as Embiid and Harden have immediately found a solid rhythm playing off of each other.
You want fans to be involved, you want fans to know everything about their basketball team and that's what we have in Philly."

     Doc Rivers is on the verge of reuniting with DeAndre Jordan, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
ET on Thursday, at which time he will reportedly sign with the Philadelphia 76ers.
In those years, Jordan made the All-NBA First Team once (2016), the All-NBA Third Team twice (2015, 2017) and the All-Defensive First Team twice (2015, 2016).
Jordan was named an All-Star in 2017 and led the league in rebounding in 2014 and 2015.
Last season, the Brooklyn Nets removed Jordan from the rotation late in the regular season and didn't play him a single minute in the playoffs.
