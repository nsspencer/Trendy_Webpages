     Read Across America Week is celebrated across the US surrounding the birthday of one of the nation's most loved children's authors-- Dr. Seuss.

All grade levels from pre-K to second grade wore their favorite hats, and Moore donned the full Cat in the Hat costume — yes, including the hat.

"We sat in the house and did nothing at all," Moore read.

The new authors and illustrators will represent a diverse cross-section of racial backgrounds to represent as many families as possible, Dr Seuss Enterprises announced in a statement.
“We look forward to putting the spotlight on a new generation of talent who we know will bring their unique voices and style to the page, while also drawing inspiration from the creativity and imagination of Dr Seuss,” Susan Brandt, president and CEO of Dr Seuss Enterprises, said in the statement.
Dr Seuss Enterprises has not yet disclosed the writers and illustrators who will work on the new books because contracts are still being ironed out.
Dr Seuss books such as “Green Eggs and Ham” and “The Cat in the Hat” remain popular more than 30 years after Geisel’s death in 1991.
