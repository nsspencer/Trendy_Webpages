     Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to face George P. Bush in runoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Driving the news: With nearly all the ballots counted, Paxton, mired in corruption scandals, had just shy of 43% of the vote.
Having failed to clear 50%, he will end up in a runoff against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, who held nearly 23% of the vote in a four-person race.
By squeezing into the runoff, Bush breathes new life into the fabled Texas political name and sets up a barn-burner of a race.
The big picture: The Texas primary was the first big midterm test of the ex-president's clout within the GOP since the Jan. 6 insurrection.
What's next: The primary runoff is set for May 24.

     Ken Paxton, George P. Bush in GOP runoff for Texas attorney general
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, weakened by legal problems and allegations of official misconduct, finished first in Tuesday's GOP primary but was denied outright victory, pushing him into a runoff against George P. Bush.
With almost three-fourths of the state's precincts reporting, Paxton had about 43% of the vote, sending the two-term incumbent into a May 24 runoff against Bush, the Texas land commissioner who had 22% of the vote.
Election results:See the 2022 Texas Primary Election resultsFormer Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, fell short in the four-way primary.
"Only one in three Republicans know that Ken Paxton is facing three felony counts in Houston court and facing an FBI investigation looking into bribery and corruption, so part of that is on me," he told reporters Tuesday night.
Meantime, the Democratic race for attorney general appeared to be headed to a runoff as well.

     Ken Paxton And George P. Bush Advance To May Runoff In GOP Texas Attorney General Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN (CBSDFW.COM/CNN) – It will take a runoff election for Texas Republicans to decide on their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of an outright victory in Tuesday’s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May.
With more than 93% of the state’s precincts reporting, Paxton had about 42.7% of the vote, versus Bush who had 22.8% of the vote.
Paxton led the four-candidate field by a comfortable margin, despite feisty and well-funded challenges from Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert.
His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP’s effort to yet again sweep statewide offices.
Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state’s high court, is a relative moderate.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN, Texas (KTRK) -- Despite an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton failed to garner enough Republican support in Tuesday's GOP primary to avoid a runoff.
"At an election night watch party in McKinney on Tuesday night, Paxton acknowledged he was heading toward a runoff race and pitched himself as the candidate against the "establishment."
Late in the campaign, Paxton had also labeled Guzman as the "establishment" candidate.
A week before the election, Paxton ran TV ads that blasted Gohmert for missing hundreds of votes in Congress during his 17 years in office.
"Indicted Ken Paxton is the most corrupt attorney general in the country, and our campaign is ready to defeat him this November.
