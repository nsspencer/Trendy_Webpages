     Incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar leads AOC-backed Jessica Cisneros in Texas district
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Driving the news: U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Laredo, has a 50% to 45.4% lead over Jessica Cisneros, an immigration attorney, with more than 99% of the votes counted in Texas' 28th congressional district.
The Associated Press overnight Tuesday declared that Cuellar and Cisneros were headed to a runoff.
Greg Casar, another AOC-backed candidate, won his Democratic primary for an open, heavily Democratic congressional seat that runs from Austin to San Antonio.
Of note: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also came to Texas in February to rally for Casar and Cisneros.
What's next: Long reliably Democratic, the 28th congressional district was recently redrawn by Texas lawmakers to make it more competitive for Republicans.

     AOC called out Biden's failure to mention student debt during the State of the Union on Tuesday.
She said it was among the issues important to Democratic constituencies that were "left unsaid."
Biden extended the student-loan payment pause through May 1 but hasn't commented on broad relief.
While Biden recently extended the pause on payments a third time, through May 1, his campaign pledge to cancel student debt broadly remains unfulfilled.
Lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez have consistently warned that failure to deliver on progressive priorities for voters, like student debt relief, could cost Democrats the majority in Congress.

     AOC Has Some Notes For Biden's State Of The Union SpeechJoe Biden just can't get a break.
The President of the United States was facing insurmountable challenges before even taking office, and the state of the world doesn't seem to be improving.
A recent poll by Harvard University's Institute of Politics finds that the country's younger voters are increasingly losing faith in Biden.
The biennial survey shows that the POTUS' approval rating has dropped 13% between 18-29-year-olds, who are becoming more and more disillusioned with the political climate in the USA.
The POTUS gave his first speech concerning the country's current condition on March 1, and AOC has some notes for his first State of the Union speech.

On certain issues, such as immigration, Biden wasn’t nearly as radical and accommodative as he should have been, AOC said.
Biden didn’t dedicate enough time in the speech to climate change and the importance of weaning America off fossil fuels, AOC suggested.
But we really need to hear more, I think, about mass transit, trains, high-speed rail and renewable energy,” she said.

     Cuellar dragged into a run-off with AOC-backed Jessica Cisneros after Texas primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Conservative Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly edged out over progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros in the Texas primary Tuesday, and the pair will now go head-to-head in a run-off election in May.
Cuellar won 48.5% of the vote and Cisneros 46.8%, but since neither broke 50% the race heads to a runoff under Texas election law.
Cuellar is one of the last pro-choice Democrats in Congress and has been critical of President Biden's handling of the southern border.
Cisneros received a political blessing with an FBI raid on Cuellar's home in the month leading up to the primary.
Still, Cuellar outspent Cisneros 2:1 and attacked her for being too liberal to hold down the district.
