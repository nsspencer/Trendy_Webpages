     But an interesting substitution against Norwich City on Wednesday night might be an indication that Liverpool fans will see more of Mané in the position.
Interestingly, Díaz slotted in on the left flank, while Mané replaced Origi's central position in the front three.
But the fact that Klopp decided to keep Mané in a central position is perhaps a suggestion of where the Liverpool boss sees his long-term future at the club.
Based on his performances so far, Mané suits the central position well.
The new position change could ensure the longevity of his career, with the central position better suited to his qualities at the moment and that can only be a good sign for Liverpool.

     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.

Nicola Soderlund, managing partner at Eccho, said: “The series is a comedy but also an important document of where Zelensky comes from.
His fictional president is a normal man, who grows into his role as a heroic and adored leader.”Also Read: Savage Rhythm Review: No Cool or Sensual Dance Moves Can Save This Weak Show!

     Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky Series ‘Servant Of The People’ Sells To UK’s Channel 4 And Others
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global networks including the UK’s Channel 4 have picked up Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky’s comedy series Servant of the People.
Channel 4 will air the comedy from this Sunday along with documentary special Zelenskyy: The Man Who Took on Putin.
Eccho Rights has, meanwhile, removed all Russian-owned and produced series from its catalogue and donated €50,000 ($55,500) to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society.
“The series is a comedy but also an important document of where Zelenskiy comes from,” said Eccho Managing Partner Nicola Söderlund.
While the real world scenario facing Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people is far more grim and appalling than the comedy of the series, there are obvious parallels with the real world situation.”

Liverpool shouldn’t take Norwich lightly but they should have enough quality to see this one through.
It was Takumi Minamino scoring again in the 39th minute after a well worked corner kick from Tsmikas.
Second HalfLiverpool began the second half much as they ended the first half but couldn’t turn anything into quality chances.
Liverpool’s final two changes came in the 83rd minute when Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz replaced Origi and Diogo Jota.

     Brad Pitt fights off other assassins in Bullet Train trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     U.K.’s Channel 4 Picks Up Volodymyr Zelensky’s ‘Servant of the People’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Britain’s Channel 4 has picked up rights to Servant of the People, the Ukraine comedy series starring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and the show that launched his political career.
The Ukraine president has been a model example of a wartime leader, posting defiant videos from the streets of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and calling on his citizens to fight.
Swedish television group Eccho Rights picked up the international rights to Servant of the People and licensed the series to Channel 4.
“Eccho Rights stands in solidarity with our friends and partners in Ukraine.
Eccho Rights is licensing all three seasons of Servant of the People as well as a feature film based on the show.

     Liverpool are through to the Quarter-Finals of the FA Cup after beating Norwich 2-1 at Anfield last night.
Unfortunately for Jones and Liverpool, he picked up a knock and was taken off at half-time.
Taki Minamino's brace was just the epitome of what this Liverpool forward line are capable of.
Despite not playing many matches this season, the Japanese forward has been vital in Liverpool's cup runs and deserves every bit of praise coming his way.
Last night's victory sees them go into the FA Cup Quarter-Final draw for the first time under Jurgen Klopp.
