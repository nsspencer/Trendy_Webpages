     Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky Series ‘Servant Of The People’ Sells To UK’s Channel 4 And Others
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global networks including the UK’s Channel 4 have picked up Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky’s comedy series Servant of the People.
Channel 4 will air the comedy from this Sunday along with documentary special Zelenskyy: The Man Who Took on Putin.
Eccho Rights has, meanwhile, removed all Russian-owned and produced series from its catalogue and donated €50,000 ($55,500) to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society.
“The series is a comedy but also an important document of where Zelenskiy comes from,” said Eccho Managing Partner Nicola Söderlund.
While the real world scenario facing Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people is far more grim and appalling than the comedy of the series, there are obvious parallels with the real world situation.”

     In the days since Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine, all eyes have been on Volodymyr Zelensky.
President Zelensky met his wife at university.
Before becoming an actor and a comedian, and prior to his political career, President Zelensky met his future wife while they both attended Kryvyi Rih National University, according to People.
Zelensky was elected president in 2018 with nearly 73% of the vote.
Volodymyr and Olena Zelensky welcomed their daughter Aleksandra in July 2004.

     Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s family photo keeps appearing in my social media feeds.
His quip turning down an evacuation offer from the United States (“I need ammunition, not a ride”) is already emblazoned on shirts, mugs, and flags for purchase on Etsy.
Treating Zelensky like a superhero—call it Marvelization—recasts a geopolitical conflict in which real people are really dying into entertainment, into content.
With Zelensky, the fandom sprouting up around him in the United States is especially dispiriting because the circumstances he is in are so relentlessly grim.
Zelensky, who played the Ukrainian president on television before he was elected, is an inherently likable figure.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Britain’s Channel 4 has picked up rights to Servant of the People, the Ukraine comedy series starring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and the show that launched his political career.
The Ukraine president has been a model example of a wartime leader, posting defiant videos from the streets of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and calling on his citizens to fight.
Swedish television group Eccho Rights picked up the international rights to Servant of the People and licensed the series to Channel 4.
“Eccho Rights stands in solidarity with our friends and partners in Ukraine.
Eccho Rights is licensing all three seasons of Servant of the People as well as a feature film based on the show.
