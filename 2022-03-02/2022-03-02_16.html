     FA Cup 2022 Match Coverage: Liverpool vs. Norwich City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following their League Cup triumph against Chelsea over the weekend, Liverpool turn their attention to the FA Cup and one of the three other trophies Jürgen Klopp’s big red machine are still in the running for as we head towards the final months of the 2021-22 European football season.
Their opponents, Norwich City, are a Premier League side but one that won’t be expected to be in the top flight next season given they sit dead last in the table.
They’ve also lost to Liverpool three times already this season, twice in the league and once in the early rounds of the League Cup.
The combined scoreline of those three games adds up to a rather lopsided 9-1 in favour of Liverpool.
Stick with The Liverpool Offside for full coverage of Wednesday night’s match under the lights at Anfield.

Liverpool shouldn’t take Norwich lightly but they should have enough quality to see this one through.
It was Takumi Minamino scoring again in the 39th minute after a well worked corner kick from Tsmikas.
Second HalfLiverpool began the second half much as they ended the first half but couldn’t turn anything into quality chances.
Liverpool’s final two changes came in the 83rd minute when Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz replaced Origi and Diogo Jota.

     Coupled with the defense frailties, Norwich lack clinical edge, registering fifteen goals all season.
IMAGO / Focus ImagesNew ManagerSince his arrival, Smith has employed a system not far derived from his time at Aston Villa.
Any hope of survival for Smith's Canaries rests upon if they can collect enough points against teams in the bottom half of the table.
Norwich, in 20th, and Everton, in 17th, are separated by five points, although the latter has two games in hand.
The Canaries have won ten of their seventeen points from teams in the current bottom six.

     Six things seen in Liverpool vs Norwich as Takumi Minamino excels and future plan set in motion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool met expectations with a relatively comfortable FA Cup fifth-round win, triumphing over Norwich City for the fourth time this season.
Takumi Minamino led the way with a first-half brace, continuing his love affair with the cup competitions this season.
With an enviable goals per 90 return this season, Minamino will surely have plenty of suitors come the summer.
Liverpool probably won’t be getting an apology of their own following the Norwich game, but they were certainly on the end of another questionable call.
However, Jones was handed a start against Norwich, and all indications are that he is channelling the frustration in the right way.
