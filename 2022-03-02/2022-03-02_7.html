     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Florida governor Ron DeSantis has drawn outrage from parents after he was caught on camera berating teenagers in his state for wearing face masks to protect against Covid-19.
“It’s just shocking that the governor told these kids: ‘Take off your mask,’” Ms Marshall, who said she urges her son to cover his face at school, told WFLA.
“Can’t believe @GovRonDeSantis would belittle &amp; bully kids to take off their masks by calling them ‘ridiculous,’” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted.
Breathe free, feel safe and be happy.”She also accused those who force children to wear masks of being the real bullies.
It is a student and parents’ choice to protect their health in a way they feel most appropriate.

     Florida Gov DeSantis Berates Students for Wearing Masks

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ron DeSantis admonished a group of high school students for wearing face masks at an indoor news conference Wednesday, saying it was time to stop what he called “this COVID theater."
The Republican governor approached the students and asked them to remove their masks as they waited for him at the press event at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
One of the students, 14-year-old Kevin Brown Jr., a high school freshman, told The Associated Press he was caught off-guard by DeSantis and felt pressured to removed his mask.
We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district," Davis said.
Though the CDC late last month eased its masking guidelines, the agency is still recommending masks indoors in areas it considers high risk.

We are a Ukrainian city, and we want to stay a Ukrainian city," Zorina said.
Kherson resident Zorina described to Amanpour the situation on the ground in the city.
“Our mayor is in contact with us, and city administration is in contact with us.

     Kherson: Russian army moves to cut Ukraine’s access to sea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west.
The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond.
A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson.
Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city.
I just asked [them] not to shoot people.”Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko.

Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.
The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets.
