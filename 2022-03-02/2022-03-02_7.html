     Farrah Forke, Who Played a Helicopter Pilot on ‘Wings,’ Dies at 54
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Farrah Forke, the actress who catapulted to fame playing a helicopter pilot on the NBC sitcom “Wings,” died at her home in Texas on Friday.
She was 54.
Her death was confirmed by her mother, Beverly Talmage, who said in a statement that her daughter had had cancer for several years.
Forke played the alluring pilot Alex Lambert on three seasons of “Wings,” which aired from 1990 to 1997 and followed the adventures of the offbeat characters at a small airport on Nantucket.
Her character’s affections were battled over by Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly and Steven Weber), brothers who ran a one-plane airline.
