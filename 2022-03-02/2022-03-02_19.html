     Jrue Holiday and the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Miami Heat in Wisconsin on Wednesday evening.
The Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat played a thrilling game in Wisconsin on Wednesday evening, and the Bucks came away victorious on their home floor with a 120-119 win.
Jrue Holiday made the game-winning shot, and the exciting sequence can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Bleacher Report.
The Heat fell to 41-22 with the loss, but they still remain as the top seed in the east.
The two teams have had several battles in the playoffs over the last few seasons, and most recently the Bucks swept the Heat in the first-round last year.

     The Heat led by 14 with six minutes left.
That stood as the game-winner when the Heat, out of timeouts, missed a desperate heave.
Holiday and Antetokounmpo each outscored Miami in the final six minutes.
Antetokounmpo finished 28 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.
Holiday added 25 points and 11 assists in what’s hopefully a playoff preview.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Bucks win a thriller, 120-119.
NBA.com Box ScoreFueled by Khris Middleton’s ten points, the Bucks did a solid job of keeping the Heat at bay in the first quarter.
A buzzer-beater fadeaway from Giannis Antetokounmpo would pad their a lead a little more, pushing the Bucks’ lead to 36-28 going into the second.
Stat That Stood OutThe Bucks locked down the Heat in the final minutes.
When it seemed like all was lost, the Bucks’ defense clamped up and came through when it was needed most.

     Analyzing the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is the Milwaukee Bucks of the past 25 games.
Looking at the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022The thing is: it just seems like a lack of urgency.
There are a multitude of factors that one can pinpoint, but here are four ways this lack of urgency has manifested itself on the court.
When watching recent Bucks games, the idea of guarding the other team has become optional.
But this team, as it currently stands, lacks urgency and effort.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.

     Right behind them in the BetMGM odds are the Milwaukee Bucks, and then the Philadelphia 76ers.
The Bucks, at their healthiest and best, are still a good team.
The Heat upset the Bucks in the 2020 bubble, then the Bucks swept Miami in the first round last year.
The Heat are 2-1 against the Bucks this season, but lost the only meeting in Milwaukee 124-102.
Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler (22) and his team have a big game in Milwaukee on Wednesday night.
