    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arkansas basketball coach Eric Musselman is leading one of the nation's hottest teams following Wednesday night's 77-76 win over LSU in the home finale, and he hopes the NCAA Tournament selection committee is keeping a close eye on the Razorbacks' play down the stretch.
"You beat a really good team like Kentucky and your NET … what is that thing?
I’ll be real interested because (LSU’s) NET is real high.
"I hope there’s common sense and now just some NET number … I mean, Saint Mary’s beat Gonzaga and their NET barely moved.
Here's the rest of Musselman's key points following the Razorbacks' win over the Tigers.

     Liverpool are through to the Quarter-Finals of the FA Cup after beating Norwich 2-1 at Anfield last night.
Unfortunately for Jones and Liverpool, he picked up a knock and was taken off at half-time.
Taki Minamino's brace was just the epitome of what this Liverpool forward line are capable of.
Despite not playing many matches this season, the Japanese forward has been vital in Liverpool's cup runs and deserves every bit of praise coming his way.
Last night's victory sees them go into the FA Cup Quarter-Final draw for the first time under Jurgen Klopp.

     LSU Basketball Drops Heartbreaker Down Stretch to No. 14 Arkansas 77-76
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LSU put itself in prime position but foul calls and paint struggles piled up and were the ultimate difference makers in a 77-76 loss to the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Coming out the gate into the second half, LSU was shot out of a cannon, going on a 7-0 run to take a 42-35 lead.
“Our problem is not staying in the game, but finishing a game,” Eason said after the game.
In a hard-fought loss, the Tigers paint struggles were too much.
Arkansas’ inside dominance became the difference maker late in the second half and shifted the momentum their way.
