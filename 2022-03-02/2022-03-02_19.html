    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool are through to the Quarter-Finals of the FA Cup after beating Norwich 2-1 at Anfield last night.
Unfortunately for Jones and Liverpool, he picked up a knock and was taken off at half-time.
Taki Minamino's brace was just the epitome of what this Liverpool forward line are capable of.
Despite not playing many matches this season, the Japanese forward has been vital in Liverpool's cup runs and deserves every bit of praise coming his way.
Last night's victory sees them go into the FA Cup Quarter-Final draw for the first time under Jurgen Klopp.

     Jürgen Klopp showed his hand in Liverpool vs Norwich as 10-minute cameo confirms major switch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But an interesting substitution against Norwich City on Wednesday night might be an indication that Liverpool fans will see more of Mané in the position.
Interestingly, Díaz slotted in on the left flank, while Mané replaced Origi's central position in the front three.
But the fact that Klopp decided to keep Mané in a central position is perhaps a suggestion of where the Liverpool boss sees his long-term future at the club.
Based on his performances so far, Mané suits the central position well.
The new position change could ensure the longevity of his career, with the central position better suited to his qualities at the moment and that can only be a good sign for Liverpool.
