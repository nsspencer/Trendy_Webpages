     Greg Casar Wins Texas Congressional Primary; Jessica Cisneros Heads to Runoff Against Henry Cuellar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texans voted in the country’s first primary election of 2022 Tuesday.
In perhaps the most closely watched race of the night, 28-year-old Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer and progressive Democrat, will head to a May runoff with incumbent Congressmember Henry Cuellar after neither secured the 50% threshold needed to move forward.
Conservative Democrat Henry Cuellar’s home and office were raided by the FBI in January as part of a federal investigation.
Former labor organizer and Austin City Councilmember Greg Casar won the Democratic primary for Congressional District 35.
In the governor’s vote, incumbent Greg Abbott won the Republican primary, while former congressmember and presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke clinched the Democratic race.

     Dems Cuellar, Cisneros head to runoff in Texas US House primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a nine-term incumbent and the last anti-abortion House Democrat, avoided defeat in Tuesday's Democratic primary in Texas – but will head to a runoff against progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, according to The Associated Press.
Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Cisneros last month in San Antonio, telling the crowd that Texas turning blue is "inevitable," and that "if we flip Texas, we flip the country."
Ocasio-Cortez slammed Cuellar as an "anti-choice Dem" in a Feb. 9 tweet after the congressman diminished her as a "far-left celebrity."
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCuellar has been an outspoken critic of the Biden administration on U.S.-Mexico border issues.
Last November, for example, he called for President Biden to replace Vice President Kamala Harris as his "border czar," claiming Harris hadn't "put the effort in there."

     Incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar leads AOC-backed Jessica Cisneros in Texas district
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Driving the news: U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Laredo, has a 50% to 45.4% lead over Jessica Cisneros, an immigration attorney, with more than 99% of the votes counted in Texas' 28th congressional district.
The Associated Press overnight Tuesday declared that Cuellar and Cisneros were headed to a runoff.
Greg Casar, another AOC-backed candidate, won his Democratic primary for an open, heavily Democratic congressional seat that runs from Austin to San Antonio.
Of note: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also came to Texas in February to rally for Casar and Cisneros.
What's next: Long reliably Democratic, the 28th congressional district was recently redrawn by Texas lawmakers to make it more competitive for Republicans.

     Cuellar came close to narrowly fending off Cisneros's challenge in a primary for Texas’s 28th District on Tuesday.
But a minor third candidate in the primary, community organizer Tannya Benavides, scooped up a handful of percentage points and kept Cisneros and Cuellar from crossing the 50% mark.

     Cuellar dragged into a run-off with AOC-backed Jessica Cisneros after Texas primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Conservative Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly edged out over progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros in the Texas primary Tuesday, and the pair will now go head-to-head in a run-off election in May.
Cuellar won 48.5% of the vote and Cisneros 46.8%, but since neither broke 50% the race heads to a runoff under Texas election law.
Cuellar is one of the last pro-choice Democrats in Congress and has been critical of President Biden's handling of the southern border.
Cisneros received a political blessing with an FBI raid on Cuellar's home in the month leading up to the primary.
Still, Cuellar outspent Cisneros 2:1 and attacked her for being too liberal to hold down the district.
