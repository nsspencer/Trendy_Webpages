    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/Matt SlocumPhiladelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid has traveled a long and winding professional road in his eight years in town, which have featured many ups and downs.
Of note, he referenced the Jerry Colangelo burner account saga when discussing the drama he's been through since arriving on the scene in 2014.
The 76ers and their former general manager parted ways in 2018 after an independent investigation revealed that Colangelo's wife, Barbara, operated numerous Twitter burner accounts that lobbed criticisms at players (including Embiid) and others and divulged sensitive information.
Colangelo denied knowledge of the burner accounts.

After three quarters it's looking more and more like their high-powered offense is just too much for the New York Knicks as the Sixers lead 93-81.
After a few days' rest for both teams, they and the New York Knicks will meet up at 7:30 p.m.
