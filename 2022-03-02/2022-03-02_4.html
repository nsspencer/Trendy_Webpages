     Here's What Tom Thibodeau Said After The Knicks Lost To The 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in Pennsylvania on Wednesday evening by a score of 123-108.
The 76ers also beat the Knicks in New York City on Sunday afternoon.
Right now, the Knicks are in a massive slump as they have lost six games in a row, and are just 1-9 in their last ten games.
After the loss to the 76ers, head coach Tom Thibodeau spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of SNY's Knicks Videos.
After making the playoffs last season, the Knicks are in serious jeopardy of missing out on the postseason this year.

     The 76ers are adding a veteran presence to back up MVP candidate Joel Embiid.
Veteran center DeAndre Jordan has cleared waivers and plans to sign with the Sixers ahead of the playoff push, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.
The Sixers will terminate center Willie Cauley-Stein’s 10-day contract in order to make room for Jordan, per Charania.
Cauley-Stein appeared in two games and played a total of five minutes since signing with the team last week.

     Joel Embiid: 'I've Been Through a Lot' with 76ers, Even 'GMs Using Burner Accounts'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/Matt SlocumPhiladelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid has traveled a long and winding professional road in his eight years in town, which have featured many ups and downs.
Of note, he referenced the Jerry Colangelo burner account saga when discussing the drama he's been through since arriving on the scene in 2014.
The 76ers and their former general manager parted ways in 2018 after an independent investigation revealed that Colangelo's wife, Barbara, operated numerous Twitter burner accounts that lobbed criticisms at players (including Embiid) and others and divulged sensitive information.
Colangelo denied knowledge of the burner accounts.

While Maxey has thrived next to Harden, Harris has really struggled in those three games (10.6 PPG on 10-for-28 shooting).

Allow me to present you with the stat line of a player from the Philadelphia 76ers’ second-straight win over the New York Knicks.
No, those numbers belong to Tyrese Maxey, and they aren’t an anomaly either.
Look, I get what Stephen A Smith was going for; I really do.
But to call Tyrese Maxey overrated or incapable of shouldering a bigger load now that James Harden had arrived is simply untrue; Maxey is playing like the Philadelphia 76ers’ third-best star and should be considered as such until he proves folks otherwise.

     76ers will reportedly sign DeAndre Jordan, ensuring their backup-center situation will be weird once again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Doc Rivers is on the verge of reuniting with DeAndre Jordan, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
ET on Thursday, at which time he will reportedly sign with the Philadelphia 76ers.
In those years, Jordan made the All-NBA First Team once (2016), the All-NBA Third Team twice (2015, 2017) and the All-Defensive First Team twice (2015, 2016).
Jordan was named an All-Star in 2017 and led the league in rebounding in 2014 and 2015.
Last season, the Brooklyn Nets removed Jordan from the rotation late in the regular season and didn't play him a single minute in the playoffs.

     Julius Randle rips Knicks’ effort on ‘D’ in ugly loss to Harden, 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA — James Harden didn’t score 100 points, but he did score enough to repel the pesky Knicks on Wednesday at festive Wells Fargo Center.
Harden went for 26 points, nine assists and nine rebounds as the skidding Knicks blew another double-digit lead in the 123-108 defeat.
We’re not doing that enough.’’James Harden, who had 26 points and nine assists, makes a pass during the Knicks’ 123-108 loss to the 76ers.
Julius Randle, who scored 24 points, drives to the basket during the Knicks’ loss to the 76ers.
“We gave up 68 points in the second half,’’ Thibodeau said.

     76ers 123, Knicks 108: Schmos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last night the Knicks were the Schmo to the 76ers’ marquee, the heel to their hero, the coyote to the roadrunner.
The Sixers were better on 2s, way better on 3s and far better at the line.
Those forgotten schmos, however anonymous, however forgotten, helped in their own way to build WWE into the mega-machine it is today.
Over at The Strickland I’m leading a reveal of the top-75 Knicks of all-time.
The loss last night was game one of a seven-game road trip for the Knicks.

     Through 3 QuartersDown seven at the end of last quarter, the Philadelphia 76ers have now snagged the lead.
After three quarters it's looking more and more like their high-powered offense is just too much for the New York Knicks as the Sixers lead 93-81.
After a few days' rest for both teams, they and the New York Knicks will meet up at 7:30 p.m.
We'll see if the 76ers can repeat their recent success or if the Knicks bounce back and reverse their fortune.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We take a look below at how the new-look 76ers are doing so far and their impact on Embiid’s rookie card stock.
In the event he continues his great momentum, the primary beneficiary in the market are those Joel Embiid rookie cards.
The state of Joel Embiid rookie cardsAs it’s the case in the hobby, big men are usually less-preferred than explosive guards and high-scoring wings in the NBA.
When you check these numbers, the value of this particular Joel Embiid card has more than doubled.
In any case, selling those Joel Embiid rookie cards while they’re high isn’t a bad idea at all.
