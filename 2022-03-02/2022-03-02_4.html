Veteran center DeAndre Jordan has cleared waivers and plans to sign with the Sixers ahead of the playoff push, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.
The Sixers will terminate center Willie Cauley-Stein’s 10-day contract in order to make room for Jordan, per Charania.
Cauley-Stein appeared in two games and played a total of five minutes since signing with the team last week.

While Maxey has thrived next to Harden, Harris has really struggled in those three games (10.6 PPG on 10-for-28 shooting).

Perhaps Doc Rivers can squeeze one more solid run out of Jordan, a player he's worked with in the past.
Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond upped their level of play under the head coach the past two seasons.

     Philadelphia 76ers: Stephen A Smith is wrong about Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Maxey has all of the requisite ability to become the Philadelphia 76ers’ third star.
Allow me to present you with the stat line of a player from the Philadelphia 76ers’ second-straight win over the New York Knicks.
No, those numbers belong to Tyrese Maxey, and they aren’t an anomaly either.
Look, I get what Stephen A Smith was going for; I really do.
But to call Tyrese Maxey overrated or incapable of shouldering a bigger load now that James Harden had arrived is simply untrue; Maxey is playing like the Philadelphia 76ers’ third-best star and should be considered as such until he proves folks otherwise.

In those years, Jordan made the All-NBA First Team once (2016), the All-NBA Third Team twice (2015, 2017) and the All-Defensive First Team twice (2015, 2016).
Jordan was named an All-Star in 2017 and led the league in rebounding in 2014 and 2015.
