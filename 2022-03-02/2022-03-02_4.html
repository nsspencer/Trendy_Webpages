     “I don’t know if I would ever say, ‘Oh my God, this person looks like me.’ I think if someone has dark hair and tan skin people are going to say, ‘Oh, that looks like Kim.’ And that’s not fair, because there are so many people who are just themselves,” Kim said.

     Who Is Chaney Jones? Here's What We Know About Kanye West's New Girlfriend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kanye West—who also goes by “Ye” these days—had found his latest muse in his new girlfriend.
On Wednesday, March 1, West posted a screenshot from popular gossip account The Shade Room to his own grid.
(You can see the original Shade Room post here, since Ye tends to not leave his content up for very long.)
It contains two paparazzi pictures of Jones and West in all-black ensembles walking and then embracing.
But regardless of being West's GF or KK's lookalike, Jones is of course her own person.

     Inside Kanye West's Romance With 'Muse' Chaney Jones: Details
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kanye West has been spotted with Chaney Jones several times since his split from Julia Fox, but they’re not getting serious — yet.
“They’re not exclusive,” an insider exclusively tells Us Weekly of the rapper, 44, and the model, 24.
At the time, the “Famous” artist was still dating Fox, 32, whom he met on New Year’s Eve 2021.
According to the first insider, their similarities are one reason for West’s interest in Jones.
“He would pick Kim over anyone but since they’re no longer dating, he’s doing the next best thing — creating another Kim Kardashian,” the insider tells Us.

     Who Is Kanye West's New Girlfriend Chaney Jones?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kanye West has officially moved on from his brief relationship with actress Julia Fox and is currently dating Chaney Jones.
Kanye and Chaney first sparked dating speculation back in early February when they were seen having dinner at Nobu in Malibu.
Meanwhile, a source tells Entertainment Tonight that Kanye and Chaney are just having fun and keeping things casual at this point in their love story.
Since then, Chaney has accompanied Kanye to the Donda 2 listening event, as well as several other ~fancy~ outings.
Nothing wrong with having a good time, so stay tuned for more updates on Kanye and Chaney, I guess!
