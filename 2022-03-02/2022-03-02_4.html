     PHILADELPHIA -- After a third straight sterling performance in a 76ers uniform -- but the first in front of the fans inside Wells Fargo Center -- James Harden declared Philadelphia feels like home.
"The love, the fans, it feels like home.
Just the love, the support, man, from looking around, hearing, 'We love you, James.'
James Harden was thrilled by the welcome Philadelphia fans gave him on Wednesday night.
Ultimately, though, Philadelphia is going as far as its new superstar tandem of Harden and Embiid can take them.

     PHILADELPHIA — James Harden didn’t score 100 points, but he did score enough to repel the pesky Knicks on Wednesday at festive Wells Fargo Center.
Harden went for 26 points, nine assists and nine rebounds as the skidding Knicks blew another double-digit lead in the 123-108 defeat.
We’re not doing that enough.’’James Harden, who had 26 points and nine assists, makes a pass during the Knicks’ 123-108 loss to the 76ers.

    </h2>

     Last night the Knicks were the Schmo to the 76ers’ marquee, the heel to their hero, the coyote to the roadrunner.
The Sixers were better on 2s, way better on 3s and far better at the line.
Those forgotten schmos, however anonymous, however forgotten, helped in their own way to build WWE into the mega-machine it is today.
Over at The Strickland I’m leading a reveal of the top-75 Knicks of all-time.
The loss last night was game one of a seven-game road trip for the Knicks.

     Philadelphia 76ers: Stephen A Smith is wrong about Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Maxey has all of the requisite ability to become the Philadelphia 76ers’ third star.
Allow me to present you with the stat line of a player from the Philadelphia 76ers’ second-straight win over the New York Knicks.
No, those numbers belong to Tyrese Maxey, and they aren’t an anomaly either.
Look, I get what Stephen A Smith was going for; I really do.
But to call Tyrese Maxey overrated or incapable of shouldering a bigger load now that James Harden had arrived is simply untrue; Maxey is playing like the Philadelphia 76ers’ third-best star and should be considered as such until he proves folks otherwise.

     76ers will reportedly sign DeAndre Jordan, ensuring their backup-center situation will be weird once again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Doc Rivers is on the verge of reuniting with DeAndre Jordan, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
ET on Thursday, at which time he will reportedly sign with the Philadelphia 76ers.
In those years, Jordan made the All-NBA First Team once (2016), the All-NBA Third Team twice (2015, 2017) and the All-Defensive First Team twice (2015, 2016).
Jordan was named an All-Star in 2017 and led the league in rebounding in 2014 and 2015.
Last season, the Brooklyn Nets removed Jordan from the rotation late in the regular season and didn't play him a single minute in the playoffs.
