     Here's What Tom Thibodeau Said After The Knicks Lost To The 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in Pennsylvania on Wednesday evening by a score of 123-108.
The 76ers also beat the Knicks in New York City on Sunday afternoon.
Right now, the Knicks are in a massive slump as they have lost six games in a row, and are just 1-9 in their last ten games.
After the loss to the 76ers, head coach Tom Thibodeau spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of SNY's Knicks Videos.
After making the playoffs last season, the Knicks are in serious jeopardy of missing out on the postseason this year.

     Kim Kardashian is doing her best to find some peace after being declared legally single on Wednesday in her Kanye West divorce.
Of course, her ex has continued to stir up the drama while dragging her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, into the mix — and she would really like it to stop.
The SKIMS founder is frustrated that West is blaming the Saturday Night Live star for getting in the way of their reconciliation.
The truth is that Kardashian is “happy” with Davidson and didn’t even consider going back to the rapper.
Gunn wrote, “For the record, Pete Davidson is one of the nicest, sweetest guys I know.

     Kim Kardashian is legally single.
TMZ reports that Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Steve Cochran on Wednesday approved Kardashian’s request to be granted single status in the eyes of the law amid her divorce proceedings with Kanye West.
Although the couple haven’t completely settled their financial and custody issues, the ruling will allow both parties to become legally divorced.
The ruling arrives over two months after Kardashian requested the judge to restore her single status.
“For so long, I did what made other people happy,” Kardashian said.

     Add in defensive stalwart Thybulle and Harris at the 4, and it's a scary group, and one that makes the Sixers a legitimate title threats.
While Maxey has thrived next to Harden, Harris has really struggled in those three games (10.6 PPG on 10-for-28 shooting).
Video Play Button Videos you might likeThe backup center position is tougher to work around, however, and it's fair to question if Jordan really addresses the issue.
Perhaps Doc Rivers can squeeze one more solid run out of Jordan, a player he's worked with in the past.
Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond upped their level of play under the head coach the past two seasons.

     Philadelphia 76ers: Stephen A Smith is wrong about Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Maxey has all of the requisite ability to become the Philadelphia 76ers’ third star.
Allow me to present you with the stat line of a player from the Philadelphia 76ers’ second-straight win over the New York Knicks.
No, those numbers belong to Tyrese Maxey, and they aren’t an anomaly either.
Look, I get what Stephen A Smith was going for; I really do.
But to call Tyrese Maxey overrated or incapable of shouldering a bigger load now that James Harden had arrived is simply untrue; Maxey is playing like the Philadelphia 76ers’ third-best star and should be considered as such until he proves folks otherwise.

     Add in defensive stalwart Thybulle and Harris at the 4, and it's a scary group, and one that makes the Sixers a legitimate title threats.
While Maxey has thrived next to Harden, Harris has really struggled in those three games (10.6 PPG on 10-for-28 shooting).

Perhaps Doc Rivers can squeeze one more solid run out of Jordan, a player he's worked with in the past.
Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond upped their level of play under the head coach the past two seasons.

     Romance rumorsKardashian and Davidson kissed on “SNL” before they started dating.
NBCKardashian and Davidson were first seen together in October 2021 in an “SNL” sketch in which they kissed as Jasmine and Aladdin on the magic carpet.
Later that month, photos surfaced of the pair holding hands on a Halloween ride in Buena Park, Calif., though a source told People they were “just friends” at the time.
“Pete arranged a dinner on the rooftop privately,” a restaurant source told Page Six at the time.
The judge also honored her request to change her name back from “Kim Kardashian West” to “Kim Kardashian.”

     Last night the Knicks were the Schmo to the 76ers’ marquee, the heel to their hero, the coyote to the roadrunner.
The Sixers were better on 2s, way better on 3s and far better at the line.
Those forgotten schmos, however anonymous, however forgotten, helped in their own way to build WWE into the mega-machine it is today.
Over at The Strickland I’m leading a reveal of the top-75 Knicks of all-time.
The loss last night was game one of a seven-game road trip for the Knicks.

     We take a look below at how the new-look 76ers are doing so far and their impact on Embiid’s rookie card stock.
In the event he continues his great momentum, the primary beneficiary in the market are those Joel Embiid rookie cards.
The state of Joel Embiid rookie cardsAs it’s the case in the hobby, big men are usually less-preferred than explosive guards and high-scoring wings in the NBA.
When you check these numbers, the value of this particular Joel Embiid card has more than doubled.
In any case, selling those Joel Embiid rookie cards while they’re high isn’t a bad idea at all.
