     MLB lockout: Rob Manfred is killing the game by alienating fans, and baseball might never recover | Klapisch

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On the day Major League Baseball committed hari-kari, I asked my son, a 19-year-old college sophomore, what he would remember about this sad moment in history.
He looked at me dumbfounded.
Why would anyone be sad, he asked, when “The Batman” was opening at theaters everywhere?

     The last 24hrs I’d say there was cautious optimism on the players side because the owners were actually at the table negotiating with us toward a deal.
What we’re asking is more than fair.
If there’s no deal the optimism from MLB was a PR illusion to make it look like they tried.

     As for Manfred, we hope he squeezes in 36 on Wednesday and gets it out of his system before talks between the MLB and MLBPA resume on Thursday.
First of all, WE WANT FREAKING BASEBALL.
FIGURE IT OUT.
Second of all, golf has enough to worry about with a Saudi blood-money takeover looming, a PIP system that rewards the big Saudi-blood-money guy, and the slow dissolution of yesterday’s stars of the future into the also-rans of today.
The last thing we need right now is to be on the hook for the failures of another sport, so do us a favor, Rob, and leave golf out of it.

     Morning Mound Visit: Rob Manfred cancels first two series of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MLB and the MLBPA failed to come to an agreement on Tuesday, and Commissioner Rob Manfred canceled the first two series of the season.
The two sides are still far apart on key issues, and the league still appears to be negotiating in bad faith.
Ross Stripling, the Blue Jay’s player’s union representative, said that the owners were “trying to sneak things through” in the fine print that were never discussed.
Rob Manfred and his bosses are just trying to put pressure on the union by withholding paychecks.
Grant Brisbee | The Athletic $: In case you still feel like the players are partially to blame for the canceled games, here’s a reminder that their asks weren’t extreme.

     ORLANDO, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 10: Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred answers questions during an MLB owner's meeting at the Waldorf Astoria on February 10, 2022 in Orlando, Florida.
Because he really is that bad of an MLB commissioner.
Rob Manfred once said it would be a "disastrous outcome" if the lockout resulted in missed games this season.

     While MLB season hangs in the balance, commissioner Rob Manfred works on his backswing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Major League Baseball labor negotiations continued this week in Jupiter, Florida — smack dab in the heart of golf country.
While the two sides have struggled to find common ground and games were officially removed from the 2022 schedule, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred was spotted Tuesday during a break in the steamy talks working on his backswing.
“Today is a sad day,” MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark said.
… The reason we are not playing is simple: A lockout is the ultimate economic weapon.
“I am under no illusion that Major League Baseball will sacrifice business revenue on behalf of its alleged corporate values.
