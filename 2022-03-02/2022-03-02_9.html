     Farrah Forke, the actress who catapulted to fame playing a helicopter pilot on the NBC sitcom “Wings,” died at her home in Texas on Friday.
She was 54.
Her death was confirmed by her mother, Beverly Talmage, who said in a statement that her daughter had had cancer for several years.
Forke played the alluring pilot Alex Lambert on three seasons of “Wings,” which aired from 1990 to 1997 and followed the adventures of the offbeat characters at a small airport on Nantucket.
Her character’s affections were battled over by Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly and Steven Weber), brothers who ran a one-plane airline.

     Farrah Forke, the actress best known for playing Alex Lambert on the hit NBC sitcom Wings, died of cancer on Feb. 25 in her Texas home, a close friend confirmed to People.
“Farrah was fierce, tender, loyal, loving, strong, funny, smart, protective, kind, passionate, and utterly irreplaceable,” the friend said in a statement.
“[Farrah] was every bit as tough, fun, beautiful and grounded as her character ‘Alex’ on Wings,” Weber wrote in an Instagram tribute to the actress.
She memorably recurred as attorney Mayson Drake on the second season of ABC’s Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.
Forke also starred as a software company manager on CBS’ short-lived comedy Dweebs, and played a faculty member on the NBC sitcom Mr. Rhodes.

     One sweet update the remake made to the original film gives Tony and Maria a little more quality time together.
In the original, Tony visits Maria at the bridal shop where she works, where they reenact a wedding and get to know each other.
In the remake, Tony takes Maria to a church on a date, where they sing "One Hand, One Heart," thus adding a little more depth to their short-lived relationship.

     Farrah Forke, the actress perhaps best known for her turn as the helicopter pilot Alex Lambert on the NBC sitcom Wings, died Friday at her home in Texas after battling cancer for several years, her family announced.
Forke appeared on 35 episodes of Wings from 1992-94 as the tough Alex, a former U.S. Army Apache helicopter pilot during Operation Desert Storm.
On the show, she runs a Nantucket Island helicopter service and has a romance with Steven Weber’s Brian Hackett.
Born on Jan. 12, 1968, in Corpus Christi, Texas, Farrah Rachael Forke attended the Hockaday School, an all-girls private school in Dallas.
A private service was held by close family and friends.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     Fitbit is recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally because the fitness product's lithium-ion battery can overheat, posing a burn hazard, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced on Wednesday.
Consumers were urged to stop using the Ionic smartwatches and to contact Fitbit to receive pre-paid packaging to return the device, for which they'll be refunded $299, the notice stated.
The recall involves only the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch, sold with a polyurethane band and a 1.4-inch color LCD screen.

Wednesday's recall comes eight years after Fitbit recalled its Fitbit Force activity-tracking wristband after the company received about 9,900 reports of the wristband irritating skin and 250 reports of blistering.

     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     'West Side Story' - Steven Spielberg 4It’s rare, though not entirely unusual, that the Academy Awards chooses to praise a modern remake of a significant Hollywood classic.
More a modern reimagining than a direct remake, Spielberg does well to set his film aside from the original, updating and adapting many aspects of the imperfect original that were superfluous.
In such strides, other aspects also fall short with the director unwilling to sacrifice classic moments of the original.
Such creates a strange dynamic in Spielberg’s modern version, with odd relationships and commitments between characters making for some emotionally confused moments that break authenticity.
Achieving that which the original film could only dream of, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story is, at least in visual spectacle, far better than the 1961 original, and even makes strides to better its story too.

     Fitbit Recalls More Than 1 Million Products for Burn Injury Risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s a new Fitbit recall to know: Fitbit has just voluntarily recalled more than one million of its Ionic smartwatches after reports that overheating lithium-ion batteries had resulted in burn injuries.
“The battery in the Ionic smartwatch can overheat, posing a burn hazard,” Fitbit said in a statement on their site on Wednesday.
“The health and safety of Fitbit users is our highest priority.
According to the brand, these reported cases accounted for less than 0.01% of the Ionic smartwatches sold.
“These incidents are very rare and this voluntary recall does not impact other Fitbit smartwatches or trackers,” Fitbit said in a statement.

     ‘West Side Story’ should have let Anybodys sing ‘Cool’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.
