     Farrah Forke, Who Played a Helicopter Pilot on ‘Wings,’ Dies at 54
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Farrah Forke, the actress who catapulted to fame playing a helicopter pilot on the NBC sitcom “Wings,” died at her home in Texas on Friday.
She was 54.
Her death was confirmed by her mother, Beverly Talmage, who said in a statement that her daughter had had cancer for several years.
Forke played the alluring pilot Alex Lambert on three seasons of “Wings,” which aired from 1990 to 1997 and followed the adventures of the offbeat characters at a small airport on Nantucket.
Her character’s affections were battled over by Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly and Steven Weber), brothers who ran a one-plane airline.

     ‘Wings,’ ‘Lois &amp; Clark’ Actress Farrah Forke Dies at 54
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Farrah Forke, the actress best known for playing Alex Lambert on the hit NBC sitcom Wings, died of cancer on Feb. 25 in her Texas home, a close friend confirmed to People.
“Farrah was fierce, tender, loyal, loving, strong, funny, smart, protective, kind, passionate, and utterly irreplaceable,” the friend said in a statement.
“[Farrah] was every bit as tough, fun, beautiful and grounded as her character ‘Alex’ on Wings,” Weber wrote in an Instagram tribute to the actress.
She memorably recurred as attorney Mayson Drake on the second season of ABC’s Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.
Forke also starred as a software company manager on CBS’ short-lived comedy Dweebs, and played a faculty member on the NBC sitcom Mr. Rhodes.
