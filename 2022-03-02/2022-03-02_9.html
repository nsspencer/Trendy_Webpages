     Here's What Tom Thibodeau Said After The Knicks Lost To The 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in Pennsylvania on Wednesday evening by a score of 123-108.
The 76ers also beat the Knicks in New York City on Sunday afternoon.
Right now, the Knicks are in a massive slump as they have lost six games in a row, and are just 1-9 in their last ten games.
After the loss to the 76ers, head coach Tom Thibodeau spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of SNY's Knicks Videos.
After making the playoffs last season, the Knicks are in serious jeopardy of missing out on the postseason this year.

     The Knicks’ free-agent big men options amid Mitchell Robinson contract impasse
    </h2>

The Knicks realize they may have to plan for life without starting center Mitchell Robinson, the longest-tenured current Knick.
The free-agent options at center are plentiful — some cheap, some pricey; some young, some old.
On Feb. 13, The Post reported Robinson and the Knicks weren’t on solid ground regarding a new contract and he likely will hit the road if he reaches unrestricted free agency without an extension.
ESPN subsequently confirmed Sunday that talks haven’t gotten anywhere close.

     Questions Knicks Must Answer Before End of Regular Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     0 of 3Sam Forencich/Getty ImagesPut a fork in the 2021-22 New York Knicks.
Mathematically they are still alive, and it's a safe bet head coach Tom Thibodeau will have his team hard-charging through the finish line.
But what, other than fan loyalty, would lead you to believe this club is capable of turning this around?
Wednesday's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers tipped off a seven-game road trip against mostly good-to-great opponents.
The biggest questions surrounding this team have nothing to do with the remainder of this season but rather how they can avoid another flop like this.

     "... You don't see high assists because of the amount of free throws we got."
The Knicks have said Rose remains out indefinitely.
"Yeah, I wish I could answer that, but I can't," Thibodeau told reporters Friday when asked if Rose could return in March.
Rose's four assists per game is less than only Julius Randle on the team, who is averaging 5.3 per game.
The Knicks had a defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possession) of 107.8 last year, fourth in the NBA.

If we put the work in and do the right things, the results will work out for us.
