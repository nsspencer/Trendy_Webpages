     NBA Today reacts to Devin Booker going into health and safety protocols.
(2:21)All-Star guard Devin Booker entered the NBA's health and safety protocols and missed the Phoenix Suns' 120-90 win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
Booker previously entered the protocols this season in September and missed media day and the start of training camp.
Booker is a three-time All-Star and the team's leading scorer, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game.
Paul broke his thumb Feb. 16 and could miss the rest of the regular season, though the team is hopeful he will return before the playoffs.

     “I was kind of surprised when I came into the gym and Devin Booker got health and safety protocols,” Payne said.
Booker wasn't at Thursday's practice as the Suns face the Knicks (25-37) Friday to conclude a four-game homestand.
“This is just another one of them.”Averaging a team-high 25.6 points a game this season, Booker didn’t attend Wednesday’s game as he posted a picture on Instagram of the game on his big screen TV.
“I don’t know the numbers so I can’t speak too accurately on this, but there’s not as many people in NBA protocols as there was a little bit earlier.
Now Booker back in protocols puts the situation front and center again for the Suns and the league.

     Phoenix Suns handle business without their All-Stars vs. depleted Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHOENIX — Who knows where expectations should be set for the Phoenix Suns while Devin Booker (health and safety protocols) and Chris Paul (right thumb avulsion fracture) remain out.
After Simons got 11 points early, Phoenix mixed in traps on Blazers ball-handlers to create that havoc when they could, something the Suns don’t do much of.
Offensively, the question was if the Suns would be able to start the initial breakdown of the defense off the dribble.
Phoenix had its own turnover problems as well, ending up with 16, and fastbreak points were 23-18 Suns.
He started alongside Landry Shamet, meaning Johnson went back to the bench after starting the three games without Paul.

     7 Observations from the Trail Blazers’ Loss to the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

     Phoenix Suns face test against Portland minus Booker and Paul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Suns have taken one step forward and four steps back entering their Wednesday home game against the Portland Trail Blazers.
Portland's coach Chauncey Billups said the Suns missing Paul and Booker won't alter their strategy on offense and defense.
Portland (25-36) is in a similar situation as the Suns (49-12), despite being on opposite ends of the Western Conference standings.
The Suns beat Portland in Phoenix, 119-109, in their second matchup on Nov. 10, in which Lillard led all scorers with 28 points.
Their third game in Portland was a grind, which ended in an 111-107 overtime victory by the Suns.
