     NBA Today reacts to Devin Booker going into health and safety protocols.
(2:21)All-Star guard Devin Booker entered the NBA's health and safety protocols and missed the Phoenix Suns' 120-90 win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
Booker previously entered the protocols this season in September and missed media day and the start of training camp.
Booker is a three-time All-Star and the team's leading scorer, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game.
Paul broke his thumb Feb. 16 and could miss the rest of the regular season, though the team is hopeful he will return before the playoffs.

     Phoenix Suns start Landry Shamet, Cam Payne in place of Booker, Paul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHOENIX — The Phoenix Suns had a mild surprise in the starting lineup for Wednesday’s matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, electing to start guards Cam Payne and Landry Shamet in place of Chris Paul (right thumb avulsion fracture) and Devin Booker (health and safety protocols).
The starting lineup nod is a nice show of faith from Williams in Shamet despite his struggles this year.
In the Suns’ seven-game stretch without Booker in December, Shamet started in his place.
The starting lineup could mean Williams rolls with both Aaron Holiday and Elfrid Payton in the reserve backcourt.
Wednesday will be the Suns’ first game without Booker and Paul due to injury since Paul arrived in November of 2020 from the Oklahoma City Thunder.

     1 Question for Every NBA Team Down the Stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     1 of 30LM Otero/Associated PressArguably no team this season has been a bigger letdown than the Hawks, who made the Eastern Conference Finals last year and are now barely hanging on in ninth place in the play-in tournament.
The biggest culprit: their defense, which has been bad enough (currently 26th in the league) to offset Atlanta having the NBA's second-best offense.
It doesn't help that John Collins, one of the few plus defenders on the roster, has missed the last five games with a foot injury.
He should theoretically be back soon, but that alone won't be enough to fix a defense that has been atrocious all year.
The Hawks aren't going to repeat their trip to the conference finals, but if they want to even have a chance of getting out of the play-in, the defense has to be better.

     Why Isn’t Chris Paul Playing for the Phoenix Suns?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Phoenix Suns won the Western Conference Championship last year and sit atop the standings by a wide margin this year as of March 2.
They are, however, missing their leader, point guard, and floor general in Chris Paul, who’s now sidelined with an injury.
Chris Paul has played a key part in the Phoenix Suns’ success this yearPhoenix is 49-12 and 6.5 games ahead of the Golden State Warriors and seven in front of Ja Morant and the quickly-rising Memphis Grizzlies.
Considering his injury history — especially at inopportune times — a healthy and rested Chris Paul going into the playoffs will benefit Phoenix.
But the Suns need a steady hand at the point guard spot, and no hand is steadier than Chris Paul’s.

     Phoenix Suns face test against Portland minus Booker and Paul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Suns have taken one step forward and four steps back entering their Wednesday home game against the Portland Trail Blazers.
Portland's coach Chauncey Billups said the Suns missing Paul and Booker won't alter their strategy on offense and defense.
Portland (25-36) is in a similar situation as the Suns (49-12), despite being on opposite ends of the Western Conference standings.
The Suns beat Portland in Phoenix, 119-109, in their second matchup on Nov. 10, in which Lillard led all scorers with 28 points.
Their third game in Portland was a grind, which ended in an 111-107 overtime victory by the Suns.

     7 Observations from the Trail Blazers’ Loss to the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

     After losing two straight and then losing their All-Star Devin Booker (COVID), the Phoenix Suns really wanted a win.
Cameron Payne led the team with 8 assists, Aaron Holiday notched 9, and the Suns had another 32-assist game that’s becoming more the norm than not.
Then Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson drained a pair of their own, and the Suns lead was 55-42 with just under three minutes left.
The Suns lead got up to 15 at halftime, 63-48.
Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder both had 13 points, while Cameron Johnson had 11 off the bench.

It's amazing the major contributions he's brought to the Phoenix Suns franchise.
I thank him personally for helping build the Phoenix Suns franchise, because he was selling the Suns franchise all those years.”How do you tell the story of the man who is synonymous with storytelling?
McCoy called a Suns game for the first time in a preseason game on September 27, 1972, and hasn't looked back since.
