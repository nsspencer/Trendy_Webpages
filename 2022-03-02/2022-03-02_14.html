     The first change is in goal, where Kepa Arrizabalaga comes in for Edouard Mendy, and it looks likely to be a back four in front of him.
Antonio Rudiger retains his place in the side, with fellow centre-back Malang Sarr joining him.
Kenedy makes his first appearance since returning from loan in January on the left flank, with Callum Hudson-Odoi returning on the right.
The second player to keep their place from the weekend is Mason Mount, with forwards Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku both being introduced in the front three, after impressing from the bench at Wembley.
Teenage left-back Dylan Williams is named on the bench for Chelsea's senior team for the first time following his January move from Derby County.

     Thomas Tuchel was bested by his compatriot, Jurgen Klopp, as Liverpool won the penalty shootout 11-10 to take home the Carabao Cup trophy.
Regardless, the Blues will now look to bounce back on the road in the FA Cup against Luton Town.
They’ll help us recover from the sting of the Carabao Cup final loss.
The Carabao Cup final loss means there is added importance on this FA Cup run.
On the other hand, the past week has been one filled with uncertainty and heartbreak for the coaches, players and fans of Chelsea Football Club.
