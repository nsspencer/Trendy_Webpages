     Michigan State basketball continues yo-yo season as Tom Izzo questions leadership again

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Each game for the past two months brings the same question: Which Michigan State basketball team will show up?
For every well-rounded win over Purdue and Wisconsin, there comes an equally comprehensive letdown at Iowa and Rutgers.
Fast starts followed by sluggish ones, gritty finishes becoming vanishing-act collapses from one game to the next.

     Watch Bad Bunny fight Brad Pitt in trailer for new film ‘Bullet Train’

     Many people know Bad Bunny as a chart-topping rapper who further globalized Latin urban music and solidified reggaeton’s place in the mainstream music scene.
But the Puerto Rican artist will now star in Sony Pictures’ upcoming action-thriller film “Bullet Train” alongside an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt and Joey King.
But “Bullet Train” takes Bad Bunny to modern-day Japan.

     Brad Pitt fights off other assassins in Bullet Train trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     Devin Booker listed out for second straight Phoenix Suns game in NBA's COVID-19 protocols

     “I was kind of surprised when I came into the gym and Devin Booker got health and safety protocols,” Payne said.
Booker wasn't at Thursday's practice as the Suns face the Knicks (25-37) Friday to conclude a four-game homestand.
“This is just another one of them.”Averaging a team-high 25.6 points a game this season, Booker didn’t attend Wednesday’s game as he posted a picture on Instagram of the game on his big screen TV.
“I don’t know the numbers so I can’t speak too accurately on this, but there’s not as many people in NBA protocols as there was a little bit earlier.
Now Booker back in protocols puts the situation front and center again for the Suns and the league.

     Here’s everything we know about Bullet Train, including its release date, plot synopsis, cast, and more.
Set to a foreign language cover of The Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” Bullet Train is hyping untold levels of fun.
Still, Bullet Train has style, one that’s been sorely lacking in most mainstream action movies today.
Brad Pitt stars Bullet Train, based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle.
Sony Pictures Joey King also stars in Bullet Train as “Prince.” Sony Pictures Hiroyuki Sanada, also seen in movies like The Wolverine and Army of the Dead, stars in Bullet Train in a major capacity.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It is as if every victory for the Phoenix Suns for the remainder of the season would carry more weight to it.
So how confident are we as a fan base that the Phoenix Suns can win at least 13 more games?
60% of SB Nation readers believe that the Suns can win at least 13 more games this season.
Of the 40 made shots by the Phoenix Suns, 32 of those came via the assist.
If the Warriors win out, and the Phoenix Suns win 13 of their games, then the Suns are still the number one seed.

     Michigan Basketball: 3 takeaways from commanding win over MSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Wolverines got back to their winning ways on Tuesday night with another requisite win over rival Michigan State 87-70.
They got to exact some revenge for the mistreatment that they incurred in East Lansing about a month ago and here are three takeaways from Michigan basketball’s win.
Tom Izzo refused to double team him and Dickinson took full advantage of the energy he brought to his teammates in the high stakes win.
Michigan State has nobody that can guard him as he proved in both contests this year.
Izzo took offense to it, but nothing arose from it.

     7 Observations from the Trail Blazers’ Loss to the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

     Michigan basketball: Phil Martelli talks Wolverines' streaky season following 87-70 win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But since then, Martelli and the Wolverines found a new gear and took down in-state rival Michigan State Tuesday night.
Hunter Dickinson was the star of the show and the Wolverines were never really in position to lose the game.
Martelli talked about the streaky season for Michigan after the win over Michigan State.
“Tomorrow I'm going to address it.
Tomorrow, I'm going to do a little bit more, and some of the guys that didn't play a lot of minutes are going to get a sweat tomorrow.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.

     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.
