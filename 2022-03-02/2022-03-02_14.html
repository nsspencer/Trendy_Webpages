     Woman accused of dismembering man, leaving body parts in a bucket
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Police were called to a home in the 800-block of Stony Brook Lane around 3:25 a.m. on Feb 23 after the victim’s mother found her son’s dismembered head in a bucket on her property.
When police asked Schabusiness what happened to the victim, she allegedly told police they had been together during the day and were smoking methamphetamine.
At some point, Schabusiness allegedly said she blacked out and went “crazy” before she strangled the victim.
After killing the man, Schabusiness told police she decided to dismember the body, but told police she forgot to bring all the parts with her.
Schabusiness also allegedly told police where they could find more of the victim’s body parts, which included at his home and in her vehicle.

     Taylor Schabusiness, 24, allegedly told detectives that police were “going to have fun trying to find all of the organs” of the unidentified Green Bay man.
Under questioning, Schabusiness allegedly taunted authorities, telling investigators that they were “going to have fun trying to find all of the organs” of the mutilated corpse.
“Schabusiness stated that the Victim had a chain that he had put around his neck,” the complaint stated.
“The strangulation was part of the sex act.”While he laid face down on a bed, Schabusiness told police she repeatedly yanked the chain that was coiled around his throat.
“Schabusiness made the comment that she was ‘already this far’ so she just kept on, referring to choking the victim.”He died between three and five minutes later, Schabusiness estimated.
