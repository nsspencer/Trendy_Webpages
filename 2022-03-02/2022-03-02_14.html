     Many people know Bad Bunny as a chart-topping rapper who further globalized Latin urban music and solidified reggaeton’s place in the mainstream music scene.
But the Puerto Rican artist will now star in Sony Pictures’ upcoming action-thriller film “Bullet Train” alongside an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt and Joey King.
But “Bullet Train” takes Bad Bunny to modern-day Japan.

     Brad Pitt fights off other assassins in Bullet Train trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Commutes are already killer enough, so why not try a sleek bullet train full of bloodthirsty assassins?
That seems to be the sentiment in the trailer for Sony Pictures’ Bullet Train, a fresh action comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by former stuntman turned action film aficionado David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde).
Based on the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train follows Brad Pitt as Ladybug, a semi-retired assassin who hops on a bullet train, only to face a few other peers onboard.
There’s Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz).
Hop aboard Bullet Train when it’s released in theaters on July 15.

     Devin Booker listed out for second straight Phoenix Suns game in NBA's COVID-19 protocols
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I was kind of surprised when I came into the gym and Devin Booker got health and safety protocols,” Payne said.
Booker wasn't at Thursday's practice as the Suns face the Knicks (25-37) Friday to conclude a four-game homestand.
“This is just another one of them.”Averaging a team-high 25.6 points a game this season, Booker didn’t attend Wednesday’s game as he posted a picture on Instagram of the game on his big screen TV.
“I don’t know the numbers so I can’t speak too accurately on this, but there’s not as many people in NBA protocols as there was a little bit earlier.
Now Booker back in protocols puts the situation front and center again for the Suns and the league.

     Here’s everything we know about Bullet Train, including its release date, plot synopsis, cast, and more.
Set to a foreign language cover of The Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” Bullet Train is hyping untold levels of fun.
Still, Bullet Train has style, one that’s been sorely lacking in most mainstream action movies today.
Brad Pitt stars Bullet Train, based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle.
Sony Pictures Joey King also stars in Bullet Train as “Prince.” Sony Pictures Hiroyuki Sanada, also seen in movies like The Wolverine and Army of the Dead, stars in Bullet Train in a major capacity.

Of the 40 made shots by the Phoenix Suns, 32 of those came via the assist.
If the Warriors win out, and the Phoenix Suns win 13 of their games, then the Suns are still the number one seed.

     7 Observations from the Trail Blazers’ Loss to the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

     There are few things quite as relaxing as settling into the comfortable soundlessness of a high-speed train’s quiet car, but silence is a luxury none of the assassins at the center of Sony’s Bullet Train from Atomic Blonde director David Leitch can afford.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s novel Maria Beetle, Bullet Train follows as five hired killers unknowingly board the same high-speed train where they’ve been sent to carry out different assignments.
In the novel, it isn’t long before the assassins’ respective jobs expose the killers to one another, and the trailer makes it seem like the movie’s story will follow a similar arc.
Bullet Train also stars Joey King, Andrew Koji, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, Masi Oka, Michael Shannon, Logan Lerman, and Hiroyuki Sanada.
The movie hits theaters on July 15th.
