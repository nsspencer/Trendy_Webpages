     Michigan State basketball continues yo-yo season as Tom Izzo questions leadership again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Each game for the past two months brings the same question: Which Michigan State basketball team will show up?
For every well-rounded win over Purdue and Wisconsin, there comes an equally comprehensive letdown at Iowa and Rutgers.
Fast starts followed by sluggish ones, gritty finishes becoming vanishing-act collapses from one game to the next.

     ANN ARBOR -- Last season, the Michigan men’s basketball team lived in a bubble.
This season, they’re on it.
Before Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, Michigan was the last team out of the NCAA Tournament field, per Jerry Palm’s projections at CBS Sports.
After the Wolverines’ 87-70 victory, they were back in the field.

     Michigan Basketball: 3 takeaways from commanding win over MSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Wolverines got back to their winning ways on Tuesday night with another requisite win over rival Michigan State 87-70.
They got to exact some revenge for the mistreatment that they incurred in East Lansing about a month ago and here are three takeaways from Michigan basketball’s win.
Tom Izzo refused to double team him and Dickinson took full advantage of the energy he brought to his teammates in the high stakes win.
Michigan State has nobody that can guard him as he proved in both contests this year.
Izzo took offense to it, but nothing arose from it.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     But since then, Martelli and the Wolverines found a new gear and took down in-state rival Michigan State Tuesday night.
Hunter Dickinson was the star of the show and the Wolverines were never really in position to lose the game.
Martelli talked about the streaky season for Michigan after the win over Michigan State.
“Tomorrow I'm going to address it.
Tomorrow, I'm going to do a little bit more, and some of the guys that didn't play a lot of minutes are going to get a sweat tomorrow.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.
