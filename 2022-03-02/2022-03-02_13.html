     NBA Today reacts to Devin Booker going into health and safety protocols.
(2:21)All-Star guard Devin Booker entered the NBA's health and safety protocols and missed the Phoenix Suns' 120-90 win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
Booker previously entered the protocols this season in September and missed media day and the start of training camp.
Booker is a three-time All-Star and the team's leading scorer, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game.
Paul broke his thumb Feb. 16 and could miss the rest of the regular season, though the team is hopeful he will return before the playoffs.

For every well-rounded win over Purdue and Wisconsin, there comes an equally comprehensive letdown at Iowa and Rutgers.

     The Phoenix Suns shook off a two-game losing streak in last night’s 120-90 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.
After getting off to a fast start, the Suns stood their ground, outscoring the depleted Portland team every quarter.
Still the Suns prevailed, improving their regular season record to 50-12, becoming the first team to reach the 50-win mark this season.
With the playoffs right around the corner, the Suns are looking to secure the top spot in the West.

     “I was kind of surprised when I came into the gym and Devin Booker got health and safety protocols,” Payne said.
Booker wasn't at Thursday's practice as the Suns face the Knicks (25-37) Friday to conclude a four-game homestand.
“This is just another one of them.”Averaging a team-high 25.6 points a game this season, Booker didn’t attend Wednesday’s game as he posted a picture on Instagram of the game on his big screen TV.
“I don’t know the numbers so I can’t speak too accurately on this, but there’s not as many people in NBA protocols as there was a little bit earlier.
Now Booker back in protocols puts the situation front and center again for the Suns and the league.

     The Wolverines got back to their winning ways on Tuesday night with another requisite win over rival Michigan State 87-70.
They got to exact some revenge for the mistreatment that they incurred in East Lansing about a month ago and here are three takeaways from Michigan basketball’s win.
Tom Izzo refused to double team him and Dickinson took full advantage of the energy he brought to his teammates in the high stakes win.
Michigan State has nobody that can guard him as he proved in both contests this year.
Izzo took offense to it, but nothing arose from it.

     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     PHOENIX — Who knows where expectations should be set for the Phoenix Suns while Devin Booker (health and safety protocols) and Chris Paul (right thumb avulsion fracture) remain out.
After Simons got 11 points early, Phoenix mixed in traps on Blazers ball-handlers to create that havoc when they could, something the Suns don’t do much of.
Offensively, the question was if the Suns would be able to start the initial breakdown of the defense off the dribble.
Phoenix had its own turnover problems as well, ending up with 16, and fastbreak points were 23-18 Suns.
He started alongside Landry Shamet, meaning Johnson went back to the bench after starting the three games without Paul.

     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
