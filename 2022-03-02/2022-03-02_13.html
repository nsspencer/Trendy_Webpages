     NBA Today reacts to Devin Booker going into health and safety protocols.
(2:21)All-Star guard Devin Booker entered the NBA's health and safety protocols and missed the Phoenix Suns' 120-90 win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
Booker previously entered the protocols this season in September and missed media day and the start of training camp.
Booker is a three-time All-Star and the team's leading scorer, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game.
Paul broke his thumb Feb. 16 and could miss the rest of the regular season, though the team is hopeful he will return before the playoffs.

File Photo by Etienne Laurent/EPA-EFEMarch 2 (UPI) -- All-Star guard Devin Booker was placed in the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocols and will miss the Phoenix Suns' game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night.
Booker's absence is another significant blow to the Suns, who are already without fellow All-Star guard Chris Paul.

     Phoenix Suns News: Devin Booker’s Absence Threatens Pursuit of Franchise Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Despite the extended absence of Chris Paul, the Phoenix Suns remain 6.5 games clear of the Golden State Warriors for the top seed in the Western Conference and home-court advantage throughout the 2022 NBA Playoffs.
But while the Suns are still in a terrific spot, Devin Booker’s impending absence threatens the team’s shot at a franchise record.
That number would eclipse the team’s previous single-season record of 62 victories, first set during the 1992-93 season and replicated during the 2004-05 campaign.
Devin Booker entering health and safety protocolsSuns say All-Star Devin Booker has entered health and safety protocols.
Still, the Suns could be hard-pressed to break the single-season wins record.

     “Forcing us to deal with something now that will hopefully make us better in the long run.
With that in mind, the Suns’ roster construction was direct and intentional, placing supplementary pieces around Booker and Paul that could co-exist with them.
We don’t know how long Booker is going to be out.
Shamet reiterated that a team-oriented mindset is not going to become more individualistic just because Booker and Paul are out.
“I don’t want to say we’re dependent on those guys but those guys add a lot to our team,” he said.

     1 Question for Every NBA Team Down the Stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     1 of 30LM Otero/Associated PressArguably no team this season has been a bigger letdown than the Hawks, who made the Eastern Conference Finals last year and are now barely hanging on in ninth place in the play-in tournament.
The biggest culprit: their defense, which has been bad enough (currently 26th in the league) to offset Atlanta having the NBA's second-best offense.
It doesn't help that John Collins, one of the few plus defenders on the roster, has missed the last five games with a foot injury.
He should theoretically be back soon, but that alone won't be enough to fix a defense that has been atrocious all year.
The Hawks aren't going to repeat their trip to the conference finals, but if they want to even have a chance of getting out of the play-in, the defense has to be better.

     Phoenix Suns face test against Portland minus Booker and Paul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Suns have taken one step forward and four steps back entering their Wednesday home game against the Portland Trail Blazers.
Portland's coach Chauncey Billups said the Suns missing Paul and Booker won't alter their strategy on offense and defense.
Portland (25-36) is in a similar situation as the Suns (49-12), despite being on opposite ends of the Western Conference standings.
The Suns beat Portland in Phoenix, 119-109, in their second matchup on Nov. 10, in which Lillard led all scorers with 28 points.
Their third game in Portland was a grind, which ended in an 111-107 overtime victory by the Suns.

It's amazing the major contributions he's brought to the Phoenix Suns franchise.
I thank him personally for helping build the Phoenix Suns franchise, because he was selling the Suns franchise all those years.”How do you tell the story of the man who is synonymous with storytelling?
McCoy called a Suns game for the first time in a preseason game on September 27, 1972, and hasn't looked back since.
