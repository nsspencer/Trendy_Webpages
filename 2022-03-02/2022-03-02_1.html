     Frank Vogel Notes DeAndre Jordan Requested Lakers Departure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Monday night, the Los Angeles Lakers made a notable roster move as it was reported they intend to waive the veteran center DeAndre Jordan.
When the reports surfaced that Jordan was moving on from the Lakers, many assumed that Los Angeles was cutting the cord on Jordan because of preference.
However, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel noted that it was actually Jordan who desired a breakup in the first place.
“We wish DeAndre well," said Vogel on Tuesday night ahead of Los Angeles' matchup against the Dallas Mavericks.
Soon enough, the veteran big man will find his next destination as he hits the open market.

     But even with the losses piling up for the Lakers, James refuses to give up his belief in himself and the team as a whole.
“Because we still have games to play,” James said following the Lakers’ five-point loss to the Mavericks when asked why he remains confident.
Oftentimes this season, the Lakers have followed these promising performances with absolutely embarrassing ones and they will need to break that trend if James’ confidence is warranted.

     LeBron James insists he won't give up on Lakers' season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     Oram: Lakers say they're confident, but their recent performances don't match up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Not much has gone the Lakers way this season, but up until recently, they at least had one thing on their side.Math.Even as they racked up losses at an alarming rate and key players kept falling victim to injuries, the bottom tier of the Western Conference was still bad enough that the Lakers enjoyed a substantial enough cushion to see a viable path through the Play-In system.
An up-and-down regular season could be forgotten if the Lakers got healthy and peaked in April, just in time to go slay the Golden State Warriors or Phoenix Suns in the first round.But now?
After a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks that was their third straight defeat since the All-Star break, the Lakers are teetering on the brink of falling out of Play-In positioning altogether.
They have just a two-game lead on New Orleans and Portland, which is trying to avoid the postseason for more balls in the draft lottery, and are up 3.5 games on San Antonio.
By contrast, they are 4.5 games behind the eighth-place Clippers and nine games out of the sixth seed.As the Lakers slid to seven games under .500 on Tuesday despite a furious comeback that saw them erase a 21-point first-half deficit to lead in the fourth quarter, it’s fair not only to wonder if the Lakers will make the Play-In, but if there is an incentive to.A defiant LeBron James said he has confidence in the Lakers “because we still have games left to play.” They have 21 of them, in fact, a slate that Tankathon.

     LeBron James’ confidence is at an all-time high – even as the Lakers struggles put them just two games away from falling out of the play-in tournament.
“We still have games to play,” he said after the Lakers’ 10th loss in the past 13 games.
“Until you stomp me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance.
The Clippers beat the Lakers 105-102 last Friday, when James missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer to tie the game.

     Mavericks blow big lead, rally to hold off Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic scored seven of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, Jalen Brunson added 22 points and the Dallas Mavericks rallied for a 109-104 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night.
Dallas trailed 100-94 with seven minutes to play before scoring 11 consecutive points in a rally kicked off by Brunson's fourth 3-pointer.
Los Angeles managed only four points in the final seven-plus minutes.
Los Angeles is 0-3 since the All-Star break.
But Los Angeles made a 22-7 run out of halftime and pulled even with cold-shooting Dallas on James' 3-pointer.
