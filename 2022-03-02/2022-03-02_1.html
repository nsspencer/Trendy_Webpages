     ORLANDO — Before a preseason match between the Kansas City Current and the Orlando Pride, both sets of players stood arm-in-arm at center field to honor the life of Katie Meyer, a Stanford University soccer player who was found dead in an on-campus residence.
“Tonight, we take a moment to honor the life of Katie Meyer.
Our hearts go out to Katie’s family, friends and the Stanford soccer community,” the team posted on Twitter.
It is with great sadness that we report that Katie Meyer, a senior majoring in International Relations and minoring in History, a Resident Assistant, and a team captain and goalkeeper on the Stanford Women’s Soccer Team, has passed away.
“Katie was a bright shining light for so many on the field and in our community,” the university said.
