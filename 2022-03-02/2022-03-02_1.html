     Stanford women's soccer player Katie Meyer dies at 22; cause of death not provided
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Katie Meyer, the goalkeeper and captain of the Stanford women's soccer team, has died, the university announced.
Her death occurred in an on-campus residence, according to the university, but a cause of death was not provided.
A senior studying international relations and history, Meyer made two key saves in a penalty shootout to help Stanford win the national championship in 2019.
The university has resources available for those affected by Meyer's death and encouraged people to check in on those around them.
"There are no words to express the deep sadness we feel about Katie Meyer's passing," Stanford athletic director Bernard Muir said in a statement.

     Stanford identifies student found dead as championship-winning soccer goalie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stanford announced Wednesday that the undergraduate student who died Tuesday was Katie Meyer, a goalkeeper and captain for the Cardinal women’s soccer team.
Meyer was found dead in her on-campus residence on Tuesday, which the university initially reported without identifying the student.
Meyer grew up in Newbury Park in Ventura County, about an hour northwest of Los Angeles.
“It’s really shocking that this has happened.”Meyer was on the Newbury Park football team for two seasons as a kicker, specializing in extra points.
But once she went to Stanford, Meyer’s transcendence to becoming “world-renowned,” as Smigiel put it, didn’t shock anyone back home in Newbury Park.
