     Star-Studded Lakers Are Fighting Just to Make the Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Lakers are on the verge of missing the N.B.A.
After their most recent outing, a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, LeBron James sounded defiant.
“Until you stump me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance,” James said, his voice echoing in a cavernous portion of the arena.
He added: “As long as we’ve got more games to play, we still have a chance.
At 27-34, with the ninth-best record in the Western Conference, they still have a chance to make the playoffs, and they have James, who has led unlikely groups to postseason success before.

     Lakers: It Sounds Like Russell Westbrook Wants Out of Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russell Westbrook experiment in Los Angeles has failed.
For most of the season, analysts and Lakers members have argued that he just needed to get time with this team to figure things out.
Well, here we are almost at the end of the season, and Russ is nowhere close to finding it.
In the Lakers' loss to the Mavericks last night, Russ sunk just 5 of his 17 shots from the field.
"In any case, there is mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer, sources said."

     Shaquille O’Neal and Dwyane Wade took issue with the Los Angeles Lakers’ play as of late ahead of the team’s latest loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
O’Neal and his former Miami Heat teammate questioned the Lakers’ lack of effort at halftime of Los Angeles’ game against the Mavericks on "Inside the NBA."

I don’t mind losing, but when you don’t have a lot of effort, it shows that – and I hate to use this word – it looks like they’re quitting," O’Neal said.
We know if we play together, we show effort, and play hard, we can compete with whoever No.

     Lakers player grades: L.A. blows golden opportunity vs. Dallas Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In their prior two games, the Los Angeles Lakers showed very little confidence or resolve in losses to the Los Angeles Clippers and New Orleans Pelicans.
However, on Tuesday night against the surging Dallas Mavericks, L.A. played with much more pride and passion, as it competed hard with Luka Doncic and company.
The Lakers’ schedule won’t get any easier in the near future.
The Lakers will get a rematch against the Clippers on Thursday before hosting Golden State on Saturday.
Here is how each Laker player graded individually during Tuesday’s game:

     LeBron James insists he won't give up on Lakers' season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     The Lakers have lost three consecutive games coming out of the NBA All-Star break and 11 of their last 15 games.
“Cause we still have games to play,” James said after scoring 26 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.
Russell Westbrook, who missed 12 of his 17 shots and scored just 12 points, explained why he remains confident.
… Big second, too many points,” Westbrook said.
During the 28-point loss to the Pelicans on Sunday night, a video surfaced on Monday of James, Westbrook and Trevor Ariza having an exchange with some fans sitting behind the Lakers’ bench.

     LeBron James is playing through a sore right knee, something he acknowledged before the All-Star break.
LeBron’s postgame quotes after the loss to Dallas on Tuesday say the same thing, and express his belief that the Lakers still have a chance in the West.
The Lakers sit as the No.
12 seed Spurs are a threat but are 3.5 games back of the Lakers with 21 games to play.
None of that not how LeBron and the Lakers envisioned the season playing out.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James faced reporters Tuesday, a microphone in his hand, another loss on his résumé and a list of reasons to remain optimistic about the Lakers’ season on his brain.
Anthony Davis, out with a foot injury, isn’t close to returning, and the Lakers weren’t particularly good when he played.
They could make the playoffs—if the season ended today, L.A. would face New Orleans in the play-in—but the Lakers are going nowhere.
The combined salaries of James, Westbrook and Davis are around $130 million.

Los Angeles’ season has fallen well short of expectations, as the Lakers have lost six of their last seven games and sit at ninth place in the Western Conference.
Despite all the flak Westbrook has gotten from the Lakers faithful, he really hasn’t had a terrible individual season.
Los Angeles is facing a crisis.
Teams in need of a veteran point guard with explosive athleticism might be making calls to Los Angeles to inquire about Russ over the summer.

     League insiders remain dubious that Pelinka is truly entrenched as Los Angeles' lead executive beyond this season.
The whispers have been quiet on who could serve as Los Angeles' next play-caller.
"He wasn't returning some teams calls at [this year's] deadline," one general manager told B/R.
Los Angeles' most realistic option may ultimately be stretching Westbrook's $47 million player option for the 2022-23 season.
