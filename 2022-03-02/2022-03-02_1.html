     Star-Studded Lakers Are Fighting Just to Make the Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Lakers are on the verge of missing the N.B.A.
After their most recent outing, a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, LeBron James sounded defiant.
“Until you stump me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance,” James said, his voice echoing in a cavernous portion of the arena.
He added: “As long as we’ve got more games to play, we still have a chance.
At 27-34, with the ninth-best record in the Western Conference, they still have a chance to make the playoffs, and they have James, who has led unlikely groups to postseason success before.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shaquille O’Neal and Dwyane Wade took issue with the Los Angeles Lakers’ play as of late ahead of the team’s latest loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
O’Neal and his former Miami Heat teammate questioned the Lakers’ lack of effort at halftime of Los Angeles’ game against the Mavericks on "Inside the NBA."

I don’t mind losing, but when you don’t have a lot of effort, it shows that – and I hate to use this word – it looks like they’re quitting," O’Neal said.
We know if we play together, we show effort, and play hard, we can compete with whoever No.

     LeBron James insists he won't give up on Lakers' season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     Report: Lakers, Westbrook have ‘mutual interest’ in parting ways originally appeared on NBC Sports WashingtonThe Los Angeles Lakers-Russell Westbrook experiment might be nearing an end.
Los Angeles’ season has fallen well short of expectations, as the Lakers have lost six of their last seven games and sit at ninth place in the Western Conference.
Despite all the flak Westbrook has gotten from the Lakers faithful, he really hasn’t had a terrible individual season.
Los Angeles is facing a crisis.
Teams in need of a veteran point guard with explosive athleticism might be making calls to Los Angeles to inquire about Russ over the summer.

     The Lakers have lost three consecutive games coming out of the NBA All-Star break and 11 of their last 15 games.
“Cause we still have games to play,” James said after scoring 26 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.
Russell Westbrook, who missed 12 of his 17 shots and scored just 12 points, explained why he remains confident.
… Big second, too many points,” Westbrook said.
During the 28-point loss to the Pelicans on Sunday night, a video surfaced on Monday of James, Westbrook and Trevor Ariza having an exchange with some fans sitting behind the Lakers’ bench.

     LeBron James faced reporters Tuesday, a microphone in his hand, another loss on his résumé and a list of reasons to remain optimistic about the Lakers’ season on his brain.
Anthony Davis, out with a foot injury, isn’t close to returning, and the Lakers weren’t particularly good when he played.
They could make the playoffs—if the season ended today, L.A. would face New Orleans in the play-in—but the Lakers are going nowhere.
The combined salaries of James, Westbrook and Davis are around $130 million.

     After an incredibly disappointing season thus far, the Los Angeles Lakers and Westbrook reportedly have “mutual interest” in parting ways this offseason.
“In any case, there is mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer, sources said,” Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report wrote.
As Lakers fans already know quite well, there were some attempts to deal Westbrook prior to the NBA trade deadline last month.
It would have been amazing to see Westbrook, a Southern California native, help lead the Lakers to a fantastic season.
There is still time for Westbrook and the Lakers to turn things around, but chances of that actually happening seem quite slim.

     Lakers Rumors: Westbrook, Vogel, Pelinka, LeBron
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers‘ struggles in 2021/22 will have ramifications beyond this season, according to Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report, who says that point guard Russell Westbrook, head coach Frank Vogel, and head of basketball operations Rob Pelinka all have uncertain futures in Los Angeles.
According to Fischer, Westbrook gave an “impassioned” speech to Lakers players prior to All-Star weekend, stressing the need to be unified in their push for the postseason.
Fischer notes that Westbrook tried to motivate the Wizards in a similar manner last year and it paid off, as the team finished strong and claimed the No.
The Lakers haven’t shown signs of turning their season around so far — they’re 1-4 since the All-Star break.
