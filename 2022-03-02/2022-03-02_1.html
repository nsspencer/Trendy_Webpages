     LeBron James Feels Lakers ‘Still Have A Chance’ As Long As There’s Game Left To Play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But even with the losses piling up for the Lakers, James refuses to give up his belief in himself and the team as a whole.
“Because we still have games to play,” James said following the Lakers’ five-point loss to the Mavericks when asked why he remains confident.
Oftentimes this season, the Lakers have followed these promising performances with absolutely embarrassing ones and they will need to break that trend if James’ confidence is warranted.
“We missed shots.
We literally missed shots.

     LeBron James insists he won't give up on Lakers' season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

     LeBron James won’t give up on Lakers season ‘until I’m 12 feet under’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James’ confidence is at an all-time high – even as the Lakers struggles put them just two games away from falling out of the play-in tournament.
“We still have games to play,” he said after the Lakers’ 10th loss in the past 13 games.
“Until you stomp me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance.
The Clippers beat the Lakers 105-102 last Friday, when James missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer to tie the game.

     Mavericks blow big lead, rally to hold off Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic scored seven of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, Jalen Brunson added 22 points and the Dallas Mavericks rallied for a 109-104 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night.
Dallas trailed 100-94 with seven minutes to play before scoring 11 consecutive points in a rally kicked off by Brunson's fourth 3-pointer.
Los Angeles managed only four points in the final seven-plus minutes.
Los Angeles is 0-3 since the All-Star break.
But Los Angeles made a 22-7 run out of halftime and pulled even with cold-shooting Dallas on James' 3-pointer.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers have lost three consecutive games coming out of the NBA All-Star break and 11 of their last 15 games.
“Cause we still have games to play,” James said after scoring 26 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.
Russell Westbrook, who missed 12 of his 17 shots and scored just 12 points, explained why he remains confident.
… Big second, too many points,” Westbrook said.
During the 28-point loss to the Pelicans on Sunday night, a video surfaced on Monday of James, Westbrook and Trevor Ariza having an exchange with some fans sitting behind the Lakers’ bench.

     Los Angeles Lakers’ Future Looks Grim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The clock is running out this season for LeBron James and Los Angeles, but what about next year?
LeBron James faced reporters Tuesday, a microphone in his hand, another loss on his résumé and a list of reasons to remain optimistic about the Lakers’ season on his brain.
Anthony Davis, out with a foot injury, isn’t close to returning, and the Lakers weren’t particularly good when he played.
The combined salaries of James, Westbrook and Davis are around $130 million.
Seven, if L.A. picks up the cheap team option on Stanley Johnson.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, on Tuesday night against the surging Dallas Mavericks, L.A. played with much more pride and passion, as it competed hard with Luka Doncic and company.
The Lakers will get a rematch against the Clippers on Thursday before hosting Golden State on Saturday.
Westbrook missed multiple layup attempts throughout the contest and missed all four of his 3-point attempts.
Story continuesAlthough he did shoot well from downtown, making half of his 3-point attempts, Monk shot just 5-of-14 overall, as he missed multiple layups in traffic.
He made both of his 3-point attempts while adding one steal and one block.
