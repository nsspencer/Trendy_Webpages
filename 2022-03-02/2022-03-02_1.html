     Let’s take a quick break from looking at single-game odds for the Dallas Mavericks and dive into some big-picture futures odds.
As it sits right now, the Mavs and Nuggets have the same record, holding the 5th and 6th seeds, respectively.
There’s no way the Mavs won’t make the playoffs, right?
But still, -10000 odds aren’t odds you should bet on.
Mavs to win the Southwest DivisionOdds: +1200Coming into the 2021-22 season, the Mavericks were fairly heavy favorites over the Memphis Grizzlies to win the Southwest Division.

A lot has changed since then, though, as Luka Doncic has found his groove in a major way and led a resurgence for the Mavs.
Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY SportsAll of this recent success for the Mavs has resulted in improved their status in multiple NBA Power Rankings.
"Even with both Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson in prime roles ... Dallas decided that it needed even more ballhandling.

     Report: NBA Rescinds Luka Doncic’s 13th Technical Foul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic is getting close to the NBA’s limit of technical fouls before a suspension is applied, but one of those was just rescinded.
With Luka Doncic being called for his 13th technical foul of the 2021-22 season during the Dallas Mavericks' 107-103 win over the Golden State Warriors, his complaining to the referees has once again become a focus.
On Tuesday, the NBA announced they had rescinded the technical foul, so now, Doncic is back to only having 12 on the season.
There was confusion as to why Doncic was even called for the technical foul in the first place.
Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports“I would lean towards playing five on five a little bit more [than complaining],” Kidd said.
