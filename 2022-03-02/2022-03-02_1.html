     Star-Studded Lakers Are Fighting Just to Make the Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Lakers are on the verge of missing the N.B.A.
After their most recent outing, a 109-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, LeBron James sounded defiant.
“Until you stump me out, cut my head off, bury me 12 feet under, then I got a chance,” James said, his voice echoing in a cavernous portion of the arena.
He added: “As long as we’ve got more games to play, we still have a chance.
At 27-34, with the ninth-best record in the Western Conference, they still have a chance to make the playoffs, and they have James, who has led unlikely groups to postseason success before.

     Lakers: It Sounds Like Russell Westbrook Wants Out of Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russell Westbrook experiment in Los Angeles has failed.
For most of the season, analysts and Lakers members have argued that he just needed to get time with this team to figure things out.
Well, here we are almost at the end of the season, and Russ is nowhere close to finding it.
In the Lakers' loss to the Mavericks last night, Russ sunk just 5 of his 17 shots from the field.
"In any case, there is mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new home this summer, sources said."

     But that's difficult to do when you have a team built around LeBron James.
The Herd's Colin Cowherd had an easy (albeit wishful) solution to it all: trade him back to Miami.
“I don’t think Miami is dynamic enough at point guard.
But he is still LeBron James, the guy that led Miami to 4 NBA Finals appearances and back-to-back titles.
The draft pick compensation that would go along with a LeBron trade would be enough to secure the health of their future.

     Report: Lakers, Russell Westbrook have ‘mutual interest’ in parting ways
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers-Russell Westbrook experiment might be nearing an end.
Los Angeles’ season has fallen well short of expectations, as the Lakers have lost six of their last seven games and sit at ninth place in the Western Conference.
Despite all the flak Westbrook has gotten from the Lakers faithful, he really hasn’t had a terrible individual season.
Los Angeles is facing a crisis.
Teams in need of a veteran point guard with explosive athleticism might be making calls to Los Angeles to inquire about Russ over the summer.

     James is committed to play out the season, wherever it goes.
In James' first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, he sat out nine of L.A.'s final 14 games -- including the last six straight -- after missing a significant portion of the season prior to that because of a groin injury.
Like James, Westbrook maintained that L.A. still has plenty more to play for.
We've beaten the best teams; we've lost to some of the worst teams.
But as long as we've got more games to play, we should have a chance," James said.

I don’t mind losing, but when you don’t have a lot of effort, it shows that – and I hate to use this word – it looks like they’re quitting," O’Neal said.

     LeBron James faced reporters Tuesday, a microphone in his hand, another loss on his résumé and a list of reasons to remain optimistic about the Lakers’ season on his brain.
Anthony Davis, out with a foot injury, isn’t close to returning, and the Lakers weren’t particularly good when he played.
They could make the playoffs—if the season ended today, L.A. would face New Orleans in the play-in—but the Lakers are going nowhere.
The combined salaries of James, Westbrook and Davis are around $130 million.

… Big second, too many points,” Westbrook said.
During the 28-point loss to the Pelicans on Sunday night, a video surfaced on Monday of James, Westbrook and Trevor Ariza having an exchange with some fans sitting behind the Lakers’ bench.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     League insiders remain dubious that Pelinka is truly entrenched as Los Angeles' lead executive beyond this season.
The whispers have been quiet on who could serve as Los Angeles' next play-caller.
"He wasn't returning some teams calls at [this year's] deadline," one general manager told B/R.
Los Angeles' most realistic option may ultimately be stretching Westbrook's $47 million player option for the 2022-23 season.
