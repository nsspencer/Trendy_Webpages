     Arkansas basketball coach Eric Musselman is leading one of the nation's hottest teams following Wednesday night's 77-76 win over LSU in the home finale, and he hopes the NCAA Tournament selection committee is keeping a close eye on the Razorbacks' play down the stretch.
"You beat a really good team like Kentucky and your NET … what is that thing?
I’ll be real interested because (LSU’s) NET is real high.
"I hope there’s common sense and now just some NET number … I mean, Saint Mary’s beat Gonzaga and their NET barely moved.
Here's the rest of Musselman's key points following the Razorbacks' win over the Tigers.

     LSU put itself in prime position but foul calls and paint struggles piled up and were the ultimate difference makers in a 77-76 loss to the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Coming out the gate into the second half, LSU was shot out of a cannon, going on a 7-0 run to take a 42-35 lead.
“Our problem is not staying in the game, but finishing a game,” Eason said after the game.
In a hard-fought loss, the Tigers paint struggles were too much.
Arkansas’ inside dominance became the difference maker late in the second half and shifted the momentum their way.

Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

Is Giannis going to get the ball?
Is Jrue (Holiday) going to have the ball?
Like, who’s gonna get the ball?”Bucks wing Khris Middleton agreed: “At that point, we said it was gonna be no timeout.

     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.

In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.

Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

     Bucks show championship mettle in comeback win over Heat: 'We made the decision that we're just going to go'

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MILWAUKEE — Down by one point with just 13.5 seconds remaining and the Miami Heat inbounding the ball from the sideline on their own end of the floor, the Bucks had just improbably forced a jump ball.
Is Khris (Middleton) going to get the ball?
Is Giannis going to get the ball?
Is Jrue (Holiday) going to have the ball?
Like, who’s gonna get the ball?”Bucks wing Khris Middleton agreed: “At that point, we said it was gonna be no timeout.

     Milwaukee vs. Miami: Bucks Pull Off Wild Comeback vs. Heat, 120-119
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.
"We can make as many good decisions in 48 minutes as we can, but if we don't defend it's gonna be a tough night, a long night.
