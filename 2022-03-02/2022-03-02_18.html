     Klay Thompson practicing with team in Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     by Owen Klukas | Warriors Correspondent | Wed, Mar 2nd 4:24pm ESTPer Anthony Slater, Klay Thompson is with the team in Dallas and is taking part in the Warriors practice before Thursday night's game versus Dallas.
(Anthony Slater on Twitter)Fantasy Impact:It looks like Thompson is trending towards playing Thursday night.
The veteran guard will slide back into the starting lineup if active which will leave less minutes for Otto Porter Jr.. Klay has scored in double figures in all but one of his 17 games played this season.

     Golden State Warriors superstar Klay Thompson is ready to go.
Speaking to reporters during a media huddle on Wednesday, Thompson emphasized that he didn’t come to Dallas just to sit on the bench and watch.
I didn’t come all the way to Dallas to watch,” Thompson shared, per Anthony Slater of The Athletic.
For what it’s worth, Klay Thompson also revealed what he went through the past few days that led him to being sidelined.
The Warriors called Thompson’s condition as “general illness” and didn’t provide further details.

     Two Warriors All-Stars return to practice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both are currently taking part in a long Warriors practice.
But after flying in and going through a long practice today, he dismissed his “questionable” classification for the Dallas Mavericks game on Thursday.
“I didn’t come all the way to Dallas to watch.”Draymond also flew in and participated in the practice, as did the Warriors most mysterious rehabbing player, James Wiseman.
It’s encouraging that Wiseman is continuing to practice, keeping up the slim hope that he can still contribute something this year.
The Warriors’ other questionable player for Thursday is Moody, who pretty much just has to have his eye not be swollen shut by game time to play.

     Warriors injury updates: Green, Wiseman scrimmage and Thompson expects to play Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While Green is not expected to play on this road trip, Thompson assured he will be suiting up and active for Thursday’s game against the Mavericks after battling a week-long illness.
But Thompson participated in a full practice with the team at the Mavericks’ facility along with rehabbing center James Wiseman and Green — who has been out since Jan. 9 with a back injury.
Green may not be playing soon, but the Warriors need his energy for revival after a discombobulated and uninspired loss to the Timberwolves.
“Frankly, this team needs him.
“He needs reps, 1,000 reps,” Kerr said.

     DALLAS — On the heels of two disappointing losses, Warriors faithful were given some reasons for optimism Wednesday afternoon.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green traveled to Dallas and practiced with the team ahead of Thursday’s rematch against the Mavericks.
Thompson, who’s missed the past two games with an illness, is listed as questionable for Thursday.
“Just very, very lucky to be healthy.”Green won’t play Thursday, but Kerr said he’s continuing to make strides in his recovery.
The team needs it.
