     Bucks Talk: GoTY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.
Relive it all with Bucks Talk hosted by Justin Garcia, presented by Gruber Law Offices.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Heat led by 14 with six minutes left.
That stood as the game-winner when the Heat, out of timeouts, missed a desperate heave.
Holiday and Antetokounmpo each outscored Miami in the final six minutes.
Antetokounmpo finished 28 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.
Holiday added 25 points and 11 assists in what’s hopefully a playoff preview.

     Family Traditions: A reckoning on Texas Independence Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     March 2 is recognized state-wide as Texas Independence Day, marking the anniversary of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico in 1836, which established the Republic of Texas.
For many proud, native Texans — like myself — every day is Texas Independence Day, but this year will be spent “con más ganas” as my family recently discovered that we’re related to an important Texas Revolution war hero.
One of the army’s first headquarters was located at a Flores family ranch.
After winning independence and establishing the Republic of Texas, Flores went on to serve as 1st Lieutenant in Seguín’s Company and married Concepción Rojo, Seguín’s sister.
The relationship between Mexico and Texas goes way back, and since this freshman class is 32% Hispanic, it felt appropriate to highlight this aspect of Hispanic heritage on Texas Independence Day.

     What is the biggest area of concern for Milwaukee Bucks in the playoffs?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So I decided to see what the doom and gloom area of my brain thought about the Milwaukee Bucks.
Finding the biggest area of concern for the Milwaukee BucksWouldn’t it be funny if I just said “injuries” and that was the end of the article?
Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

     Milwaukee vs. Miami: Bucks Pull Off Wild Comeback vs. Heat, 120-119
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.
"We can make as many good decisions in 48 minutes as we can, but if we don't defend it's gonna be a tough night, a long night.
