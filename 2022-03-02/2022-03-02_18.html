     March 2 marks the day that the Texas Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1836.
It's the day independence was declared from Mexico and the Republic of Texas was formed.

     Family Traditions: A reckoning on Texas Independence Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     March 2 is recognized state-wide as Texas Independence Day, marking the anniversary of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico in 1836, which established the Republic of Texas.
For many proud, native Texans — like myself — every day is Texas Independence Day, but this year will be spent “con más ganas” as my family recently discovered that we’re related to an important Texas Revolution war hero.
One of the army’s first headquarters was located at a Flores family ranch.
After winning independence and establishing the Republic of Texas, Flores went on to serve as 1st Lieutenant in Seguín’s Company and married Concepción Rojo, Seguín’s sister.
The relationship between Mexico and Texas goes way back, and since this freshman class is 32% Hispanic, it felt appropriate to highlight this aspect of Hispanic heritage on Texas Independence Day.
