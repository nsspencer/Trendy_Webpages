     COLLIN COUNTY (WBAP/KLIF News) – Less than 24 hours after being forced into a primary runoff this week, U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly ended his campaign after allegations of infidelity with a former jihadist dubbed the ‘ISIS bride’ surfaced.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.
Joya gained national attention for her role as a former jihadist who was once married to a commander for the Islamic State.
Taylor was set to face off against Republican candidate Keith Self in a May 24th runoff elections.
The Collin County native has represented the 3rd Congressional District in the Dallas suburbs since 2018.

Van Taylor of Texas said Wednesday that he was ending his reelection campaign and admitted having an affair following reports that he had been in a relationship with the widow of an American-born recruiter for the Islamic State group.
The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
But it didn't happen like that," Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.
