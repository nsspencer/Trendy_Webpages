     ANN ARBOR -- Last season, the Michigan men’s basketball team lived in a bubble.
This season, they’re on it.
Before Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, Michigan was the last team out of the NCAA Tournament field, per Jerry Palm’s projections at CBS Sports.
After the Wolverines’ 87-70 victory, they were back in the field.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Three weeks ago, after his Michigan basketball team trounced then-No.
3 Purdue in arguably its best performance of the season, head coach Juwan Howard was asked to explain why everything came together for the Wolverines.
Could he identify some reason, some impetus behind three months of maddening fluctuations giving way to a near-flawless 40 minutes of basketball against one of the strongest teams in the Big Ten?

     What Howard Eisley had to say heading into Iowa game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan Wolverines men’s basketball assistant coach Howard Eisley spoke to the media Wednesday on the team’s off day between games against Michigan State and the Iowa Hawkeyes.
The Wolverines pummeled their rival last night, but have just one day to prep for the visiting Hawkeyes, the No.
Eisley spoke on a few topics today, such as Hunter Dickinson, his own play calling, Frankie Collins and tomorrow’s senior night festivities before the Iowa game.
Calling a flawless game, I’m not quite sure what that means,” Eisley said when he was told Phil Martelli said he called a flawless game.
“I think (point guard is) probably the toughest position to learn, especially when you’re going to different levels,” Eisley said.

     Michigan Basketball: 3 takeaways from commanding win over MSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Wolverines got back to their winning ways on Tuesday night with another requisite win over rival Michigan State 87-70.
They got to exact some revenge for the mistreatment that they incurred in East Lansing about a month ago and here are three takeaways from Michigan basketball’s win.
Tom Izzo refused to double team him and Dickinson took full advantage of the energy he brought to his teammates in the high stakes win.
Michigan State has nobody that can guard him as he proved in both contests this year.
Izzo took offense to it, but nothing arose from it.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     Michigan to honor 5 players on Senior Night, sans Juwan Howard

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan men’s basketball team will honor five players and two managers before it faces Iowa at the Crisler Center on Thursday night.
The Senior Night festivities will begin at about 8:35 p.m., some 30 minutes before the scheduled tip time of 9:07 p.m., according to a program spokesperson.
Missing from the celebration will be Juwan Howard, who continues to serve a suspension for his role in last month’s postgame altercation against Wisconsin.
Obviously he wants to be around, so that’s tough on him.”Hunter Dickinson and Jace Howard visited Juwan before Tuesday’s game against Michigan State.
Since then, though, the Hawkeyes haven’t lost; they’ve beaten Ohio State and Michigan State among four straight wins to climb off the bubble and into the national rankings.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.
