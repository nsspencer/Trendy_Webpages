     COLLIN COUNTY (WBAP/KLIF News) – Less than 24 hours after being forced into a primary runoff this week, U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly ended his campaign after allegations of infidelity with a former jihadist dubbed the ‘ISIS bride’ surfaced.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.
Joya gained national attention for her role as a former jihadist who was once married to a commander for the Islamic State.
Taylor was set to face off against Republican candidate Keith Self in a May 24th runoff elections.
The Collin County native has represented the 3rd Congressional District in the Dallas suburbs since 2018.

You need to be pretty good at basketball if an intense dance party doesn’t even slow you down.
The fact they are having dance parties before games show how much fun they are having this season and how confident they are of their abilities.

Van Taylor of Texas said Wednesday that he was ending his reelection campaign and admitted having an affair following reports that he had been in a relationship with the widow of an American-born recruiter for the Islamic State group.
The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
But it didn't happen like that," Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.

     NBA Today reacts to Devin Booker going into health and safety protocols.
(2:21)All-Star guard Devin Booker entered the NBA's health and safety protocols and missed the Phoenix Suns' 120-90 win against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
Booker previously entered the protocols this season in September and missed media day and the start of training camp.
Booker is a three-time All-Star and the team's leading scorer, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game.
Paul broke his thumb Feb. 16 and could miss the rest of the regular season, though the team is hopeful he will return before the playoffs.

     “I was kind of surprised when I came into the gym and Devin Booker got health and safety protocols,” Payne said.
Booker wasn't at Thursday's practice as the Suns face the Knicks (25-37) Friday to conclude a four-game homestand.
“This is just another one of them.”Averaging a team-high 25.6 points a game this season, Booker didn’t attend Wednesday’s game as he posted a picture on Instagram of the game on his big screen TV.
“I don’t know the numbers so I can’t speak too accurately on this, but there’s not as many people in NBA protocols as there was a little bit earlier.
Now Booker back in protocols puts the situation front and center again for the Suns and the league.

     Just before Tuesday’s primary, the conservative news outlet National File revealed Taylor’s affair with British native Tania Joya — the widow of John Georgelas, an American who joined ISIS in 2013.
Taylor reportedly had the affair with Tania Joya, whose ex-husband joined ISIS in 2013.
Toward the end of their affair, Joya asked Taylor for help paying off some bills and she claimed he agreed and gave her $5,000, but only if she kept her mouth shut.

     It is as if every victory for the Phoenix Suns for the remainder of the season would carry more weight to it.
So how confident are we as a fan base that the Phoenix Suns can win at least 13 more games?
60% of SB Nation readers believe that the Suns can win at least 13 more games this season.
Of the 40 made shots by the Phoenix Suns, 32 of those came via the assist.
If the Warriors win out, and the Phoenix Suns win 13 of their games, then the Suns are still the number one seed.

     PHOENIX — Who knows where expectations should be set for the Phoenix Suns while Devin Booker (health and safety protocols) and Chris Paul (right thumb avulsion fracture) remain out.
After Simons got 11 points early, Phoenix mixed in traps on Blazers ball-handlers to create that havoc when they could, something the Suns don’t do much of.
Offensively, the question was if the Suns would be able to start the initial breakdown of the defense off the dribble.
Phoenix had its own turnover problems as well, ending up with 16, and fastbreak points were 23-18 Suns.
He started alongside Landry Shamet, meaning Johnson went back to the bench after starting the three games without Paul.

     7 Observations from the Trail Blazers’ Loss to the Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers continued their losing streak against elite NBA teams tonight, falling to the Phoenix Suns 120-90.
Portland’s young, offensive-impoverished lineup couldn’t keep up with Phoenix, even without star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker to worry about.
One of the strong developments of this season is the freedom allowed to Billups by the utter lack of EXTERNAL expectations and star players.
He can drill down to pure basketball, style, and effort as the Blazers and their players explore the ability of these players to grow.
StatsHere are some significant stats tonight:9 out of 11 Blazers players registered a negative plus-minus.

Ring, ring.
The Suns have none of those nine players, which is why Steph and Giannis have such good odds behind the Suns.
If the Suns win a ring, the history on Paul and Book will change retroactively.
If the Suns win a ring, people will remember Paul and Book as the superstars they are.

     What Howard Eisley had to say heading into Iowa game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan Wolverines men’s basketball assistant coach Howard Eisley spoke to the media Wednesday on the team’s off day between games against Michigan State and the Iowa Hawkeyes.
The Wolverines pummeled their rival last night, but have just one day to prep for the visiting Hawkeyes, the No.
Eisley spoke on a few topics today, such as Hunter Dickinson, his own play calling, Frankie Collins and tomorrow’s senior night festivities before the Iowa game.
Calling a flawless game, I’m not quite sure what that means,” Eisley said when he was told Phil Martelli said he called a flawless game.
“I think (point guard is) probably the toughest position to learn, especially when you’re going to different levels,” Eisley said.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.
