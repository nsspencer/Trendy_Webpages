     Rivian Stock Is Falling Because EV Prices Are Rising. Investors Aren’t Happy.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Prices for new electric vehicles from electric truck maker Rivian Automotive are rising to help the start-up offset higher costs.
The direction of all car prices has been up in recent months, so a hike from another auto maker doesn’t seem like a surprise.
Investors are reacting with nervousness anyway.
Rivian stock (ticker: RIVN) fell nearly 11% to $55.18 a share on Wednesday.
The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each were up more than 2%.

     Rivian R1T and R1S EV Reservation Holders Hit with Big Price Hikes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rivian has announced large price increases for its R1S and R1T EVs that affect even current reservation holders.
A letter from Rivian posted by one customer on the Rivian owners' forum blames the price hike on supply-chain woes.
Buyers unwilling to stomach a big price increase have another option: accept a less powerful truck and wait longer for it.
Rivian's configurator still shows an "estimated" vehicle starting price of $67,500 for the R1T and $72,500 for the R1S.
This dual-motor, all-wheel-drive powertrain makes "over 600" horsepower and "over 600" pound-feet of torque, versus 835 hp and 908 pound-feet for the quad-motor version.

     Rivian buyers are canceling at alarming rates after price increases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A poll shows that Rivian buyers are canceling their reservations at an alarming rate after significant price increases for the R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV.
As we reported yesterday, Rivian announced significant price increases across its lineup that are resulting in some configurations going up by more than $12,000, and some by as much as $20,000 – these price increases also apply to people who had reservations for years, and they are not happy.
Rivan blamed the price increases on inflation and costs of materials, but many frustrated reservation holders noted that if that was the case, the price increase would have been smaller and more gradual.
Here’s our own poll for Rivian reservation holders:Electrek’s TakeI am pretty sure that I’m going myself to cancel my reservation of four years.
While I agree that it is a frustrating situation for reservation holders, it is likely the only way for Rivian to survive.

Both were early fans and reservation holders of Rivian’s R1T truck, but now they are speaking out about feeling like they experienced a bait and switch.
Quinn wrote on Twitter that five months ago, people at Rivian told him they were confident on the pricing of the cars.

     The more favorable market environment didn't prevent some companies from seeing losses in their share prices.
One notable decliner was Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), which made a controversial move that risks the loyalty of its early adopters.
Rivian looks to hike pricesShares of Rivian Automotive were down more than 12% late Wednesday morning.
Rivian said that it would raise prices on its two planned electric vehicles.
The increase comes as Rivian faces inflationary pressures on the costs of the components it needs to build its vehicles.

     Rivian faces customer backlash over price increases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The electric automaker Rivian is facing strong backlash from pre-order customers after announcing price increases this week.
“It’s a damn shame,” said Tyler Lisenby of Lake Forest, who canceled his R1S (sport utility vehicle) pre-order Tuesday.
So he pre-ordered the Rivian R1T truck in mid-2020.
But changing the price of the vehicle – or offering him a lesser vehicle for the same price – is “not ethical,” he told WGLT.
“Since you are in the final steps of completing your transaction, your Rivian preorder will not be affected by these adjustments,” Rivian told customers like Williams.
