     One sweet update the remake made to the original film gives Tony and Maria a little more quality time together.
In the original, Tony visits Maria at the bridal shop where she works, where they reenact a wedding and get to know each other.
In the remake, Tony takes Maria to a church on a date, where they sing "One Hand, One Heart," thus adding a little more depth to their short-lived relationship.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Heat led by 14 with six minutes left.
That stood as the game-winner when the Heat, out of timeouts, missed a desperate heave.
Holiday and Antetokounmpo each outscored Miami in the final six minutes.
Antetokounmpo finished 28 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.
Holiday added 25 points and 11 assists in what’s hopefully a playoff preview.

     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.

NBA.com Box ScoreFueled by Khris Middleton’s ten points, the Bucks did a solid job of keeping the Heat at bay in the first quarter.
A buzzer-beater fadeaway from Giannis Antetokounmpo would pad their a lead a little more, pushing the Bucks’ lead to 36-28 going into the second.
Stat That Stood OutThe Bucks locked down the Heat in the final minutes.
When it seemed like all was lost, the Bucks’ defense clamped up and came through when it was needed most.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New Posters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     Analyzing the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is the Milwaukee Bucks of the past 25 games.
Looking at the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022The thing is: it just seems like a lack of urgency.
There are a multitude of factors that one can pinpoint, but here are four ways this lack of urgency has manifested itself on the court.
When watching recent Bucks games, the idea of guarding the other team has become optional.
But this team, as it currently stands, lacks urgency and effort.

     West Side Story: The Brilliance and Tragedy of Its Disney+ Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.

     ‘West Side Story’ should have let Anybodys sing ‘Cool’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.

     In December 2017, casting director Cindy Tolan answered a phone call from West Side Story producer Kristie Macosko Krieger.
And she said, ‘Steven Spielberg.
Steven Spielberg is a genius.”Tolan’s work on West Side Story has been nominated for best casting at the Baftas — a relatively new cate­gory, but one she feels is warranted.
And I’m thrilled Bafta does it.”While Oscar has yet to follow suit with a casting award, Tolan believes it’s only a matter of time.
“A few years ago, the Academy did acknowledge we are a group that matter and created a branch for casting directors.
