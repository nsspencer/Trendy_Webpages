     Jrue Holiday game-winner caps Bucks’ crazy comeback vs. Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Heat led by 14 with six minutes left.
That stood as the game-winner when the Heat, out of timeouts, missed a desperate heave.
Holiday and Antetokounmpo each outscored Miami in the final six minutes.
Antetokounmpo finished 28 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.
Holiday added 25 points and 11 assists in what’s hopefully a playoff preview.

     Bucks Talk: GoTY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.
Relive it all with Bucks Talk hosted by Justin Garcia, presented by Gruber Law Offices.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Bucks win a thriller, 120-119.
NBA.com Box ScoreFueled by Khris Middleton’s ten points, the Bucks did a solid job of keeping the Heat at bay in the first quarter.
A buzzer-beater fadeaway from Giannis Antetokounmpo would pad their a lead a little more, pushing the Bucks’ lead to 36-28 going into the second.
Stat That Stood OutThe Bucks locked down the Heat in the final minutes.
When it seemed like all was lost, the Bucks’ defense clamped up and came through when it was needed most.

     Analyzing the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is the Milwaukee Bucks of the past 25 games.
Looking at the Milwaukee Bucks’ lack of urgency in 2022The thing is: it just seems like a lack of urgency.
There are a multitude of factors that one can pinpoint, but here are four ways this lack of urgency has manifested itself on the court.
When watching recent Bucks games, the idea of guarding the other team has become optional.
But this team, as it currently stands, lacks urgency and effort.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.
