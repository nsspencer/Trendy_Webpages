     After Sydney Sweeney was pictured wearing a diamond ring while out and about with her beau Jonathan Davino in Los Angeles on Monday, February 28, 2022, fans speculated that the two may be engaged.
The 24-year-old Euphoria star has been romantically linked to 37-year-old Jonathan, whose family owns the Chicago-based Italian restaurant Pompei, since 2018.
"I don't date people in the spotlight," she told Cosmo.
"I don't date actors or musicians or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it's easiest.

     COLLIN COUNTY (WBAP/KLIF News) – Less than 24 hours after being forced into a primary runoff this week, U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly ended his campaign after allegations of infidelity with a former jihadist dubbed the ‘ISIS bride’ surfaced.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.
Joya gained national attention for her role as a former jihadist who was once married to a commander for the Islamic State.
Taylor was set to face off against Republican candidate Keith Self in a May 24th runoff elections.
The Collin County native has represented the 3rd Congressional District in the Dallas suburbs since 2018.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor drops his Texas reelection bid and admits to an affairEnlarge this image toggle caption Caroline Brehman/AP Caroline Brehman/APDALLAS — U.S. Rep. Van Taylor of Texas said Wednesday that he was ending his reelection campaign and admitted having an affair following reports that he had been in a relationship with the widow of an American-born recruiter for the Islamic State group.
The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
But it didn't happen like that," Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.

     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.
