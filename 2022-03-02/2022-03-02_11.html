     After Sydney Sweeney was pictured wearing a diamond ring while out and about with her beau Jonathan Davino in Los Angeles on Monday, February 28, 2022, fans speculated that the two may be engaged.
The 24-year-old Euphoria star has been romantically linked to 37-year-old Jonathan, whose family owns the Chicago-based Italian restaurant Pompei, since 2018.
"I don't date people in the spotlight," she told Cosmo.
"I don't date actors or musicians or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it's easiest.
Sydney nor Jonathan have publicly commented on the engagement yet.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New Posters

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     West Side Story: The Brilliance and Tragedy of Its Disney+ Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     Bucks stun Heat on Jrue Holiday's last-second game-winner, but Milwaukee's defense deserves all the credit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because of the previous inbounds fiasco, the Heat had no timeouts left to set up a play, and the Bucks escaped with a thrilling 120-119 victory.
In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.
"We can make as many good decisions in 48 minutes as we can, but if we don't defend it's gonna be a tough night, a long night.

     ‘West Side Story’ should have let Anybodys sing ‘Cool’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.
