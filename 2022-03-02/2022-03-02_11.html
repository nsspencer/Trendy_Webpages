     One sweet update the remake made to the original film gives Tony and Maria a little more quality time together.
In the original, Tony visits Maria at the bridal shop where she works, where they reenact a wedding and get to know each other.
In the remake, Tony takes Maria to a church on a date, where they sing "One Hand, One Heart," thus adding a little more depth to their short-lived relationship.

     West Side Story Is Now Streaming on Disney+, 2 New PostersThe remake of West Side Story is one of those rare times when a remake really did do everything right and is genuinely a good movie, but there just wasn't an audience at the box office for it at the time.
If Encanto taught us anything, it's that a movie on streaming can very much find a new audience.
The new remake of West Wide Story has now hit Disney+ for most of the people that decided not to see it in theaters, along with a new TV spot and two new posters.
Maybe now people will take the time to check this one out, much as they did with Encanto, and can see why it picked up seven Academy Award nominations.
Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, West Side Story tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.

     West Side Story: The Brilliance and Tragedy of Its Disney+ Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This fact belies both the shrewdness of Disney reviving interest in the movie a week before Academy Award voters start turning in their final ballots and also the minor tragedy of a movie as visually magnificent as West Side Story still being a box office loser.
The filmmaker admitted he grew up adoring the original cast recording of the 1957 Broadway production as a child well before he saw the Wise movie that went on to win Best Picture.
The gymnasium shot is just a drop in the ocean of the filmmaking energy raising all boats in this new adaptation.
Those are, of course, the breaks that come with playing at the box office casino, especially in such strange times.
And for that reason, it’s clever on Disney’s part to both allow these clips to go viral a week before West Side Story’s Disney+ premiere and to then offer a splashy debut on the second most popular streaming service in the U.S.

     ‘West Side Story’ should have let Anybodys sing ‘Cool’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Spielberg’s rendition, Anybodys is played by nonbinary actor, iris menas, and the character is depicted on screen as transmasculine.
Giving Anybodys a song would not only push the envelope for transgender representation but also makes narrative sense.
In the original stage production, Riff and the Jets sing this song in Act 1 before the rumble.
In the 1961 film, Ice and the Jets sing it after the rumble, once Riff has already been killed.
