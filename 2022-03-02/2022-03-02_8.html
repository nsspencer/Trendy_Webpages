     Florida Gov DeSantis Berates Students for Wearing Masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ron DeSantis admonished a group of high school students for wearing face masks at an indoor news conference Wednesday, saying it was time to stop what he called “this COVID theater."
The Republican governor approached the students and asked them to remove their masks as they waited for him at the press event at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
One of the students, 14-year-old Kevin Brown Jr., a high school freshman, told The Associated Press he was caught off-guard by DeSantis and felt pressured to removed his mask.
We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district," Davis said.
Though the CDC late last month eased its masking guidelines, the agency is still recommending masks indoors in areas it considers high risk.

     There’s a new Fitbit recall to know: Fitbit has just voluntarily recalled more than one million of its Ionic smartwatches after reports that overheating lithium-ion batteries had resulted in burn injuries.
“The battery in the Ionic smartwatch can overheat, posing a burn hazard,” Fitbit said in a statement on their site on Wednesday.
“The health and safety of Fitbit users is our highest priority.
According to the brand, these reported cases accounted for less than 0.01% of the Ionic smartwatches sold.
“These incidents are very rare and this voluntary recall does not impact other Fitbit smartwatches or trackers,” Fitbit said in a statement.

     Fitbit is recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally because the fitness product's lithium-ion battery can overheat, posing a burn hazard, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced on Wednesday.
Consumers were urged to stop using the Ionic smartwatches and to contact Fitbit to receive pre-paid packaging to return the device, for which they'll be refunded $299, the notice stated.
The recall involves only the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch, sold with a polyurethane band and a 1.4-inch color LCD screen.
