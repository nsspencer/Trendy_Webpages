     Ron DeSantis admonished a group of high school students for wearing face masks at an indoor news conference Wednesday, saying it was time to stop what he called “this COVID theater."
The Republican governor approached the students and asked them to remove their masks as they waited for him at the press event at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
One of the students, 14-year-old Kevin Brown Jr., a high school freshman, told The Associated Press he was caught off-guard by DeSantis and felt pressured to removed his mask.
We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district," Davis said.
Though the CDC late last month eased its masking guidelines, the agency is still recommending masks indoors in areas it considers high risk.

     Florida governor Ron DeSantis has drawn outrage from parents after he was caught on camera berating teenagers in his state for wearing face masks to protect against Covid-19.
“It’s just shocking that the governor told these kids: ‘Take off your mask,’” Ms Marshall, who said she urges her son to cover his face at school, told WFLA.
“Can’t believe @GovRonDeSantis would belittle &amp; bully kids to take off their masks by calling them ‘ridiculous,’” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted.
Breathe free, feel safe and be happy.”She also accused those who force children to wear masks of being the real bullies.
