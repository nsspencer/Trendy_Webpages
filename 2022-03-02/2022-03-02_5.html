     MLB lockout: Rob Manfred is killing the game by alienating fans, and baseball might never recover | Klapisch

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On the day Major League Baseball committed hari-kari, I asked my son, a 19-year-old college sophomore, what he would remember about this sad moment in history.
He looked at me dumbfounded.
Why would anyone be sad, he asked, when “The Batman” was opening at theaters everywhere?

     As for Manfred, we hope he squeezes in 36 on Wednesday and gets it out of his system before talks between the MLB and MLBPA resume on Thursday.
First of all, WE WANT FREAKING BASEBALL.
FIGURE IT OUT.
Second of all, golf has enough to worry about with a Saudi blood-money takeover looming, a PIP system that rewards the big Saudi-blood-money guy, and the slow dissolution of yesterday’s stars of the future into the also-rans of today.
The last thing we need right now is to be on the hook for the failures of another sport, so do us a favor, Rob, and leave golf out of it.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The first two series of the 2022 MLB regular season have officially been cancelled.
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred made the announcement during a press conference after the players' union unanimously declined the league's latest CBA proposal.
In his presser, Manfred reiterated that, "The concerns of our fans are at the very top of our consideration list."
The MLBPA promptly responded after the conclusion of Manfred's televised press conference.
The MLBPA held a subsequent press conference where Tony Clark, the MLBPA executive director, provided his thoughts on the current state of the sport of baseball“The game has suffered damage for a while now.

     Morning Mound Visit: Rob Manfred cancels first two series of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MLB and the MLBPA failed to come to an agreement on Tuesday, and Commissioner Rob Manfred canceled the first two series of the season.
The two sides are still far apart on key issues, and the league still appears to be negotiating in bad faith.
Ross Stripling, the Blue Jay’s player’s union representative, said that the owners were “trying to sneak things through” in the fine print that were never discussed.
Rob Manfred and his bosses are just trying to put pressure on the union by withholding paychecks.
Grant Brisbee | The Athletic $: In case you still feel like the players are partially to blame for the canceled games, here’s a reminder that their asks weren’t extreme.

     ORLANDO, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 10: Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred answers questions during an MLB owner's meeting at the Waldorf Astoria on February 10, 2022 in Orlando, Florida.
Because he really is that bad of an MLB commissioner.
Rob Manfred once said it would be a "disastrous outcome" if the lockout resulted in missed games this season.
Here's a look at Manfred during the same presser where he officially canceled the beginning of the season: pic.twitter.com/wy6Tof2zq3 — Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) March 1, 2022Dodgers fans have a reason to hate Rob Manfred even more.

     The joke, or hunch, or belief, has always been that Manfred doesn’t really like baseball.
He’s only there to aid the owners, who themselves are at best indifferent to baseball.
Actual baseball doesn’t really enter into it.
That perceived glee as Manfred took baseball away from its fans confirmed all those suspicions.
It’s too far gone now, because baseball is run by people who only see what’s right in front of their faces and not what’s down the block.

     The MLB lockout will rage on through March, pushing back Opening Day and canceling the first two series of the season.
This is just the latest Rob Manfred embarrassmentOnce again, Manfred is aligning himself on the wrong side of baseball history.
While earnings and prices go up around Major League Baseball, player salaries have dropped 4.8% from 2019.
After all, the league, owners, and teams are losing money.
But Major League Baseball is where common sense goes to die — and Manfred is more interested in harboring wealth than bringing the game back to its millions of fans.
