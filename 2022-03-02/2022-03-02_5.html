     Ukrainian Official Says Kherson Not Captured by Russia, Fighting Continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that Russia had not captured Kherson, a southern port city that Russia had earlier said it had seized.
Oleksiy Arestovych said fighting continued for the provincial capital of around a quarter of a million people, which sits at the Dnipro river's exit into the Black Sea.
"The city has not fallen, our side continues to defend," Arestovych told a live briefing broadcast on the website of the president's office.
"Information that Kherson has fallen and so on - that's not true.

     Mayor of Ukraine's Kherson City Says Russian Troops in the Streets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, Igor Kolykhayev on Wednesday said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
Ukraine's government had earlier played down reports that Kherson had fallen into Russian hands, which would be the first sizeable city to do so since the invasion began last week.
Kolykhayev urged Russian soldiers not to shoot at civilians and publicly called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.
"We do not have the Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here!"

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Russia Gains Strategic Advantage by Taking Southern City of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kherson, a key strategic point along the Black Sea, has been captured by Russia, making it the first major Ukrainian city to fall to invading Russian forces.
As the fighting raged into its seventh day, throngs of the Russian military were seen advancing upon the city of approximately 300,000 people.
The capture of Kherson represents a major strategic victory for the Russian army as it continues its efforts to annex Ukraine.
Kherson's fall comes as the Russian military continues an aggressive assault on another major Ukrainian metropolis—Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.
The continued assault could make Kharkiv the second major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands.

     Kherson mayor indicates the city has fallen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kherson Ihor Kolykhaiev has said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” — indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.
The announcement on his Facebook page follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city.
Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000.
On Wednesday in Kyiv, the mayor had disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainian forces were still fighting in parts of the city.
The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday.

     ANDRII YATSKEVICH went to bed on March 1st in a Ukrainian city and woke up in a Russian-controlled one.
A city of 285,000 people, Kherson is the first regional capital and by far the largest town that Russian forces have taken and held.
In Berdyansk, social-media footage shows citizens gathering outside lines of Russian troops to chant “go home”.
There Russian troops shot and wounded the father of one of Mr Yatskevich’s friends, he says, as he went to protect his shop from looting by Russian troops.
And it seems to have orders to bombard Ukraine into submission, city by civilian-filled city.
