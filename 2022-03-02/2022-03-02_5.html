     Embattled Texas AG Paxton Faces Off Against George P. Bush In Runoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Even with ex-president Donald Trump’s endorsement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) failed to get more than 50 percent of the vote in his GOP primary race on Tuesday, forcing him into a runoff against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush.
Jeb Bush (R), the nephew of ex-president George W. Bush and the grandson of ex-president George H.W.
Bush, came in second place, bumping Paxton’s two other Republican challengers out of the runoff (pour one out for Rep. Louie Gohmert).
The Austin-American Statesman reports that Paxton brushed off the election results on Tuesday night, telling supporters that running against an “establishment” candidate like Bush was “nothing new” for him.
Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified Jeb Bush.

     Ken Paxton, George P. Bush in GOP runoff for Texas attorney general
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, weakened by legal problems and allegations of official misconduct, finished first in Tuesday's GOP primary but was denied outright victory, pushing him into a runoff against George P. Bush.
With almost three-fourths of the state's precincts reporting, Paxton had about 43% of the vote, sending the two-term incumbent into a May 24 runoff against Bush, the Texas land commissioner who had 22% of the vote.
Election results:See the 2022 Texas Primary Election resultsFormer Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, fell short in the four-way primary.
"Only one in three Republicans know that Ken Paxton is facing three felony counts in Houston court and facing an FBI investigation looking into bribery and corruption, so part of that is on me," he told reporters Tuesday night.
Meantime, the Democratic race for attorney general appeared to be headed to a runoff as well.

     Driving the news: With nearly all the ballots counted, Paxton, mired in corruption scandals, had just shy of 43% of the vote.
Having failed to clear 50%, he will end up in a runoff against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, who held nearly 23% of the vote in a four-person race.
By squeezing into the runoff, Bush breathes new life into the fabled Texas political name and sets up a barn-burner of a race.
The big picture: The Texas primary was the first big midterm test of the ex-president's clout within the GOP since the Jan. 6 insurrection.
What's next: The primary runoff is set for May 24.

     Ken Paxton And George P. Bush Advance To May Runoff In GOP Texas Attorney General Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN (CBSDFW.COM/CNN) – It will take a runoff election for Texas Republicans to decide on their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of an outright victory in Tuesday’s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May.
With more than 93% of the state’s precincts reporting, Paxton had about 42.7% of the vote, versus Bush who had 22.8% of the vote.
Paxton led the four-candidate field by a comfortable margin, despite feisty and well-funded challenges from Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert.
His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP’s effort to yet again sweep statewide offices.
Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state’s high court, is a relative moderate.

Paxton is the most prominent Texas incumbent who was pushed into a runoff after Tuesday’s primary.
The five-way Democratic contest was also in flux Tuesday, but appeared to be headed into a runoff as well.
In late 2020, eight top staffers accused Paxton of repeatedly abusing his office to benefit a wealthy campaign donor.
