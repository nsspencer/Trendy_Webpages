    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Harden, left, of the Sixers jokes with new teammate Matisse Thybulle before their game at the Wells Fargo Center on Feb. 15, 2022.
Starting wing Matisse Thybulle said after Wednesday’s shootaround that Harden has “inspired a lot of people … just [with] the energy, the talk” since joining the Sixers less than three weeks ago.
“The camaraderie has grown just from his presence alone, just because of the amount of passion he plays with,” Thybulle said of Harden.
And it trickles down to everybody.”That approach has carried over to the court, where Thybulle said he has most felt Harden’s impact in the Sixers’ uptick in pace.
Simmons has not played at all this season after sitting out his time on the Sixers’ following a trade demand.

     Sixers Notebook: Harden’s presence won’t alter Doc Rivers’ varied lineup approach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA — From training camp through the trade deadline, Doc Rivers was determined to preserve one coaching option.
Since the Harden addition, Rivers has shown a preference for a second unit of Georges Niang, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green, Paul Millsap and Shake Milton.
Aware that Embiid might need the occasional rest, the Sixers had success last season with Dwight Howard as a backup five-man.
And before they traded him to Brooklyn this season, Andre Drummond proved a valuable supplement to the Sixers’ MVP candidate.
Between Paul and Paul and Willie and if we get someone else, it may be a committee.

That was the case on Wednesday night as fans lined the tunnel waiting for the arrival of James Harden to come out and show the fans what they have been waiting for.

He then began his warm-ups and the crowd was in anticipation of every single jumper The Beard put up.
As he gets set to make his debut, the atmosphere promises to be a wild one at 7:30 p.m. EST:

     Sixers' Tobias Harris Reacts to Recent Struggles With Harden On Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When the Sixers landed Harden weeks ago at the trade deadline, they couldn't utilize him right away.
In the two games he played alongside Harden, Harris put up two points per game while shooting just 27-percent from the field.
Following Sunday's victory over the Knicks, Sixers coach Doc Rivers mentioned he's far from worried about Harris' lack of production.
However, he made it clear that winning games is first and foremost on his list of goals throughout the NBA season.
But if the Sixers are winning games, it's hard for anybody on the roster to be disgruntled.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Harden helped the 38-23 Sixers overcome a sluggish first half with 26 points, nine assists and nine rebounds Wednesday, while Embiid had 27 points and 12 rebounds.
It's safe to say Rivers is early in the process of putting together his playoff rotation.
The final spot, assuming Rivers goes with nine, could be determined between Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz.
Between Paul and Paul and Willie and if we get someone else — it may be a committee, which I can tell you upfront it's the last thing I want.
Rivers and the Sixers' goal is to win as many of them as possible while continuing to collect information that will result in determining the playoff rotation by mid-April.

The Sixers outscored the Knicks by two points in Millsap's second-half minutes, which felt like a huge win given the team's continued defensive shakiness.
Embiid grinned after seeing Maxey make a difficult three to extend the Sixers' lead to 112-99 in the fourth quarter.
Harden stared down a wide-open three to begin the third quarter but instead opted to hit Embiid in the paint.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the blockbuster trade on Feb. 10 that sent ex-Net James Harden to the Sixers for Ben Simmons, Philadelphia head coach Doc Rivers gave a speech about staying focused on the present.
Maxey was just a few months into his rookie season when Philadelphia became embroiled in its saga with Simmons.
“We have a great group of guys, guys that really like each other, guys that get along, guys that want to play with each other and guys that want to win.
Harden joined a Philadelphia team that entered the All-Star break third in the East, where they remain, just 2 1/2 games behind the Heat and Bulls.
James Harden with the Philadelphia 76ers Getty ImagesJoel Embiid has kept the 76ers afloat with an MVP campaign-worthy effort this season, averaging 29.6 points and 11.2 rebounds per game.
