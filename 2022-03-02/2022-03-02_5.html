    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–James Harden came to the Philadelphia 76ers with extremely high expectations.
The Sixers were already contenders before Harden, but now that they possess a talent such as he, it raised everything as the expectation now is to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.
This is a claim that he has denied since joining Philadelphia, but it is still a reputation that he carried with him.
Coach Doc Rivers has been impressed with the way Harden has allowed him to coach him and how he has been with his teammates:Editor’s note, Rivers’ comments were made before Wednesday’s game.
So this is before Harden’s third game with the team.

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Sixers sign DeAndre Jordan as another backup center option for thin frontcourt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan dunks over Charlotte Hornets center Mason Plumlee in the first quarter at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021.
Read moreAfter clearing waivers, veteran center DeAndre Jordan has officially signed with the 76ers, the team announced Thursday night.
The Sixers quickly emerged as a front-runner to land Jordan after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him earlier this week, according to a report by ESPN.
Since then, Sixers coach Doc Rivers has been adamant that the Sixers would canvas the buyout market for a replacement.
The 37-year-old Millsap has been the Sixers’ backup center the past four games with mediocre-at-best results, averaging 4.4 points and 2.8 rebounds in 11.2 minutes.

     Late on Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
The major port of Odesa, Ukraine’s third-largest city, lies some 200km (124 miles) west of Kherson.
If Russian forces overtake Odesa, it would cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.

     Kherson: Russian army moves to cut Ukraine’s access to sea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west.
The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond.
A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson.
Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city.
I just asked [them] not to shoot people.”Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko.

     Sixers to Sign Former Lakers Center DeAndre Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Philadelphia 76ers plan to sign former Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan for the rest of the season, a source confirms to Sports Illustrated on Thursday.
Jordan, a 33-year-old veteran, joins the Sixers after a short-lived stint with the Lakers.
In 32 games with the Lakers, the veteran center averaged four points and five rebounds while playing 12 minutes per game.
"We wish DeAndre well," said Vogel on Tuesday night ahead of Los Angeles' matchup against the Dallas Mavericks.
The Lakers needed a guard, Jordan needed to move on, and now the Sixers need another big to backup their All-Star center, Joel Embiid.

     Russian Troops Enter Strategic Ukrainian Port of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian troops were in the center of the Ukrainian port of Kherson on Thursday after a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had captured a major urban center for the first time in its eight-day invasion.
Russia's defense ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded that Ukrainian forces continued to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people.
Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.
The U.S. State Department called on Putin and the Russian government to "immediately cease this bloodshed" and withdraw forces from Ukraine.
Russian businessman Roman Abramovich said he would sell London's Chelsea Football Club and donate money to help victims of the war in Ukraine.

     Sixers sign DeAndre Jordan as backup center, release Willie Cauley-Stein
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Sixers on Thursday night made DeAndre Jordan their latest addition in the search for backup center answers.
The team announced the signing of Jordan, who was waived Tuesday after playing in 32 games this season for the Lakers.
Harden assisted Jordan 50 times and the Texas A&amp;M product shot 76.1 percent off of his passes.
After acquiring Harden, the Sixers first used Paul Reed at backup center.
Now Jordan is another big man on board, and on another Rivers team aiming for a championship.

     Doc Rivers happy with Paul Millsap as backup big man for Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–As it stands right now, the Philadelphia 76ers will bring in DeAndre Jordan on a deal to be the new backup big man behind Joel Embiid.
After the Sixers moved Andre Drummond in the James Harden trade, they have been in need of his replacement.
Before the Sixers got Jordan, they had been relying on veteran Paul Millsap, and they still might go to Millsap as they move forward.
“He’s been another guy, he’s played three games (he’s played five) and knows every little of what we’re doing.
“He didn’t rebound tonight (Wednesday), but overall, I think he’s a physical player.

     “James came up to me,” Maxey said, “and asked me, was I going to play today?
“He shows up — it doesn’t matter whether it’s a back-to-back or not — he’s going to show up the next day at 8 in the morning.
He’s going to come in at night and get some work in.
It’s now obvious Harden wants to play an active role as the Sixers keep pushing Maxey to be a rim-attacking, foul-drawing, self-believing offensive weapon.
I’m going to be James Harden and that’s all I know how to be.”

     Embiid Reflects on 'The Process' and Burner Gate as Sixers Start New Chapter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Embiid could've been that guy, but a foot injury derailed his ride to becoming the top draft selection that offseason.
Reflecting on the Past"I've been through a lot," Embiid said on Wednesday night following a win over the New York Knicks in South Philly.
Now in his eighth year with the Sixers organization, Embiid has seen Sam Hinkie, Bryan Colangelo, Brett Brown (interim), Elton Brand, and now Daryl Morey run the team's front office.
He's also lost some of the players he's built a strong bond with over the years through trades and the free agency market.
"We've had so many people come in and out whether it's front office or players, coaches," Embiid continued.

     So they’re turning to the available free agent pool for former two-time All Defensive team member, DeAndre Jordan.
That implies a bunch of other teams didn’t want Jordan, or Jordan didn’t want them, or some combination thereof.
Barring an unlikely waiver claim before the 5 PM ET deadline today, center DeAndre Jordan is expected to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources tell ESPN.
But this franchise has a recent history of blowing the backup big minutes.

     PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers are off to a very good start to the James Harden era as they are sitting at 3-0 with the new superstar guard teaming up with Joel Embiid.
Embiid was already a dominant player before the Philadelphia debut of Harden and The Beard has made his life easier for the big fella.
He doesn’t have to do it all by himself anymore now that he has Harden next to him.
“We’re smart basketball players,” Embiid stated.
It’s about them, Tyrese (Maxey) and all the other guys, but he’s an extremely smart basketball player.
