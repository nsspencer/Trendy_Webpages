     Mayor of Ukraine's Kherson City Says Russian Troops in the Streets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, Igor Kolykhayev on Wednesday said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
Ukraine's government had earlier played down reports that Kherson had fallen into Russian hands, which would be the first sizeable city to do so since the invasion began last week.
Kolykhayev urged Russian soldiers not to shoot at civilians and publicly called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.
"We do not have the Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here!"

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

Scarred from a war for the last generation, locals are on edge as Russian forces encroach on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast.

     Russia Gains Strategic Advantage by Taking Southern City of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kherson, a key strategic point along the Black Sea, has been captured by Russia, making it the first major Ukrainian city to fall to invading Russian forces.
As the fighting raged into its seventh day, throngs of the Russian military were seen advancing upon the city of approximately 300,000 people.
The capture of Kherson represents a major strategic victory for the Russian army as it continues its efforts to annex Ukraine.
Kherson's fall comes as the Russian military continues an aggressive assault on another major Ukrainian metropolis—Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.
The continued assault could make Kharkiv the second major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands.

     "Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands."
"They (Russian military) started shooting from their BMP (military vehicle), towards the park in front of the post office in the centre of Borodyanka," said a Ukrainian man, who did not give his name.
Kherson's Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.
A second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on a ceasefire was expected after initial talks on Monday ended without agreement.
It also reported a strike on a radio and television centre in Kyiv, where Russian missiles hit a TV tower earlier this week.
