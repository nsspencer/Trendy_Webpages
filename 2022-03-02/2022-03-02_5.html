     Mayor of Ukraine's Kherson City Says Russian Troops in the Streets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, Igor Kolykhayev on Wednesday said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
Ukraine's government had earlier played down reports that Kherson had fallen into Russian hands, which would be the first sizeable city to do so since the invasion began last week.
Kolykhayev urged Russian soldiers not to shoot at civilians and publicly called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.
"We do not have the Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here!"

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Russia Gains Strategic Advantage by Taking Southern City of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kherson, a key strategic point along the Black Sea, has been captured by Russia, making it the first major Ukrainian city to fall to invading Russian forces.
As the fighting raged into its seventh day, throngs of the Russian military were seen advancing upon the city of approximately 300,000 people.
The capture of Kherson represents a major strategic victory for the Russian army as it continues its efforts to annex Ukraine.
Kherson's fall comes as the Russian military continues an aggressive assault on another major Ukrainian metropolis—Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.
The continued assault could make Kharkiv the second major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands.

     Russian troops enter strategic Ukrainian port of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia's defence ministry said it controlled Kherson on Wednesday but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded that Ukrainian forces continued to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterA Ukrainian delegation had left for a second round of talks with Russian officials on a ceasefire, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters.
"They (Russian military) started shooting from their BMP (military vehicle), towards the park in front of the post office in the centre of Borodyanka," said a Ukrainian man, who did not give his name.
Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.
Russia's attack has led to a barrage of international sanctions that threaten the global economic recovery from the COVID pandemic, and stoked fears of wider conflict as Western countries send arms to help the Ukrainian military.

     Russian Forces Claim to Have Conquered the City of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, which would make it the biggest city to fall yet in the invasion.
But a senior U.S. defense official disputed that.
“Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But the mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building.
Russian forces laid siege to two strategic Ukrainian seaports Wednesday and pressed their bombardment of the country's second-biggest city, while the huge armored column threatening Kyiv appeared stalled outside the capital.
