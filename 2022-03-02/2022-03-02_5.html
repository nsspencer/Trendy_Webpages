     LVIV, March 3 (Reuters) - Russian forces have occupied the regional administration building in Ukraine's port city of Kherson, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.
Russia's defence ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but Ukraine has said its forces continue to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people.

     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     From CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh in the Odessa region and Tim Lister in KyivA resident from the Ukrainian city of Kherson told Thursday that there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.
According to the local resident, the town is suffering a severe lack of food and medicine — particularly insulin — with pharmacies being looted.
The local resident also claimed that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.
The regional operational headquarters, which I lead, continues its work and addresses issues to help residents of the region.
Speaking to CNN, the Kherson resident said some locals had approached Russian soldiers in the city, who told them that they were from the Russian city of Voronezh and doubted they would leave the city alive.

     Late on Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
The major port of Odesa, Ukraine’s third-largest city, lies some 200km (124 miles) west of Kherson.
If Russian forces overtake Odesa, it would cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.

Nearby, the smaller towns of Berdyansk and Melitopol have also been taken and held by Russian forces.

     Kherson: Russian army moves to cut Ukraine’s access to sea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west.
The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond.
A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson.
Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city.
I just asked [them] not to shoot people.”Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko.

     Russian Troops Enter Strategic Ukrainian Port of Kherson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian troops were in the center of the Ukrainian port of Kherson on Thursday after a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had captured a major urban center for the first time in its eight-day invasion.
Russia's defense ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded that Ukrainian forces continued to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people.
Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.
The U.S. State Department called on Putin and the Russian government to "immediately cease this bloodshed" and withdraw forces from Ukraine.
Russian businessman Roman Abramovich said he would sell London's Chelsea Football Club and donate money to help victims of the war in Ukraine.

     PHILADELPHIA–The fan base of the Philadelphia 76ers is a passionate one.
That was the case on Wednesday night as fans lined the tunnel waiting for the arrival of James Harden to come out and show the fans what they have been waiting for.
The fans gave a big cheer as Harden came running out of the tunnel and onto the Wells Fargo Center court as if he was a little kid on the last day of school.
He then began his warm-ups and the crowd was in anticipation of every single jumper The Beard put up.
As he gets set to make his debut, the atmosphere promises to be a wild one at 7:30 p.m. EST:

     Sixers' Tobias Harris Reacts to Recent Struggles With Harden On Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When the Sixers landed Harden weeks ago at the trade deadline, they couldn't utilize him right away.
In the two games he played alongside Harden, Harris put up two points per game while shooting just 27-percent from the field.
Following Sunday's victory over the Knicks, Sixers coach Doc Rivers mentioned he's far from worried about Harris' lack of production.
However, he made it clear that winning games is first and foremost on his list of goals throughout the NBA season.
But if the Sixers are winning games, it's hard for anybody on the roster to be disgruntled.

     James Harden shines in Sixers home debut as Doc Rivers looks to make rotation decisions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Harden helped the 38-23 Sixers overcome a sluggish first half with 26 points, nine assists and nine rebounds Wednesday, while Embiid had 27 points and 12 rebounds.
It's safe to say Rivers is early in the process of putting together his playoff rotation.
The final spot, assuming Rivers goes with nine, could be determined between Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz.
Between Paul and Paul and Willie and if we get someone else — it may be a committee, which I can tell you upfront it's the last thing I want.
Rivers and the Sixers' goal is to win as many of them as possible while continuing to collect information that will result in determining the playoff rotation by mid-April.

     Sixers vs. Knicks: James Harden picks up a comeback win in home debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
The Sixers outscored the Knicks by two points in Millsap's second-half minutes, which felt like a huge win given the team's continued defensive shakiness.
Embiid grinned after seeing Maxey make a difficult three to extend the Sixers' lead to 112-99 in the fourth quarter.
Harden stared down a wide-open three to begin the third quarter but instead opted to hit Embiid in the paint.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.

     How Tyrese Maxey is preparing for a Sixers second half with James Harden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the blockbuster trade on Feb. 10 that sent ex-Net James Harden to the Sixers for Ben Simmons, Philadelphia head coach Doc Rivers gave a speech about staying focused on the present.
Maxey was just a few months into his rookie season when Philadelphia became embroiled in its saga with Simmons.
“We have a great group of guys, guys that really like each other, guys that get along, guys that want to play with each other and guys that want to win.
Harden joined a Philadelphia team that entered the All-Star break third in the East, where they remain, just 2 1/2 games behind the Heat and Bulls.
James Harden with the Philadelphia 76ers Getty ImagesJoel Embiid has kept the 76ers afloat with an MVP campaign-worthy effort this season, averaging 29.6 points and 11.2 rebounds per game.
