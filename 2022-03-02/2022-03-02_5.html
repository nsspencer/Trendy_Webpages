     First Ukraine City Falls as Russia Strikes More Civilian Targets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

     Too soon to declare that Ukraine's Kherson is in Russian hands, says U.S. official
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A military tank is seen on a street of Kherson, Ukraine March 1, 2022, in this screen grab from a video obtained by Reuters on March 2, 2022.
Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.
The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets.
British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace earlier on Thursday said Putin had deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine.
But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use."

     Why capturing Ukraine’s Kherson is important for Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Late on Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
The major port of Odesa, Ukraine’s third-largest city, lies some 200km (124 miles) west of Kherson.
If Russian forces overtake Odesa, it would cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.
Mariupol fightingSeparately, to the east of Kherson, Mariupol’s city council said Russian forces were constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure there.
Nearby, the smaller towns of Berdyansk and Melitopol have also been taken and held by Russian forces.

     Kherson: Russian army moves to cut Ukraine’s access to sea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west.
The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond.
A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson.
Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city.
I just asked [them] not to shoot people.”Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko.
