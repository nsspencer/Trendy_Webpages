     Michigan State basketball continues yo-yo season as Tom Izzo questions leadership again

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Each game for the past two months brings the same question: Which Michigan State basketball team will show up?
For every well-rounded win over Purdue and Wisconsin, there comes an equally comprehensive letdown at Iowa and Rutgers.
Fast starts followed by sluggish ones, gritty finishes becoming vanishing-act collapses from one game to the next.

Martelli talked about the streaky season for Michigan after the win over Michigan State.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Wolverines got back to their winning ways on Tuesday night with another requisite win over rival Michigan State 87-70.
They got to exact some revenge for the mistreatment that they incurred in East Lansing about a month ago and here are three takeaways from Michigan basketball’s win.
Tom Izzo refused to double team him and Dickinson took full advantage of the energy he brought to his teammates in the high stakes win.
Michigan State has nobody that can guard him as he proved in both contests this year.
Izzo took offense to it, but nothing arose from it.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.

I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life," Taylor said in an email to supporters.
"I want to apologize for the pain I have caused with my indiscretion, most of all to my wife Anne and our three daughters."
On Tuesday evening, he was forced into a May runoff with Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.

What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponents in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Rep. Van Taylor apologized Wednesday for an affair with an ex-jihadist dubbed the “ISIS bride” by British tabloids and abruptly dropped his bid for a third term, conceding the GOP runoff to rival Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.
Former President Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
The overwhelmingly Republican district includes Collin County, where Self served a dozen years as the top elected official, and much of Hunt County.
