     The North Texas congressman's announcement came the day after former Collin County Judge Keith Self forced Taylor into a runoff for the Republican nomination.
Taylor apologized for the affair in a statement shared with supporters Wednesday.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the newspaper.
Instead, the newspaper reported, Harp sent a supporter to interview the woman, then shared the interview with a pair of right-wing websites.
Toward the end of the affair with Taylor, Joya said she asked for help to pay off a credit card debt and some other bills.

     Rep. Van Taylor apologizes for affair with ‘ISIS bride,’ abruptly drops reelection bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Rep. Van Taylor apologized Wednesday for an affair with an ex-jihadist dubbed the “ISIS bride” by British tabloids and abruptly dropped his bid for a third term, conceding the GOP runoff to rival Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.
Former President Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
The overwhelmingly Republican district includes Collin County, where Self served a dozen years as the top elected official, and much of Hunt County.
