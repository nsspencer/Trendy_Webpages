     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor Admits to Having Affair, Ends Campaign – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) announced Wednesday that he was ending his campaign to seek reelection to Congress after admitting to infidelity.
The North Texas Republican announced his resignation in a letter to supporters where he apologized and admitted to having an affair with a Plano woman.
I am truly sorry, and I hope in time I can earn their forgiveness," Taylor said in his letter.
Taylor, a former Marine and Iraq war combat veteran, was considered one of the Texas delegation's most conservative members when he was elected in 2018.
"My response is that we need to be praying for Van and Anne and their girls.

     Texas Republican lawmaker suspends campaign after admitting to affair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Republican Rep. Van Taylor of Texas suspended his reelection campaign Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair, which he called the "greatest failure" of his life.
"About a year ago, I made a horrible mistake that has caused deep hurt and pain among those I love most in this world.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life," Taylor said in an email to supporters.
"I want to apologize for the pain I have caused with my indiscretion, most of all to my wife Anne and our three daughters."
On Tuesday evening, he was forced into a May runoff with Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rep. Van Taylor has apologized for an affair with the widow of an ISIS member from Texas and will halt his run for re-election, conceding the GOP runoff to former Collin County judge Keith Self, according to the Dallas Morning News.
What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponents in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

     Rep. Van Taylor apologizes for affair with ‘ISIS bride,’ abruptly drops reelection bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Rep. Van Taylor apologized Wednesday for an affair with an ex-jihadist dubbed the “ISIS bride” by British tabloids and abruptly dropped his bid for a third term, conceding the GOP runoff to rival Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.
Former President Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
The overwhelmingly Republican district includes Collin County, where Self served a dozen years as the top elected official, and much of Hunt County.
