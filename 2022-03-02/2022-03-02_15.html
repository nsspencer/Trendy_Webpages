     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.

     ANN ARBOR -- Last season, the Michigan men’s basketball team lived in a bubble.
This season, they’re on it.
Before Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, Michigan was the last team out of the NCAA Tournament field, per Jerry Palm’s projections at CBS Sports.
After the Wolverines’ 87-70 victory, they were back in the field.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s being called the biggest win of the season, the Bucks take down the Heat at Fiserv Forum, 120-119.
Excitement: When Khris Middleton dropped 21 points in the first half, including nine of the team’s 14 threes made in the first half.
Agony: Costly turnovers that Miami capitalized on scoring 21 points off of the Bucks 14 turnovers.
Jrue Holiday’s floater off the glass to secure one of, if not the biggest win of the regular season.

The Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat lit it up from 3-point land, which propelled a high scoring affairThe Bucks and Heat have both been known for letting it fly from downtown at a high rate over the past several seasons, and that tradition certainly carried on last night.

     What is the biggest area of concern for Milwaukee Bucks in the playoffs?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So I decided to see what the doom and gloom area of my brain thought about the Milwaukee Bucks.
Finding the biggest area of concern for the Milwaukee BucksWouldn’t it be funny if I just said “injuries” and that was the end of the article?
Sure, that is an area of concern but it is for literally every team.
Can they piece together enough good enough drop minutes in the playoffs with Lopez (assuming he isn’t at the same level as last year’s playoffs) and Ibaka?
A concern that others have that I don’t share as much for the playoffs is the lack of offense from the bench.

     Milwaukee vs. Miami: Bucks Pull Off Wild Comeback vs. Heat, 120-119
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fueled by lockdown defense down the stretch, the Bucks came back to knock off the Miami Heat, 120-119.
A buzzer-beater shot from Giannis would put the Bucks up by eight going into the second quarter.
Duncan Robinson would start to light it up from deep, which gave Miami the slight edge going into intermission, 66-64.
It’s not as if the Bucks’ defense was non-existent all evening.
It says a lot that despite the hot shooting from Miami, Milwaukee was able to weather the storm and pull off the comeback.

In the final seven minutes, Herro scored only two points and had three turnovers.
Then, as the clock wound down to two and a half minutes, Matthews again picked Herro up fullcourt and forced an over-and-back violation.
And finally, with less than 30 seconds to play, Matthews and Portis trapped Herro and created another turnover.

     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor Admits to Having Affair, Ends Campaign – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) announced Wednesday that he was ending his campaign to seek reelection to Congress after admitting to infidelity.
The North Texas Republican announced his resignation in a letter to supporters where he apologized and admitted to having an affair with a Plano woman.
I am truly sorry, and I hope in time I can earn their forgiveness," Taylor said in his letter.
Taylor, a former Marine and Iraq war combat veteran, was considered one of the Texas delegation's most conservative members when he was elected in 2018.
"My response is that we need to be praying for Van and Anne and their girls.

     Texas Republican lawmaker suspends campaign after admitting to affair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Republican Rep. Van Taylor of Texas suspended his reelection campaign Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair, which he called the "greatest failure" of his life.
"About a year ago, I made a horrible mistake that has caused deep hurt and pain among those I love most in this world.
I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life," Taylor said in an email to supporters.
"I want to apologize for the pain I have caused with my indiscretion, most of all to my wife Anne and our three daughters."
On Tuesday evening, he was forced into a May runoff with Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.

     Rep. Van Taylor apologizes for affair with ex-ISIS widow, drops out of runoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rep. Van Taylor has apologized for an affair with the widow of an ISIS member from Texas and will halt his run for re-election, conceding the GOP runoff to former Collin County judge Keith Self, according to the Dallas Morning News.
What happened: Tania Joya contacted Suzanne Harp, one of Taylor’s opponents in the primary, to share details of the affair.
Joya says she and Taylor met through her work helping reprogram extremists, per the Dallas Morning News.
“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that,” Joya told the paper.

     Rep. Van Taylor apologizes for affair with ‘ISIS bride,’ abruptly drops reelection bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Rep. Van Taylor apologized Wednesday for an affair with an ex-jihadist dubbed the “ISIS bride” by British tabloids and abruptly dropped his bid for a third term, conceding the GOP runoff to rival Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.
Former President Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
The overwhelmingly Republican district includes Collin County, where Self served a dozen years as the top elected official, and much of Hunt County.
