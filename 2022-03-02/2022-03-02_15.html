     U.S. Rep. Van Taylor Admits to Having Affair, Ends Campaign – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Representative Van Taylor (R-Plano) announced Wednesday that he was ending his campaign to seek reelection to Congress after admitting to infidelity.
The North Texas Republican announced his resignation in a letter to supporters where he apologized and admitted to having an affair with a Plano woman.
I am truly sorry, and I hope in time I can earn their forgiveness," Taylor said in his letter.
Taylor, a former Marine and Iraq war combat veteran, was considered one of the Texas delegation's most conservative members when he was elected in 2018.
"My response is that we need to be praying for Van and Anne and their girls.

     Texas Rep. Van Taylor drops reelection bid day after primary over affair with ‘ISIS bride’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just before Tuesday’s primary, the conservative news outlet National File revealed Taylor’s affair with British native Tania Joya – the widow of John Georgelas, an American who joined ISIS in 2013.
Taylor reportedly had the affair with Tania Joya — whose ex-husband joined ISIS in 2013.
Toward the end of their affair, Joya asked Taylor for help paying off some bills and she claimed he agreed and gave her $5,000, but only if she kept her mouth shut.
@RepVanTaylor/Twitter“All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya.
Taylor’s decision came a day after the Republican primary election in Texas.

     Rep. Van Taylor apologizes for affair with ‘ISIS bride,’ abruptly drops reelection bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Rep. Van Taylor apologized Wednesday for an affair with an ex-jihadist dubbed the “ISIS bride” by British tabloids and abruptly dropped his bid for a third term, conceding the GOP runoff to rival Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.
Former President Donald Trump snubbed four of those five, including Taylor, as he bestowed endorsements on 16 other Texas congressional incumbents.
Under Texas election law, Self will become the nominee as long as Taylor withdraws in writing to the state Republican Party chair.
“Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress,” Taylor wrote his supporters.
The overwhelmingly Republican district includes Collin County, where Self served a dozen years as the top elected official, and much of Hunt County.
