     Russia is waging war on Ukraine to destroy its democracy, its alignment with the West and the spirit of the Ukrainian people.
Again, make no mistake: Mr. Putin aims to advance this ideology by going for blood beyond Ukraine.
Mr. Putin’s forces will continue to terrorize the country to induce surrender.
Russian forces are experiencing fierce resistance from both the Armed Forces of Ukraine and from Ukrainian citizens hurling homemade Molotov cocktails that Ukraine’s government is encouraging them to make.
Even though Mr. Zelensky and I cannot be physically alongside every brave Ukrainian fighting for this country, our spirit is with them.

     Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky Series ‘Servant Of The People’ Sells To UK’s Channel 4 And Others
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global networks including the UK’s Channel 4 have picked up Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky’s comedy series Servant of the People.
Channel 4 will air the comedy from this Sunday along with documentary special Zelenskyy: The Man Who Took on Putin.
Eccho Rights has, meanwhile, removed all Russian-owned and produced series from its catalogue and donated €50,000 ($55,500) to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society.
“The series is a comedy but also an important document of where Zelenskiy comes from,” said Eccho Managing Partner Nicola Söderlund.
While the real world scenario facing Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people is far more grim and appalling than the comedy of the series, there are obvious parallels with the real world situation.”

Swedish television group Eccho Rights picked up the international rights to Servant of the People and licensed the series to Channel 4.
“Eccho Rights stands in solidarity with our friends and partners in Ukraine.
Eccho Rights is licensing all three seasons of Servant of the People as well as a feature film based on the show.

     An aide to the Ukrainian president warned in an op-ed that the Russia-Ukraine war may be a "prologue" to a "global massacre."

Yermak penned the op-ed from a bunker in Kyiv alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"We recognize that this would be a serious escalation in the war and that it could bring NATO into direct conflict with Russia," Yermak wrote.
"These measures would not be without cost to the world economy, but the alternative is far worse," Yermak wrote.

His quip turning down an evacuation offer from the United States (“I need ammunition, not a ride”) is already emblazoned on shirts, mugs, and flags for purchase on Etsy.
Treating Zelensky like a superhero—call it Marvelization—recasts a geopolitical conflict in which real people are really dying into entertainment, into content.
With Zelensky, the fandom sprouting up around him in the United States is especially dispiriting because the circumstances he is in are so relentlessly grim.
Zelensky, who played the Ukrainian president on television before he was elected, is an inherently likable figure.

     Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian turned statesman, has helped rally the world around his nation’s cause in the face of Vladimir Putin’s invasion.
Three days after Giuliani’s call, Zelensky was granted what turned out to be his infamous July 25 phone call with Trump.
The president left the call unsatisfied, which resulted in Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Zelensky for months afterward.
“You need Trump to like you, and you need this visit, but you also need to retain bipartisan support for Ukraine.
Maybe if Trump were still president, he would have held a grudge against Zelensky for not corruptly helping his campaign against Biden.
