     A military tank is seen on a street of Kherson, Ukraine March 1, 2022, in this screen grab from a video obtained by Reuters on March 2, 2022.
Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.
The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets.
British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace earlier on Thursday said Putin had deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine.
But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use."

     PHILADELPHIA–James Harden came to the Philadelphia 76ers with extremely high expectations.
The Sixers were already contenders before Harden, but now that they possess a talent such as he, it raised everything as the expectation now is to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.
This is a claim that he has denied since joining Philadelphia, but it is still a reputation that he carried with him.
Coach Doc Rivers has been impressed with the way Harden has allowed him to coach him and how he has been with his teammates:Editor’s note, Rivers’ comments were made before Wednesday’s game.
So this is before Harden’s third game with the team.

     TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo held a press conference Thursday to stand up for the “traditional practice of medicine.”The governor touted his fight against a range of COVID-19 mitigation tactics used widely across the nation — namely lock-downs, mask mandates, and vaccine requirements.
“People have lost their jobs over these policies,” DeSantis said.“People’s kids have lost access to education over these policies.”He added there was more that needed to be done to protect Floridians against “threats to freedom.”To do so, DeSantis said the Florida legislature is working to create the Free Speech of Health Care Practitioners Act, which would prohibit medical boards or the Department of Health from “reprimanding, sanctioning, or revoking or threatening to revoke license, certificate, or registration of health care practitioner for specified use of his or her right of free speech without specified proof.
“We’re here today to say ‘let’s get this thing across the finish line,'” DeSantis said.
“We want to make sure that people can exercise sound judgment, we want to make sure doctors can practice medicine and not just be genuflecting to whatever may come out from these agencies or professional bodies.”

     A Pentagon official said that Russian forces were suffering logistical problems, and warned that they were likely to become less precise in targeting their missile and artillery attacks as the fighting continues.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Wednesday that Russia had used thermobaric weapons — also known as vacuum bombs or fuel-air explosives — that can create enormous blasts and indiscriminate destruction.
The high-caliber weapons used by Russian forces left many of the dead in Kherson unrecognizable, said Mr. Kolykhaev, the mayor, so volunteers were burying them in mass graves.
A French official said the bloc would establish a hub in Poland for handling aid and weapons shipments.
Ukraine appealed to the United Nations and the Red Cross to establish a humanitarian corridor to ferry medical and other supplies into cities and civilians out, but said Russian forces had rebuffed the idea.

The Sixers quickly emerged as a front-runner to land Jordan after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him earlier this week, according to a report by ESPN.
Since then, Sixers coach Doc Rivers has been adamant that the Sixers would canvas the buyout market for a replacement.

     Florida governor Ron DeSantis has drawn outrage from parents after he was caught on camera berating teenagers in his state for wearing face masks to protect against Covid-19.
“It’s just shocking that the governor told these kids: ‘Take off your mask,’” Ms Marshall, who said she urges her son to cover his face at school, told WFLA.
“Can’t believe @GovRonDeSantis would belittle &amp; bully kids to take off their masks by calling them ‘ridiculous,’” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted.
Breathe free, feel safe and be happy.”She also accused those who force children to wear masks of being the real bullies.

     The Sixers on Thursday night made DeAndre Jordan their latest addition in the search for backup center answers.
The team announced the signing of Jordan, who was waived Tuesday after playing in 32 games this season for the Lakers.
Harden assisted Jordan 50 times and the Texas A&amp;M product shot 76.1 percent off of his passes.
After acquiring Harden, the Sixers first used Paul Reed at backup center.
Now Jordan is another big man on board, and on another Rivers team aiming for a championship.

     Ron DeSantis admonished a group of high school students for wearing face masks at an indoor news conference Wednesday, saying it was time to stop what he called “this COVID theater."
The Republican governor approached the students and asked them to remove their masks as they waited for him at the press event at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
One of the students, 14-year-old Kevin Brown Jr., a high school freshman, told The Associated Press he was caught off-guard by DeSantis and felt pressured to removed his mask.
We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district," Davis said.
Though the CDC late last month eased its masking guidelines, the agency is still recommending masks indoors in areas it considers high risk.

If Russian forces overtake Odesa, it would cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.

     Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west.
The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond.
A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson.
Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city.
I just asked [them] not to shoot people.”Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko.

     Embiid Reflects on 'The Process' and Burner Gate as Sixers Start New Chapter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Embiid could've been that guy, but a foot injury derailed his ride to becoming the top draft selection that offseason.
Reflecting on the Past"I've been through a lot," Embiid said on Wednesday night following a win over the New York Knicks in South Philly.
Now in his eighth year with the Sixers organization, Embiid has seen Sam Hinkie, Bryan Colangelo, Brett Brown (interim), Elton Brand, and now Daryl Morey run the team's front office.
He's also lost some of the players he's built a strong bond with over the years through trades and the free agency market.
"We've had so many people come in and out whether it's front office or players, coaches," Embiid continued.

     Sixers vs. Knicks: James Harden picks up a comeback win in home debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     His straight-line drives have been explosive, and he was determined Wednesday to play through contact and ensure a home debut win.
Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
Maxey, Embiid and Harden have averaged 84.7 points per game, which is the biggest reason why the negatives outlined above haven't been costly.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.
“I continue to tell Jo, he’s so used to dribbling it up and having to go one-on-one, which he’s great at," Harden said.

     Sixers sign former All-Star DeAndre Jordan, waive Willie Cauley-Stein
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So they’re turning to the available free agent pool for former two-time All Defensive team member, DeAndre Jordan.
That implies a bunch of other teams didn’t want Jordan, or Jordan didn’t want them, or some combination thereof.
Barring an unlikely waiver claim before the 5 PM ET deadline today, center DeAndre Jordan is expected to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources tell ESPN.
But this franchise has a recent history of blowing the backup big minutes.
