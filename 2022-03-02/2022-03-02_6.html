That was the narrative, anyway, right?

But then that minimizes a few things we saw as U-M rolled over MSU at Crisler Center, 87-70.

     ANN ARBOR -- Last season, the Michigan men’s basketball team lived in a bubble.
This season, they’re on it.
Before Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, Michigan was the last team out of the NCAA Tournament field, per Jerry Palm’s projections at CBS Sports.
After the Wolverines’ 87-70 victory, they were back in the field.

     Michigan Basketball: 3 things we learned from win over MSU

     Final Michigan State Spartans 70 Michigan Wolverines 87Michigan basketball toppled Michigan State on Tuesday night and here are three things that we learned from the Wolverines win.
Going into Tuesday’s game against Michigan State, it really felt like the season was on the line for the Wolverines.
The Wolverines were projected in the field by Joe Lunardi of ESPN prior to the win and this should give them a little bump.
But first, let’s take a look back at three things we learned in Michigan basketball’s massive win over Michigan State on Tuesday night.
This time around, Dickinson made Izzo pay, and the Spartans inability to guard Dickinson is the main reason they lost.

     But since then, Martelli and the Wolverines found a new gear and took down in-state rival Michigan State Tuesday night.
Hunter Dickinson was the star of the show and the Wolverines were never really in position to lose the game.
Martelli talked about the streaky season for Michigan after the win over Michigan State.
“Tomorrow I'm going to address it.
Tomorrow, I'm going to do a little bit more, and some of the guys that didn't play a lot of minutes are going to get a sweat tomorrow.

     Michigan basketball: Takeaways from dominant win over Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tuesday night, Michigan basketball squared off against Michigan State in a thrilling in-state rivalry game that was crucial for both teams.
Following the Wolverines’ loss to Illinois on Sunday, Michigan needed to add another win to their resume for their tournament hopes.
Michigan basketball also looked for a measure of revenge against the neighboring Spartans, who defeated the Wolverines earlier this season.
Since taking over as head coach, Michigan basketball is now 2-1.
So far, Martelli has a nine-point win over Rutgers and a 17-point win over Michigan State — both enormous wins for Michigan heading into tournament season.

     Ann Arbor, Mich. — Hunter Dickinson had his most productive game in a Michigan uniform as his 33 points powered the Wolverines over Michigan State on Tuesday night at the Crisler Center.
Nah, not for me,” Martelli said, explaining that he asked Dickinson to let his play do the talking.
I remember after the game at Michigan State, Coach Izzo had a lot to say to me — a lot of good things.
On if he can repeat any of what he was saying to Michigan State:Freshman Hunter would’ve said.
Nah, nah, nah.

     Takeaways from Michigan’s thrashing of Michigan State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan Wolverines put on one of their best performances of the year when they needed it most, thrashing the Michigan State Spartans, 87-70.
Every time Michigan State tried to make some semblance of a run, a few buckets from Dickinson would instantly swing momentum back in the Wolverines favor.
It’s pretty hard to lose when you make 61% of your shots in the first half and 58% of your shots all game.
After not showing up in too many games this year, Caleb Houstan came to play by scoring 16 points, including a few buckets at the start of the second half that thwarted any chance of a Michigan State comeback.
23 Ohio State on Sunday,If the Wolverines manage to win both those games, it will be pretty hard to keep them out of the NCAA Tournament.
