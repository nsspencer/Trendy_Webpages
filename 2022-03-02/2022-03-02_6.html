     Why Playing Euphoria's Cassie Is Therapeutic For Sydney Sweeney
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Why Playing Euphoria's Cassie Is Therapeutic For Sydney Sweeney"Euphoria" star Sydney Sweeney is ready to take over your screens.
She was eerily convincing in her role as child-bride Eden in "Handmaid's Tale", and blew audiences away in HBO's satirical drama "The White Lotus," per IMDb.
However, it's her role as cheerleader Cassie Howard in "Euphoria" that's making the most noise.
Not only has this allowed her to flourish on our screens as Cassie, but it's allowed her to put things into perspective in a new way.
Though the role comes with a lot of eyes on Sweeney, it's empowered the actress to come to terms with her self-confidence and self-worth.

The nudity was — it was tough for me because I’m, you know, I’m not really… I’m just not comfortable like that publicly.

     Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney criticizes gendered "double standards" for nude scenes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sydney Sweeney has commented on the gendered double standards that she feels still exist between men and women when it comes to nude scenes.
"There are hour-long compilations of world-famous male actors with nude scenes who win Oscars and get praised for that work.
Sweeney is best known for playing Cassie in Euphoria, as well as her role as Olivia in The White Lotus season 1.
"I don’t think as many people took me seriously in Euphoria because I took my shirt off," Sweeney said.
When I get tagged in Cassie’s or Pippa from [Prime Video movie] The Voyeurs’ nudes, it feels like me looking at their nudes, not Sydney’s nudes.

     Sydney Sweeney From Euphoria Dyed Her Hair Copper Red
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alert: Sydney Sweeney no longer has Cassie's blonde hair.
And it seems Sweeney has also taken the advantage of the Euphoria break by dyeing her hair from golden blonde to a lush copper red.
The newly redhead Sydney Sweeney was spotted on Monday, February 28, in Los Angeles.
While Sydney Sweeney is associated with blonde, this is not the first time she's experimented with her hair color.
In February a Sydney Sweeney fan account tweeted old photos of the star with dark brown hair, back before she was famous.
