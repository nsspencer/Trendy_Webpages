     Sixers' Doc Rivers opens up on what it's like to coach James Harden

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–James Harden came to the Philadelphia 76ers with extremely high expectations.
The Sixers were already contenders before Harden, but now that they possess a talent such as he, it raised everything as the expectation now is to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.
This is a claim that he has denied since joining Philadelphia, but it is still a reputation that he carried with him.
Coach Doc Rivers has been impressed with the way Harden has allowed him to coach him and how he has been with his teammates:Editor’s note, Rivers’ comments were made before Wednesday’s game.
So this is before Harden’s third game with the team.

     TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo held a press conference Thursday to stand up for the “traditional practice of medicine.”The governor touted his fight against a range of COVID-19 mitigation tactics used widely across the nation — namely lock-downs, mask mandates, and vaccine requirements.
“People have lost their jobs over these policies,” DeSantis said.“People’s kids have lost access to education over these policies.”He added there was more that needed to be done to protect Floridians against “threats to freedom.”To do so, DeSantis said the Florida legislature is working to create the Free Speech of Health Care Practitioners Act, which would prohibit medical boards or the Department of Health from “reprimanding, sanctioning, or revoking or threatening to revoke license, certificate, or registration of health care practitioner for specified use of his or her right of free speech without specified proof.
“We’re here today to say ‘let’s get this thing across the finish line,'” DeSantis said.
“We want to make sure that people can exercise sound judgment, we want to make sure doctors can practice medicine and not just be genuflecting to whatever may come out from these agencies or professional bodies.”

     Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan dunks over Charlotte Hornets center Mason Plumlee in the first quarter at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021.

The Sixers quickly emerged as a front-runner to land Jordan after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him earlier this week, according to a report by ESPN.
Since then, Sixers coach Doc Rivers has been adamant that the Sixers would canvas the buyout market for a replacement.
The 37-year-old Millsap has been the Sixers’ backup center the past four games with mediocre-at-best results, averaging 4.4 points and 2.8 rebounds in 11.2 minutes.

     Florida governor Ron DeSantis has drawn outrage from parents after he was caught on camera berating teenagers in his state for wearing face masks to protect against Covid-19.
“It’s just shocking that the governor told these kids: ‘Take off your mask,’” Ms Marshall, who said she urges her son to cover his face at school, told WFLA.
“Can’t believe @GovRonDeSantis would belittle &amp; bully kids to take off their masks by calling them ‘ridiculous,’” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding tweeted.
Breathe free, feel safe and be happy.”She also accused those who force children to wear masks of being the real bullies.
It is a student and parents’ choice to protect their health in a way they feel most appropriate.

     Ron DeSantis admonished a group of high school students for wearing face masks at an indoor news conference Wednesday, saying it was time to stop what he called “this COVID theater."
The Republican governor approached the students and asked them to remove their masks as they waited for him at the press event at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
One of the students, 14-year-old Kevin Brown Jr., a high school freshman, told The Associated Press he was caught off-guard by DeSantis and felt pressured to removed his mask.
We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district," Davis said.
Though the CDC late last month eased its masking guidelines, the agency is still recommending masks indoors in areas it considers high risk.

     Governor Ron DeSantis is now fundraising off a video showing him barking at Florida students for having the gall to wear a mask near him during a pandemic.
So if you wanna wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”NEW: @GovRonDeSantis annoyed with USF students— "You do not have to wear those masks.
Seven of the children at the speech were from Middleton High School in Tampa, the Hillsborough School District told WFLA.
DeSantis to ask her son &amp; the other high school students to take off their masks.
Each individual’s decision should be respected.”DeSantis clearly did not seem to have much respect for the students who decided to wear masks.

     James Harden 'very vocal' from the jump with Sixers, pushing Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “James came up to me,” Maxey said, “and asked me, was I going to play today?
“He shows up — it doesn’t matter whether it’s a back-to-back or not — he’s going to show up the next day at 8 in the morning.
He’s going to come in at night and get some work in.
It’s now obvious Harden wants to play an active role as the Sixers keep pushing Maxey to be a rim-attacking, foul-drawing, self-believing offensive weapon.
I’m going to be James Harden and that’s all I know how to be.”

     Embiid Reflects on 'The Process' and Burner Gate as Sixers Start New Chapter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Embiid could've been that guy, but a foot injury derailed his ride to becoming the top draft selection that offseason.
Reflecting on the Past"I've been through a lot," Embiid said on Wednesday night following a win over the New York Knicks in South Philly.
Now in his eighth year with the Sixers organization, Embiid has seen Sam Hinkie, Bryan Colangelo, Brett Brown (interim), Elton Brand, and now Daryl Morey run the team's front office.
He's also lost some of the players he's built a strong bond with over the years through trades and the free agency market.
"We've had so many people come in and out whether it's front office or players, coaches," Embiid continued.

     Sixers vs. Knicks: James Harden picks up a comeback win in home debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     His straight-line drives have been explosive, and he was determined Wednesday to play through contact and ensure a home debut win.
Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
Maxey, Embiid and Harden have averaged 84.7 points per game, which is the biggest reason why the negatives outlined above haven't been costly.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.
“I continue to tell Jo, he’s so used to dribbling it up and having to go one-on-one, which he’s great at," Harden said.

     So they’re turning to the available free agent pool for former two-time All Defensive team member, DeAndre Jordan.
That implies a bunch of other teams didn’t want Jordan, or Jordan didn’t want them, or some combination thereof.
Barring an unlikely waiver claim before the 5 PM ET deadline today, center DeAndre Jordan is expected to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources tell ESPN.
But this franchise has a recent history of blowing the backup big minutes.
