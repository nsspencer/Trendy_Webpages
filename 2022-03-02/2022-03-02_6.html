     Sixers' Doc Rivers opens up on what it's like to coach James Harden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–James Harden came to the Philadelphia 76ers with extremely high expectations.
The Sixers were already contenders before Harden, but now that they possess a talent such as he, it raised everything as the expectation now is to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.
This is a claim that he has denied since joining Philadelphia, but it is still a reputation that he carried with him.
Coach Doc Rivers has been impressed with the way Harden has allowed him to coach him and how he has been with his teammates:Editor’s note, Rivers’ comments were made before Wednesday’s game.
So this is before Harden’s third game with the team.

     Sixers to Sign Former Lakers Center DeAndre Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Philadelphia 76ers plan to sign former Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan for the rest of the season, a source confirms to Sports Illustrated on Thursday.
Jordan, a 33-year-old veteran, joins the Sixers after a short-lived stint with the Lakers.
In 32 games with the Lakers, the veteran center averaged four points and five rebounds while playing 12 minutes per game.
"We wish DeAndre well," said Vogel on Tuesday night ahead of Los Angeles' matchup against the Dallas Mavericks.
The Lakers needed a guard, Jordan needed to move on, and now the Sixers need another big to backup their All-Star center, Joel Embiid.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kanye West—who also goes by “Ye” these days—had found his latest muse in his new girlfriend.
On Wednesday, March 1, West posted a screenshot from popular gossip account The Shade Room to his own grid.
(You can see the original Shade Room post here, since Ye tends to not leave his content up for very long.)
It contains two paparazzi pictures of Jones and West in all-black ensembles walking and then embracing.
But regardless of being West's GF or KK's lookalike, Jones is of course her own person.

     Sixers sign DeAndre Jordan as another backup center option for thin frontcourt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan dunks over Charlotte Hornets center Mason Plumlee in the first quarter at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021.
Read moreAfter clearing waivers, veteran center DeAndre Jordan has officially signed with the 76ers, the team announced Thursday night.
The Sixers quickly emerged as a front-runner to land Jordan after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him earlier this week, according to a report by ESPN.
Since then, Sixers coach Doc Rivers has been adamant that the Sixers would canvas the buyout market for a replacement.
The 37-year-old Millsap has been the Sixers’ backup center the past four games with mediocre-at-best results, averaging 4.4 points and 2.8 rebounds in 11.2 minutes.

     Inside Kanye West's Romance With 'Muse' Chaney Jones: Details
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kanye West has been spotted with Chaney Jones several times since his split from Julia Fox, but they’re not getting serious — yet.
“They’re not exclusive,” an insider exclusively tells Us Weekly of the rapper, 44, and the model, 24.
At the time, the “Famous” artist was still dating Fox, 32, whom he met on New Year’s Eve 2021.
According to the first insider, their similarities are one reason for West’s interest in Jones.
“He would pick Kim over anyone but since they’re no longer dating, he’s doing the next best thing — creating another Kim Kardashian,” the insider tells Us.

     James Harden 'very vocal' from the jump with Sixers, pushing Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “James came up to me,” Maxey said, “and asked me, was I going to play today?
“He shows up — it doesn’t matter whether it’s a back-to-back or not — he’s going to show up the next day at 8 in the morning.
He’s going to come in at night and get some work in.
It’s now obvious Harden wants to play an active role as the Sixers keep pushing Maxey to be a rim-attacking, foul-drawing, self-believing offensive weapon.
I’m going to be James Harden and that’s all I know how to be.”

     Embiid Reflects on 'The Process' and Burner Gate as Sixers Start New Chapter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Embiid could've been that guy, but a foot injury derailed his ride to becoming the top draft selection that offseason.
Reflecting on the Past"I've been through a lot," Embiid said on Wednesday night following a win over the New York Knicks in South Philly.
Now in his eighth year with the Sixers organization, Embiid has seen Sam Hinkie, Bryan Colangelo, Brett Brown (interim), Elton Brand, and now Daryl Morey run the team's front office.
He's also lost some of the players he's built a strong bond with over the years through trades and the free agency market.
"We've had so many people come in and out whether it's front office or players, coaches," Embiid continued.

     Sixers vs. Knicks: James Harden picks up a comeback win in home debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     His straight-line drives have been explosive, and he was determined Wednesday to play through contact and ensure a home debut win.
Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
Maxey, Embiid and Harden have averaged 84.7 points per game, which is the biggest reason why the negatives outlined above haven't been costly.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.
“I continue to tell Jo, he’s so used to dribbling it up and having to go one-on-one, which he’s great at," Harden said.

     Sixers sign former All-Star DeAndre Jordan, waive Willie Cauley-Stein
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So they’re turning to the available free agent pool for former two-time All Defensive team member, DeAndre Jordan.
That implies a bunch of other teams didn’t want Jordan, or Jordan didn’t want them, or some combination thereof.
Barring an unlikely waiver claim before the 5 PM ET deadline today, center DeAndre Jordan is expected to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources tell ESPN.
But this franchise has a recent history of blowing the backup big minutes.
