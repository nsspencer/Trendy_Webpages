     AOC criticizes Biden for 'glossing over' some issues in State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     articleU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, blasted President Joe Biden's State of the Union address for leaving out key issues to his voting base.
Biden's first State of the Union, which lasted just over one hour, touted his administration's and European allies' crackdown against Russia.
Ocasio-Cortez went on MSNBC Tuesday evening and criticized Biden for "gloss[ing] over" issues such as the "crisis in education," student loan debt and immigration.

     AOC underwhelmed by Biden’s SOTU speech, says he should have pushed more social welfare programs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was left unsatisfied by President Biden’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday, saying he should have emphasized the need to pass more social welfare programs such as student debt relief.
They have pushed Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress to embrace a more far-reaching package of government social welfare programs.
Ms. Tlaib gave a liberal response to both Mr. Biden’s address, and the GOP response delivered by Iowa Gov.
Mr. Biden focused his speech on the war in Ukraine, bipartisanship and mitigating the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also briefly touched later in his speech on issues such as immigration, inflation and his upcoming legislative agenda.

     AOC calls out student-loan forgiveness as one of the issues 'left unsaid' during Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AOC called out Biden's failure to mention student debt during the State of the Union on Tuesday.
She said it was among the issues important to Democratic constituencies that were "left unsaid."
Biden extended the student-loan payment pause through May 1 but hasn't commented on broad relief.
While Biden recently extended the pause on payments a third time, through May 1, his campaign pledge to cancel student debt broadly remains unfulfilled.
Lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez have consistently warned that failure to deliver on progressive priorities for voters, like student debt relief, could cost Democrats the majority in Congress.

She said it “definitely was a lost opportunity” to not push harder to leave the use of oil behind.
“But we really need to hear more, I think, about mass transit, trains, high-speed rail and renewable energy,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez said.
“First and foremost, I think the world is watching, and many immigrants and refugees are watching,” she said.
“How the world treats ... Ukrainian refugees should be how we are treating all refugees in the United States.”“The way that the world treated Syrian refugees versus how the world is greeting Ukrainian refugees is a very stark contrast,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez added.

     (Jordan Vonderhaar/Reuters )Responding to President Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that Biden did not go far enough in committing to her progressive agenda.
AdvertisementAdvertisementOn certain issues, such as immigration, Biden wasn’t nearly as radical and accommodative as he should have been, AOC said.
Biden didn’t dedicate enough time in the speech to climate change and the importance of weaning America off fossil fuels, AOC suggested.
But we really need to hear more, I think, about mass transit, trains, high-speed rail and renewable energy,” she said.
“Squad” member Representative Cori Bush slammed Biden’s pro-law enforcement statement on social media: “With all due respect, Mr. President.
