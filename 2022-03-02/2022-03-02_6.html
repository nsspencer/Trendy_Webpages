     PHILADELPHIA–James Harden came to the Philadelphia 76ers with extremely high expectations.
The Sixers were already contenders before Harden, but now that they possess a talent such as he, it raised everything as the expectation now is to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.
This is a claim that he has denied since joining Philadelphia, but it is still a reputation that he carried with him.
Coach Doc Rivers has been impressed with the way Harden has allowed him to coach him and how he has been with his teammates:Editor’s note, Rivers’ comments were made before Wednesday’s game.
So this is before Harden’s third game with the team.

     Sixers to Sign Former Lakers Center DeAndre Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Philadelphia 76ers plan to sign former Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan for the rest of the season, a source confirms to Sports Illustrated on Thursday.
Jordan, a 33-year-old veteran, joins the Sixers after a short-lived stint with the Lakers.
In 32 games with the Lakers, the veteran center averaged four points and five rebounds while playing 12 minutes per game.
"We wish DeAndre well," said Vogel on Tuesday night ahead of Los Angeles' matchup against the Dallas Mavericks.
The Lakers needed a guard, Jordan needed to move on, and now the Sixers need another big to backup their All-Star center, Joel Embiid.

Read moreAfter clearing waivers, veteran center DeAndre Jordan has officially signed with the 76ers, the team announced Thursday night.
The Sixers quickly emerged as a front-runner to land Jordan after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him earlier this week, according to a report by ESPN.
Since then, Sixers coach Doc Rivers has been adamant that the Sixers would canvas the buyout market for a replacement.
The 37-year-old Millsap has been the Sixers’ backup center the past four games with mediocre-at-best results, averaging 4.4 points and 2.8 rebounds in 11.2 minutes.

     The Sixers on Thursday night made DeAndre Jordan their latest addition in the search for backup center answers.
The team announced the signing of Jordan, who was waived Tuesday after playing in 32 games this season for the Lakers.
Harden assisted Jordan 50 times and the Texas A&amp;M product shot 76.1 percent off of his passes.
After acquiring Harden, the Sixers first used Paul Reed at backup center.
Now Jordan is another big man on board, and on another Rivers team aiming for a championship.

Embiid was already a dominant player before the Philadelphia debut of Harden and The Beard has made his life easier for the big fella.
He doesn’t have to do it all by himself anymore now that he has Harden next to him.
“We’re smart basketball players,” Embiid stated.

Now in his eighth year with the Sixers organization, Embiid has seen Sam Hinkie, Bryan Colangelo, Brett Brown (interim), Elton Brand, and now Daryl Morey run the team's front office.
He's also lost some of the players he's built a strong bond with over the years through trades and the free agency market.
"We've had so many people come in and out whether it's front office or players, coaches," Embiid continued.

     His straight-line drives have been explosive, and he was determined Wednesday to play through contact and ensure a home debut win.
Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
Maxey, Embiid and Harden have averaged 84.7 points per game, which is the biggest reason why the negatives outlined above haven't been costly.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.
“I continue to tell Jo, he’s so used to dribbling it up and having to go one-on-one, which he’s great at," Harden said.

That implies a bunch of other teams didn’t want Jordan, or Jordan didn’t want them, or some combination thereof.
Barring an unlikely waiver claim before the 5 PM ET deadline today, center DeAndre Jordan is expected to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources tell ESPN.
But this franchise has a recent history of blowing the backup big minutes.
