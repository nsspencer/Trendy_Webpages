     PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers returned home on Wednesday with the anticipation of James Harden’s home debut.
The Beard had already played in two road games for Philadelphia, but the Wells Fargo Center awaited him as the team played host to the New York Knicks.

Tyrese Maxey had 25 points, Tobias Harris added 14 and seven rebounds, Matisse Thybulle added 10 and three blocks, and Shake Milton and Georges Niang hopped off the bench and had six points each.

     Will Sixers Utilize Willie Cauley-Stein More in Upcoming Games?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Simmons wasn't a big loss considering he missed every game this season and didn't plan to play for the Sixers again.
Therefore, the Sixers are currently offering a veteran big man a tryout right now.
Last week, the Sixers signed Willie Cauley-Stein to a ten-day deal.
However, the veteran big man appeared on the court in the fourth quarter of last Friday's game for four minutes.
Although Cauley-Stein didn't play in New York this past weekend, perhaps he'll get an opportunity to do something when the Sixers host the Knicks in South Philly.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Harden, left, of the Sixers jokes with new teammate Matisse Thybulle before their game at the Wells Fargo Center on Feb. 15, 2022.
Starting wing Matisse Thybulle said after Wednesday’s shootaround that Harden has “inspired a lot of people … just [with] the energy, the talk” since joining the Sixers less than three weeks ago.
“The camaraderie has grown just from his presence alone, just because of the amount of passion he plays with,” Thybulle said of Harden.
And it trickles down to everybody.”That approach has carried over to the court, where Thybulle said he has most felt Harden’s impact in the Sixers’ uptick in pace.
Simmons has not played at all this season after sitting out his time on the Sixers’ following a trade demand.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Defensive problems in non-Embiid minutesThe game seriously soured for the Sixers when Embiid headed to the bench.
The Sixers outscored the Knicks by two points in Millsap's second-half minutes, which felt like a huge win given the team's continued defensive shakiness.
Embiid grinned after seeing Maxey make a difficult three to extend the Sixers' lead to 112-99 in the fourth quarter.
Harden stared down a wide-open three to begin the third quarter but instead opted to hit Embiid in the paint.
Embiid then drained a three assisted by Harden on the Sixers’ next possession and the team’s deficit was suddenly just one point.

That was the case on Wednesday night as fans lined the tunnel waiting for the arrival of James Harden to come out and show the fans what they have been waiting for.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the blockbuster trade on Feb. 10 that sent ex-Net James Harden to the Sixers for Ben Simmons, Philadelphia head coach Doc Rivers gave a speech about staying focused on the present.
Maxey was just a few months into his rookie season when Philadelphia became embroiled in its saga with Simmons.
“We have a great group of guys, guys that really like each other, guys that get along, guys that want to play with each other and guys that want to win.
Harden joined a Philadelphia team that entered the All-Star break third in the East, where they remain, just 2 1/2 games behind the Heat and Bulls.

     James Harden shines in Sixers home debut as Doc Rivers looks to make rotation decisions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Harden helped the 38-23 Sixers overcome a sluggish first half with 26 points, nine assists and nine rebounds Wednesday, while Embiid had 27 points and 12 rebounds.
It's safe to say Rivers is early in the process of putting together his playoff rotation.
The final spot, assuming Rivers goes with nine, could be determined between Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz.
Between Paul and Paul and Willie and if we get someone else — it may be a committee, which I can tell you upfront it's the last thing I want.
Rivers and the Sixers' goal is to win as many of them as possible while continuing to collect information that will result in determining the playoff rotation by mid-April.
