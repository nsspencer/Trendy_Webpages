     Stanford goalkeeper Katie Meyer found dead in on-campus residence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Katie Meyer, a senior goalkeeper on the Stanford women’s soccer team, was found dead in an on-campus residence on Tuesday, the school announced.
No cause of death was given and calls by USA TODAY Sports to Stanford University and the Santa Clara County (California) Sheriff's Department were not returned.
Meyer, 22 and a team captain, led the Cardinal to the 2019 championship after making two saves in a penalty shootout against North Carolina to secure the team's third national title.
She also helped the Cardinal to the 2019 Pac-12 title.
"Katie was extraordinarily committed to everything and everyone in her world.

     Newbury Park High graduate Katie Meyer was found dead in her dorm room on the campus of Stanford University on Tuesday, the school has announced.
Meyer, a goalie, rose to national prominence as the heroine of Stanford’s NCAA women’s soccer national championship team in 2019, when she saved two penalty kicks in the decisive shootout against North Carolina.
The Star All-County selection was a 4.3 GPA student at Newbury Park, a U.S. youth international and also kicked on the Panthers football team.
Former Moorpark High and Washington state goalkeeper Courtney Worstell played against Meyer on the club, high school and collegiate levels.
“The thoughts and hearts of the entire U.S. Soccer Federation are with the family, friends, teammates and loved ones of Katie Meyer,” U.S. Soccer posted.

     Stanford announced Wednesday that the undergraduate student who died Tuesday was Katie Meyer, a goalkeeper and captain for the Cardinal women’s soccer team.
Meyer was found dead in her on-campus residence on Tuesday, which the university initially reported without identifying the student.
Meyer was twice a team captain for Stanford and twice named to the Pac-12’s academic honor roll.
Meyer grew up in Newbury Park in Ventura County, about an hour northwest of Los Angeles.
“She will always be a true Panther and showed her great character both on the soccer field, football field and on campus,” Newbury Park football coach Joe Smigiel tweeted.
