     PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers returned home on Wednesday with the anticipation of James Harden’s home debut.
The Beard had already played in two road games for Philadelphia, but the Wells Fargo Center awaited him as the team played host to the New York Knicks.
Joel Embiid had himself another big night with 27 points and 12 rebounds and Harden had 26, nine assists, and nine rebounds.
Tyrese Maxey had 25 points, Tobias Harris added 14 and seven rebounds, Matisse Thybulle added 10 and three blocks, and Shake Milton and Georges Niang hopped off the bench and had six points each.

     76ers legendary guard Allen Iverson has dubbed Philadelphia the best crowd of fans to play in front of many times throughout his career and beyond.
And he's excited that another NBA superstar will find out firsthand what it's like to play in front of Sixers fans.
Last Friday, as the Sixers faced the Minnesota Timberwolves coming back from the All-Star break, Harden made his Philadelphia debut.
After playing in the last two games against the Timberwolves and the New York Knicks, Harden will now make his home debut -- and Iverson welcomes him "home."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–The fan base of the Philadelphia 76ers is a passionate one.
That was the case on Wednesday night as fans lined the tunnel waiting for the arrival of James Harden to come out and show the fans what they have been waiting for.
The fans gave a big cheer as Harden came running out of the tunnel and onto the Wells Fargo Center court as if he was a little kid on the last day of school.
He then began his warm-ups and the crowd was in anticipation of every single jumper The Beard put up.
As he gets set to make his debut, the atmosphere promises to be a wild one at 7:30 p.m. EST:

     Will Sixers Utilize Willie Cauley-Stein More in Upcoming Games?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Simmons wasn't a big loss considering he missed every game this season and didn't plan to play for the Sixers again.
Therefore, the Sixers are currently offering a veteran big man a tryout right now.
Last week, the Sixers signed Willie Cauley-Stein to a ten-day deal.
However, the veteran big man appeared on the court in the fourth quarter of last Friday's game for four minutes.
Although Cauley-Stein didn't play in New York this past weekend, perhaps he'll get an opportunity to do something when the Sixers host the Knicks in South Philly.

     Early trade overreaction: Sixers are winning the NBA championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The new-look Sixers, featuring the dynamic duo of Joel Embiid and James Harden, have played just two games together yet they look like a championship-caliber team.
I was in attendance at Madison Square Garden on Sunday and there were as many Sixers fans as Knicks fans, if not more.
This is the first time since the Allen Iverson teams of the early 2000s that it genuinely feels like this team can win the NBA Championship.
This Sixers team is legit.
And as long as we stay healthy, the Championship trophy has a real shot to come to Philly this season.

     Matisse Thybulle says James Harden has ‘inspired’ Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Harden, left, of the Sixers jokes with new teammate Matisse Thybulle before their game at the Wells Fargo Center on Feb. 15, 2022.
Starting wing Matisse Thybulle said after Wednesday’s shootaround that Harden has “inspired a lot of people … just [with] the energy, the talk” since joining the Sixers less than three weeks ago.
“The camaraderie has grown just from his presence alone, just because of the amount of passion he plays with,” Thybulle said of Harden.
And it trickles down to everybody.”That approach has carried over to the court, where Thybulle said he has most felt Harden’s impact in the Sixers’ uptick in pace.
Simmons has not played at all this season after sitting out his time on the Sixers’ following a trade demand.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the blockbuster trade on Feb. 10 that sent ex-Net James Harden to the Sixers for Ben Simmons, Philadelphia head coach Doc Rivers gave a speech about staying focused on the present.
Maxey was just a few months into his rookie season when Philadelphia became embroiled in its saga with Simmons.
“We have a great group of guys, guys that really like each other, guys that get along, guys that want to play with each other and guys that want to win.
Harden joined a Philadelphia team that entered the All-Star break third in the East, where they remain, just 2 1/2 games behind the Heat and Bulls.
