     Summary: Sanders says the choice in the U.S. is 'normal or crazy' in GOP response to BidenEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Drago/AP Al Drago/APArkansas' newly elected governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, delivered the Republican Party's response to President Biden's State of the Union address, telling Americans: "Biden and the Democrats have failed you."
She drew a sharp contrast between the two parties, especially with respect to what she called the "left-wing culture war."
"The dividing line in America is no longer between right and left — it's between normal or crazy," Sanders said in her rebuttal to President Biden's State of the Union address.
She held up former President Donald Trump's achievements as bringing "stability" to America before saying the Democrats "destroyed" that record.
But she said, "The America we love is in danger," echoing her line that now is the time for change and that President Biden and Democrats have failed.

     Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacks ‘left-wing culture war’ in SOTU response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of her first acts as governor, Sanders garnered national attention for a directive banning the term Latinx across the Arkansas government.
In her Tuesday response, Sanders similarly waded into culture war subjects that have animated conservatives in the Biden years, inveighing against “false idols” of the left and other conservative punching bags.
Huckabee also hit the president for his stewardship of the economy and the Biden administration’s handling of immigration policy.
“The dividing line in America is no longer between right or left; the choice is between normal or crazy,” she said.
Hutchinson has at times flirted with a presidential run as a conservative alternative to Trump, while Sanders has tamped down speculation that she is angling for a higher position.

     Sarah Huckabee Sanders draws sharp contrast with Democrats in GOP rebuttal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave a combative speech Tuesday evening in response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, drawing a sharp contrast with Biden as she delivered a series of blistering criticisms of the president.
Sanders called Biden “unfit to serve as commander in chief,” said his “weakness puts our nation and the world at risk” and described the political landscape in dire terms.
Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, served as governor of the state from 1996 to 2007.
Sanders also used the speech to highlight her service in the Trump administration and ties to the former president.
Everyone, including President Biden, should listen carefully.”This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.
