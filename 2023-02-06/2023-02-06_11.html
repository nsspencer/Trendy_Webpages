     Alec Baldwin wants prosecutor in on-set death case dropped
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA FE, N.M. — (AP) — Defense attorneys for actor Alec Baldwin are seeking to disqualify the special prosecutor in the case against him stemming from the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.
Reeb is “exercising either the executive power or the judicial power, and her continued service as a special prosecutor is unconstitutional," Baldwin's team argued in the motion.
The office of Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies dismissed the idea that Reeb would be disqualified.
Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021.
Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.

     Alec Baldwin asks to have special prosecutor removed from 'Rust' case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Alec Baldwin, who's accused of fatally shooting cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, filed a motion Tuesday to remove special prosecutor Andrea Reeb from the case, citing New Mexico's separation-of-powers statute.
"Representative Reeb is therefore exercising either the executive power or the judicial power, and her continued service as a special prosecutor is unconstitutional."
Baldwin, who has denied any wrongdoing in the on-set shooting, also said a politician could be susceptible to undue public pressure.
"However, the district attorney and the special prosecutor will remain focused on the evidence and on trying this case so that justice is served.”Reeb told CNN last month that her decisions as a prosecutor were not influenced by politics.
The state House is a part-time body, and Reeb's appointment as a special prosecutor is a special assignment with no inherent conflict of interest, Kastenberg said.

     Alec Baldwin Seeks to Disqualify Special Prosecutor in ‘Rust’ Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin’s lawyer filed a motion on Tuesday to disqualify the special prosecutor in the “Rust” case, arguing she cannot simultaneously serve as a prosecutor and a state legislator.
Andrea Reeb was brought in last year by the First Judicial District Attorney in Santa Fe to assist on the “Rust” case.
Baldwin’s lawyers argue that Reeb’s position as a state lawmaker could influence her prosecutorial decisions.
Baldwin’s lawyers argue that even if Reeb recuses herself from voting on that request, her fellow lawmakers might be inclined to support continuing to fund Reeb’s salary as a special prosecutor.
In a statement Tuesday afternoon, the First Judicial District Attorney’s Office called Baldwin’s motion a distraction.
