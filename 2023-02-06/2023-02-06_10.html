     North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brings daughter to visit troops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lauded the “limitless strength” of his nuclear-armed military as he visited troops with his daughter to mark the 75th founding anniversary of his army, state media said Wednesday.
North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim visited an unspecified barracks with his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, and later Tuesday gave an encouraging speech to troops at a banquet, praising them for maintaining the “world’s strongest military” despite external difficulties.
North Korea has not confirmed plans for a military parade, which could possibly take place later Wednesday.
North Korea is also facing deepening economic isolation and food shortages, showing the costs of Kim’s nuclear ambitions are piling up.
North Korea is coming off a record-breaking year in weapons testing, and the dozens of missiles it fired in 2022 included potentially nuclear-capable systems designed to strike targets in South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

     North Korea’s Kim Jong Un gives clearest sign daughter is heir apparent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the banquet, Kim Jong Un called for development of the country’s military.
Advertisement“Given these developments, there is no longer a question about whether Kim Ju Ae has been chosen as Kim Jong Un’s successor,” he said.
Kim Jong Un was announced to the military as his father’s successor when he was only 8 years old, according to his aunt.
Kim Jong Un is the third generation of his family to rule the totalitarian state since it was founded by his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1948.
After Kim Il Sung died in 1994, his son Kim Jong Il took over, ruling until the end of 2011, when he was succeeded by Kim Jong Un, who is now 39.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SEOUL, South Korea — (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his daughter to visit troops to mark the 75th founding anniversary of the country's army as he lauded the “irresistible might” of his nuclear-armed military, state media said Wednesday.
In her fourth known public appearance, Kim's daughter Kim Ju Ae, believed to be 9 or 10 years old, stood closely with her father as he shook the hands of senior officials and sat next to him at a table.
North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim visited the lodging quarters of the Korean People’s Army’s general officers with his daughter.
North Korea is also facing deepening economic isolation and food shortages, showing the costs of Kim’s nuclear ambitions are piling up.
Animosity could rise in coming months with Kim doubling down on his nuclear push entering 2023.
