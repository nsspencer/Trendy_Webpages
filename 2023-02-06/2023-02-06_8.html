     Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Sinks on Plans to Raise Over $1B Capital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beleaguered retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) announced its plan to raise over $1 billion in capital by issuing convertible preferred securities and warrants.
Furthermore, the Wall Street Journal reported on late Monday evening that the company secured investor backing for its offering.
BBBY shares plunged nearly 32% in Tuesday’s pre-market trading following a 92.1% jump yesterday due to meme stock frenzy.
The company also disclosed plans to shut down an additional 150 stores on top of 250 previously announced store closures.
The average BBBY stock price of $1.36 implies a possible downside of nearly 77%.

     What Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's Hail Mary to Avoid Bankruptcy Means for Its Stock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Its stock price plunged.
The company will sell more than 23,000 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock to raise $225 million upfront.
It will also sell warrants that will allow investors to purchase more than 84,000 shares of convertible preferred stock and 95 million shares of common stock in the future to raise $800 million.
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a meme stock, meaning it's heavily shorted, and its share price once soared due to coordinated buying efforts by retail investors.
Once converted it could be a win-win: They’ll make money on both accounts, even if the share price is in a downward spiral.
