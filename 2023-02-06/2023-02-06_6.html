     ETSU student meets with Kamala Harris
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JOHNSON CITY – East Tennessee State University student Jeremiah Heyward enjoyed what he said was a “surreal experience” earlier this year when he met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House.
Heyward was one of only a handful of people personally invited to Washington to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing young men of color as a new year begins.
Harris pledged to work with the Joe Biden administration based on the concerns highlighted in the meeting.
Heyward, a senior at ETSU who hopes to work in leadership development within athletics, said he has enjoyed many opportunities throughout his life.
“None,” he said, “can compare to representing ETSU in such a prestigious manner in a White House meeting.”

     Mayor blasts 'leading white Democrats' reportedly trying to oust Harris after NYT casts doubts on 2024 hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Democratic mayor is defending Vice President Kamala Harris against so-called "leading white Democrats" who he claimed are trying to oust from President Biden's ticket following a recent New York Times article that suggested she has not yet "defined her role" in the government.
"Please allow me to translate: The NYT just reported that some leading white Democrats want to get rid of Kamala Harris but don’t know how to do it without upsetting Blacks, women, and especially Black women.
Wow," Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson wrote in a Twitter post of the Times piece, in which most Democratic sources remained anonymous.
Now, as the 2024 presidential election begins to pick up, Democrats are doubting whether Harris proved herself capable of winning a second term alongside President Biden if he seeks re-election.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., would not say whether she believes Harris should run again and cast doubts on her political future."

     The New York Times publishes bleakest Kamala Harris report yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday, the New York Times published a damning report about how Vice President Kamala Harris has struggled to define her historic tenure as the nation's second in command.
Of all the similar reports that have come out since Harris first assumed the role in 2021, Monday's New York Times article is the bleakest.
The most troubling takeaway came when the authors asked Harris' staff for sources who could speak to her accomplishments.
"Even some Democrats whom her own advisers referred reporters to for supportive quotes confided privately that they had lost hope in her," the authors wrote.

     In veep trouble: Three barriers putting Kamala Harris in unenviable position ahead of 2024
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Democrats look ahead to 2024 and consider alternative candidates if President Joe Biden does not seek reelection, some party leaders are questioning whether Vice President Kamala Harris has what it takes to win the White House.
However, now that Democrats hold a 51-49 majority, that could open the vice president up to getting more face time with voters ahead of the 2024 cycle.
Gaffes and blundersCriticisms of Harris for her delay in visiting the southern border intensified after the vice president explained her absence.
“I haven’t been to Europe,” Harris quipped to NBC News weeks before making her first trip to the southern border.
Harris has been weighed down by other similar gaffes, typically resulting in the vice president giving a long-winded answer that critics attack as not being substantive.
