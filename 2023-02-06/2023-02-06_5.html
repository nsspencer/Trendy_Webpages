     Ohio train derailment: Residents forced to evacuate not yet allowed to return home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Residents near the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line who were told to evacuate after tanker cars derailed in a fiery crash days ago have still not been allowed to return home.
A large ball of fire and plume of black smoke could be seen billowing high into the sky from the smoldering derailment site in East Palestine, Ohio, as the controlled burn took place.
East Palestine is a small village in northeastern Ohio, near the border with Pennsylvania.
Ten of the derailed cars were transporting hazardous materials, five of which contained vinyl chloride.

     Summary: Ohio crews conduct a 'controlled release' of toxic chemicals from derailed train carsEnlarge this image toggle caption Gene J. Puskar/AP Gene J. Puskar/APCrews in Ohio began to release hazardous chemicals from five cars of a train that derailed amid fears of a "catastrophic" explosion on Monday at the site near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.
Mike DeWine said he approved the operation of the "controlled release" at the site in East Palestine, Ohio.
Air and water are being monitored for contaminationThe operation follows concerns about hazardous materials such as vinyl chloride, phosgene and combustible liquids contained in the derailed cars.
About 50 cars of a Norfolk Southern train went off track in East Palestine on Friday around 9 p.m. local time.
Ten of the 50 derailed cars contained hazardous materials — five of which include vinyl chloride, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

     Health officials: No air quality concerns after East Palestine train derailment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Canton City Public Health hasn't seen a problem with air quality around Stark County since a major train derailment Friday in East Palestine and a controlled release of toxic chemicals on Monday, officials said.
Train derailment:Crews successfully release toxic chemicals from derailed Ohio train cars, authorities sayOfficials had warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air.
But officials have said the town's air quality monitors showed no levels of concern.
Air quality varies from area to area, the spokesperson said, but everything has been below a level requiring action.
Adams also has been watching the reports from the U.S. EPA, which has been monitoring the air quality near the derailment.

     Ohio train derailment: What are the risks of toxic vinyl chloride?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that breathing vinyl chloride over long periods “may be connected” to brain cancer, lung cancers and some cancers of the blood.
It’s less understood how a sudden release, such as the one in Ohio, could affect people living nearby — or how the authorities’ decision to burn off the vinyl chloride might affect its dispersal.
Train derailments occur roughly 1,000 times a year in the United States, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, although not all result in leakage of toxic chemicals.
If the amount of the toxic chemical release is large enough, it has to be reported to the EPA.
According to the CDC, some vinyl chloride can dissolve in water, and it can migrate to groundwater or spread through the breakdown of other chemicals.

     What if a train derailment like Ohio’s happened in Philly?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementThe derailment Sunday in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border, involved the risk of a deadly explosion and the release of a toxic chemical, vinyl chloride.
The derailment happened in a sparsely populated area and up to 2,000 people live in the evacuation zone.
If dangerous chemicals escaped in a Philadelphia train incident, the number of people needing evacuation could be many times that.
One Penn Environment study from 2015 estimated more than 700,000 people lived within a half mile of a potential accident involving a train transporting oil.
The population density of an area a train is traveling through is a factor in freight rail’s safety planning, Kahanek said.

     Ohio train derailment: 5 derailed train cars carrying hazardous material at risk of exploding are no longer burning, official says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Five train cars that contained vinyl chloride, a potentially explosive chemical, are no longer burning after a train derailment in Ohio, a Norfolk Southern official said Tuesday.
But it’s not yet clear when residents who were ordered to evacuate can return home, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick said Tuesday.
The train derailment Friday led to a massive inferno and increased pressure inside the hot steel.
Derailed train cars smoldered Monday in East Palestine, Ohio.
Malfunctioning safety valves heightened concernsWhen the Norfolk Southern train crashed in East Palestine, about 10 of 20 cars carrying hazardous materials derailed.
