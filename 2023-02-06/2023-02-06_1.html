The company added , "Each experience offered under Portkey Games will take place in the wizarding world and will be authentic to it.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A hotly anticipated new video game set in the “Harry Potter” universe appears to feature a trans character, which would be a first for the franchise.
The revelation of a trans character is particularly noteworthy because of ongoing controversy surrounding “Harry Potter” author JK Rowling’s views on transgender people.
So far, she has not commented on the “Hogwarts Legacy” character.
Rowling’s past comments have drawn criticism from “Harry Potter” actors like Daniel Radcliffe, and have deeply divided the vast “Harry Potter” fandom.
Such debate also has swirled around the “Hogwarts Legacy” video game.
