     Chicago Bulls: 3 trades to send Zach LaVine to the Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just last week, Brooklyn Nets star guard Kyrie Irving formally requested a trade, and days later, he got it.
Now, the Chicago Bulls could be impacted by the deal.
Chicago’s front office has maintained the fact that they are unlikely to move guard Zach LaVine, who is in the first of a 5-year deal signed last summer.
If Chicago was willing to listen to offers for LaVine, Brooklyn just might be a dark horse landing spot.
The biggest part of the deal would include Brooklyn sending a first-round pick in 2027 and 2029 to Chicago in exchange for LaVine.

     How the Trail Blazers Could Help Make the Bulls Deadline a Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All indications are that the Chicago Bulls will remain relatively quiet at this season’s trade deadline.
It’s hard to imagine we can deem the Bulls’ trade deadline a success for Chicago if they sit on their hands.
The Bulls received a 2022 Portland Trail Blazers lottery-protected first-round pick two offseasons ago.
Now, there are protections they can put on a first-rounder right now that would ensure it conveys at an appropriate time after the Bulls’ pick.
And, considering they’re currently 11th in the West (and the Bulls don’t own a first-round pick in this upcoming draft), that sounds great to me!

     The Chicago Bulls May Have Just Found Their Solution At Point Guard Ahead Of The Trade Deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just over 48 hours until the 2022-23′ season’s trade deadline passes, the Chicago Bulls may have stumbled upon their second-half point guard solution right at the buzzer.
Bulls Can’t Catch A BreakComing into the season, the Bulls knew they were without Lonzo Ball, who assumed the point guard position for much of the 2021-22′ campaign.
Things have since been derailed in both the security of the point guard position for Chicago and Ball’s now-unknown return date.
Chicago Bulls point guard Ayo Dosunmu said on NBC Sports Chicago that he sent a text in the Bulls group chat earlier today explaining the urgency of the season and that they can't drop any more games and every game matters.
The former Illini point guard has stayed just as hot for the next two games.

     Memphis Grizzlies vs. Chicago Bulls Game Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A big reason why is because the Grizzlies are among the worst teams in the NBA beginning and starting games.
On the bright side for Chicago, the Bulls are 6-3 over their past nine games, and finally are running into some good injury luck.
Though the Bulls are more accurate from three, the Grizzlies make shooting beyond the arc a bigger area of focus.
This starts with good team defense on a Bulls team that has been very good at finding high percentage shots.
Morant also has had plenty of success against the Bulls in the past, and he likely will be focused on having big game.

     Summary: ET trade deadline quickly approaching, the Bulls have not met their own self-imposed expectation.
They find themselves at a crossroads but do not intend to trade core players this week, team and league sources told ESPN.
That percentage drops further when DeRozan, LaVine and Vucevic are on the court together.
When Ball was on the court with the Bulls' All-Star trio last season, Chicago outscored teams by 59 points.
Because of the protections on the picks owed to the Magic and Spurs, the Bulls can't trade any of their own first-round picks.
