     Joe Rogan Called Out for Promoting Anti-Semitic Trope on Podcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Rogan has landed himself in hot water after voicing anti-Semitic tropes on his widely popular Spotify podcast.
While speaking to MSNBC contributor Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjet, the Joe Rogan Experience host referenced a tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar, who in 2019 tweet claimed that Israel’s defenders in the U.S. were motivated by money.
“Disturbing that at a time of rising anti-Jewish violence, when growing numbers of Americans believe in antisemitic conspiracy theories, [Joe Rogan] would use his immense platform to spew antisemitic tropes about Jews and money,” Greenblatt wrote.
‘Comedian’ or not, Rogan’s comments are no joke.” The tweet linked to an ADL article and video debunking the stereotype.
Others to call out Rogan included Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and British comedian/Jews Don’t Count author David Baddiel:

     Summary: Alex Jones wanted embattled influencer Andrew Tate to be featured on Joe Rogan's podcast, per the SPLC.
"Yeah he's been trying to get on my podcast for a while," Rogan wrote of Tate in a text to Jones, per the SPLC.
Tate has not appeared on "The Joe Rogan Experience" before, though Rogan mentioned the former kickboxer on his podcast on January 5.
"I think they were genuinely friends and I think Rogan wasn't necessarily opening it up to where Jones could come on there as much as possible."
Representatives for Jones, Tate, and Rogan did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

     Joe Rogan Faces New Criticism for Promoting ‘Antisemitic Tropes About Jews and Money’ on Podcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Rogan has found himself facing new controversy after voicing antisemitic tropes on his massively popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience.”In a recent episode featuring guests Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti, hosts of the “Breaking Points” podcast, Rogan stated that “the idea that Jewish people aren’t into money is ridiculous.
“She’s apologizing for talking about ‘It’s all about the Benjamins,’ which is just about money—she’s talking about money,” Rogan continued on his podcast.
Disturbing that at a time of rising anti-Jewish violence, when growing numbers of Americans believe in antisemitic conspiracy theories, @joerogan would use his immense platform to spew antisemitic tropes about Jews and money.
Rogan, whose show ranked as the most popular podcast of 2022 on Spotify, is no stranger to backlash.
Seventy episodes of “The Joe Rogan Experience” were pulled from Spotify last year for the host’s repeated use of the N-word, a controversy that led to an apology from the podcast host.

     Joe Rogan Sparks Backlash for Pushing Antisemitic ‘Money’ Trope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Conspiracy-peddling podcaster Joe Rogan, who signed a $200 million deal with Spotify in 2020, is once again in hot water—this time for pushing the well-known antisemitic trope that Jewish people are “into money” and greedy.
According to the longtime UFC commentator, there is nothing problematic about observing that Jewish people like money.
“She’s apologizing for talking about ‘It’s all about the Benjamins,’ which is just about money—she’s talking about money,” he stated.
Benjamins are money.”Rogan continued: “The idea that Jewish people aren’t into money is ridiculous.
That’s fucking stupid.”Noting that Omar recently reiterated her apology during an interview alongside Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is Jewish, Rogan doubled down.

     Summary: (JTA) — It’s “ridiculous” to doubt that Jews like money, popular podcaster Joe Rogan said on his show on Saturday.
But Rogan defended the statement on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience.” The show attracts some 11 million listeners per episode, according to an estimate last year in Time magazine, and is the most popular podcast on Spotify’s platform.
“She’s talking about money,” Rogan said about Omar.
You know, the idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous.
