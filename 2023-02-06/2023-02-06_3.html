     Strongest earthquake in decades startles Buffalo, upstate New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A small earthquake rumbled through Buffalo and western New York Monday morning, alarming people in a region unaccustomed to such shaking but apparently causing no significant damage.
Erie County emergency services officials confirmed the earthquake was felt in at least a 30-mile radius, including in Niagara Falls, about 20 miles north of Buffalo, he said.
Even though the earthquake’s epicenter was more than 70 miles west of Rochester, it did reverberate here, Alex Hatem, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, confirmed.
Earthquake Canada, which measured a 4.2 magnitude event, reported it was felt slightly in southern Ontario.

     Quake near the lake; Details on Buffalo's earthquake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Dan Russell (@Dan_Weather_Man) February 6, 2023 ​Soon after, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) confirmed that the earthquake measured a 3.8 magnitude on the Richter scale.
The highest magnitude earthquake ever recorded in this part of the country was on Aug. 12, 1929.
That day, a 4.9 magnitude earthquake struck with the epicenter 5 miles south of Corfu, N.Y. near Attica, N.Y.
Many asked if this earthquake was related at all to the tragic earthquake that affected Syria and Turkey on the same day.
While that earthquake had aftershocks reported many countries away from its epicenter, this earthquake was an entirely separate event.

     Buffalo earthquake: 3.8 magnitude quake rattles western New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A 3.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the Buffalo, New York, area early Monday.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, the Buffalo office of the National Weather Service said.
The earthquake comes weeks after the area endured a deadly winter storm that left 39 people dead in Erie County and the city of Buffalo buried under nearly 52 inches of snow.
The county also issued a “code blue” warning last week and opened three warming shelters as dangerously cold temperatures gripped the northeast.
CNN affiliate WKBW received reports of people around the region feeling the rumbling Monday, including across the border in Ontario, Canada.
