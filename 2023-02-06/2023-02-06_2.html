     State of the Union 2023: Chinese balloon looms large over Biden's speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although public opinion surveys 21 months removed from an election are of limited value, the latest numbers show that if Mr Biden takes the plunge he is in for a closely contested campaign, with Republicans - including his former adversary Donald Trump - more than capable of wresting the White House from his grasp.
His overall approval has improved but is still net-negative.
Polling indicates that Democrats would be more resigned to a Biden re-election campaign than energised by it.

     Biden's 2023 State of the Union has started: Follow for live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The above stream is scheduled to start at 9 p.m.
U.S. President Joe Biden will face a divided Congress and stubbornly high inflation when he delivers the annual State of the Union address at 9 p.m. Tuesday night.
U.S. job growth, the war in Ukraine, the rise in domestic manufacturing, the ongoing pandemic and America's strategic competition with China will dominate the speech, according to White House aides who outlined his comments.
It will also be the first time that Biden gives the historic speech before a divided Congress after Republicans clenched control of the U.S. House in November's midterm elections.
Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California will sit behind Biden's left shoulder on the dais during his address instead of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Vice President Kamala Harris will sit next to McCarthy.
