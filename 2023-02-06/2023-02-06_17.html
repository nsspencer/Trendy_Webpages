     Famed Homicide Detective Reacts to Aiden Fucci Guilty Plea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But that’s exactly how he would describe 16-year-old Aiden Fucci, who recently pleaded guilty to stabbing his 13-year-old classmate 114 times.
“In this case, this is an act of pure evil,” Waters said in an extended interview with Law&amp;Crime’s Sidebar podcast.
And they even recovered the weapon.”The list continued: “They’ve got trace evidence, they’ve got digital evidence, they’ve got videos, they’ve got res gestae statements,” Waters pointed out.
“It looks like he may have a cut to his hand and that may have been in the midst of the stabbing,” Waters noted.
“When you talk about 114 times that he stabs this girl, this young lady — clearly for me he defines himself as a psychopath,” Waters continued.

     Who Is Aiden Fucci? Florida Teen Admits Brutal Murder of Tristyn Bailey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aiden Fucci was just 14 when he killed Tristyn Bailey in a ferocious attack in a wooded area of St. Johns County, Florida, back in 2021.
Fucci's mom, Crystal Smith, was charged with tampering with evidence after she allegedly tried to clean the blood from Fucci's jeans.
Fucci was initially charged with second-degree murder and held without bail but the charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder when prosecutors said the killing suggested premeditation.
After suddenly pleading guilty to first-degree murder on Monday he said: "I just want to say I plea guilty and I'm sorry for the Bailey family and my family."
Fucci was sent to Duval County Jail before his trial and, according to First Coast News, has been involved in multiple physical fights there.
