     William Byron Wins Unusually Quiet NASCAR Race at Martinsville
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every NASCAR race run under the current rule set mandates at least two cautions at the end of the first and second stages.
Their Chase Elliott led the first 185 laps, winning the first and second stages over teammate William Byron.
He would not look back, leading 212 of the remaining 218 laps to take his second win of the season.
That was the first Cup dirt race in decades, but it was building on a foundation of successful races on dirt by the Truck Series that had fundamentally similar cars.
This year, teams will have to contend with the second draft of a Bristol dirt track in a Next Gen car that has never seen a dirt surface in race trim.

     Recap: William Byron holds strong run through overtime restart to win Martinsville spring race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MARTINSVILLE, Va. – The first night race for the NASCAR Cup Series at Martinsville Speedway was a cakewalk for Hendrick Motorsports—until a late caution sent the race to overtime, that is.
Byron, who also won Thursday night’s NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race, is the first driver to win two events this season.
With his parents on his pit box for the entire race, Byron dedicated the win to his mother.
The four cautions total—with two for stage breaks—were the fewest in a Cup race at Martinsville since 1997.
NOTE: NASCAR’s inspection is complete in the Cup Series garage with no issue, confirming William Byron as the race winner.
