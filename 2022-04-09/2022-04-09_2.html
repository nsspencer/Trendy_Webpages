     Summary: (Photo by James Gilbert/Getty Images)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The UFC made another stop in Jacksonville and delivered another blockbuster night.
The arena was sold out again, packing in 14,605 and earning a record gate of $3.55 million, said UFC president Dana White.
Sterling won 48-47 on two judges’ cards and Yan won 48-47 on the third.
That led to a bit of good natured trash talk between the Australian and Korean fans.

     Summary: The Chechen-born Swede returned to the UFC's Octagon in the middle bout of the UFC 273 main card, taking on No.
Chimaev fired plenty of heavy artillery in return, but unlike his previous opponents, Burns didn't go away.
"I didn't know he was so tough," a bruised and bloodied Chimaev said in his post-fight interview with UFC color commentator Joe Rogan.
For all his previous dominance in the Octagon, Chimaev was a total mystery heading into his UFC 273 with Burns.
Then again, there is a silver lining to Chimaev's less-than-perfect performance at UFC 273: It answered most of the questions his doubters had about him.
