    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The screeching sound you may have heard late Saturday night if you were anywhere near Jacksonville, Florida, was the Khamzat Chimaev hype train slowing its roll.
And as his UFC 273 fight against the skyrocketing star that is Chimaev moved into the second round, Burns started to seize control.
Burns is a multiple-time jiu-jitsu world champion barely a year removed from a challenge for the UFC title.
He said not a word about the co-main bantamweight title bout between champ Aljamain Sterling and former champ Petr Yan.
Khamzat Chimaev didn't dominate Gilbert Burns as he had done against previous opponents, but the victory may have been more impressive.
