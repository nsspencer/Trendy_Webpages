     'SNL' game show wants to know why Jake Gyllenhaal liked that Instagram post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We all like a lot of posts on Instagram, but we may not want to admit why.
"Saturday Night Live" debuted a new game show sketch in Saturday's episode called "Why'd You Like It?"
in which the unsuspecting contestants – played by host Jake Gyllenhaal, Chloe Fineman and Chris Redd – were confronted with Instagram posts they've furtively liked and are interrogated about why.
Spoiler alert: The answer usually comes down to the contestants wanting to hook up with whoever was posting on Instagram.

     Jake Gyllenhaal Remembers Hosting ‘SNL’ All Too Well
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jake Gyllenhaal hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time in 15 years and sang a power ballad about remembering an old love.
Now that’s a decision considering he was the subject of one, on that very stage, only 148 days ago.
“To give you an idea of what it was like in 2007, in the show I hosted, there was a George W. Bush sketch, there were jokes about the first iPhone, and this is a photo of me from my monologue,” Gyllenhaal said.
The photo revealed him performing a Dreamgirls spoof in drag, with Maya Rudolph, Amy Poehler, and Kristen Wiig as his spangled backup singers, “to promote a movie where I played a gay cowboy.”Gyllenhaal said that he never thought he would have an opportunity to host the show again.
“But being here tonight,” he said, “it feels like everything is suddenly coming back.” Gyllenhaal then reprised the sketch — this time with Chloe Fineman, Ego Nwodim, and Cecily Strong backing him up — and sang Celine Dion’s “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.”Sounds more like Gyllenhaal wants to be his old self again, but he’s still trying to find it.

     ‘SNL’: Jake Gyllenhaal Reminisces On First 2007 Appearance, Sings Celine Dion In Opening Monologue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jake Gyllenhaal tonight returned to SNL for the first time since 2007, reflecting in his opening monologue about just how long ago that was.
“There I am in full drag, singing a song from Dreamgirls, to promote a movie where I played a gay cowboy,” said the host.
“Then, I showed up on set and was like, ‘You’re looking at a guy who gained 10 pounds and doesn’t care about awards.
In truth, he wasn’t even sure he would remember how to host.
Gyllenhaal is joined for tonight’s show by musical guest Camila Cabello.

     Summary: “Saturday Night Live” paid tribute to future Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a cold open that had her visiting the ghosts of historical figures in the Oval Office.
Biden then left Jackson in his office to commune with the spirits of Americans that paved the way for her historic confirmation.

“You are a stupid man,” Nwodim, playing his girlfriend, angrily chided.

     Jake Gyllenhaal remembers how to have fun on a largely amusing SNL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This week, Jake Gyllenhaal returned to the Saturday Night Live hosting gig for the first time in 15 years, or “400 Marvel movies ago,” as he said in the monologue.
Back then, Gyllenhaal was basking in acclaim from Brokeback Mountain and angling to become an action star.
In the preview for this episode, I wondered why the show hadn’t had Gyllenhaal back to host.
It’d be nice to see SNL aim upward in its perspective on sex and kink instead of consistently starting from the junior-high basement.
Worse, it ends in about the most junior-high way possible: Gyllenhaal collapses, revealing he has the herpes medication Valtrex in his pocket.
