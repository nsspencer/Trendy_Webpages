     Photos: The rise and fall of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Imran Khan has been removed from the prime minister’s office in Pakistan after a no-confidence motion against him succeeded in parliament.
His centre-right Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party promised a “new” Pakistan, assuring supporters to fight corruption, bolster the crippling economy and pursue an independent foreign policy.
But, critics say, he failed to keep his promises, and the opposition gained momentum to bring down his government.
Still, many see him as a saviour of the common man in the roles of a cricketer, philanthropist and politician.
Born in 1952 in the northeastern city of Lahore, he won the only 50-over cricket World Cup for Pakistan in 1992, making him a hero to the young generation of Pakistan at the time.

     Pakistan's Imran Khan removed as prime minister after no-confidence vote
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pakistan's Parliament has passed a no-confidence vote to remove Imran Khan as prime minister.
Why it matters: While no previous Pakistani prime minister has completed a full five-year term, the former cricket star is the first to be removed from office in a no-confidence vote, the New York Times notes.
By the numbers: The motion passed early Sunday local time in the 342-seat parliament with 174 votes — two more than was required for a simple majority, according to the Washington Post.
Khan had seen several recent defections — notably a key ally quitting the ruling coalition, which last month cost him the majority in Parliament.
Opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League party who spearheaded the campaign against Khan, was expected to become the interim prime minister, WashPost notes.

     Summary: Imran Khan has been ousted as Pakistan's prime ministerEnlarge this image toggle caption Anjum Naveed/AP Anjum Naveed/APImran Khan was ousted from his position as prime minister of Pakistan after 174 legislators voted against him in a no-confidence motion early on Sunday morning.
He said they needed to protect Pakistan's sovereignty and oppose U.S. dictations.
The no-confidence vote loss for Khan may bring to power some unlikely partners.
The largest among the opposition parties — the Pakistan People's Party, led by the son of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and the Pakistan Muslim League — have been tainted by allegations of widespread corruption.
Pakistan Muslim League leader and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was convicted of corruption after being named in the so-called Panama Papers.

     Summary: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was voted out of office early Sunday after a confused and chaotic day in which a “no confidence” vote in Parliament was repeatedly delayed.
But as a tense nighttime confrontation loomed, with police and paramilitary troops blanketing the capital, the vote was finally held.
AdvertisementOn Thursday, the justices ruled unanimously that Khan’s maneuvers had been illegal and that the vote must be held.
It was a legally held vote, endorsed by the judiciary, in a careful legalistic ruling that was widely applauded.

     Imran Khan: Pakistan Prime Minister voted out of office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has been ousted as the country's leader following a vote of no confidence over allegations of economic mismanagement and mishandling of the country's foreign policy, bringing an end to his tumultuous term in office.
The speaker of the National Assembly will now send a notice to Khan and call for a fresh session of parliament to elect a new prime minister.
No prime minister has ever completed a full five-year term under the present constitution of 1973.
The opposition responded by accusing Khan of treason and asking Pakistan's highest court to rule on whether the prime minister had breached the constitution.
