     Soccer-Tottenham ‘feel the blood’ of top-four rivals, says Conte
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte said his team could “feel the blood” of their rivals and capitalised on their slips as the north London club tightened their grip on the fourth place in the Premier League with a 4-0 win at Aston Villa.
Son Heung-min’s hat-trick on Saturday helped Tottenham open a three-point lead over rivals Arsenal, with Conte’s team fourth in the league on 57 points after 31 matches.
Manchester United’s defeat at Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers’ defeat at Newcastle United also helped Tottenham strengthen their grip on the fourth spot.
“It was a great win for us, especially coming after your rivals have played and lost: Wolverhampton, Manchester United and Arsenal,” Conte said.
There is a lot of space for improvement.”Tottenham next host 11th-placed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on April 16.

     Watch Son Heung-Min's Finishing Masterclass In Spurs Win At Aston Villa - Premier League Highlights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham's 4-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday was built on their superior quality at both ends of the pitch.
Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was a strong contender for man of the match, after making eight saves to keep one of the most hard-earned clean sheets in Premier League history.
It was a finishing masterclass from Son, who only had three shots in the entire game.
Two of Son's goals were also scored with his left foot, which is supposedly his weaker foot, but stats suggest he is one of the most ambipedal players in Premier League history.

     Summary: With Arsenal losing 2-1 at home to Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham are three points above their North London rivals in the battle for fourth spot.

     Summary: The 30-year-old left Spurs in January 2020 to join Inter Milan but is currently back in the Premier League with Brentford.
Eriksen registered double figures for Premier League goals and assists combined in each of those six seasons.
Christian Eriksen pictured playing for Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final IMAGO/Sportfoto RudelEriksen's departure left a big hole in the Tottenham team.
Kane made more assists, 14, than any other Premier League player last season and has added another six this campaign, aided largely by his excellent relationship with Son Heung-min.
Conte's admission that he wants a number 10 will add fuel to the rumors linking Eriksen with Spurs.

     Summary: It is now just over six weeks ago since Antonio Conte questioned his own future at Tottenham following their dismal 1-0 defeat away at Burnley.
While there have been a few bumps in the road along the way since then, notably the FA Cup exit at Championship side Middlesbrough and their 3-2 defeat against Manchester United, Tottenham have won six of their last eight games in all competitions.
The game wasn't easy, but we made the game easy."
The game certainly wasn't easy for Tottenham, but they did make it easy as they wowed in the second half to deliver a hammer blow to Villa.
The confidence is there at present and the goals are flowing as a result, with 12 in their last three fixtures.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham have tightened their grip on fourth spot in the Premier League with a 4-0 win against Aston Villa, giving them a three-point cushion over Arsenal in fifth.
Spectacular saves from Lloris became a recurring theme, with the veteran goalkeeper averting a long-range screamer from John McGinn soon afterwards.
Raking balls from the back proved to be Spurs’ most effective weapon, with Son scoring his second from a similar situation.
Romero lofted a pass to Kane, whose flicked header sent the South Korean forward one-on-one before he beat Martinez once again.
KEY STATSAs per Opta, Son has scored the most non-penalty goals of any player in the Premier League this season with 17.
