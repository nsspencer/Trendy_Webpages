    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Philip PullellaVATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis on Sunday called for an Easter truce in Ukraine, and in an apparent reference to Russia, questioned the value of planting a victory flag “on a heap of rubble”.
Let An Easter truce start.
Since the war began in Ukraine, Francis has only mentioned Russia specifically in prayers, such as during a special global event for peace on March 25.
It marks the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday in the Roman Catholic Church on April 17 this year.
Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter a week later, on April 24.

     Summary: Hundreds of Christians across the world are celebrating the start of Holy Week this year, a year after restrictions prevented in-person gatherings and celebrations.
Roman Catholic clergy gathered for a Mass on Sunday at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem to mark Palm Sunday.
During the service Pizzaballa also handed out palm fronds to the clergy.
Following the Mass, worshippers were expected to take part in a procession through Jerusalem, retracing Jesus' traditional route from 2,000 years ago.
Palm Sunday is the sixth and last Sunday of Lent.

     Jerusalem’s Holy Sepulchre ‘resurrected’ for Palm Sunday mass as pilgrims return
    </h2>

     Summary: Worshippers rattled palm fronds, a traditional gesture to remember the branches laid down by the crowds welcoming Jesus to Jerusalem as recorded by the gospels.
The day marks the start of Holy Week for Roman Catholics.
“I never believed I would visit the holy land,” said Francisca Teresinha de Jesus Fernandes Farias, 85, from Brazil.
The Holy Sepulchre lies at the heart of the Old City’s Christian Quarter in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and later annexed.
The return of overseas tourists has not yet been in large enough numbers to restore business in the quarter.

     Summary: As Martin Luther King, Jr., stated, “a riot is the language of the unheard.”Today’s scene of Jesus entering into Jerusalem days before his crucifixion comes from Luke’s gospel.
Yet riding on a donkey, Jesus is posturing himself as a person who rather comes humbly into the city with peace.
If a riot is the language of the unheard, these women organizers were demanding to be heard.
In February, I had the privilege of accompanying a group of students to the Kino Border Initiative.
So we ride into Holy Week with our holy frustration on the memory of a riot.

     Summary: Vatican City, Apr 10 (EFE).- Pope Francis on Sunday denounced the “folly of war” in a “violent and tormented world” during his Palm Sunday homily.
The sermon was attended by thousands of faithful for the first time after the pandemic.
“We lose sight of why we are in the world and even end up committing senseless acts of cruelty,” the Pope said.
“We see this in the folly of war, where Christ is crucified yet another time”.
He is crucified in the elderly left alone to die; in young people deprived of a future; in soldiers sent to kill their brothers and sisters,” he continued.

Today, the Holy Father insisted, "Jesus teaches us not to remain there, but to react, to break the vicious circle of evil and sorrow."
In folly of war, Christ crucified againThose who crucified Christ, the Pope observed, had premeditated His killing, organized His arrest and trials, and now they were standing on Calvary to witness His death.
This, the Holy Father explained, "is how Jesus acts in our regard: He makes Himself our advocate.

A truce to reach peace through real negotiations.”Francis did not refer directly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the reference was clear, and he has repeatedly denounced the war and the suffering brought to innocent civilians.
We see this in the folly of war, where Christ is crucified yet another time,” he said.
Traditionally, the pope leads a Palm Sunday procession through St. Peter’s Square before celebrating Mass.
Palm Sunday opens Holy Week leading up to Easter, which this year falls on April 17, and features the Good Friday Way of the Cross Procession.

     Summary: Palm Sunday begins a week that prophecy had been predicting for centuries.
Jesus did what He did on Palm Sunday for the single purpose of fulfilling prophecy.
So, Jesus did not ride into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday in order to be a popular hero in a large supportive crowd.
And Jesus knew what was going on.
He knew that the people of Jerusalem would miss the import of the whole week that Palm Sunday started.
