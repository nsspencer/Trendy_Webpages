     VAR Disallows Arsenal Goal After Reviewing It For 3 Mins &amp; 40 Secs As Brighton Win Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: VAR Disallows Arsenal Goal After Reviewing It For 3 Mins &amp; 40 Secs As Brighton Win AwayOne of the Premier League's longest ever VAR reviews took place at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.
The lengthly check eventually disallowed a goal that had been scored by Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli.
Arsenal were losing 1-0 at home to Brighton in first-half added time when Martinelli headed home from ultra close range.
A heavily-deflected shot from Martin Odegaard pulled a goal back for the Gunners late on, but Brighton held on for three points.
Arsenal's 2-1 defeat handed the advantage to rivals Tottenham in the battle to finish in the Premier League's top four places.

     Mikel Arteta disappointed with 'sloppy' Arsenal after Brighton defeat hits Champions League hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta called his side ‘sloppy’ as they lost 2-1 at home to Brighton in a blow to their Champions League hopes.
AdIt has been a tough week for Arsenal after they lost to Crystal Palace earlier in the week just as their season looked to be coming together.
Premier League Arsenal confirm Tierney to miss rest of season ahead of knee surgery 05/04/2022 AT 14:30Speaking after the defeat on Saturday, Arteta said: "It has been a tough week; especially today because we wanted a reaction [to the defeat at Crystal Palace].
We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward.

     Thomas Partey's classy gesture amid Arsenal injury blow as Mikel Arteta decision backfires
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We have to keep assessing him but he’ll be out for some weeks," the Spaniard said.
'His passing, while forward for the most part, was often inaccurate and the Gunners struggled to create through the middle as a result.'
Uploading an image to his Instagram Stories, it would appear that his classy gesture made the day for two young children.
Of course, the mood may have dropped come full-time following the 2-1 loss - a result that leaves Arsenal three points behind Tottenham in the race to finish fourth.
But with eight games remaining, there's still time for plenty of twists and turns as the battle for Champions League qualification heats up.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal’s quest to qualify for the Champions League received another setback with a 2-1 home loss to Brighton on Saturday, making it two defeats in a row for Mikel Arteta’s slumping team.
Arsenal started the game tied on points with fourth-place Tottenham, which plays at Aston Villa later Saturday.
Granit Xhaka, a center midfielder, filled in at left back with Tierney missing and was out of position for Brighton’s first goal.
It was a third loss in the last four games for Arsenal, which must play Chelsea and Manchester United this month with its injury-affected team.
Brighton, which hadn’t won any of its previous seven league games, is languishing in midtable as it drifts toward the end of the season.

     Summary: Andy Rain/EPA"With all of the team available, we know how difficult the challenge that we have ahead," said Arteta.
Finding a way of returning Xhaka to the heart of the team feels imperative after Saturday's display.
The cushion Arsenal had in the top four race has gone and Arteta did not hide from the difficult moment they now find themselves in.
Alexandre Lacazette was a peripheral figure once again, now without a goal from open play since December 11.
But the dual loss of Tierney and Partey feels one of their biggest hurdles yet.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For much of the season, the Emirates Stadium has been giddy with the excitement of watching a young team blossoming under a growing manager.
Consecutive defeats to Crystal Palace and Brighton have dealt a major blow to Arsenal’s hopes of finishing among the top four.A few weeks ago Arsenal’s destination appeared clear: the promised land of the Champions League.
“Especially with where we want to be.”There was late drama here, late desperation.
In truth, those few minutes were not an accurate reflection of a game in which Arsenal simply did not perform.At full-time, the disappointment was palpable.
Eddie Nketiah lingered on the field, perhaps wondering just how Robert Sanchez had plucked his goal-bound header out of the top corner.

     Summary: Although they picked up a late consolation through Martin Odegaard, Mikel Arteta's side are now in a difficult predicament moving forward.
Let's take a look at how football.london's Arsenal writer Kaya Kaynak rated the Arsenal players involved.
He wasn't really the main reason Arsenal lost today even if his passing wasn't quite its usual accurate self.
Bukayo Saka: You know it's not your day when even Saka has a bad game.
With 30 games played, Arsenal are three points behind Spurs in the league, although they do have a game in hand.

Real Betis exited the following Champions League term third in Group G behind Liverpool and Chelsea.
So, Bellerin – who Ian Wright says was an ‘unbelievable servant’ for Arsenal – may be a welcome addition if Pellegrini returns Real Betis to UEFA’s top club competition.

     Summary: Arsenal lost ground in the race for Champions League places as they fell to a defeat against Brighton at home in the Premier League.
Brighton forward Leandro Trossard made Arsenal pay for a slow start by scoring a 28th-minute opener, firing home Enock Mwepu's cut-back.
A goal at that point would have been a game-changer for Arsenal but instead, they continued to be troubled by Brighton.
The visitors got their second through Mwepu on the 67th minute following a brilliant move by debutant Moises Caicedo.

     Summary: Mikel Arteta gave an honest assessment of our performance after we slumped to a disappointing defeat against Brighton on Saturday afternoon.
The result condemns us to back-to-back defeats with just eight games remaining in our fight for a top-four spot.
After the match, the boss discussed our performance, Alexandre Lacazette's form, playing Granit Xhaka at left-back and how we bounce back.
The reaction that we wanted to show and everything that we talked about, we didn’t make it happen on the pitch.
We have to give them something, and we didn’t give them anything in the first half and this is down to us.
