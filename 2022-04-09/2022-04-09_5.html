     Soccer-Mbappe on fire again, Neymar back to his best as PSG demolish Clermont
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS (Reuters) – Kylian Mbappe and Neymar were on fire on Saturday as both scored hat-tricks as Paris St Germain hammered Clermont 6-1 away to move a step closer to the Ligue 1 title.
They are 15 points ahead of second-placed Stade Rennais.
Clermont, who reduced the arrears through Jodel Dossou, are 17th on 28 points after their fifth defeat in a row.
Neymar put them ahead after six minutes, firing home with a low crossed shot after being set up by Lionel Messi.
Six minutes later, Mbappe was at it again, benefiting from a nice combination between Messi and Neymar to curl a shot into the top corner.

     Kylian Mbappe Briefly Made PSG Captain After He &amp; Neymar Score Hat-Tricks Against Clermont
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe was given the responsibility of captaining Paris Saint-Germain during the closing stages of Saturday's 6-1 win over Clermont Foot.
He did not start the match as captain but led superbly from the front nonetheless by scoring a hat-trick.
"I consider Kylian, as well as other players, as a possible captain of this team," Pochettino said, as quoted by Marca.
But Presnel Kimpembe started Saturday's match as captain, before passing the armband onto Marco Verratti when he left the pitch in the 79th minute.
But it is believed that Mbappe could be promoted to first-choice captain at the end of the season if he decides to stay.

     Hat tricks for Mbappe and Neymar as PSG routs Clermont 6-1 | Charlotte Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both scored hat tricks as runaway leader Paris Saint-Germain moved closer to a record-tying 10th French league title by thrashing Clermont 6-1 on Saturday.
Neymar gave PSG a 3-1 lead by converting a penalty in the 71st after Clermont fullback Akim Zedadka brought down Mbappe.
Three minutes later, Neymar hit a ball over the top for Mbappe, who rounded Desmas to score into an empty net.
Messi, Neymar and Mbappe are combining more effectively on the field, with a greater understanding between the players.
Sweden international Jens Cajuste sent Alemdar the wrong way to cut Rennes’ lead.

     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain obliterated Clermont Foot 63 on Saturday with a 6-1 thumping in Ligue 1 which opened a 15-point gap at the summit thanks to Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both recording hat tricks, as well as a treble of assists from Lionel Messi.
It does give hope for the future if the three play together beyond the end of this season and Mbappe's current contract.
"We had a lot of fun and I think many people will have enjoyed watching us.
We continue towards the 10th Ligue 1 title which is not too far now, and we are satisfied.
"There has been plenty to delay us, but life is like that -- sometimes you win and other times you lose.

     Mbappé and Neymar score hat-tricks in PSG romp

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 - Paris are the 1st team with two players scoring a hat-trick in the same game in Ligue 1 (Mbappé &amp; Neymar) since... PSG themselves against Guingamp in January 2019 (Mbappé &amp; Cavani).
Neymar then released Mbappé with a ball over the top with the outside of his boot in the 74th minute, and the France superstar rounded Desmas to score his second and PSG’s fourth goal.
His hat-trick goal followed soon after, with Neymar and Messi combining this time to set up Mbappé, who thumped home his 31st goal of the season in all competitions (80’).
Mbappé then broke the offside trap to run through and square for Neymar to complete a hat-trick of his own in the 83rd minute.
It was the Brazilian’s first hat-trick in a Ligue 1 game since he put four past Dijon FCO in January 2018.
