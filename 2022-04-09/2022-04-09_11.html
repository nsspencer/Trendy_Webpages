    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The five starting lights have been extinguished at the Australian Grand Prix for the first time since 2019 – with Charles Leclerc using his pole position to good effect to lead the pack around Lap 1, with Max Verstappen holding P2 behind.
Behind those two, Lewis Hamilton jumped up to P3 from P5 on the grid.
Further down the order, though, it was a dreadful start for Carlos Sainz from P9, the Ferrari driver dropping down to P14 after battling with Mick Schumacher's Haas.
But worse was to come on Lap 2, as the Spaniard spun into the gravel and out of the race at Turn 10, bringing out a Safety Car.

     Australian Grand Prix sets new Formula One, Melbourne sporting attendance records
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:54)MELBOURNE, Australia -- The 2022 Australian Grand Prix smashed the attendance benchmark Formula One achieved during the 2021 season and set a new record for the highest attended weekend sporting event ever staged in Melbourne.
The weekend figure topped the 400,000 achieved at last year's United States Grand Prix in Austin, F1's best attendance result of 2021.
However, it fell short of the 520,000 fans who attended the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, the final race in Adelaide before F1 shifted the event to Albert Park.
Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief Andrew Westacott believes the figure at this year's event could have been even greater had they been permitted to sell additional tickets.
On Friday, local hero Daniel Ricciardo said Albert Park was clearly the busiest he had ever seen.

     Summary: The long-running Australian Grand Prix circuit has also been modified to aid overtaking during its absence from the schedule.
The race start also went in Leclerc’s favor.
The safety car was deployed early on after Carlos Sainz lost control of his Ferrari on the second lap.
AdvertisementThe winner of the Australian Grand Prix was effectively decided on lap 39 when Max Verstappen retired when his Red Bull caught fire in turn 1.
Despite an incredible start to pass two cars and get to third, Lewis Hamilton was overtaken by Pérez just before the second safety car period.

Max Verstappen retires after engine issues causes him to pull off the track at the Australian GP.
Max Verstappen is not thinking about the defence of his world championship after suffering a second DNF in three races at the Australian Grand Prix.
Max Verstappen doesn't want to think about the Championship fight, as he concedes it's more important to finish races.
However, team principal Christian Horner sympathised with Verstappen's frustrations and is determined Red Bull will get to the bottom of what caused the retirement before the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola in two weeks.

Verstappen opened the season in Bahrain by qualifying second behind Charles Leclerc and spent most of the race holding that position.
All seemed right in the Red Bull garage.
Once again, the 2021 Champion qualified behind Leclerc, second on the grid.
I think it’s more important to just finish races,” Verstappen said.
