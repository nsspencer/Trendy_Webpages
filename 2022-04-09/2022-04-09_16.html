     Summary: Anthony Gordon's first-half strike turned out to be the winner as Everton claimed a crucial win in their battle to avoid relegation.
Manchester United endured a woeful afternoon with another defeat at Everton.
The visitors started well and Marcus Rashford forced two stunning saves inside the opening 15 minutes from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
Everton frustrated United throughout the second half with both teams failing to create many clear-cut chances.
Cristiano Ronaldo forced Pickford into a late save but United were disappointing after the break and Everton picked up a deserved victory.

The England keeper made a fine stop on a deflected shot from Cristiano Ronaldo in stoppage time and definitely deserves the plaudits coming his way.
But Everton‚Äôs not going to care what a goal looks like at this stage ‚Äî or what Manchester United looks like ‚Äî just that the score line says they beat the Red Devils and moved closer to safety.

     Summary: After another crushing loss for Everton, the Toffees need a bit of magic and a bit of fire, but can a game against Manchester United be the ticket?
Manchester United have been having a really tough - comparatively speaking - season in their own right.
CR7 aside, as I previously stated, this team was going to be screwed because they had a massive fatal flaw.
Fred needs to have a holding midfielder behind him, and Scott McTominay wouldn‚Äôt even get into the Everton team (trust me on this.
