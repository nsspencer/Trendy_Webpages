     Aljamain Sterling crowned undisputed bantamweight champion with solid win over Petr Yan at UFC 273
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aljamain Sterling vowed to Petr Yan that their rematch would be a different fight.
Sterling scored a pivotal takedown in each of the second and third rounds to help power a split-decision victory over Yan to be crowned the undisputed bantamweight champion of the world at UFC 273.
Judges at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Fla. on Saturday night scored it 48-47 Sterling, 47-48 Yan and 48-47 Sterling to give him the close win in the co-main event of the pay-per-view.
This comes after Sterling called Yan a dirty fighter following Yan being disqualified for an illegal knee to the head of a downed Sterling in their first fight in March 2021.
Altogether, Sterling posted eight minutes and 31 seconds of control time to help eke out the victory.

     Dana White blasts Aljamain Sterling vs. Petr Yan 2 decision: ‘I thought that the judges blew that one’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dana White thinks that Aljamain Sterling may have gotten away with one again.
At the evening’s post-fight presser, White stated clearly that he didn’t agree with the judges’ decision.
“I thought that the judges blew that one,” White said.
He entered Saturday as the interim UFC bantamweight champion after defeating Cory Sandhagen at UFC 267 to claim that vacant belt.
Two-time champion T.J. Dillashaw was in attendance at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena and earlier in the evening he stated that he would prefer a title fight against Yan.

     Aljamain Sterling ekes out split decision over Petr Yan to unify UFC's bantamweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sterling (21-3) got the last laugh on Petr Yan (16-3) and all his critics Saturday, as he pulled out a razor-close split decision over Yan.
That controversy might not be completely cleared up, however, as some scored the fight in Yan's favor.
Sterling, who won the belt in 2021 when Yan was disqualified for an illegal knee, seemed to enjoy the win even though the Jacksonville crowd booed the decision.
"I had a tough-ass opponent in Petr Yan," Sterling said.
At his postfight news conference, UFC president Dana White said he thought Yan should've gotten the decision.

     Summary: Thirteen months after their title bout ended via disqualification, the bantamweight title rivalry between Aljamain Sterling and Petr Yan appears to be only getting started.
Two judges scored it 48-47 in favor of Sterling while the third had the same score for Yan, the interim titleholder.
Yan, 29, appeared lucky to get out of the second round after Sterling, who was relentless in pursuit of takedowns, pulled Yan down and instantly took his back.
"I think I won this fight and I got robbed," Yan said through a translator.
After the win, Sterling called for a fight against a former champion who appeared to welcome the challenge sitting cageside.
