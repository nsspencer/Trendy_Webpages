     Summary: (Photo by David Berding/Getty Images)The Chicago Blackhawks traded Marc-Andre Fleury to the Minnesota Wild at the 2022 NHL Trade Deadline.
That second-rounder would become a first if the Minnesota Wild reached the Western Conference Finals in addition to Fleury delivering half of those wins.
Unfortunately, the Wild were defeated by the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night and eliminated from playoff contention.
St Louis won three straight games to come back and defeat Minnesota after being down in the series early.
The Chicago Blackhawks were let down badly by the Minnesota Wild.

     Summary: The monumental disbelief and disappointment of the best Minnesota Wild team ever racking up a first-round playoff loss will fade.
After all, the Wild put up 113 points this season.
Yes, the Wild played a 109-point team in the first round.
This was the easiest, cleanest, most simple shot at a legitimate playoff run the Wild were going to get.
If the Wild had difficulties fielding a cap-compliant roster this year, what will the following seasons look like?

     Myers: Historic season comes to a sudden, stunning halt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "It's tough to put into words right now just how close this group was and how positive the regular season was," said Wild forward Marcus Foligno.
"I think that's what stings the most but this team has been building something special this year and this was another step forward."
For whatever reason; the stick-to-itiveness, the resiliency and the sheer will that has defined a Wild team - this one in particular - one that had won more games and accumulated more points than any Wild team before it, just couldn't be summoned.
You bring in a lot of great guys and unfortunately with business that's the way it is.
And I think Billy or whatever he's going to add to it it's going to be a great culture for anyone coming in here.

     Disappointment leads to big decisions facing Wild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First-round playoff ousters are nothing new to the Minnesota Wild, but packing up the lockers after Thursday night's resounding 5-1 loss to the St. Louis Blues just feels a bit more painful than past years.
“It’s tough to put into words right now just how close this group was and how positive the regular season was,” veteran forward and assistant captain Marcus Foligno told The Athletic.
Well, he proved it all right, at least during the regular season.
Blueline bluesWhile the Wild's defenders were not ridiculous during the regular season, they were not as consistent as last season.
That will make signing big buck free agents nearly impossible, and force difficult decisions on resigning current players.
