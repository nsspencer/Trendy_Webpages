     Lawyer: Brittney Griner's detention in Russia extended 30 days following court appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pretrial detention for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was extended for another 30 days by a Russian court, Griner's lawyer Alexander Boykov said.
"We did not receive any complaints about the detention conditions from our client," Boykov said.
Griner has been detained in Russia since February, when she was stopped at an airport for allegedly carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her carry-on luggage.
The WNBA continues to support Griner, placing her initials and jersey number on the sideline of every WNBA court, while also paying her full salary this season.
“Today’s news on Brittney Griner was not unexpected, and the WNBA continues to work with the U.S. government to get BG home safely and as soon as possible," a WNBA spokesperson said in a statement released to USA TODAY Sports.

“The officer was able to confirm that Brittney Griner is doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances,” Price said.
“I want to take a moment to reiterate the WNBA’s support for Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner,” the WNBA commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, said last month.

     Brittney Griner's detention in Russia has been extended by a month, Russian state news reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A Russian court has extended the pretrial detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner – held since February on accusations of drug smuggling – by another month, Russian state news agency TASS reported Friday.
She had been playing for a Russian team in the WNBA offseason, something she has done for about seven seasons.
A Russian court had announced in March it had extended Griner’s pretrial detention until mid-May.
The office leads the government’s diplomatic efforts to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad.
“Regardless of Russian legal proceedings, Brittney Griner has been officially designated as Wrongfully Detained by the U.S. Government and has been held now for 85 days,” Griner’s agent Lindsay Colas said Friday.

     Summary: Russian drug laws are widely considered draconian and the country imprisons more people per capita for drug crimes compared with the rest of Europe, according to The Moscow Times.
Griner, 31, has been held on drug smuggling charges since February when she was found in Moscow's airport allegedly possessing cannabis-derived vape cartridges.
"They're going to try and horse trade," Salvo, a former diplomat at the State Department who had worked in Russia, said.
"The State Department can't storm the Russian prison to bring her home," Salvo said.
"There's a delicate dance their families have to do with trying to raise attention with the State Department and Congress while not wanting to inflame Russia," Salvo said.
