They gathered at Public Square Park in downtown Friday morning ahead of her sentencing hearing.
The rally started with a moment of silence for Charlene Murphey, the patient who died RaDonda Vaught’s care.
“Obviously something tragic happened but we’re also here to support our sister nurse.”Vaught was fond guilty of criminally negligent homicide after giving Murphy the wrong medication back in 2017.

     Former nurse RaDonda Vaught sentenced to 3 years probation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — Former Vanderbilt nurse RaDonda Vaught was sentenced to three years supervised probation in a Davidson County courtroom Friday after she was convicted of negligent homicide in the 2017 death of 75-year-old Charlene Murphey.
Vaught’s probation is to be served with judicial diversion, meaning her conviction could be dismissed following a successful probation period.
Vaught was accused of administering a fatal dose of the wrong medication.
She admitted to using the wrong medication but pleaded not guilty to the charges in 2019.
| RaDonda Vaught Case: Continuing Coverage →Charlene Murphey, of Gallatin, was waiting for a standard scan at Vanderbilt Medical Center in 2017 when she was killed by a fatal dose of the wrong medication.

     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — A former Vanderbilt University Medical Center nurse is sentenced to three years of supervised probation.
VUMC nurse: "If one of us was sick, she would be our choice"She described Vaught as generous, carrying and resilient.
Assistant District Attorney Brittani Flatt told the court Vaught would be a good candidate for probation, but she reiterated that Judge Smith should consider Vaught's actions.
In his sentencing recommendation, Defense Attorney Peter Strainse reminded Judge Smith of all the character reference letters she has received about Vaught.
Judge Smith pushed back on his arguments, saying it was an emotional week and an emotional trial.

     A nurse was just sentenced to 3 years of probation for a lethal medical error
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What made Vaught’s case notable was that she was prosecuted in criminal court, a decision made by the Nashville district attorney.
If legal action is taken in nursing errors, it is generally through civil courts, where patients and families can obtain financial compensation.
Vaught’s case was also notable because while she was charged with a crime, her employer — Vanderbilt University Medical Center — faced fewer consequences.
Punishing individuals for systemic safety failures is concerning to patient safety advocates because it is ultimately detrimental to patient safety.
Rates of medical errors — and measures of staff willingness to report them — are only revealed over time.
