The Kings have an all-time record of 7-4 in Game 7s and have won their last four.
Once upon a time, the Kings were playing in Game 7s with regularity.

     Summary: The Kings had the first crack at ending their first-round series with the Edmonton Oilers yesterday on home ice.
After conceding 10 high-danger chances during the first period, the Kings gave up just five across the final 40 minutes of play.
There’s no fear in going on the road for this game, with the Kings already winning twice in this series in Edmonton.
There’s no need to prop anyone up, no need to sell this moment as any type of experience for the Kings.
There’s no “B” game wins at this time of the year and that’s player one through player 20.
