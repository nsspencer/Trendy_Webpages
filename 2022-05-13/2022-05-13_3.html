     See Rebel Wilson Wow on the 'Senior Year' Red Carpet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rebel Wilson has been busy these days promoting her new Netflix movie, Senior Year.
In it, Rebel plays Stephanie Conway, a cheerleader who has been in a coma for 20 years.
Once she wakes up, she decides she wants to go back to high school and redo her senior year.
One of her best looks was from the movie's special screening red carpet in California.
The sequins dress, along with her beach waves, had Rebel giving off major mermaid vibes, and we loved it.

     Rebel Wilson Channels Britney Spears In A New 'Senior Year' Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rebel Wilson, 42, shows off her killer dance moves in her new movie, Senior Year.
The actress brought out her inner pop star by recreating Britney Spears' "(You Drive Me) Crazy" music video.
Rebel stars in Senior Year on Netflix, which drops today.
The movie follows Rebel as she travels back in time between high school in 2002 and present day.
But when it was time for her to channel Britney, Rebel was more than ready.

     Rebel Wilson Transforms Into Britney Spears For “Crazy” Dance Scene In ‘Senior Year’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much of Senior Year—the new Netflix comedy starring Rebel Wilson that began streaming today—is spent on nostalgia.
(Almost as if the script, from writers Andrew Knauer, Arthur Pielli, and Brandon Scott Jones, were written in 2019, not 2022).
So it’s only fitting that Wilson’s character, Stephanie, would turn to Britney in a time of need.
Audiences already know Wilson can sing and dance, of course—Fat Amy didn’t turn the beat around in Pitch Perfect for nothing—but Britney’s dance moves are on a new level.
In a behind-the-scenes video released by Netflix, which you can watch above along with the full “Crazy” dance scene, Wilson said they rehearsed the number over the course of five days.

     ‘Senior Year’ Review: Rebel Wilson’s ‘Never Been Kissed’ Knockoff Trades on Cheap Nostalgia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unless, of course, they do, because that needs to happen if a Netflix comedy is going to move right along.
Little in “Senior Year” will surprise, and the film chugs through its predictable beats with good humor, but there’s not much else to recommend it.
Mostly it feels familiar, and not in an entirely unwelcome way — those “Never Been Kissed” comparisons aren’t mean ones!
Nineties and early aughties nostalgia is ripe for dissection, as is the wide, woke world of today’s teen influencers.
The same can be said for “Senior Year,” which at best is an average student just muddling through until the bell rings.

     Senior Year review – Rebel Wilson fails Netflix high school comedy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The spirit of sparky high school comedies, from Never Been Kissed to Mean Girls to Easy A, haunts Netflix’s junky “if you like…” offering Senior Year, with a progressively deafening reminder of what came before.
For where those films had charm, wit and vim, this has a stultifying absence instead, a disappointing and derivative two-hour slog down memory lane.
There’s proven comic mileage in comparing the nature of high school life then and now, something 21 Jump Street handled well, the leads forced to reconfigure their ideas of popularity and how to wear a backpack.
There’s no attempt to add any real humour or any kind of inventive spin to the performance, it just … is.
Senior Year might get a passing grade for sheer energy but for everything else, it’s a fail.
