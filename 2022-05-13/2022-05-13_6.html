     Lawyer: Brittney Griner's detention in Russia extended 30 days following court appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pretrial detention for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was extended for another 30 days by a Russian court, Griner's lawyer Alexander Boykov said.
"We did not receive any complaints about the detention conditions from our client," Boykov said.
Griner has been detained in Russia since February, when she was stopped at an airport for allegedly carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her carry-on luggage.
The WNBA continues to support Griner, placing her initials and jersey number on the sideline of every WNBA court, while also paying her full salary this season.
“Today’s news on Brittney Griner was not unexpected, and the WNBA continues to work with the U.S. government to get BG home safely and as soon as possible," a WNBA spokesperson said in a statement released to USA TODAY Sports.

     Brittney Griner's pretrial detention in Russia has been extended by a month, Russian state news reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A Russian court has extended the pretrial detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner -- held since February on accusations of drug smuggling -- by another month, Russian state news agency TASS reported Friday.
Griner, who the US government has said is being wrongfully detained , now can be held in pretrial detention at least until June 18, a court in Khimki outside Moscow ruled Friday, TASS reported, citing the court's press service.
Leaving a hearing Friday in the Khimki court, she was handcuffed, wearing an orange hooded pullover with her head down, an Associated Press photo shows.
An official from the US Embassy was able to talk with Griner on the sidelines of her hearing Friday morning, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
"The officer was able to confirm that Brittney Griner is doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances," Price said on a briefing call Friday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was unclear whether the two developments — the expedited hearing and the report in TASS — were related.
But they came 10 days after the Biden administration officially reclassified Griner’s arrest as a “wrongful detainment,” signaling U.S. officials would ramp up efforts to obtain her release rather than wait for the Russian legal system to play out.
Griner, a seven-time WNBA all-star for the Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was arrested in February at an airport outside Moscow.
Griner was returning to Russia to rejoin UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she plays during the WNBA offseason.
