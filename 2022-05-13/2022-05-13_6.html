     Lawyer: Brittney Griner's detention in Russia extended 30 days following court appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pretrial detention for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was extended for another 30 days by a Russian court, Griner's lawyer Alexander Boykov said.
"We did not receive any complaints about the detention conditions from our client," Boykov said.
Griner has been detained in Russia since February, when she was stopped at an airport for allegedly carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil in her carry-on luggage.
The WNBA continues to support Griner, placing her initials and jersey number on the sideline of every WNBA court, while also paying her full salary this season.
“Today’s news on Brittney Griner was not unexpected, and the WNBA continues to work with the U.S. government to get BG home safely and as soon as possible," a WNBA spokesperson said in a statement released to USA TODAY Sports.

     Brittney Griner's pretrial detention in Russia has been extended by a month, Russian state news reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A Russian court has extended the pretrial detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner -- held since February on accusations of drug smuggling -- by another month, Russian state news agency TASS reported Friday.
Griner, who the US government has said is being wrongfully detained , now can be held in pretrial detention at least until June 18, a court in Khimki outside Moscow ruled Friday, TASS reported, citing the court's press service.
Leaving a hearing Friday in the Khimki court, she was handcuffed, wearing an orange hooded pullover with her head down, an Associated Press photo shows.
An official from the US Embassy was able to talk with Griner on the sidelines of her hearing Friday morning, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
"The officer was able to confirm that Brittney Griner is doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances," Price said on a briefing call Friday.

A U.S. official told ESPN that the report is further validation of why Griner was recently reclassified as being wrongfully detained and evidence that Russia's judicial system is transactional.

     Summary: Updated May 13, 2022 at 1:39 PM ETMOSCOW — A Russian court has extended the pre-trial detention of WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner by one month, her Moscow lawyer tells NPR.

The State Department says it now regards Griner as wrongfully detained, a change in classification that suggests the U.S. government will be more active in trying to secure her release.
Earlier this month, the U.S. government declared Griner was "wrongfully detained" — a move that moves responsibility for her case from consular affairs to a special envoy for hostage affairs.
