     Phillies Vs. Dodgers Game Preview: Walker Buehler Starts In Place Of Clayton Kershaw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers dropped the opener of their four-game set with the Philadelphia Phillies after being unable to finish what would have been a memorable comeback.
With Kershaw and his history of back troubles, the Dodgers will err on the side of caution with their veteran left-hander who was having one of the better starts to his season in years.
Garrett Cleavinger was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City and Walker Buehler, who is on regular four-day rest, starts in place of Kershaw.
Following his complete-game shutout against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 25, which also happened to be his 100th career start, Buehler maintained he was still searching for consistency in his game.
In his most recent start against the Dodgers in 2021, Gibson allowed six earned runs and seven hits in just 4.1 innings pitched.

With the New York Mets off to such a fast start, the Philadelphia Phillies can ill afford to drop much further behind in the NL East.
We’re slightly more than a month into the season, and Philadelphia is already 6.5 games out of first place.
After shopping around, I found that WynnBET offers the Phillies with odds as high as +205.
