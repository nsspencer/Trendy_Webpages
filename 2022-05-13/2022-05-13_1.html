     Summary: Chris Paul met with the media after the Phoenix Suns lost Game 6 to the Dallas Mavericks.
The Phoenix Suns lost Game 6 to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night by a score of 113-86.
The road team in the series has looked completely lost, so it's been an extremely volatile series.
Chris Paul finished the loss with just 13 points, two rebounds and four assists, and he met with the media postgame.
Paul joined the Suns last season, and he helped them end a ten-year drought from the NBA Playoffs.

     Phoenix Suns PG Chris Paul’s playoff history in Game 7s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His stats in the final game of a series have not disappointed, averaging 20.6 points, 9.9 assists and 5.9 rebounds with a 3-4 record in seven Game 7s in his career.
The Clippers were up 19 points in the third quarter of a Game 6 and held a 13-point fourth-quarter lead.
L.A. eventually fell in the seventh game, losing the 3-1 series lead.
In the final game of his Clipper career, Paul fell short in Game 7 against the Utah Jazz in 2017.
This was undoubtedly his worst performance in a closeout game, scoring 13 points, nine assists and four rebounds on 6-of-19 shooting.

     Summary: Luka Doncic and the Mavericks have not backed down one bit in this series and now, they hold the momentum heading into Sunday’s game.
Having one last home game, Phoenix is going to be very confident, but they should absolutely be concerned after what Dallas did in Game 6.
Heading into Game 7 on Sunday, let’s take a look back on what happened in Game 6 and three key takeaways from that game.
There’s Something About That Dallas Water Phoenix Does Not LikeI do not know what it is about Dallas, but the Phoenix Suns just simply cannot win there this postseason.

With Phoenix having the advantage in the do-or-die game, their chances of getting back to the conference finals look pretty good.
Still, the same Mavs team that has made them look like chumps will be showing up for Game 7.
Homecourt advantage helps but it won’t stop Luka Doncic or the Mavs’ array of perimeter shooters alone.
