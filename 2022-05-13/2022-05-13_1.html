     Devin Booker, Chris Paul sound off on Game 7 after getting throttled by Luka Doncic, Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fresh off a 30-point thumping of the Dallas Mavericks in Tuesday’s Game 5, the Phoenix Suns nearly met that same fate in Dallas for Game 6.
The Mavs dominated the Suns in all facets of the game f0r a 113-86 final.
“Best thing about all these playoff games is that you don’t carry a 20-point lead into the next game,” said Chris Paul.
“I feel like we worked as hard as we did all season to get home court,” Suns veteran Chris Paul said.
“We’ve worked all season to have home-court advantage and get the last game at our house and it’s exciting,” said Devin Booker.

     Luka Doncic, Mavericks Have Formula to Upset Phoenix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This doesn’t look like the same 64-win Suns who cruised past the rest of the league in the regular season.
Phoenix has dropped three of the last four as Dallas evened the second-round series at three games apiece on Thursday night.
The Mavs, meanwhile, have found a winning formula, with an upset on Sunday afternoon certainly in play.
Phoenix center Deandre Ayton is an impressive player, though nobody will confuse him with Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokić.
Booker coughed up eight turnovers in Game 6—the Suns recorded 22 in total—and Phoenix was outscored by 30 points at the three-point line.
