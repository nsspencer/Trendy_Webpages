     Luka Doncic, Mavericks Have Formula to Upset Phoenix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This doesn‚Äôt look like the same 64-win Suns who cruised past the rest of the league in the regular season.
Phoenix has dropped three of the last four as Dallas evened the second-round series at three games apiece on Thursday night.
The Mavs, meanwhile, have found a winning formula, with an upset on Sunday afternoon certainly in play.
Phoenix center Deandre Ayton is an impressive player, though nobody will confuse him with Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokiƒá.
Booker coughed up eight turnovers in Game 6‚Äîthe Suns recorded 22 in total‚Äîand Phoenix was outscored by 30 points at the three-point line.

     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns are going to Game 7.
Luka Doncic and the Mavericks cruised to a 113-86 win on their home court in Game 6 on Thursday night to tie the second-round series, 3-3.

     Suns‚Äô Al McCoy Honored for 50 Seasons at the Mic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs literally the voice of the Suns,‚Äù Booker told Sportico.
He‚Äôll be only the 18th member ascending to the Rocky Mountain Southwest Golden Circle for his 50 years of broadcasting, primarily with the Suns.
He‚Äôs called more basketball games for any single NBA team than any other announcer, surpassing the Lakers‚Äô tenure of Chick Hearn, who died in 2002.
Like Wilt Chamberlain‚Äôs 100-point game or another pitcher amassing 300 Major League career wins, McCoy doesn‚Äôt think a broadcaster spending 50 consecutive years with one NBA team will happen again.
McCoy looked over to the Suns bench during the halftime ceremony and there was only one player sitting on it: Booker.
