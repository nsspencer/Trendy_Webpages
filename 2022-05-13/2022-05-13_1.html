     Jayson Tatum Had the Game of His Life to Save the Celtics’ Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a time when the Boston Celtics’ season seemed in danger of crumbling into a pile of fine dust.
There were questions about whether Jayson Tatum could coexist with Jaylen Brown — was it time for the team to consider trading Brown?
It is familiar history at this late stage of the season, but worth reiterating, especially now.
Because on Friday night, in the wake of a late-game meltdown earlier in the week, the Celtics were facing elimination in Milwaukee.
Outside of their cocoon, as they braced themselves for Game 6, the questions swirled: Had they blown their chance?

     What Celtics’ Jayson Tatum, others said about Game 7 vs. Bucks in Boston: ‘The best atmosphere in the NBA’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — The Celtics, despite all the noise they heard after their Game 5 collapse, did the improbable.
The Celtics get a win-or-go-home game on their home court after they beat the Bucks in Game 6 in an impressive bounce-back game.
And this current group of Celtics — whether it’s Tatum, Jaylen Brown or Marcus Smart — know what it’s like to play a Game 7 in a juiced-up Garden atmosphere.
“The best atmosphere in the NBA, and Game 7s are the biggest and best games.
So there’s also some history between the Bucks, Celtics and Game 7 in Boston.

     Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum drops 46 points in 'signature game' to force Game 7 in NBA playoffs semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum and Giannis Antetokounmpo combine for 90 points in an incredible Game 6 that sees the Celtics come out on top.
Two nights prior, the Boston Celtics had a prime opportunity to take control of the NBA playoffs semifinal series but let Game 5 slip through their hands.
"That's why he gets paid the big bucks," Celtics guard Marcus Smart said.
Tatum, Brown and Smart combined for 89 of Boston's 108 points as Brown went for 22 and Smart had 21.
Still, the series comes down to one very meaningful game, something the Celtics players can't wait to be a part of.

     Celtics vs. Bucks: Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo go blow-for-blow in a heavyweight bout for the ages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jayson Tatum gave us a heavyweight bout for the ages on Friday, combining for 90 points on 62 shots.
Think about the history of the Boston Celtics, and Tatum is now just the second player in franchise history, joining Sam Jones, to post multiple 45-point playoff games.
Tatum's 46 is also the second-highest output for a Boston player in an elimination game, tied with Paul Pierce.
Tatum, however, has more dependable offensive help in Brown and Smart and I would bet on a big Al Horford game, too.
However it works out, what a brawl between two of the best players in the game we got on Friday.

     Jayson Tatum’s superstar moment helps Celtics send series vs. Bucks to Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum willed Boston to that point with a season-saving 46-point, nine-rebound, four assist showing to lift the Celtics to a 108–95 victory over Milwaukee in Game 6.
The Bucks got their own incredible performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 44 points, 20 rebounds and six assists in the losing effort.
With the sixth game of this fantastic series in the books, we outlined six key takeaways from Boston’s win.
(Somewhat surprisingly, Allen—just 4-for-20 in the series from deep—came out and started the second half despite his awful showing.)
When White entered the game just four minutes earlier, Boston had been up by just three.
