     'Legacies' Cancelled After Four Seasons on The CW
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLLIDER VIDEO OF THE DAYUniting characters from both preceding shows, Legacies debuted in 2018 and was an instant hit with fans.
Legacies follows Hope as she attends the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted – a haven where supernatural beings can learn to control their abilities and impulses.
Legacies has survived unfavorable odds before, which is why news of Legacies’ cancellation will come as surprise to those who have followed the show for many years.
Concluding at four seasons, Legacies was not able to match the durability of its parent show, The Vampire Diaries, which ran for eight seasons, and fellow TVD spinoff, The Originals, which ran for five seasons.
The fourth and final season of Legacies is currently airing.
