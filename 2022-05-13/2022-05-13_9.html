     Jarvis Landry to Saints on One-Year Deal

Additionally, Tyrann Mathieu signed a free agent deal to play with the Saints recently, a friend of Landry's.
The Browns released Landry after the two sides couldn't agree on a restructured deal.
Still 29 years old, Landry can absolutely contribute and the Saints are assembling a team they think can compete in a watered down NFC Conference.
The Browns are scheduled to host the Saints including Jarvis Landry in week 16 of the regular season on Saturday, December 24th.

     Jarvis Landry strikes deal to join New Orleans Saints in homecoming move
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver agreed to terms Friday with the New Orleans Saints on a one-year contract.
Two days before the official start of NFL free agency, the Browns released Landry on March 14 in a cost-saving move.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said May 10 on “The Pat McAfee Show” the Browns offered Landry “a pretty nice one-year deal,” but he rejected the proposal.
On March 28, agent Roosevelt Barnes told the Beacon Journal there was “some mutual interest” between Landry and the Browns.
In four seasons with the Browns, Landry made two of his five Pro Bowls (2018 and 2019) and started 56 of his 59 games in the regular season.
