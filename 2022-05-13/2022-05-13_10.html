     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C. — As the WNBA season began last week, amid the backdrop of on-court logos advertising "BG 42" at every arena, the league and its players spoke about their dismay regarding Brittney Griner's detainment in Russia on drug-related charges.
Accused of carrying cannabis oil in her luggage and smuggling a narcotic substance, Griner has been detained since mid-February, and publicly, there’s been little movement on her case.

     Brittney Griner's pretrial detention in Russia has been extended by a month, Russian state news reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A Russian court has extended the pretrial detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner -- held since February on accusations of drug smuggling -- by another month, Russian state news agency TASS reported Friday.
Griner, who the US government has said is being wrongfully detained , now can be held in pretrial detention at least until June 18, a court in Khimki outside Moscow ruled Friday, TASS reported, citing the court's press service.
Leaving a hearing Friday in the Khimki court, she was handcuffed, wearing an orange hooded pullover with her head down, an Associated Press photo shows.
An official from the US Embassy was able to talk with Griner on the sidelines of her hearing Friday morning, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
"The officer was able to confirm that Brittney Griner is doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances," Price said on a briefing call Friday.

     Summary: Associated PressMOSCOW— The lawyer for WNBA star Brittney Griner said Friday her pre-trial detention in Russia has been extended by one month.
Alexander Boykov told The Associated Press he believed the relatively short extension of the detention indicated the case would come to trial soon.
The Biden administration says Griner, 31, is being wrongfully detained.
The Russians have described Griner’s case as a criminal offense without making any political associations.
Ambassador John Sullivan had a meeting with Russian counterparts but would not say whether Griner was discussed or talk any further about her case.

     Summary: Updated May 13, 2022 at 1:39 PM ETMOSCOW — A Russian court has extended the pre-trial detention of WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner by one month, her Moscow lawyer tells NPR.
Griner had just arrived in Russia to play for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the country's professional women's basketball league.
Rick Scuteri / AP / AP Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner during Game 2 of the WNBA Finals against the Chicago Sky on Oct. 13, 2021.
The State Department says it now regards Griner as wrongfully detained, a change in classification that suggests the U.S. government will be more active in trying to secure her release.
Earlier this month, the U.S. government declared Griner was "wrongfully detained" — a move that moves responsibility for her case from consular affairs to a special envoy for hostage affairs.

     With trial looming, WNBA star Brittney Griner faces strict Russian drug laws
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian drug laws are widely considered draconian and the country imprisons more people per capita for drug crimes compared with the rest of Europe, according to The Moscow Times.
Griner, 31, has been held on drug smuggling charges since February when she was found in Moscow's airport allegedly possessing cannabis-derived vape cartridges.
"They're going to try and horse trade," Salvo, a former diplomat at the State Department who had worked in Russia, said.
"The State Department can't storm the Russian prison to bring her home," Salvo said.
"There's a delicate dance their families have to do with trying to raise attention with the State Department and Congress while not wanting to inflame Russia," Salvo said.
