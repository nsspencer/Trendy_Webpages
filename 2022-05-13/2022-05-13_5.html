     Lawyer: Brittney Griner's detention in Russia extended 30 days following court appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pretrial detention for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was extended for another 30 days by a Russian court, Griner's lawyer Alexander Boykov said.
"We did not receive any complaints about the detention conditions from our client," Boykov said.
Griner has been detained in Russia since February, when she was stopped at an airport for allegedly carrying vape cartridges with cannabis oil cartridges in her carry-on luggage.
The U.S. government has said the 31-year-old two-time Olympic gold medalist was wrongfully detained and that they are working to obtain her release.
The WNBA continues to support Griner, placing her initials and jersey number on the sideline of every WNBA court, while also paying her full salary this season.

     Brittney Griner's pretrial detention in Russia has been extended by a month, Russian state news reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A Russian court has extended the pretrial detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner -- held since February on accusations of drug smuggling -- by another month, Russian state news agency TASS reported Friday.
Griner, who the US government has said is being wrongfully detained , now can be held in pretrial detention at least until June 18, a court in Khimki outside Moscow ruled Friday, TASS reported, citing the court's press service.
Leaving a hearing Friday in the Khimki court, she was handcuffed, wearing an orange hooded pullover with her head down, an Associated Press photo shows.
An official from the US Embassy was able to talk with Griner on the sidelines of her hearing Friday morning, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
"The officer was able to confirm that Brittney Griner is doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances," Price said on a briefing call Friday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MOSCOW -- The lawyer for Brittney Griner said Friday that the WNBA star's pretrial detention in Russia has been extended by one month.
Alexander Boykov told The Associated Press he believed the relatively short extension of the detention indicated the case would come to trial soon.
A U.S. official told ESPN that the report is further validation of why Griner was recently reclassified as being wrongfully detained and evidence that Russia's judicial system is transactional.
As we have stated repeatedly, the Russian system wrongfully detained Ms. Griner," a State Department official said.
The Biden administration says Griner, 31, is being wrongfully detained.
