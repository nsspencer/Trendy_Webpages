     Findings in New Study May Reveal Possible Cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study from researchers in Australia found that babies classified under SIDS deaths had lower levels of an enzyme that can play a role in regulating breathing.
SIDS is defined by the CDC as "the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation."
Such deaths often happen during sleep or within a baby’s sleep area.
U.S. officials say the cause of SIDS remains unknown.
Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area.

     Study identifies potential biomarker for SIDS, but a test for it is a long way off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Australian researchers say they've identified one potential biomarker for sudden infant death syndrome, known as SIDS, but experts caution that it's just one piece of the puzzle.
About 3,400 babies die from SIDS in the US each year.
BChE is an enzyme of the cholinergic system, part of the autonomic system, which controls functions like blood pressure and breathing.
The study authors say more research is needed to determine whether BChE tests might be able to identify and prevent future SIDS cases.
Smoking during pregnancy is one of the risk factors for SIDS, along with things like family history and premature birth.

     Researchers find cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articleScientists have published a new study that may offer groundbreaking insight into Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), an occurrence that has previously baffled the medical community.
In the latest study, researchers found that infants who died from SIDS had lower levels of an enzyme known as Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).
"We conclude that a previously unidentified cholinergic deficit, identifiable by abnormal -BChEsa, is present at birth in SIDS babies and represents a measurable, specific vulnerability prior to their death," the researchers stated.
We have found the first marker to indicate vulnerability prior to death," Harrington said in a news release.
While the sample size is limited, the study seems to indicate that lower levels of this enzyme are associated with a higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome.

     Does a new study solve the mystery of sudden infant deaths?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australian researchers believe they know what causes sudden infant death syndrome.
Known and unknownThe Centers for Disease Control and Preventioncounts about 3,400 sudden, unexpected infant deaths each year in the United States.
“The infant’s vulnerability lies latent unless subjected to an exogenous stressor during the critical period,” the study said.
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with a three-fold increase in risk of sudden infant death, they noted, along with impairment of the autonomic system.
But there are still sudden, unexpected infant deaths and the declines have since leveled off.

     SIDS study shows the risks of science hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even though the study points in a promising direction for future research, it isn’t a panacea, experts say.
“There is nothing definitive about this at all,” said Rachel Moon, a researcher studying sudden infant death syndrome at the University of Virginia, in an email to The Verge.
SIDS refers to the sudden and often unexplained death of an infant one years old or younger.
Taking a close look at this SIDS study, published in the journal EBioMedicine last week, shows that it was very small — it included blood samples from 67 infants who died and 10 who survived.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that the enzyme is responsible for SIDS or has a role in an infant’s death.
