     Summary: Tennessee nurse convicted in lethal drug error sentenced to three years probationEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicole Hester/AP Nicole Hester/APRaDonda Vaught, a former Tennessee nurse convicted of two felonies for a fatal drug error, whose trial became a rallying cry for nurses fearful of the criminalization of medical mistakes, will not be required to spend any time in prison.
Smith said the Murphey family suffered a "terrible loss" and "nothing that happens here today can ease that loss."
The judge noted that Vaught had no criminal record, has been removed from the health care setting, and will never practice nursing again.
Vaught, 38, a former nurse at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, faced up to eight years in prison.
Other nurses and nursing experts have told KHN that overrides are routinely used in many hospitals to access medication quickly.

     Ex-Tennessee nurse RaDonda Vaught sentenced to probation in patient medication death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A former Tennessee nurse whose medication error killed a patient was sentenced to three years of probation Friday as hundreds of health care workers rallied outside the courthouse, warning that criminalizing such mistakes will lead to more deaths in hospitals.
A state judge imposed the sentence on RaDonda Vaught after she apologized to relatives of the victim, Charlene Murphey, and said she’ll be forever haunted by her mistake.
The relief came after the health care workers spent hours in the sun and cling onto every word of the judge’s lengthy sentencing explanation for several minutes, some linked in a chain with hands locked.
Vaught, 38, injected the paralyzing drug vecuronium instead of the sedative Versed into 75-year-old Charlene Murphey on Dec. 26, 2017.
There was also no scanner in the imaging area for Vaught to scan the medication against the patient’s ID bracelet.
