     Peloton Teases Rowing Machine Coming to Its Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During an event on Friday, Peloton confirmed it will add a rowing machine to its lineup of fitness equipment.
The company didn't release specifics but said the rowing machine is "coming soon."
"The rumors are true -- Peloton will be bringing its best-in-class fitness experience to the world of rowing," the company said in a blog post.
Peloton briefly showed off the new rowing machine in a promo during its Homecoming event and also posted it to social media.
Last month, Peloton revealed it was lowering equipment costs and raising subscription prices as part of an attempt to rejuvenate its business.

     Summary: Peloton punctuated a rough week with a bright spot, teasing the next major addition to its home exercise offerings.
In a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, the connected fitness brand confirmed the forthcoming release of a home rowing machine.
It appears to be an all-black sit-down machine with a standard resistance cable and a large display for watching Peloton’s fitness courses.
The system was briefly unveiled as part of its two-day “Member Event.” The company notes, “Peloton will be bringing its best-in-class fitness experience to the world of rowing!
Rowing machines have become an increasingly popular third option for full-body workouts, after fitness bikes and treadmills.

     First Glimpse Of The Peloton Rowing Machine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hot on the heels of its last new piece of fitness kit – the Peloton Guide workout camera – Peloton has announced it will be launching a rowing machine in the near future.
If that appeals, start saving now, because it’s likely the Peloton rower will follow the lead of the Peloton Bike and Tread by being very expensive – the cheapest Peloton Bike is currently £1,345 (reduced from £1,550) and the Tread is £2,445 (reduced from £2,545), and that’s before you consider the £39.99 monthly subscription you need to access the classes.
We rate the Peloton Tread as one of the best treadmills available, and the Bike delivers the best home spinning experience you’ll find on any exercise bike.
The Peloton rower was announced as part of the company’s keynote speech, with the major software announcement being that Peloton users will soon be able to schedule workouts with friends so you can all sweat together.
New accessibility features for the Peloton Tread were also announced at the keynote.

     Peloton is finally launching its long-rumored rowing machine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Peloton finally teased its upcoming rowing machine, which has been rumored since 2020.
Peloton's foray into rowing has been rumored since as far back as 2020, when Bloomberg reported that Peloton was working on a rowing machine.
9to5Google reported last August that Peloton could be building a rowing machine, after spotting language about rowing in an update to its Android app.
In February, The Financial Times reported that Peloton would debut the rowing machine at its Homecoming event and that employees had already been testing the machine at home.
Peloton cofounder and chief product officer Tom Cortese told The Verge in a recent interview that the rowing machine "feels like the worst-kept secret on Earth."

     Summary: The Fifth Circuit lifted an injunction on the law Wednesday pending appeal, offering no opinion laying out their decision.
“The divided panel’s shocking decision to greenlight an unconstitutional law—without explanation—demanded the extraordinary response of seeking emergency Supreme Court intervention,” Chris Marchese, counsel for NetChoice, told Protocol.
The law also, not coincidentally, contains provisions that aim to prohibit tech platforms from walling off their services in Texas altogether.
The Texas law declares that these platforms are common carriers and therefore can be subject to these speech requirements.
The Texas case could now be decided on the court’s shadow docket, through which it issues orders without hearing arguments.

     Peloton teases new rower at Homecoming event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year, the big tease is that Peloton officially confirmed a connected rower is coming.
Rumors about the rower have been floating around since 2018, when Bloomberg reported that Peloton had plans to launch it in 2020.
Ahead of Peloton’s Homecoming announcement, I got to speak with co-founder and chief product officer Tom Cortese about the decision, as well as Peloton’s other Homecoming announcements.
Quarter after quarter, the company’s monthly churn rate — the percentage of Peloton users who cancel their membership — stays under one percent.
But perhaps the one that will make Peloton diehards most excited is that the company is reopening its Peloton Studios.
