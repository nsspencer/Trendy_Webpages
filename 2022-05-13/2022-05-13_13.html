     Summary: Senator Rand Paul said that the U.S. doesn't need to be a "sugar daddy" for Ukraine while speaking about his move to block the quick passage of a new aid package for Ukraine worth about $40 billion.
Paul, a Republican lawmaker from Kentucky, made the comments Friday while speaking on The Clay Travis &amp; Buck Sexton Show.
We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy," Paul tweeted Friday regarding his decision.
They’ll eventually pass the spending without me, as they always do, but at the very least they need to include oversight.

     Summary: “My oath of office is to the national security of the United States of America,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.
While most senators were unified, Paul blocked unanimous consent for the Ukraine aid package and demanded change to the legislation.
“It’s clear from the junior senator from Kentucky’s remarks, he doesn’t want to aid Ukraine,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wanted the Senate to follow the House’s example and quickly pass the package.
The aid package would provide $40 billion in military and humanitarian aid.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Sen. Rand Paul blocked the Senate from passing a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine this week, derailing a plan to fast-track legislation his fellow Kentuckian, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, supported.
McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were working together to try to get the aid approved Thursday.
They were willing to let senators vote separately on Paul's proposed amendment, which would have needed 60 votes to pass, rather than add it directly into the aid package before senators vote to approve it.

The junior senator from Kentucky is preventing swift passage of Ukraine aid because he wants to add, at the last minute, his own changes directly into the bill.

     Summary: Ukraine's top diplomat criticized Sen. Rand Paul for delaying aid to Kyiv.
Paul singlehandedly stalled a $40 billion aid bill intended to support Ukraine as it battles Russia.
Paul delayed "much needed support" that could save lives, Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.
@POTUS, @SecBlinken, @SenateGOP, @SenateDems and American people were in strong support, and @RandPaul delayed so much needed support," Kuleba tweeted.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also ripped into Paul for delaying the bill.
