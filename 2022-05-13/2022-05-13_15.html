     Summary: Senator Rand Paul said that the U.S. doesn't need to be a "sugar daddy" for Ukraine while speaking about his move to block the quick passage of a new aid package for Ukraine worth about $40 billion.
Paul, a Republican lawmaker from Kentucky, made the comments Friday while speaking on The Clay Travis &amp; Buck Sexton Show.
We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy," Paul tweeted Friday regarding his decision.
They’ll eventually pass the spending without me, as they always do, but at the very least they need to include oversight.

     Sen. Rand Paul stalls $40 billion in Ukraine aid, breaking with Mitch McConnell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Sen. Rand Paul blocked the Senate from passing a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine this week, derailing a plan to fast-track legislation his fellow Kentuckian, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, supported.
McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer actually were working together to try to get the aid approved Thursday.
He's from KentuckyThey were willing to let senators vote separately on Paul's proposed amendment, which would have needed 60 votes to pass, rather than add it directly into the aid package before senators vote to approve it.
Schumer derided Paul's intransigence in his own speech on the Senate floor, noting that "the vast majority" of Democratic and Republican senators support the aid package.
The junior senator from Kentucky is preventing swift passage of Ukraine aid because he wants to add, at the last minute, his own changes directly into the bill.

     Summary: Ukraine's top diplomat criticized Sen. Rand Paul for delaying aid to Kyiv.
Paul singlehandedly stalled a $40 billion aid bill intended to support Ukraine as it battles Russia.
Paul delayed "much needed support" that could save lives, Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.
@POTUS, @SecBlinken, @SenateGOP, @SenateDems and American people were in strong support, and @RandPaul delayed so much needed support," Kuleba tweeted.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also ripped into Paul for delaying the bill.

     Summary: With the Senate poised to debate and vote on the package of military and economic aid, Paul denied leaders the unanimous agreement they needed to proceed.
The legislation has been approved overwhelmingly by the House and has strong bipartisan support in the Senate.
It was also a brazen rebellion against his fellow Kentucky Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The bipartisan backing for Ukraine has been partly driven by accounts of Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians that have been impossible to ignore.
"It bears directly on America’s national security and vital interests that Russia’s naked aggression not succeed and carries significant costs.”Biden administration officials have said they expect the latest aid measure to suffice through September.
