     'The Lincoln Lawyer' Season 2: Cast, Plot, Potential Premiere Date &amp; What To Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lincoln Lawyer — which may be a familiar title to some — is headed to the streamer for its first season.
Given the deep well of source material, it’s easy to wonder if there will be a Season 2 of The Lincoln Lawyer.
The reason why the title may sound so familiar is because it’s the same name as the 2011 film The Lincoln Lawyer, which starred Matthew McConaughey.
As of yet, there’s been no announcement of a Season 2 for The Lincoln Lawyer, nor has Netflix hinted at a potential sophomore season.
Just because plans haven’t been announced, however, doesn’t mean that there isn’t a chance of more Michael Haller.

     The Lincoln Lawyer Review: A CBS Series on Netflix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lincoln Lawyer has all the ingredients to be a success behind the camera, and with Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the most important character in the show, Mickey Haller, is in safe hands.
It’s easy to see why he’s such a successful defense attorney even before he opens his mouth to reveal wisdom.
LisaGay Hamilton’s Judge Holder is a brilliant bit of casting opposite Haller; she’s no-nonsense and dry, and seems completely immune to his charms while still hoping for the best out of him.
The Lincoln Lawyer‘s roots as a CBS procedural are very much evident, particularly in the first half of the season.
Haller bounces around from case to case while digging in where he can on the show’s central issue and his very important client.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a TV critic, I watch a lot of TV shows.
Its appeal comes from being something familiar done very well, and it's the kind of series Netflix should be making all the time.
The dialogue is sharp and witty, just like co-creator Kelley's other iconic legal series such as NBC's "The Practice" or Fox's "Ally McBeal."
After a long day, a nice episode of "The Lincoln Lawyer" feels just right.

So on that day it was like, “No, I guess they’re really going to do it.

     Summary: But his involvement in high school theater led him to study acting in California at the New York Film Academy.
I went back to Mexico, and the agent was like, “You have to be here.” I decided to move here.
I remember getting out of the audition, and all that emotion that didn’t come out during the audition just started pouring out.
A lot of Mexican actors that I know come here for two months, it doesn’t work quickly, and they go back.
