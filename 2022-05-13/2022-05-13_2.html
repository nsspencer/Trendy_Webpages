     Summary: Veteran actor Fred Ward, who parlayed rugged everyman looks into a lengthy career playing everything from historic American heroes to a monster-fighting repairman, has died, his representative said Friday.
Ward played Gus Grissom, one of the seven pioneering astronauts who launched America into the space age.
But Ward was also no stranger to more daring art house fare, starring in 1990’s “Henry &amp; June” as American novelist Henry Miller.
He played Eddie Velcoro, the father of Detective Ray Velcoro, played by Colin Farrell.
The actor is survived by his wife of 27 years, Marie-France Ward, and son Django Ward, according to Hoffman.

     Summary: Updated May 13, 2022 at 10:44 AM ETActor Fred Ward has died, according to his publicist, Ron Hofmann.
The star, who brought gentlemanly gruffness to films that included The Right Stuff, Henry and June and The Player died Sunday, May 8 at the age of 79.
Ward brought reservoirs of tenderness to his tough guy roles, and plenty of street credibility.
"The unique thing about Fred Ward is that you never knew where he was going to pop up, so unpredictable were his career choices," Hofmann wrote in an email.
Ward is survived by his wife of 27 years, Marie-France Ward and his son Django Ward.

     Summary: Fred Ward, who starred in films including “Henry and June,” “Tremors,” “The Right Stuff” and “The Player,” died May 8, his publicist confirmed to Variety.
Ward brought his trademark grit to his portrayal of the courageous, intelligent astronaut Gus Grissom in 1983’s “The Right Stuff,” Philip Kaufman’s epic story of the early space program.
After a small role in “Tilt” (1979), starring Brooke Shields, Ward essayed his first substantial film role in “Escape From Alcatraz” that same year.
Fred Ward is an underused and underrated actor, an everyman who can deliver dialogue with a fresh tilt that works for many of his characters.
