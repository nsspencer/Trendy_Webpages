     The Phoenix Suns Weren’t Supposed to Get Pushed to Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If one believes in trends, it seems likely that the Phoenix Suns will win Sunday’s do-or-die Game 7 against the Dallas Mavericks in their Western Conference semifinal series.
After all, the home team has won every game of this playoff series.
by far, and especially not after the Suns dominated their first two games against a Dallas team with limited playmaking outside of its star, Luka Doncic.
On Thursday night, the Suns had a chance to send the Mavericks home for the summer, only to lay an egg.
“I don’t have enough time to talk about everything that’s eating at me,” Suns Coach Monty Williams told reporters after the game.

     Phoenix Suns-Dallas Mavericks Game 7 start time revealed for Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns will host Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Dallas Mavericks at 5:00 p.m. on Sunday.
The home team has won every game in the series so far, which should bode well for the Suns.
Game time was not determined until the result of Game 6 of the series between the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics.
It is the first Game 7 the Suns have hosted since 2006 when Phoenix beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference semifinals, 127-107.
The Suns also hosted Game 7 in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 121-90.

     Suns’ X-Factor in Game 7 vs. Mavs, and it’s not Devin Booker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To the surprise of many, the Dallas Mavericks have taken the Phoenix Suns to a Game 7 in the Western Conference semifinals.
They will need to bounce back in a big way in Game 7 to keep their title aspirations alive.
In a nutshell, the Suns need to flush this outing down the toilet but also learn from it and make the necessary adjustments for the series-clincher.
While Willie Green’s squad did take the Suns six games, Paul rose to the occasion and took over when Booker missed time due to a hamstring injury.
They’re going to be hungry for the upset, therefore the Suns need to bring their best on Sunday.

In theory, and based on the way that the series is gone, the Suns should win Game 7 at home.

     Summary: Luka Doncic and the Mavericks have not backed down one bit in this series and now, they hold the momentum heading into Sunday’s game.
Having one last home game, Phoenix is going to be very confident, but they should absolutely be concerned after what Dallas did in Game 6.
Heading into Game 7 on Sunday, let’s take a look back on what happened in Game 6 and three key takeaways from that game.
There’s Something About That Dallas Water Phoenix Does Not LikeI do not know what it is about Dallas, but the Phoenix Suns just simply cannot win there this postseason.
