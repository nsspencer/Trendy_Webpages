     Fred Ward, Star of ‘The Right Stuff’ and ‘Henry and June,’ Dies at 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But his more subtle talents as an actor were on vivid display in “Henry and June” (1990), a steamy account of the Parisian love triangle that Miller had with his wife, June (Uma Thurman), and the diarist Anaïs Nin (Maria de Medeiros) in the 1930s.
“My rear end seemed to have something to do with it,” Mr. Ward said of the threatened X rating, though his was not the only rear end on display.
“Because women were the instigators as much as men in this film, that may have been threatening to some people,” he told The Washington Post in 1990.
“Or that may be a cockamamie theory of mine.”In harmony with Miller’s appetite for living and his bawdy humor, Mr. Ward captured his working-class Brooklyn origins and accent, as well as the rascally, bohemian joy he took in flouting convention.
He shaved his head to resemble Miller’s and studied videotapes of the aged Miller to imitate his tics.

     Summary: Veteran actor Fred Ward, who parlayed rugged everyman looks into a lengthy career playing everything from historic American heroes to a monster-fighting repairman, has died, his representative said Friday.
Ward played Gus Grissom, one of the seven pioneering astronauts who launched America into the space age.
But Ward was also no stranger to more daring art house fare, starring in 1990’s “Henry &amp; June” as American novelist Henry Miller.
He played Eddie Velcoro, the father of Detective Ray Velcoro, played by Colin Farrell.
The actor is survived by his wife of 27 years, Marie-France Ward, and son Django Ward, according to Hoffman.

     Summary: Updated May 13, 2022 at 10:44 AM ETActor Fred Ward has died, according to his publicist, Ron Hofmann.
The star, who brought gentlemanly gruffness to films that included The Right Stuff, Henry and June and The Player died Sunday, May 8 at the age of 79.
Ward brought reservoirs of tenderness to his tough guy roles, and plenty of street credibility.
"The unique thing about Fred Ward is that you never knew where he was going to pop up, so unpredictable were his career choices," Hofmann wrote in an email.
Ward is survived by his wife of 27 years, Marie-France Ward and his son Django Ward.

     Actor Fred Ward, of ‘Tremors,’ ‘The Right Stuff’ fame, dies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Fred Ward, a veteran actor who brought a gruff tenderness to tough-guy roles in such films as “The Right Stuff,” “The Player” and “Tremors,” has died.
One early big role was alongside Clint Eastwood in 1979′s “Escape From Alcatraz.”“I mourn the loss of Fred Ward, who was so kind to me when we worked together on ‘Remo Williams,’” actor Kate Mulgrew tweeted.
Based on the book by Anais Nin and directed by Philip Kaufman, Ward played novelist Henry Miller, opposite Nin and his wife, June.
Ward demonstrated his comedy chops playing a terrorist intent on blowing up the Academy Awards in “Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult” in 1994.
Ward is survived by his wife of 27 years, Marie-France Ward and his son, Django Ward.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fred Ward, who starred in films including “Henry and June,” “Tremors,” “The Right Stuff” and “The Player,” died May 8, his publicist confirmed to Variety.
Ward brought his trademark grit to his portrayal of the courageous, intelligent astronaut Gus Grissom in 1983’s “The Right Stuff,” Philip Kaufman’s epic story of the early space program.
After a small role in “Tilt” (1979), starring Brooke Shields, Ward essayed his first substantial film role in “Escape From Alcatraz” that same year.
Fred Ward is an underused and underrated actor, an everyman who can deliver dialogue with a fresh tilt that works for many of his characters.
Variety said: “Fred Ward is particularly good as the partners’ superior, Master Sgt.

I worked with Fred on The Right Stuff, and he was such a great, warm guy.
He really had the right stuff of acting, honest, subtle, deep.
https://t.co/np0H8IlLHG — Barbara Hershey (@BarbaraHershey8) May 13, 2022Great pleasure working with @mariademedeiros and the late Fred Ward in HENRY &amp; JUNE.
