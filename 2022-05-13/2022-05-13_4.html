     Blood marker identified for babies at risk of SIDS hailed as 'breakthrough'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Jorge Silva/NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - A team of Australian researchers have identified a biochemical marker in the blood that could help identify newborn babies at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a breakthrough they said creates an avenue to future tragedy-preventing interventions.
In their study, babies who died of SIDS had lower levels of an enzyme called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) shortly after birth, the researchers said.
Using dried blood spots taken at birth as part of a newborn screening program, Harrington's team compared BChE levels in 26 babies who later died of SIDS, 41 infants who died of other causes, and 655 surviving infants.
Harrington lost her own child to SIDS 29 years ago and has dedicated her career to researching the condition, according to the statement.
Further research "needs to be undertaken with urgency" to determine whether routine measurement of BChE could potentially help prevent future SIDS deaths, the investigators said.

     Findings in New Study May Reveal Possible Cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study from researchers in Australia found that babies classified under SIDS deaths had lower levels of an enzyme that can play a role in regulating breathing.
SIDS is defined by the CDC as "the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation."
Such deaths often happen during sleep or within a baby’s sleep area.
U.S. officials say the cause of SIDS remains unknown.
Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area.

     Study identifies potential biomarker for SIDS, but a test for it is a long way off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Australian researchers say they've identified one potential biomarker for sudden infant death syndrome, known as SIDS, but experts caution that it's just one piece of the puzzle.
About 3,400 babies die from SIDS in the US each year.
BChE is an enzyme of the cholinergic system, part of the autonomic system, which controls functions like blood pressure and breathing.
The study authors say more research is needed to determine whether BChE tests might be able to identify and prevent future SIDS cases.
Smoking during pregnancy is one of the risk factors for SIDS, along with things like family history and premature birth.

     SIDS study shows the risks of science hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even though the study points in a promising direction for future research, it isn’t a panacea, experts say.
“There is nothing definitive about this at all,” said Rachel Moon, a researcher studying sudden infant death syndrome at the University of Virginia, in an email to The Verge.
SIDS refers to the sudden and often unexplained death of an infant one years old or younger.
Taking a close look at this SIDS study, published in the journal EBioMedicine last week, shows that it was very small — it included blood samples from 67 infants who died and 10 who survived.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that the enzyme is responsible for SIDS or has a role in an infant’s death.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australian researchers believe they know what causes sudden infant death syndrome.
Known and unknownThe Centers for Disease Control and Preventioncounts about 3,400 sudden, unexpected infant deaths each year in the United States.
“The infant’s vulnerability lies latent unless subjected to an exogenous stressor during the critical period,” the study said.
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with a three-fold increase in risk of sudden infant death, they noted, along with impairment of the autonomic system.
But there are still sudden, unexpected infant deaths and the declines have since leveled off.

     Summary: May 13, 2022expert reaction to study attempting to identify cause of and biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)A study published in eBioMedicine identifies a possible biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
“It is a small study but is well done – it is excellent science but the number of babies in it who died of SIDS is small.
“At the individual baby level, 50% of the babies in this study who died of SIDS had butyrylcholinesterase levels in the same range as healthy babies.
“In the study the authors had little information about the individual babies (for correct information governance reasons).
By contrast, we know that smoking in pregnancy increases the risk by 400% – so this is a small risk by comparison.
