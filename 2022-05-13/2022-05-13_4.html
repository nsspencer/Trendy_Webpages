    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Media coverage is suggesting that there is new research pinpointing the cause of SIDS and allowing doctors to test for it.
The paper is an interesting and solid contribution and we are very happy to see it in press,” SIDS researcher Dr. Richard Goldstein said.
The study measured an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and found that BChE levels at birth were significantly lower in babies who later died of SIDS.
“There is a lot of work to do before understanding how specifically [BChE] can identify risk,” Dr. Goldstein said.
It’s a big deal.”The study does show promise, though; Dr. Goldstein said it could help increase awareness of the disease.

     Study: Low enzyme activity may be cause behind sudden death infant syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers believe they may have found the cause behind sudden infant death syndrome.
SIDS accounts for more than one-third of sudden, unexpected deaths among infants each year in the U.S.
That means if a child stopped breathing while they slept, the brain defect would prevent them from waking up.
Researchers at The Children's Hospital Westmead in Sydney compared blood samples from newborns who died from SIDS and from healthy babies,They found that babies who died of SIDS had lower activity of the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), than healthy babies.
Parents have been previously advised that they should lay babies on their backs, keep toys and blankets out of the crib and not letting babies overheat as ways to prevent SIDS.

     Enzyme in babies’ blood linked to risk of sudden infant death syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study is the first to identify a biochemical marker in the blood that is linked to the risk of Sids, sometimes called cot death, when an apparently healthy infant dies during their sleep.
Harrington and colleagues compared dried blood samples taken during the newborn heel prick test from 655 healthy babies, 26 babies who died from Sids and 41 babies who died in infancy from other causes.
They found that the Sids babies had lower levels of an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a major role in the brain’s arousal pathway.
Although the Sids babies had lower levels on average, there was also a lot of overlap between the groups, with about half of the Sids babies falling within the same range as half of the babies who did not die.
Babies with low BChE had a 1.1-1.5 times higher risk of Sids.

     Summary: Australian researchers believe they know what causes sudden infant death syndrome.
Known and unknownThe Centers for Disease Control and Preventioncounts about 3,400 sudden, unexpected infant deaths each year in the United States.
“The infant’s vulnerability lies latent unless subjected to an exogenous stressor during the critical period,” the study said.
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with a three-fold increase in risk of sudden infant death, they noted, along with impairment of the autonomic system.
But there are still sudden, unexpected infant deaths and the declines have since leveled off.

“It is a small study but is well done – it is excellent science but the number of babies in it who died of SIDS is small.
“At the individual baby level, 50% of the babies in this study who died of SIDS had butyrylcholinesterase levels in the same range as healthy babies.
“In the study the authors had little information about the individual babies (for correct information governance reasons).
By contrast, we know that smoking in pregnancy increases the risk by 400% – so this is a small risk by comparison.
