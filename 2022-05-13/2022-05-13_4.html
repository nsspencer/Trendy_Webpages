     Findings in New Study May Reveal Possible Cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study from researchers in Australia found that babies classified under SIDS deaths had lower levels of an enzyme that can play a role in regulating breathing.
SIDS is defined by the CDC as "the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation."
Such deaths often happen during sleep or within a baby’s sleep area.
U.S. officials say the cause of SIDS remains unknown.
Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area.

She said she "never really got answers" when she lost her infant to SIDS when she was just 19.
I lost my first son at 38 weeks, told SIDS in utero.
Last year my cousin's baby also died of SIDS and I just watched it hurt her all over again."

     SIDS study shows the risks of science hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even though the study points in a promising direction for future research, it isn’t a panacea, experts say.
“There is nothing definitive about this at all,” said Rachel Moon, a researcher studying sudden infant death syndrome at the University of Virginia, in an email to The Verge.
SIDS refers to the sudden and often unexplained death of an infant one years old or younger.
Taking a close look at this SIDS study, published in the journal EBioMedicine last week, shows that it was very small — it included blood samples from 67 infants who died and 10 who survived.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that the enzyme is responsible for SIDS or has a role in an infant’s death.

     Does a new study solve the mystery of sudden infant deaths?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australian researchers believe they know what causes sudden infant death syndrome.
Known and unknownThe Centers for Disease Control and Preventioncounts about 3,400 sudden, unexpected infant deaths each year in the United States.
“The infant’s vulnerability lies latent unless subjected to an exogenous stressor during the critical period,” the study said.
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with a three-fold increase in risk of sudden infant death, they noted, along with impairment of the autonomic system.
But there are still sudden, unexpected infant deaths and the declines have since leveled off.

     Potential cause of sudden infant death syndrome identified
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Few words strike fear into the heart of parents like sudden infant death syndrome.
SIDS usually befalls infants before 6 months of age, and during sleep, leaving no certain cause of death.
“This finding represents the possibility for the identification of infants at risk for SIDS infants prior to death and opens new avenues for future research into specific interventions,” the authors concluded in their study.
Researchers now hope their work will be used to develop screening protocols for babies at risk of developing SIDS.
In the meantime, the findings allowed Harrington to put the mystery of her son’s death to rest.

     Summary: May 13, 2022expert reaction to study attempting to identify cause of and biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)A study published in eBioMedicine identifies a possible biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
“It is a small study but is well done – it is excellent science but the number of babies in it who died of SIDS is small.
“At the individual baby level, 50% of the babies in this study who died of SIDS had butyrylcholinesterase levels in the same range as healthy babies.
“In the study the authors had little information about the individual babies (for correct information governance reasons).
By contrast, we know that smoking in pregnancy increases the risk by 400% – so this is a small risk by comparison.
