     Blood marker identified for babies at risk of SIDS hailed as 'breakthrough'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Jorge Silva/NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - A team of Australian researchers have identified a biochemical marker in the blood that could help identify newborn babies at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a breakthrough they said creates an avenue to future tragedy-preventing interventions.
In their study, babies who died of SIDS had lower levels of an enzyme called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) shortly after birth, the researchers said.
Using dried blood spots taken at birth as part of a newborn screening program, Harrington's team compared BChE levels in 26 babies who later died of SIDS, 41 infants who died of other causes, and 655 surviving infants.
Harrington lost her own child to SIDS 29 years ago and has dedicated her career to researching the condition, according to the statement.
Further research "needs to be undertaken with urgency" to determine whether routine measurement of BChE could potentially help prevent future SIDS deaths, the investigators said.

     Summary: “Media coverage is suggesting that there is new research pinpointing the cause of SIDS and allowing doctors to test for it.
The paper is an interesting and solid contribution and we are very happy to see it in press,” SIDS researcher Dr. Richard Goldstein said.
The study measured an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and found that BChE levels at birth were significantly lower in babies who later died of SIDS.
“There is a lot of work to do before understanding how specifically [BChE] can identify risk,” Dr. Goldstein said.
It’s a big deal.”The study does show promise, though; Dr. Goldstein said it could help increase awareness of the disease.

     Fact Check: Have Scientists Found the Cause of SIDS?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a tragic medical phenomenon in which children younger than the age of one die with no known cause.
One popular post, which had gained over 100,000 likes by Friday in less than 24 hours, read: "They found the cause of SIDS".
But care should be taken when declaring that scientists have found a "cause" of SIDS.
In other words, it might help doctors tell which babies are at risk for SIDS and find out ways to help them.
The Lullaby Trust, a British charity that raises awareness of SIDS, warned against reports that a cause of SIDS had been found on Friday.

     Enzyme in babies’ blood linked to risk of sudden infant death syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study is the first to identify a biochemical marker in the blood that is linked to the risk of Sids, sometimes called cot death, when an apparently healthy infant dies during their sleep.
Harrington and colleagues compared dried blood samples taken during the newborn heel prick test from 655 healthy babies, 26 babies who died from Sids and 41 babies who died in infancy from other causes.
They found that the Sids babies had lower levels of an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a major role in the brain’s arousal pathway.
Although the Sids babies had lower levels on average, there was also a lot of overlap between the groups, with about half of the Sids babies falling within the same range as half of the babies who did not die.
Babies with low BChE had a 1.1-1.5 times higher risk of Sids.

"We know babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their stomachs or sides.
Keep baby's sleep area in the same room where you sleep for the first 6 months or, ideally, for the first year.
"Place your baby's crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard in your bedroom, close to your bed.
Keep soft objects, loose bedding and other items out of the baby's sleep area.

     SIDS breakthrough? Possible sudden infant death syndrome biomarker identified
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Babies at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) could be identified through a biochemical marker, a new study published in The Lancet’s eBioMedicine finds.
SIDS is the unexplained death of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old, typically during sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Researchers investigating the cause of SIDS at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead (CHW) in Australia said they identified the first biochemical marker that could help detect babies more at risk of sudden infant death syndrome while they are still alive.
We have found the first marker to indicate vulnerability prior to death," Harrington said in a news release.
While the sample size is limited, the study seems to indicate that lower levels of this enzyme are associated with a higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome.
