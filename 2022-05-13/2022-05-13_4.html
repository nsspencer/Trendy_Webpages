     Summary: “Media coverage is suggesting that there is new research pinpointing the cause of SIDS and allowing doctors to test for it.
The paper is an interesting and solid contribution and we are very happy to see it in press,” SIDS researcher Dr. Richard Goldstein said.
The study measured an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and found that BChE levels at birth were significantly lower in babies who later died of SIDS.
“There is a lot of work to do before understanding how specifically [BChE] can identify risk,” Dr. Goldstein said.
It’s a big deal.”The study does show promise, though; Dr. Goldstein said it could help increase awareness of the disease.

     Blood marker identified for babies at risk of SIDS hailed as 'breakthrough'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Jorge Silva/NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - A team of Australian researchers have identified a biochemical marker in the blood that could help identify newborn babies at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a breakthrough they said creates an avenue to future tragedy-preventing interventions.
In their study, babies who died of SIDS had lower levels of an enzyme called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) shortly after birth, the researchers said.
Using dried blood spots taken at birth as part of a newborn screening program, Harrington's team compared BChE levels in 26 babies who later died of SIDS, 41 infants who died of other causes, and 655 surviving infants.
Harrington lost her own child to SIDS 29 years ago and has dedicated her career to researching the condition, according to the statement.
Further research "needs to be undertaken with urgency" to determine whether routine measurement of BChE could potentially help prevent future SIDS deaths, the investigators said.

     Findings in New Study May Reveal Possible Cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study from researchers in Australia found that babies classified under SIDS deaths had lower levels of an enzyme that can play a role in regulating breathing.
SIDS is defined by the CDC as "the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation."
Such deaths often happen during sleep or within a baby’s sleep area.
U.S. officials say the cause of SIDS remains unknown.
Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area.

     Summary: The AAP offers these additional sleep safety recommendations for babies:1.
"We know babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their stomachs or sides.
Keep baby's sleep area in the same room where you sleep for the first 6 months or, ideally, for the first year.
"Place your baby's crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard in your bedroom, close to your bed.
Keep soft objects, loose bedding and other items out of the baby's sleep area.

     SIDS study shows the risks of science hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even though the study points in a promising direction for future research, it isn’t a panacea, experts say.
“There is nothing definitive about this at all,” said Rachel Moon, a researcher studying sudden infant death syndrome at the University of Virginia, in an email to The Verge.
SIDS refers to the sudden and often unexplained death of an infant one years old or younger.
Taking a close look at this SIDS study, published in the journal EBioMedicine last week, shows that it was very small — it included blood samples from 67 infants who died and 10 who survived.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that the enzyme is responsible for SIDS or has a role in an infant’s death.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Experts say the new study is interesting but urge caution about interpreting the findings.
CNN —Australian researchers say they’ve identified one potential biomarker for sudden infant death syndrome, known as SIDS, but experts caution that it’s just one piece of the puzzle.
Experts don’t know which babies are at risk for SIDS or what causes it.
The study authors say more research is needed to determine whether BChE tests might be able to identify and prevent future SIDS cases.
Smoking during pregnancy is one of the risk factors for SIDS, along with things like family history and premature birth.
