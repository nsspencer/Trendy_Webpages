     Study identifies potential biomarker for SIDS, but a test for it is a long way off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Australian researchers say they've identified one potential biomarker for sudden infant death syndrome, known as SIDS, but experts caution that it's just one piece of the puzzle.
About 3,400 babies die from SIDS in the US each year.
BChE is an enzyme of the cholinergic system, part of the autonomic system, which controls functions like blood pressure and breathing.
The study authors say more research is needed to determine whether BChE tests might be able to identify and prevent future SIDS cases.
Smoking during pregnancy is one of the risk factors for SIDS, along with things like family history and premature birth.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‚ÄúMedia coverage is suggesting that there is new research pinpointing the cause of SIDS and allowing doctors to test for it.
The paper is an interesting and solid contribution and we are very happy to see it in press,‚Äù SIDS researcher Dr. Richard Goldstein said.
The study measured an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and found that BChE levels at birth were significantly lower in babies who later died of SIDS.
‚ÄúThere is a lot of work to do before understanding how specifically [BChE] can identify risk,‚Äù Dr. Goldstein said.
It‚Äôs a big deal.‚ÄùThe study does show promise, though; Dr. Goldstein said it could help increase awareness of the disease.

     Enzyme in babies‚Äô blood linked to risk of sudden infant death syndrome
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The study is the first to identify a biochemical marker in the blood that is linked to the risk of Sids, sometimes called cot death, when an apparently healthy infant dies during their sleep.
Harrington and colleagues compared dried blood samples taken during the newborn heel prick test from 655 healthy babies, 26 babies who died from Sids and 41 babies who died in infancy from other causes.
They found that the Sids babies had lower levels of an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a major role in the brain‚Äôs arousal pathway.
Although the Sids babies had lower levels on average, there was also a lot of overlap between the groups, with about half of the Sids babies falling within the same range as half of the babies who did not die.
Babies with low BChE had a 1.1-1.5 times higher risk of Sids.

     Summary: The AAP offers these additional sleep safety recommendations for babies:1.
"We know babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their stomachs or sides.
Keep baby's sleep area in the same room where you sleep for the first 6 months or, ideally, for the first year.
"Place your baby's crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard in your bedroom, close to your bed.
Keep soft objects, loose bedding and other items out of the baby's sleep area.

     SIDS study shows the risks of science hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even though the study points in a promising direction for future research, it isn‚Äôt a panacea, experts say.
‚ÄúThere is nothing definitive about this at all,‚Äù said Rachel Moon, a researcher studying sudden infant death syndrome at the University of Virginia, in an email to The Verge.
SIDS refers to the sudden and often unexplained death of an infant one years old or younger.
Taking a close look at this SIDS study, published in the journal EBioMedicine last week, shows that it was very small ‚Äî it included blood samples from 67 infants who died and 10 who survived.
That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the enzyme is responsible for SIDS or has a role in an infant‚Äôs death.

     Summary: May 13, 2022expert reaction to study attempting to identify cause of and biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)A study published in eBioMedicine identifies a possible biomarker for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
‚ÄúIt is a small study but is well done ‚Äì it is excellent science but the number of babies in it who died of SIDS is small.
‚ÄúAt the individual baby level, 50% of the babies in this study who died of SIDS had butyrylcholinesterase levels in the same range as healthy babies.
‚ÄúIn the study the authors had little information about the individual babies (for correct information governance reasons).
By contrast, we know that smoking in pregnancy increases the risk by 400% ‚Äì so this is a small risk by comparison.
