     Summary: So, what gives with Evil Dead: The Game not being on Steam?
Evil Dead game on Steam: Is it an Epic Games Store exclusive?
Evil Dead: The Game is not on Steam, and the developers have not announced any intention to bring the game to that particular platform.
Well, it looks like the game's developer (Saber Interactive) and publisher (Boss Team Games) have opted to strike a deal with the Epic Games Store instead.
If you play on console as well as PC, you can pick up Evil Dead: The Game from the Xbox Store or the PlayStation Store if you don't fancy going down the Epic Games Store route.

     Evil Dead The Game review in progress – hail to the king, baby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a relative late-comer to the Evil Dead fandom, I had a short – but very intense – period of excitement prior to the release of Saber Interactive’s asymmetrical action-horror: Evil Dead The Game.
Evil Dead The Game really is a treat for fans of the Evil Dead franchise – as well as being a treat for general fans of the horror genre or asymmetrical multiplayer games.
Without this mechanic, which might seem like a superficial addition to the game at first, I fear Evil Dead The Game would be more hack-and-slash than horror.
I have spent most of my time playing Evil Dead The Game, so far, as a Survivor.
Whether you’re playing with your friends against the forces of evil, or taking control of those forces of evil yourself, you’re in for a fun time with Evil Dead The Game.
