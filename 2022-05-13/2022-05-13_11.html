    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leading the series 3-2, the Kings entered Crypto.com Arena on Thursday night with a chance to close out the Edmonton Oilers season.
The tightly contested battle saw a Kings team fight back from an early deficit and give themselves a chance to win the game late in the third.
Continuing the Oilers trend of scoring early in a period was Evander Kane, who deflected in a Brett Kulak point shot 1:50 into the second period.
The comeback Kings then tied the game 29 seconds into the third period when Carl Grundstrom rifled home a wrist shot beating Mike Smith blocker-side.
The Oilers would take back the lead when they capitalized on a Kings defensive breakdown, leading to a Tyson Barrie goal in the slot with 5:10 remaining in the game.

     Summary: The Kings had the first crack at ending their first-round series with the Edmonton Oilers yesterday on home ice.
After conceding 10 high-danger chances during the first period, the Kings gave up just five across the final 40 minutes of play.
There’s no fear in going on the road for this game, with the Kings already winning twice in this series in Edmonton.
There’s no need to prop anyone up, no need to sell this moment as any type of experience for the Kings.
There’s no “B” game wins at this time of the year and that’s player one through player 20.
