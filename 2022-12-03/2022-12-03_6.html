     Summary: 5) Quarterback quartet includes two intriguing seniorsThe College Football Playoff games traditionally have set the stage for at least one quarterback due to enter the upcoming NFL draft.
Since the inception of the CFB Playoff in the 2014 season, each year has featured at least one quarterback drafted in the first four rounds the following April.
That span has included playoff games from eventual top-five picks Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray, Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa.
Even still, Bennett's toughness, smarts, better-than-average arm and other intangibles are likely to land him on an NFL roster.
But his improved accuracy, rugged toughness, running ability, experience and ability to deliver in the clutch are a bit more appreciated now.
