     Summary: CNN —Sunday’s round of 16 fixtures feature the 2018 World Cup winner, the current African champion and one of the Euro 2020 finalists.
Euro 2020 finalist England comes in as heavy favorites having reached the World Cup semifinals in 2018.
England has faced African opposition 20 times, including seven World Cup matches, and has yet to lose.
Although African nations have lost eight of their nine World Cup knockout round games against European sides, the lone exception was one which featured Senegal’s current manager, Aliou Cisse.
“They’ve had to defend a lot in the group stage and they defended very well.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ENGLAND 3-0 SENEGAL FT: France await in the quarter-finals!
If you'd told me after 35 minutes that England would go on to win this game 3-0, I would have found it difficult to believe.
After a bright start from Gareth Southgate's team, Senegal has grown into the contest and created the two best chances.
There wasn't much to report after that, with Southgate's team taking their foot off the pass and Senegal not creating a single chance of note.
England cruised to victory and a place in the quarter-finals, where they surely won't have it as easy against France.
