     Summary: Kevin Holland was compromised from the first round going forward in the UFC on ESPN 42 main event, according to his team.
Holland (23-9 MMA, 9-6 UFC) suffered a fourth-round TKO defeat by corner stoppage against Stephen Thompson (17-6-1 MMA, 12-6-1 UFC) in Saturdayâ€™s welterweight headliner at Amway Center in Orlando, Fla.
He hardly threw the right hand as the rounds wore on, and it was obvious something was wrong after he was much more reckless in exchanging during the opening frame.
@Trailblaze2top broke his right hand landing a cross in the first round.

Shortly before either of those superfights take place, the UFC has put together an eight-man tournament in the absolute division.
Faber will be taking on a tough opponent in Elias Anderson, the reigning CJJ Bantamweight world champion.

If Wonderboy can continue putting on performances like this, there's no reason he shouldn't be in UFC Fight Night main events like this or on pay-per-view main cards a few times a year.
There are plenty of up-and-coming strikers the UFC can throw at Wonderboy to see if they can hang.
