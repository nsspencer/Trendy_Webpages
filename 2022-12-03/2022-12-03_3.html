     Surprise! Keke Palmer announces pregnancy and SZA reveals album release date on ‘SNL’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Host Keke Palmer and musical guest SZA had some big news to share on this weekend’s episode of “Saturday Night Live.”During her opening monologue, Palmer dramatically revealed her pregnancy by showing off her baby bump for the first time on live TV.
Later in the show, SZA announced the release date for her next album while performing her latest single, “Shirt.”“I’m especially glad to be here ... because there’s some rumors going around,” Palmer told the studio audience.
After soaking in the applause and doing a little happy dance on stage, Palmer couldn’t help but laugh as she struggled to button her coat back up.
“I was trying so hard to keep it on the down-low, ‘cause I got a lot of stuff going on, you know?
“Y’all know I’m the same person I always been, and I’m proud of that.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Dec. 3, Keke Palmer confronted rumors when she revealed her baby bump on stage while hosting “Saturday Night Live."
Mitchell reprised his role in the sketch, briefly reuniting with Kenan and his beloved orange soda before being tragically gunned down.
The sketch portrays Walker as a hapless fool, unable to comprehend the most straightforward statements and filled with childlike excitement.
During “Weekend Update,” co-host Colin Jost said, “The Georgia Senate runoff set records for early voting.
It was “Kenan and Kelly," not "Kenan and Keke."

     Saturday Night Live Recap: Baby, She’s Keke Palmer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seldom since “It’s Britney, bitch” has any star asserted her identity with as much dominance as Keke Palmer in her Saturday Night Live debut.
“Baby, I’m Keke Palmer.”She then spends the rest of the show revealing just who that is and why she’s a force to be reckoned with.
All the heavy lifting she is tasked with in the Kenan and Kelly sketch draws on her extensive comedy background.
She’s Keke Palmer, baby.
If anyone has ever been as luminous, charming, funny, and yet somehow still relatable in an SNL monologue before, it’s news to me.
