     Colorado Introduces Deion Sanders With Rousing Press Conference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Less than 24 hours after winning the SWAC championship as the coach of Jackson State, Deion Sanders addressed the media in his first press conference as the new football coach at Colorado.
Coach Prime expressed in a rousing monologue that he hoped to completely revamp the program and bring the school back to achieve its ultimate goal: winning.
“The thing that alarms me the most is just because I’m leaving Jackson, they think that I’m leaving African Americans.
I don’t know if you noticed or not, but I’m Black,” Sanders said.
The wideout surely won’t be the last top prospect to make way for Boulder as Coach Prime assured fans Sunday that recruiting moves were already being made as he spoke.

     Deion Sanders is hired as the next football head coach for the University of Colorado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Football legend Deion Sanders has been named the new University of Colorado football head coach, the school announced Saturday.
The Tigers won the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) championship earlier Saturday, defeating Southern University 43-24.
“There were a number of highly qualified and impressive candidates interested in becoming the next head football coach at Colorado, but none of them had the pedigree, the knowledge and the ability to connect with student-athletes like Deion Sanders,” Colorado athletic director Rick George said in a statement.
In October, Colorado fired Karl Dorrell after an 0-5 start and an 8-15 overall record in three years as head coach.
Interim head coach Mike Sanford went 1-6 as the Buffaloes finished the season with the worst record in the Pac-12 Conference.

     Summary: Deion Sanders is taking over as head coach at ColoradoEnlarge this image toggle caption Rogelio V. Solis/AP Rogelio V. Solis/APBOULDER, Colo. — Deion Sanders is taking over as head coach at Colorado, bringing his charisma and larger-than-life persona to a beleaguered Pac-12 program that's plunged to the bottom of college football.
"In coaching you either get elevated or you get terminated," Sanders told his team.
Moving to Jackson State, Sanders called the fit "a match made in heaven," and quickly lifted the school in Mississippi's capital.
Sanders told the team he was recommending to Robinson and the Jackson State administration that receivers coach T.C.
Taylor be the next head coach.
