    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest trailer for HBO's upcoming TV adaptation of The Last of Us contains a rather notable callback to The Last of Us Part II.
Within the past day, HBO finally showed off our best look so far at The Last of Us via a new video that dropped in proximity to Brazil Comic-Con.
During the final minute or so of this new The Last of Us trailer, a version of the song "Take On Me" by a-ha can be heard.
The Last of Us is set to premiere next month on HBO and HBO Max on January 15th.

     The Last Of Us TV Show Gets Longer, Chattier Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last Of Us TV series has had a couple of trailers, one very short and one a bit longer, but both of those were very much of the teaser variety, keeping things close to their chest and only showing brief flashes of scenery and action.
HBO released a third trailer over the weekend, however, and this one has a lot more going on.
Clocking in at over two minutes long, this trailer actually features extended looks at scenes from the series, and in particular exchanges between some of the main characters.
Then again this is just a two-minute trailer, so who knows how faithful the actual series will be!

     HBO’s The Last of Us stuns in second trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After several years of lacklustre video game adaptations, it’s no surprise that fans have treated HBO’s The Last of Us TV show with a sense of caution.
There was certainly excitement for the upcoming adventure, although there was just as much trepidation as casting news and first images appeared.
Now, a second trailer for the series has given fans a renewed sense of hope.
Read: HBO’s The Last of Us TV show gets first major trailerIt also introduces the original voice of Ellie, Ashley Johnson, who will play Ellie’s mother in flashbacks.
Likewise, Joel’s original voice actor, Troy Baker, appears in the trailer – seemingly as a henchman in a wandering gang of rebels.

     Summary: “That’s something Ellie would appreciate,” says the co-president of video game developer Naughty Dog, name-checking the female lead in The Last of Us.
He’s sitting in the TV room of his four-bedroom, five-bathroom Santa Monica residence, a contemporary two-story he purchased in 2019 that reflects his rich inner life and vivid imagination.
Hired initially just to zhuzh up his office, Gordon ended up reimagining the entire house.
A display of his guitars alongside a distressed leather chair became an invitation — now, when work feels stressful, Druckmann noodles on them.
The video game developer has even come around to the couch Gordon suggested he install in the primary bath.
