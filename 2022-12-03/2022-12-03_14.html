     Noodle the pug, bones or no-bones TikTok star, dies at 14: 'He made millions of people happy'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noodle, the pug who became TikTok famous for his bones or no-bones days videos, has died.
What more can you hope for in the life of a dog," Graziano said in a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday.
Is it a bones or no-bones day?
On no-bones days, as explained in the description of Granzino's "Noodle and the No Bones Day" book, Noodle wasn't sick or sad – he just needed to take it easy.
May it forever be a bones day," Doug the Pug's Twitter account wrote on Saturday.

     Noodle The Pug, The Viral 'No Bones Day' TikTok Dog, Has Passed Away.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noodle, the senior pug who went viral for his “bones or no bones day” ritual, has passed away at the age of 14.
Noodle first went viral in 2021 when Graziano started posting videos giving daily horoscope-like readings with Noodle as the prime indictator of whether it would be a “bones or no bones day.” Granziano determined this by sitting the pug on a dog bed, and if Noodle stayed standing, it was a good day, aka a bones day.
If he flopped over like the silly pug he was, it was a no bones day, which gave viewers permission to partake in some self-care.
He even served as the inspiration for a children’s book called Noodle and the No Bones Day, which was published earlier this year.
It’s a no bones day for everyone today.

     Noodle, the TikTok famous 'bones or no bones' pug, has died
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Noodle, the geriatric pug who captured hearts across the internet for his “bones or no bones” ritual, has died at age 14, his owner says.
Jonathan Graziano, Noodle’s owner, announced that his beloved dog died on Friday, in a tearful update posted to his TikTok and Instagram.
In each video, Graziano would sit Noodle upright to see if the dog could stand on his own.
If he stood up by himself, it was a “bones day” – which quickly became internet code for a day to get out of bed and make the most of your day.
On the other hand, if the pug flopped back over, it was a “no bones day” – aka a day for self-care and relaxation.
