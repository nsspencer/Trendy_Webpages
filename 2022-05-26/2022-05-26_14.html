     Klay Thompson drops epic shimmy after 3-pointer in Warriors-Mavericks Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson wasn't messing around the first half of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals on Thursday night at Chase Center.
After his fourth 3-pointer gave the Warriors a 45-32 lead, Thompson did an incredible shimmy as the Mavericks were forced to call a timeout.
KLAY REALLY JUST HIT A SHIMMY ðpic.twitter.com/8KKkCNIWSW — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) May 27, 2022Usually, it's Steph Curry doing the the celebratory shimmy, but in this case, his Splash Brother got in on the act.
Thompson and the Warriors are looking to punch a ticket to their sixth NBA Finals in the last eight seasons.
If the Warriors can close out the Mavericks in Game 5, the three-time NBA champion can shimmy all night long.

     3 Reasons Klay Thompson is hurting the Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson has long been one of the Golden State Warriors‘ best assets but his first postseason back from injury has left some questions regarding his status with the team.
The Golden State Warriors have oddly played better when Klay Thompson is on the bench this postseason.

The Warriors are playing significantly better defense without Thompson and their overall net rating shoots through the roof when he is on the bench.
Today, we look at how the Warriors have played better without Thompson — and why Klay is still one of the best and most important members of the team.

     Klay Thompson's Emotional Reaction to Reaching Finals Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this close-out game, they were led by Klay Thompson, who shared his emotional reaction after the game.
"I should've had 10 threes, I left like three on the board tonight," Klay joked before revealing what this moment meant to him.
I don't wanna get emotional, but I can't believe we're back.
Thompson's 32 points in this close-out game helped propel the Warriors back to a place where they have now been six of the last eight seasons.
To have a close-out game like this, to send his team back to the Finals, is an example of why that mindset makes him who he is.

     Summary: Game 6 Klay was born during the 2016 Western Conference Finals and came to life again in Game 6 of the 2022 Western Conference semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies.
But on Thursday, Klay Thompson unleashed Game 6 Klay a game early.
Thompson and the Golden State Warriors were hosting the Dallas Mavericks for Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals.
Despite Golden State taking a 3-1 series lead into Game 5, Thompson’s performance had not been especially strong.
If he has found his shooting form, Golden State will be even better going forward.
