     Heat's Tyler Herro: Listed questionable for Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herro (groin) is questionable for Friday's Game 6 at Boston.
Herro missed Game 4 and Game 5 -- both Heat losses -- due to the strained left groin he sustained during Game 3.
With their backs against the wall, the Heat are hoping to get the Sixth Man of the Year back Friday, but it's far from a guarantee.
With Herro out, the Heat managed just 82 and 80 points, respectively, in Games 4 and 5.

     Patrick Beverley takes possible shot at Tyler Herro after ECF Game 5: ‘I don’t even think he could have did anything if he played’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herro is dealing with an injury right now that has forced him to miss pivotal playoff games.
“Tyler Herro, I don’t even think he could have did anything if he played, man” he said.
He’s averaging just 13.5 points per game in the playoffs, a far fall from his regular season average of 20.7 points per game.
Now, with Game 6 on the horizon and the Heat’s season on the line, the team will have to dig deep to try to get a win and force a Game 7.
Whether or not Herro is able to play in the upcoming Game 6 remains to be seen.

     Patrick Beverley drops brutal Tyler Herro truth bomb on Heat after Game 5 loss to Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat suffered a disheartening 93-80 loss to the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night as they now see themselves down 3-2 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Injuries played a major role in Miami’s lackluster performance on Wednesday and among them was Sixth Man of the Year winner Tyler Herro being forced to sit out again due to a groin injury.
If you ask Minnesota Timberwolves guard Patrick Beverley, however, he believes that Herro wouldn’t have made much of a difference for the Heat anyway:“I mean, if he was to play, could he have done more?
“… Tyler Herro, I don’t even think he could have did anything if he played.
Patrick Beverley appears to be on this same boat.
