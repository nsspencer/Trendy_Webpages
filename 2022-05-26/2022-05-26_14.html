[Isles]Perfect coincidental timing: As Frans Nielsen announces his retirement, the newest Weird Islanders podcast has Dan and Mike talking to Steve about Weird Frans, Valtteri Filppula.
[LHH]Revisiting the Lightning’s 10 toughest opponents during their 10 consecutive series wins: The 2020-21 Islanders obviously top the list.
[Isles]According to CapFriendly, the Islanders signed forward Ruslan Iskhakov to an ELC just ahead of the deadline to do so.
Then Nathan MacKinnon completed a hat trick and would-be late game-winner with THIS (note the position of his blade on the actual shot...not easy):NATHAN MACKINNON IS THAT DUDE.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cale Makar boarded a plane bound for St. Louis, leaving behind one thing he doesn’t fully believe travels from game to game or city to city — momentum.
The Colorado Avalanche hope the young defenseman is right after squandering a three-goal lead in an overtime loss.
The St. Louis Blues are eager to prove that feeling false.
This (loss) is in the past and momentum doesn’t carry from game to game.”The Blues were 56 seconds away from the curtain closing on their season.
“I personally felt bad after the game because (MacKinnon) put us on his back and he should have won us that game and unfortunately we couldn’t get it,” Makar said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Avs swept both games at St. Louis after a poor showing in Game 2 at Ball Arena that evened the Western Conference semifinals 1-1.
The Blues limited Colorado to just 11 shots in the second and third periods after the Avs had 18 in the opening frame.
Colorado was clearly the better team in the first half of the game and St. Louis dominated the final period.
“I don’t have any different thoughts this morning on last night’s game than I had last night,” Bednar said.
You learn from it,” he said from DIA before boarding a charter flight to St. Louis.
