     Yankees News: Matt Carpenter Signs Contract After Rangers Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Curry/Getty ImagesThe New York Yankees media announced Thursday that infielder Matt Carpenter has signed a major league contract with the team and has been added to the 26-man roster.
New York placed Josh Donaldson, Joey Gallo and Kyle Higashioka on the COVID-19 injured list earlier this week.
The Yankees placed Giancarlo Stanton on the 10-day IL Wednesday because of ankle inflammation, and Gallo was reinstated.
He went on the injured list with a lower back strain and a right foot contusion, finishing the year hitting .226.
The Yankees need depth because of Stanton's injury and the other players who are unavailable while on the COVID-19 injured list.
