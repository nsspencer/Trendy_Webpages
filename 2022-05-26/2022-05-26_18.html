     Andor Is the First Star Wars Show for Disney That 'Doesn't Lean' on StageCraft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since the debut of the first teaser trailer for Andor, many have commented on the impressive way the upcoming Star Wars show looks.
Starting with the first season of The Mandalorian, LucasFilm has used a new technology called StageCraft which utilizes an immersive CGI screen that wraps around the set to create the faraway worlds of Star Wars.
“We haven’t been working with Stagecraft at all for our show, no,” says Andor executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg in an interview with IGN at Star Wars Celebration.
“It is the first Star Wars show for Disney Plus that has not been leaning into that technology.”LoadingWohlenberg says that the decision to shoot on camera was simply a result of Tony Gilroy’s writing, which didn’t lend itself to StageCraft.
Check out the first trailer for Andor as well as the rest of our coverage from Star Wars Celebration, including a breakdown of the Andor trailer, and how Deborah Chow utilized a Vader specialist on set for Obi-Wan.
