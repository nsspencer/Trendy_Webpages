     Summary: In the end, Maryanne Oketch was crowned the champion of Survivor 42.
Maryanne, Mike, and Romeo were Survivor 42's Top 3 and got the chance to make a case to the jury on why they deserve to win.
Of course, for Black players, that's such a powerful thing.
But having representation in age and diversity and socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation, that's such a powerful thing.

     Survivor Winner Talks Wild Final Tribal, Impact of Ousting Omar: 'I Would've Burned Every Bridge If That Flopped'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s… that’s a lot.
I’m still trying to go and sit in the fact that I’m a Survivor winner.
When I went into final Tribal, I kind of had a feeling like, “Oh my goodness, I think I’m gonna win.” But people kept asking Mike questions, and I was like, “Oh my goodness, I miscalculated.
But I really didn’t think I’d be able to beat them in the final thee, which is why at the final eight, seven and six, I targeted them.
I just graduated from my master’s a couple of weeks ago, so I think I’m going to be taking a year off and working.

     Summary: “I was so, so close to playing my idol,” Maryanne told Lindsay and the jury about the final-five vote.
In a throwback to old seasons, we saw the jury members talking briefly about the final three, before the final Tribal Council.
Lindsay, Maryanne, and Mike seemed like they had a chance; Jonathan and Romeo did not.
“Every single Tribal” Romeo said.
“Cheers for the most unlikely final three,” Maryanne said on the morning of the final Tribal Council.
