     Carnival ship catches fire, leaving passengers awaiting rescue cruise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadA Carnival Cruise Line ship caught fire Thursday morning while docked in Grand Turk, leaving passengers stuck until another ship on a rescue mission this weekend.
Passengers were allowed to leave the ship to spend the day in Grand Turk.
The cause of the blaze was not clear, and the cruise line did not say how much damage was caused.
Passengers will stay onboard while a sister ship, the Carnival Conquest, makes its way to Grand Turk from Miami to pick up passengers and bring them back to Port Canaveral on Monday.
In that incident, the ship ran aground and passengers ended up being flown home under sometimes-chaotic circumstances days later.
