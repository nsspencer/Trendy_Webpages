     Summary: APCale Makar boarded a plane bound for St. Louis, leaving behind one thing he doesn't fully believe travels from game to game or city to city ‚Äî momentum.
The Colorado Avalanche hope the young defenseman is right after squandering a three-goal lead in an overtime loss.
The St. Louis Blues are eager to prove that feeling false.
This (loss) is in the past and momentum doesn‚Äôt carry from game to game."
‚ÄúI personally felt bad after the game because (MacKinnon) put us on his back and he should have won us that game and unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt get it,‚Äù Makar said.

     Summary: The Avs swept both games at St. Louis after a poor showing in Game 2 at Ball Arena that evened the Western Conference semifinals 1-1.
The Blues limited Colorado to just 11 shots in the second and third periods after the Avs had 18 in the opening frame.
Colorado was clearly the better team in the first half of the game and St. Louis dominated the final period.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any different thoughts this morning on last night‚Äôs game than I had last night,‚Äù Bednar said.
You learn from it,‚Äù he said from DIA before boarding a charter flight to St. Louis.

With 10:03 left, Thomas trimmed the team‚Äôs deficit to 3-2 on a heads-up feed from Buchnevich.
The Avs‚Äô 3-0 lead was gone with 4:46 left in regulation, so at the least, the Blues had made a game of it.
