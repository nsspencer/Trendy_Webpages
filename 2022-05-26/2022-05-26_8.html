That is because the Jets will benefit if the Rangers win this series.
One of the draft selections included was the Rangers’ 2022 second-round draft choice, but this pick was conditional.
Therefore, all the Jets need to obtain the Rangers’ first-rounder is for the Rangers to win this series over the Hurricanes.

The Rangers captured Games 3 and 4 at Madison Square Garden to even the series at two games apiece.
Whether that momentum will travel south or be thwarted by the rowdy Caniacs is a point of curiosity heading into Game 5.
If you win special teams battles over the course of a series and in every game, I think you have a pretty good chance to win."
Historically, the team that wins Game 5 in a 2-2 scenario advances 78.8% of the time, according to Hockey Reference.

     Hurricanes-Rangers Game 5: Carolina defeats New York, 3-1, takes 3-2 series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Hurricanes once again put their undefeated home record to the test against the New York Rangers in Game 5 of their second-round NHL playoff series Thursday at PNC Arena, the series tied 2-2 after the Hurricanes lost both games in New York.
How to watchTuesday’s game — and the rest of the series — is available only on ESPN (Sean McDonough, Ray Ferraro, Emily Kaplan).
Raanta locked in: After that long forecheck sequence for the Canes, the Rangers came down and had a chance against Raanta.
The Canes outshot the Rangers 11-5 in the frame, and at even strength Carolina was the better team.
That duo worked Game 7 of the first-round series against the Boston Bruins and Lee also worked Game 4 of that series.
