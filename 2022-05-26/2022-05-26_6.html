     Pooh and Piglet on a Rampage: Director Details the Plot of Upcoming ‘Winnie the Pooh’ Horror Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night we reported on an upcoming indie horror movie titled Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, of course only made possible by the original incarnation of the Winnie the Pooh characters slipping into the public domain earlier this year.
Rhys Frake-Waterfield directed the film, said to be a “horror retelling of the famous legend of Winnie the Pooh.”Speaking with Variety this morning, Waterfield spills the beans on the exact plot of the movie, teasing a wild slasher wherein Pooh and Piglet head out on a murderous adventure.
“Christopher Robin is pulled away from them, and he’s not [given] them food, it’s made Pooh and Piglet’s life quite difficult,” Waterfield details the general plot of his movie.
“Because they’ve had to fend for themselves so much, they’ve essentially become feral,” the filmmaker continues.
Amber Doig-Thorne, Maria Taylor, and Danielle Scott star in the horror movie.

     A Winnie The Pooh horror movie is on its way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Okay, so we can kind of see why Disney has kept a fanatical hold on Mickey’s copyright all this time.
A.A. Milne’s original children’s story Winnie The Pooh has been in the public domain for less than a year, and already there’s a super creepy slasher film made about the beloved bear.
Twitter was agog with the release of the first images of Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey, a British horror film that is no way, no how associated with the House of Mouse.
Stills from the new flick show grotesque, man-sized versions of Pooh and Piglet menacing a bikini clad woman in a hot tub.
Pooh Bear is hungry, and not for honey, according to director Rhys Waterfield.

     A Winnie the Pooh Horror Movie Is Coming, oh Bother
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Someone has made a Winnie the Pooh horror movie.
It's called Blood and Honey, and the first images suggest these versions of Winnie and Piglet are a bit darker than you remember.
According to IMDB, Rhys Frake-Waterfield wrote and directed the scary flick, which stars Amber Doig-Thorne, Maria Taylor and Chris Cordell as Piglet.
You'll no doubt recognize the animated version of the lovable bear seen in Disney cartoons.
Cunningly, the film seems to feature people wearing Winnie and Piglet masks, rather than a story about the actual bear which might attract the attention of Disney's legal department.

     New Horror Movie Turns Winnie the Pooh Into a Serial Killer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But can you do it with a horror version of Winnie the Pooh?
N ow that early stories of A.A. Milne’s creation have entered the public domain after being previously owned by Disney, someone’s decided to test this theory by splicing Winnie into a movie where he’s a serial killer.
It’s clearly got an indie horror box it’s sticking to, which could potentially make for a fascinating watch, if you’re into that sort of thing?
Because the film is based on the 1962 version of Winnie that’s in the public domain, that means supporting characters who are still under copyright—like Tigger—won’t be showing up in the movie.
The movie does have a distributor, but not a release date as of yet.
