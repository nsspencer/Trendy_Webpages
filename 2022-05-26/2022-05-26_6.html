     Summary: Alan White, the longtime drummer for progressive rock pioneers Yes who also played on projects with John Lennon and George Harrison, has died at 72.

In 1983 Yes released the smash hit album “90125.”AdvertisementA longtime Seattle-area resident, White was born in Pelton, County Durham, England, in 1949.
White played with bands in England throughout the 1960s.
“A voice announced, ‘Hello, this is John Lennon,’” White said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alan White, longtime drummer for prog rock band Yes, has died at home aged 72 after a short illness.
White was one of the longest-running members of the group, having joined in 1972, replacing Bill Bruford (who joined King Crimson).
Success stepped up a notch with a place in Billy Fury’s backing band, and after John Lennon saw a performance by another White band, prog rockers Griffin, he was recruited as drummer for the Plastic Ono Band.
Despite the brief addition of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (AKA the Buggles) to the group, Yes split in 1981.
“I didn’t necessarily feel betrayed, but at the same time it was something for us to deal with,” White later said.
