     'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Episode 2 reveals a surprising new take on Darth Vader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His appearance in Obi-Wan Kenobi is unlike anything we’ve ever seen Christensen do — but it’s familiar to Vader fans.
Though we do get glimpses of classic Anakin courtesy of some nightmare prequel recap in Episode 1, Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 2 is what truly drives home the tragedy of his relationship with his old master.
Anakin in his bacta tank in Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 2.
With this reveal, we can basically count on a more Vader-focused episode for Episode 3.
Hayden Christensen in scarred, pale flesh prosthetics is still Hayden Christensen, and he’ll find a way for his prequel charm to shine through.

     'Obi-Wan Kenobi': Who is Playing Young Leia Organa?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Obi-Wan Kenobi may have been tasked with watching over Luke Skywalker, but that doesn't mean he isn't as important to Luke's twin sister Leia Organa.
Princess Leia was of course made iconic by the late Carrie Fisher, who portrayed the character from 1977 until her death in 2016.
Fisher also made a posthumous appearance as Leia in The Rise of Skywalker through unused footage from The Force Awakens.
The first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi are available now, and the show will continue to air Wednesdays on Disney+.

     Obi-Wan Kenobi review – Ewan McGregor’s fight scenes are genuinely thrilling
    </h2>

     Summary: Because, to continue the meat metaphor for a moment, Obi-Wan Kenobi is connective tissue.
Kenobi left Anakin Skywalker for dead a decade ago and, realistically, it’s another decade before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope.
Consider this Obi-Wan Kenobi: The Startlingly Unnecessary Years.
However, once Obi-Wan Kenobi starts to build up a bit of momentum, a miraculous thing happens.
She’s hot-headed and impetuous and carving a straight line towards Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Obi-Wan also has plenty of history with “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” characters such as Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze who have already appeared in other live-action “Star Wars” shows.
While any crossover seems unlikely, viewers will just have to wait and see if any other familiar faces appear in “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”
