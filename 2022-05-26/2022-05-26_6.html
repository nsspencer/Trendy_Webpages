     Summary: Two more games tonight as the second round continues with the Battle of Albert and the Hurricanes playing...somebody.

[Isles]According to CapFriendly, the Islanders signed forward Ruslan Iskhakov to an ELC just ahead of the deadline to do so.
Then Nathan MacKinnon completed a hat trick and would-be late game-winner with THIS (note the position of his blade on the actual shot...not easy):NATHAN MACKINNON IS THAT DUDE.

     Blues at home with confidence for Game 6 vs. Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadCale Makar boarded a plane bound for St. Louis, leaving behind one thing he doesn’t fully believe travels from game to game or city to city — momentum.
The Colorado Avalanche hope the young defenseman is right after squandering a three-goal lead in an overtime loss.
The St. Louis Blues are eager to prove that feeling false.
This (loss) is in the past and momentum doesn’t carry from game to game.”The Blues were 56 seconds away from the curtain closing on their season.
Advertisement“I personally felt bad after the game because (MacKinnon) put us on his back and he should have won us that game and unfortunately we couldn’t get it,” Makar said.

     Summary: He had two assists and I thought was one of the few Avs with a good game from start to finish.
Unbelievable third goal that made it 4-3, but the team couldn’t hold it together.
Almost 12 minutes played and one shot.
Just a collapse as a whole team tonight.

     ‘Resilient’ Blues pull off incredible comeback in Game 5 vs. Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blues were going to be answering questions, and a lot of them: What happened to the Pavel Buchnevich–Robert Thomas–Vladimir Tarasenko line?
Who else is FREAKING OUT 🚨🚨🚨🚨 — Molly Bozak (@MollyBozak) May 26, 2022“It’s just character and leadership,” Blues coach Craig Berube said.
With 10:03 left, Thomas trimmed the team’s deficit to 3-2 on a heads-up feed from Buchnevich.
The Avs’ 3-0 lead was gone with 4:46 left in regulation, so at the least, the Blues had made a game of it.
“That was a heck of a play,” Berube said.
