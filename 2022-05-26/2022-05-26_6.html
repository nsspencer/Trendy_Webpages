     Is Instagram Down? Login Issues Reported by Users.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some users have reported that the service appears to be experiencing technical difficulties, in particular login issues.
We found several tweets on Twitter that confirmed Instagram is down for at least a few users (as of this writing), some who mentioned login errors.
Also, never give your password or text verification code to anyone who claims they can fix login issues on any social media platform.
Readers should be cautious of any users that advise to reach out to a specific account that can supposedly help fix login errors.
ALERT: Scammers on Twitter are taking advantage of the current Instagram outage by telling people to contact specific users who can supposedly help fix their login issues.
