     Summary: UVALDE, Texas — Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, on Thursday visited Uvalde, Texas, where she donated food at a community center hosting a blood drive and laid flowers at a memorial for the victims of the elementary school shooting that killed 21 people, including 19 children.
BuzzFeed News spoke with volunteers at the Herby Ham Activity Center who accepted the duchess's donations.
According to blood drive volunteers, Meghan, wearing a baseball cap and a black mask, quietly dropped by the community center's kitchen to drop off two "large" crates filled with sandwiches, beverages, and desserts for blood donors.
She just was carrying on a conversation like her and I knew each other for years," volunteer Gloria Contreras, 40, told BuzzFeed News.
"We were just talking about, you know, the situation and what happened what we were doing here.

     Meghan Markle Traveled to Uvalde to Honor Robb Elementary Shooting Victims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But after the mass shooting in Uvalde that took the lives of 19 children and two teachers, Meghan opted for an in-person tribute at Robb Elementary School.
According to a spokesperson for the couple, Meghan traveled to Uvalde on Thursday in a personal capacity “as a mother” to express her condolences and provide support for the community.
Meghan was photographed at Robb wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and a pair of sneakers and carrying a bouquet of white roses.
She laid the roses down in front of a cross, one of 19 erected on the elementary school’s grounds to honor the victims.
When Meghan and Harry were wed in May 2018, she carried a bouquet of white roses and forget-me-nots, which were said to be Diana’s favorite flower.
