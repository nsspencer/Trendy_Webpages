     Warriors' Stephen Curry Named 2022 Western Conference Finals MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty ImagesStephen Curry was named the Magic Johnson Western Conference Finals MVP after his Golden State Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, 120-110, winning the series in five games.
Curry, 34, was excellent in the series, averaging 23.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists.
Curry is a three-time champion, eight-time All-Star, two-time MVP, two-time scoring champion and four-time first-team All-NBA selection.
The one thing that Curry has never won, however, is Finals MVP in five previous trips.
If the Warriors win a title this year, however, Curry will be the prohibitive favorite to claim the award.

(0:57)SAN FRANCISCO -- Stephen Curry celebrated the Golden State Warriors' return to the NBA Finals by adding a new trophy to his collection as he was named the first Western Conference finals Most Valuable Player on Thursday.
But now the two-time NBA MVP will be going for his fourth NBA championship.
The league introduced new trophies for the MVPs of both the Eastern Conference finals and Western Conference finals.
The NBA named the Western Conference MVP trophy after Johnson and the Eastern Conference MVP trophy after Larry Bird -- the two legends credited with raising the game to new levels in the 1980s.
