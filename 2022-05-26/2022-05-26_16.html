     'Look at Me: XXXTENTACION' develops an incomplete picture of a troubled life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Look At Me: XXXTENTACION" tries to thread a needle, celebrating the talent of the late musical star, who was murdered at age 20, and addressing his mental-health issues while acknowledging allegations of domestic violence.
Produced by his mother and his manager, the result is an awkward construct that doesn't overlook his violent behavior but occasionally downplays it.
She thinks I'm gonna kill her," Onfroy says in one recording, despite having insisted repeatedly that Ayala was lying about him.
Videos also capture various fights and assaults on others, which in essence became part of his brand.
To her credit, she also meets during the film with Ayala, who experienced threats and social-media backlash from his fans at the time because of his legal troubles.

     Summary: It’s been nearly four years since XXXTentacion was fatally shot in Deerfield Beach, Florida on June 18, 2018, and his name still evokes polarizing responses from the music world.
But on May 26, Look At Me: XXXTentacion debuted on Hulu, and the Fader Films-produced documentary explores the late rapper’s life and death in detail.
The documentary, which was directed by Sabaah Folayan, isn’t your typical cookie-cutter exploration.
In addition to the documentary, X’s estate will also be releasing a new single with Kanye West called “True Love” this Friday, which is slated to appear on Look At Me: The Album and Kanye’s Donda 2.
Complex spoke with director Sabaah Folayan about the making of Look At Me: XXXTentacion, depicting the truth, and more.

     Kanye West and XXXTentacion's "True Love": Stream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ye, aka Kanye West, has dropped his collaborative track with the late Florida rapper XXXTentacion, titled “True Love,” which originally debuted on Donda 2, the elusive Stem Player exclusive released in February.
There’s been no word yet on whether this spells an impending widespread release for West’s latest album though, and no release dates were given for either project.
“True Love” opened West’s Donda 2 listening event in Miami in February and subsequently underwent several tweaks before arriving on the Stem Player, and even more now as a fully commercially-available piece.
Check out the song’s Ye-designed cover artwork, created from scans of X’s handwritten journal entries recently found by his mother, below.
Their first shared track dropped months’ later with “One Minute,” which featured Travis Barker and appeared on X’s 2018 posthumous release Skins.

Kanye West &amp; XXXTENTACION – “True Love”﻿Hearing Kanye West and XXXTENTACION on the same track is a strange experience.

Sleepy Hallow &amp; 347aidan – “Die Young”﻿New York Drill rapper Sleepy Hallow first burst onto the scene through songs such as “Deep End Freestyle” and “6am In NY” from Sleepy Hallow Presents: Sleepy Hallow President.

But I think if you just dial down the energy level, you have a really, really common story.
