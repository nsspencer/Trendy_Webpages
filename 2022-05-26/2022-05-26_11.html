     Todd Chrisley's Former Business Partner Testifies In Fraud Case, Claims They Were Blackmailed Over Secret Gay Affair
    </h2>

     Summary: While in court for a fraud case, Todd Chrisley's former business partner Mark Braddock testified that the two had an affair in the early 2000s, and they paid nearly $40,000 when a blackmailer threatened to expose them.
According to reports, Braddock helped the patriarch commit fraud that helped the married reality star, 53, evade nearly $2 million worth of taxes.

Out of resentment, Braddock turned the father-of-five and wife Julie into the FBI and was granted immunity for doing so.
