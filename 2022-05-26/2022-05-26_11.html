     How the XXXTentacion Documentary ‘Look At Me’ Was Made
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been nearly four years since XXXTentacion was fatally shot in Deerfield Beach, Florida on June 18, 2018, and his name still evokes polarizing responses from the music world.
But on May 26, Look At Me: XXXTentacion debuted on Hulu, and the Fader Films-produced documentary explores the late rapper’s life and death in detail.
The documentary, which was directed by Sabaah Folayan, isn’t your typical cookie-cutter exploration.
In addition to the documentary, X’s estate will also be releasing a new single with Kanye West called “True Love” this Friday, which is slated to appear on Look At Me: The Album and Kanye’s Donda 2.
Complex spoke with director Sabaah Folayan about the making of Look At Me: XXXTentacion, depicting the truth, and more.

     Summary: Few fan communities have become as aware of it as rap fans.
Like many other hip-hop and rap icons, the story of XXXTentacion falls into the making of this uniquely American tragedy.
MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAYBreaking Down a Tumultuous LegacyFaded FilmsNow four years later, Hulu has released a documentary film about the young rapper and the mythology that now surrounds his legacy.
Look at Me: XXXTentacion opens up with a vlog by the rapper, in which he talks about how he is struggling mentally.
Look At Me’s strengths lie in the fact it refuses to glorify Onfroy for his music or its fame.

     Summary: Sabaah Folayan: Well, because the film was being made by people who loved him, and there's a built-in bias there.
From there, it just opened up into a really, really long conversation.
I think that's it.
But I think if you just dial down the energy level, you have a really, really common story.
And I think that's where #MeToo and cancel culture, that's the intention behind it.

     Summary: That trust is really, really important to me — and I think that audiences are intelligent, and I think they know when you’re being honest and when you’re not.
It’s funny, because a film has to make things look really linear and really neat.
But I think that you can look across TV, you can look across culture, [and see how] we’re collectively fascinated by the villains.
Why do you think X and his message resonated so much with kids, despite his being the villain and anti-hero?
What kind of father do you think X could have been?
