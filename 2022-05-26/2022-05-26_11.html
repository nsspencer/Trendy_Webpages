“Just the excellence that he demonstrated throughout his entire career.”

This is the first year that the NBA has had trophies for the most valuable player of the conference finals rounds.
But winning this award means he’s one step closer to potentially claiming his first Finals MVP trophy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are back in the NBA Finals for the 2021-22 season after defeating the Dallas Mavericks 4-1 in the Western conference finals.
One of those championship caliber pieces is point guard Stephen Curry, who is widely regarded as the greatest shooter of all-time.
He’s making his sixth Finals appearance, but will be looking for his first Finals MVP award.
That’s right; Curry has never won Finals MVP.
Andre Iguodala got the award when Golden State won in 2015, while Kevin Durant bagged MVP honors in 2017 and 2018.

     Summary: Stephen Curry has won the first ever Magic Johnson Western Conference Finals MVP award.
Last season was better, but Golden State couldn't even escape the play-in round.
He is a three-time NBA champion, but has infamously failed to win the Finals MVP award.
4, Curry will be in the running for that elusive Finals MVP award as well.
The guard that has dominated the past decade of Western Conference history has now fittingly won its first Conference Finals MVP award.
