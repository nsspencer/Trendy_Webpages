     Avalanche news: Nathan MacKinnon reacts to Game 5 collapse vs. Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That setback also put to waste a spectacular effort from Avs center Nathan MacKinnon, who had scored his first three goals of the series in that contest.
MacKinnon was not one to feel very dejected though after such a gut-wrenching defeat, as he looks forward to helping the Avalanche seal the deal in Game 6 on the road.
Via Greg Wyshynski of ESPN:“We’ve gotta move on and win Game 6 on the road,” MacKinnon said.
You can’t win every series in four and five [games].
Beating the rejuvenated Blues this coming Friday will be easier said than done for the MacKinnon and the Avalanche, but there’s a reason why they are the favorites to win this series.
