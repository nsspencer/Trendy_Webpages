     Willow, the sequel to Willow, gets a trailer featuring Willow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once upon a time, Ron Howard and George Lucas wanted to try and replicate the success of Star Wars by creating a whole new fantasy, Willow.
The film only did okay at the box office, and any nascent plans for a sequel were put on ice.
No longer a wizard in training, Willow now has a staff — and can apparently do magic beyond poorly turning people into a wide variety of animals.
The rest of the cast of the new show probably wasn’t even alive when the film premiered, but they certainly have a lot to do.
There’s plenty of magic, sword fighting, smooches, and exceptionally wild hair in the trailer, which premiered at Star Wars Celebration.

     Willow returns in first trailer for Lucasfilm’s new fantasy series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lucasfilm’s new Disney Plus series based on Willow, the late ’80s fantasy film directed by Ron Howard and based on a story by George Lucas, is coming this fall.
And the first trailer shows Warwick Davis, in this eponymous role as Willow Ufgood, returning to (perhaps reluctantly) contend with a new imbalance of good and evil.
Joanne Whalley from the original Willow will reprise her role as Sorsha in the series.
The new Willow will be set about 20 years after the original film.
The fantasy film tells the story of Willow Ufgood, who must protect an infant, Elora Danan, from an evil queen.

     Summary: The new Willow TV show gets its first trailer plus still images and a release date on Disney+.
Credit: Disney / LucasfilmThe 1988 film Willow is one of my favorite movies.
Howard returns as a producer for the TV show alongside Jonathan Kasdan (son of Star Wars writer Lawrence Kasdan) who Howard collaborated with on Solo: A Star Wars Story.
But I like Willow just as much as Star Wars so it’s wonderful to see this take shape.
Disney and Lucasfilm also released a brand new trailer for the upcoming Star Wars live-action show Andor and it looks simply stunning.
