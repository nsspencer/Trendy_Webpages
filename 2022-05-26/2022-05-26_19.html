     Steph Curry wins Western Conference finals MVP as Warriors close out Mavericks

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steph Curry has yet to win an NBA Finals MVP, but he earned the honors of being named the inaugural Magic Johnson Western Conference final MVP on Thursday night.
The Warriors eliminated the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 at Chase Center, punching their ticket to the NBA Finals where they await the winner of the Eastern Conference finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics.
Curry and the Warriors will play in their sixth NBA Finals in eight seasons.
As for that elusive NBA Finals MVP trophy, Curry will get a fourth chance to add it to his collection of accolades.
A Finals MVP would be a fitting conclusion to a season that has seen Curry win NBA All-Star Game MVP and now Western Conference finals MVP.
