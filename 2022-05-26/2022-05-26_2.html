For the first time since losing to the Toronto Raptors in 2019, the Golden State Warriors are return to the NBA Finals.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They're now the first franchise since Jordan's Chicago Bulls to reach six NBA Finals in an eight-season span.
In reality, the Warriors now have gone to six straight Finals when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are healthy.
Here are three takeaways from the Warriors dominating the Mavs on their way to the Finals yet again.
In the first halves of the first four games combined, Thompson scored 18 points.
Having two days off in between the first two games of the Finals will be huge for Thompson.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadSAN FRANCISCO — When the Golden State Warriors have it going, they make the defense look lost and apprehensive, overwhelmed by their quick decisions and even quicker triggers.
Despite a gallant Dallas comeback attempt, Golden State held on for a resounding victory at Chase Center.
In the first half, Green found Thompson coming off a screen with a perfectly timed pass for a three-pointer.
Former Warriors guard Shaun Livingston presented the Western Conference championship trophy to Green and the rest of his former teammates.
To wit, Golden State improved to 9-0 at home in these playoffs, with all three of its closeout wins coming at Chase Center.

     Summary: The trio that led Golden State to so much success in recent years is whole again and and has the Warriors in position for another title after advancing to the NBA Finals with a 120-110 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night.
We understand what it takes to win a championship.”The triumvirate of Curry, Thompson and Green is in rarified air in NBA lore as the core of a team that has made it to six NBA Finals in an eight-year span.
“We’re happy to be here, but it would help our legacy a lot if we completed the mission and won the whole thing,” Thompson said.
Thompson tore his left ACL during a season-ending Game 6 loss in the 2019 NBA Finals.
It’s the only way you can have a run like that because you get exhausted, you get tired, you get frustrated.

(0:28)SAN FRANCISCO -- As Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr watched his team celebrate their 120-110 win over the Dallas Mavericks, he had a flashback to 2015.
He was a rookie coach, and his team had just won the Western Conference finals, punching their ticket to the NBA Finals.
It was the moment that the Warriors had made the NBA Finals for the first time since 2019 and for the sixth time in the past eight years.

     Summary: After two major surgeries and two years of grueling rehabilitation, Thompson is rounding back into form and shot the Golden State Warriors back into the NBA Finals.
Thompson shimmied his way to 32 points and the Warriors advanced to their sixth finals in the past eight seasons by beating the Dallas Mavericks 120-110 in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals on Thursday night.
“It just takes an enormous amount of skill and determination and work.”Golden State will host the winner of the Eastern Conference finals between Boston and Miami on June 2 in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
Moody scored all of his seven points in the second quarter with his 3-pointer giving Golden State a 56-38 lead.
Moody scored just six points the first three games of this series for the Warriors before scoring 17 the past two games with Porter sidelined.

     Summary: But that Warriors team, a bit of "adversity" notwithstanding, was still an all-time great squad.
They were surely the best team in the league and the clear favorite to win it all.
Those first two postseason runs with Durant on board, the Warriors outscored opponents by a combined 23.6 points per 100 possessions.
The Warriors always were, and still are, a supremely skilled team, but this team has had to find other, less spectacular ways to win.
How dare I question any team with Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, let alone one coached by Steve Kerr.
