    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By the time Elvis filming ended in March 2021, Austin Butler had given himself so much to the role that his body "started shutting down," the actor said.
“Just images of Elvis everywhere, from every time period,” Butler told British GQ.
Medical issues aside, Butler discovered in his research for the role that he had something else in common with the music pioneer.
“His mother passed away when he was 23, and my mum passed away when I was 23,” Butler said.
Luhrmann, Hanks and Butler were joined on the red carpet by Priscilla Presley, who has been supportive of Butler and his performance in Elvis.

     Summary: Austin Butler is working hard to live up to legendary designer Yohji Yamamoto's assertion that “black is modest and arrogant at the same time.
Gisela SchoberEveryone knows that the most traditional shoes to wear with a black-tie look are a pair of patent leather lace-ups.
Staying true to the shit-kicking style of his character in the film, perhaps, Butler instead opted for a pair of winklepicker black leather boots.
Austin Butler's choice to wear a double rather than a single-breasted jacket also afforded the look extra sartorial weight.
Could Butler be the new king of the black-tie realm?

     'Elvis' review: Austin Butler hip-shakes his way to Oscars 2023 contention
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baz Luhrmann and Elvis Presley were always going to be a match made in showbiz heaven.
'Elvis' Director: Baz Luhrmann Starring: Austin Butler, Tom Hanks, Olivia DeJonge Rating: 4/5Premiering out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival, Elvis is a dazzling, sometimes overwhelming, biopic that throws everything at the wall.
Rising star Austin Butler must surely have blasted his way in contention in next year’s Oscar race with a titanic performance as Elvis, brimming with vim and vigour.
Narrating the film is Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks), the mysterious impresario who became Elvis’s manager, craftily sending this boy from Memphis to stratospheric heights.
Parker doesn’t want Elvis making political statements — he doesn’t even want him leaving the country to tour internationally for “security” reasons.
