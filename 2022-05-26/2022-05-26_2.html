     Kevin Spacey Facing Sexual Assault Charges in Britain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — The British authorities have authorized criminal charges against Kevin Spacey on four counts of sexual assault against three men, the country’s Crown Prosecution Service announced in a news release on Thursday.
Mr. Spacey cannot be formally charged unless he enters England or Wales, a spokesman for the service said in a telephone interview.
The spokesman declined to comment on whether the service would pursue extradition proceedings if that did not occur.
The incidents dated from March 2005, August 2008 and April 2013, it added — a time when Mr. Spacey was artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London.
All the incidents occurred in London, except one from 2013, which occurred in Gloucestershire, England.

     Summary: Kevin Spacey faces charges of sexual assault in BritainEnlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty ImagesProsecutors in England have authorized charging actor Kevin Spacey with multiple counts of sexual assault.
According to a statement from Rosemary Ainslie, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Special Crime Division, the service has authorized charging the actor with four counts of sexual assault against three men.
The CPS is also authorized charging him with one count of "causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent."
In 2017, the actor Anthony Rapp publicly accused Spacey of sexually abusing him at a party in 1986 when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26.
Spacey is an Oscar-winning actor and was the lead of the Netflix hit House of Cards, until he was written out of the show following the sexual assault allegations.

     Kevin Spacey charged with four counts of sexual assault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN) US actor Kevin Spacey has been charged with four counts of sexual assault against three men, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Thursday.
Spacey was also charged with one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent, the CPS said.
The charges relate to two alleged incidents in London in 2005, another two in 2008, and a further incident in Gloucestershire, western England, in 2013.
The alleged victim of the 2005 incidents is now in his 40s, while the two men allegedly involved in the 2008 and 2013 incidents are now in their 30s, London's Metropolitan Police said.
The decision to charge Spacey "follows a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police Service in its investigation," the force said.
