     Summary: Check out Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green celebrate the Western Conference championship after defeating the Mavericks in five games.
(0:57)SAN FRANCISCO -- As Stephen Curry was named the inaugural Most Valuable Player of the Western Conference finals, Draymond Green gave the Golden State Warriors star a bear hug, lifting him up and letting out a scream.
Curry smiled and laughed as he celebrated returning to the NBA Finals, which came with the first Magic Johnson Western Conference finals MVP trophy after the Warriors eliminated the Dallas Mavericks with their 120-110 win in Game 5 on Thursday night.
The league introduced new trophies for the MVP of both the Eastern and Western Conference finals; the East's trophy is named after Larry Bird.
He had an all-around performance in the Western Conference finals, averaging 23.8 points, 7.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds and 43.9% shooting in the series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They're now the first franchise since Jordan's Chicago Bulls to reach six NBA Finals in an eight-season span.
In reality, the Warriors now have gone to six straight Finals when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are healthy.
Here are three takeaways from the Warriors dominating the Mavs on their way to the Finals yet again.
In the first halves of the first four games combined, Thompson scored 18 points.
Having two days off in between the first two games of the Finals will be huge for Thompson.

     Summary: Steph Curry has yet to win an NBA Finals MVP, but he earned the honors of being named the inaugural Magic Johnson Western Conference finals MVP on Thursday night.
The Warriors eliminated the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 at Chase Center, punching their ticket to the NBA Finals where they await the winner of the Eastern Conference finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics.
Curry and the Warriors will play in their sixth NBA Finals in eight seasons.
As for that elusive NBA Finals MVP trophy, Curry will get a fourth chance to add it to his collection of accolades.
A Finals MVP would be a fitting conclusion to a season that has seen Curry win NBA All-Star Game MVP and now Western Conference finals MVP.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — With a little over three minutes to go in the Western Conference Finals, Klay Thompson had a pull-up jumper in the lane rejected by Spencer Dinwiddie.
The ball found its way back to Klay, and this time he sank a three, his eighth of the game.
The Warriors took a 15-point lead and punched their ticket back to the NBA Finals.
That sequence from Klay, and perhaps his whole season, is a microcosm of this Golden State team.
The Warriors are headed back to the Finals for the sixth time in eight years, a feat last accomplished by Jordan’s Bulls.

Despite a gallant Dallas comeback attempt, Golden State held on for a resounding victory at Chase Center.
In the first half, Green found Thompson coming off a screen with a perfectly timed pass for a three-pointer.
Former Warriors guard Shaun Livingston presented the Western Conference championship trophy to Green and the rest of his former teammates.
To wit, Golden State improved to 9-0 at home in these playoffs, with all three of its closeout wins coming at Chase Center.

     Summary: Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty ImagesStephen Curry was named the Magic Johnson Western Conference Finals MVP after his Golden State Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, 120-110, winning the series in five games.
Curry, 34, was excellent in the series, averaging 23.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists.
Curry is a three-time champion, eight-time All-Star, two-time MVP, two-time scoring champion and four-time first-team All-NBA selection.
The one thing that Curry has never won, however, is Finals MVP in five previous trips.
If the Warriors win a title this year, however, Curry will be the prohibitive favorite to claim the award.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are heading back to the NBA Finals for the sixth time in eight seasons.
Klay Thompson turned back the clock with his best game of the series, pouring in eight 3-pointers and 32 points to lead the way.
Luka Doncic got off to a rough start, but caught fire in the third quarter to lead the Mavericks' comeback attempt.
Golden State's bid to win the 2019 Finals effectively ended when Thompson tore his ACL.
Now, their trip to the 2022 Finals is coming thanks to perhaps the best game of Thompson's postseason.
