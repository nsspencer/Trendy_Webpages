     ‘Stranger Things’ Review: Once More Into the Upside Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Six years ago, Matt and Ross Duffer whipped up a perfect streaming-video dessert, low on nutrition but high in sweet pop-culture calories.
Season 1 of their Netflix series “Stranger Things” was an expertly assembled and precisely calibrated souffle of Gen-X nostalgia, Spielbergian family melodrama and more-intense-than-expected sci-fi-horror adventure.
And the many devotees of “Stranger Things” have been lucky, because as the show’s fourth season — which premieres with seven of its nine episodes on Friday — demonstrates, the Duffers’ expertise and crowd-pleasing instincts significantly exceed their storytelling imagination.
The problem is that when the payoffs arrive, they’re deflatingly familiar — the show has gone from lovingly echoing 1980s touchstones to industriously copying itself.
That’s the route film franchises take, and “Stranger Things” often feels more like a film franchise than a television series.

     Netflix Adds Warning to Stranger Things Season Premiere After School Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix is adding a warning card that will run ahead of the Season 4 premiere of Stranger Things, in light of this week’s school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
“We filmed this season of Stranger Things a year ago,” the warning card reads, according to our sister site Variety.
On Tuesday, 19 children and two adults were killed when a gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
The tragedy marked the deadliest American school shooting since the murders at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary nearly 10 years ago.
The first part of Stranger Things Season 4 is still slated to debut this Friday, returning after a nearly three-year hiatus with five new episodes.

     Like It or Not, Stranger Things Season 4 Hurls the Series Into Adulthood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Returning to Netflix after a nearly three-year-long, pandemic-induced break, Stranger Things could've done two things.
There's some of the old Stranger Things in Volume One of Season Four, which is now streaming on Netflix.
We'll avoid spoilers here, but very early on, it becomes exceedingly clear that Stranger Things went in direction number two—which takes a hard left into Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire territory.
Suddenly, it doesn't feel like Stranger Things is fighting a raging tentacle monster in a shopping mall anymore.
The series will need the momentum, because Stranger Things is set to end with Season Five, which may very well end up as a 24-hour-long marathon at this rate.

     Netflix Adds Warning Card to ‘Stranger Things 4’ Premiere Following Uvalde School Shooting (EXCLUSIVE)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix is adding a warning card to the “Stranger Things 4” premiere in light of the shooting on Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which left 21 people dead — including 19 children and two teachers.
The warning card, which will show up for viewers in the U.S. when the episodes launch on Friday, reads: “We filmed this season of ‘Stranger Things’ a year ago.
But given the recent tragic shooting at a school in Texas, viewers may find the opening scene of episode 1 distressing.
Last Friday, Netflix released the first eight minutes of the “Stranger Things” Season 4 premiere as a sneak-peek video ahead of the official launch of Volume 1 this Friday.
The steps taken by Netflix ahead of the “Stranger Things 4” premiere are not the first moves Hollywood has made this week following the shooting at Robb Elementary.

     Summary: Once quaint, 'Stranger Things' is now extravagant in every wayEnlarge this image toggle caption Netflix NetflixIn the first season of Stranger Things, being 12 years old was a moment of suspension in air.
They were children until they saw monsters, and the monsters were the gravity that knocked them to the ground.
That weightlessness, for those who are ever fortunate enough to experience it, is temporary, especially for kids who love fiercely and care about everything, the way these kids do.
The first season, back in the summer of 2016, had a quaintness of both story and format (despite the gore).
Stranger Things is ungainly now, bulked up by more extravagant and ambitious "wowza" effects sequences.

     ‘Stranger Things’ Season 3 Recap: Catch Up Before Season 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Season 3 kicks off in 1984, when Soviet scientists are trying to force open a gate to the Upside Down.
The action then shifts to 1985, when, thousands of miles away, the new Starcourt Mall is upending the economy of Hawkins, Indiana.
Inside the mill, their bodies explode and form a single creature, a new incarnation of the Mind Flayer.
Those two teens become some of many townspeople possessed, or “flayed,” by the Mind Flayer as it grows stronger inside the mill.
The Mind Flayer repeatedly attacks the teens, and though Eleven is able to fend it off, she’s wounded in the fight, left with a Mind Flayer fragment embedded in her body.
