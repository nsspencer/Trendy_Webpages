     Summary: Austin Butler says he put his “life on pause for two years” to prepare to play Elvis Presley.
The ‘Elvis’ star put a priority on getting into character and “absorbed everything” that he “possibly could” to bring his best work to the biopic of the King of Rock’n'Roll helmed by Baz Luhrmann.
Austin spoke about the “unrealistic expectations” he placed on himself to bring Elvis to life.
The former ’the Carrie Diaries' star watched some clips of Elvis "over and over and over", such as his television performances from the 50s.
Austin compared getting character as Elvis - who died in 1977 - to “spinning plates”.
