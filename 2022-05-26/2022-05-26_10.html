The Colorado Avalanche hope the young defenseman is right after squandering a three-goal lead in an overtime loss.
The St. Louis Blues are eager to prove that feeling false.
This (loss) is in the past and momentum doesn’t carry from game to game.”The Blues were 56 seconds away from the curtain closing on their season.

     Summary: The Avs swept both games at St. Louis after a poor showing in Game 2 at Ball Arena that evened the Western Conference semifinals 1-1.
The Blues limited Colorado to just 11 shots in the second and third periods after the Avs had 18 in the opening frame.
Colorado was clearly the better team in the first half of the game and St. Louis dominated the final period.
“I don’t have any different thoughts this morning on last night’s game than I had last night,” Bednar said.
You learn from it,” he said from DIA before boarding a charter flight to St. Louis.

     Summary: Kadri is a forward for the Colorado Avalanche, and he is having the best year in his career.
After Kadri collided with Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington during Saturday’s game, Kadri wound up the target of Blues fans’ ire.
But in this season, Kadri has shown that he has become a mature athlete.
Instead, he remained focused, knowing that he had a job to do as part of the Colorado Avalanche team.
Kadri doesn’t have the highest scores in the league (yet), and he may not be the most talented hockey player out there.
