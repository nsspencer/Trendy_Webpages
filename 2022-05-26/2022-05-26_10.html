     Summary: You may be wondering why a Winnipeg Jets fansite is writing an article about the Rangers and Hurricanes Stanley Cup Playoff series.
That is because the Jets will benefit if the Rangers win this series.
One of the draft selections included was the Rangers’ 2022 second-round draft choice, but this pick was conditional.
Therefore, all the Jets need to obtain the Rangers’ first-rounder is for the Rangers to win this series over the Hurricanes.

     Summary: The Rangers, on the other hand, will see if they have at least one more comeback in them this season.
It was just single game, we got to get back at it and win one game.”The Rangers face elimination as they return to MSG.
But they took the reins in Game 5, put together their best performance of the series and ran away with it.
Vatrano, Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad, who scored the Rangers’ lone goal on the power play, totaled just two shots.
“I think the first series helped a little bit and then having to win Games 3 and 4, those were pretty much must-win games and we did a good job.

    </h2>

     Summary: But while Carolina stepped up its game, Rangers coach Gerard Gallant placed the bulk of the blame on his own squad for falling flat after winning two in a row at home.
We can make excuses about them clogging up the neutral zone and all that, but we just didn't play our game."
"We're down 3-1 last series, we're down 2-0 in this series, and all that matters is that next game.
Everyone was talking about momentum after (the Rangers won) Games 3 and 4, and tonight they won.
But Carolina challenged the play, with the goal being reversed due to an offside call against the Rangers.

     Hurricanes-Rangers Game 5: Carolina defeats New York, 3-1, takes 3-2 series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Hurricanes once again put their undefeated home record to the test against the New York Rangers in Game 5 of their second-round NHL playoff series Thursday at PNC Arena, the series tied 2-2 after the Hurricanes lost both games in New York.
How to watchTuesday’s game — and the rest of the series — is available only on ESPN (Sean McDonough, Ray Ferraro, Emily Kaplan).
Raanta locked in: After that long forecheck sequence for the Canes, the Rangers came down and had a chance against Raanta.
The Canes outshot the Rangers 11-5 in the frame, and at even strength Carolina was the better team.
That duo worked Game 7 of the first-round series against the Boston Bruins and Lee also worked Game 4 of that series.
