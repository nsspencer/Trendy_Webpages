     A film editor made good on his decade-plus promise to ‘eat his own shoe’ if ‘Top Gun 2’ was ever made
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Check back Thursday.”A decade ago I tweeted that if Top Gun 2 happened I would eat a shoe.
And despite the fact that the shoe was speckled with grass once he came back inside, Patches eventually made good on his promise.
“Well, Top Gun 2 really happened,” Patches said towards the end of the video.
But, I ate a shoe.” As for why, he quoted Herzog, the man himself: “To eat a shoe is a foolish signal but it was worthwhile.
Though we don’t necessarily advocate that anyone actually eat a shoe, you just can’t argue with that logic.

     Watch a journalist eat a shoe because of Top Gun 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2010, then-culture-journalist Matt Patches wrote a benign tweet: “If Top Gun 2 happens, I will eat a shoe.” In hindsight, he should have considered that dumb things said on the internet will haunt you forever.
Twelve years after this all began, against all odds, Top Gun: Maverick is playing in theaters around the world.
And Patches is eating a shoe on YouTube.
Patches also got married and had two children, which is why he can’t just eat any normal shoe.
And yet Patches found a way to make and eat a usable shoe nonetheless.

     ‘Top Gun 2’: Film critic eats his shoe (literally) over ‘Top Gun: Maverick’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And that’s particularly true this week for "Polygon" Deputy Entertainment Editor Matt Patches — who decided to put his money where his mouth is (literally) over a 12-year-old bet involving "Top Gun: Maverick" and a shoe.
But 12 years later — after a long development process and many pandemic-related delays — "Top Gun: Maverick" finally soars into theaters this weekend.

     Top Gun: Maverick: Watch Someone Eat A Shoe Because Of Sequel Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An entertainment writer eats his shoe because of Top Gun: Maverick in a hilarious new video.
But instead of starring in an immediate sequel, Cruise elected to leave behind Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and his need for speed.
Infamously, Werner Herzog once said he’d eat his shoe if his friend Errol Morris’ documentary Gates of Heaven ever saw the light of day.
The final lesson of all this is of course to never doubt Top Gun: Maverick star Cruise when he puts his mind to something.
