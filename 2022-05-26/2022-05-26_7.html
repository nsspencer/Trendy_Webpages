     Summary: A Carnival cruise ship caught fire as it was docked in Grand Turk on Thursday morning, officials said.
The fire, which broke out in the Carnival Freedom ship's funnel, was quickly extinguished as the ship was in Grand Turk, the capital island of the Turks and Caicos archipelago southeast of the Bahamas, a Carnival spokesperson said Thursday morning.
Oma5Bonnie via Twitter"All guests and crew are safe, and the ship’s guests were cleared by local authorities to go ashore.
Just before 11 a.m., passengers were still on shore at Grand Turk.
The ship had left Port Canaveral in Brevard County, Florida, on Monday for a five-day cruise, officials said.
