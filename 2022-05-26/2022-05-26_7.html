Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode has passed,” wrote the Cure’s Lol Tolhurst on Twitter.
Depeche Mode in 1982: Andy Fletcher, left, Dave Gahan, Alan Wilder and Martin Gore.
In fact, the seeds of Depeche Mode were planted during the punk and new wave explosion of the late 1970s, when Fletcher and friend Clarke started a band called No Romance in China, which morphed into Composition of Sound.
When Fletcher and Clarke discovered Kraftwerk and other early electronic music, they swapped strings for circuits, added kindred spirit Gore and, not long after, brought on Gahan as vocalist.
