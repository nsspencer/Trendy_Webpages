     ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Review: Will This Stuff Still Fly?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every so often in “Top Gun: Maverick,” Pete Mitchell (that’s Maverick) is summoned to a face-to-face with an admiral.
Pete, after all these years in the Navy — more than 35, but who’s counting — has stalled at the rank of captain.
He’s one of the best fighter pilots ever to take wing, but the U.S. military hierarchy can be a treacherous political business, and Maverick is anything but a politician.
(Without “The Right Stuff,” there would have been no “Top Gun.”) He seems to be telling Pete that the game is over.
The conversation with Cain is not so much a red herring as a meta-commentary.

     ‘Top Gun 2’: Film critic eats his shoe (literally) over ‘Top Gun: Maverick’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And that’s particularly true this week for "Polygon" Deputy Entertainment Editor Matt Patches — who decided to put his money where his mouth is (literally) over a 12-year-old bet involving "Top Gun: Maverick" and a shoe.
But 12 years later — after a long development process and many pandemic-related delays — "Top Gun: Maverick" finally soars into theaters this weekend.

     Watch a journalist eat a shoe because of Top Gun 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2010, then-culture-journalist Matt Patches wrote a benign tweet: “If Top Gun 2 happens, I will eat a shoe.” In hindsight, he should have considered that dumb things said on the internet will haunt you forever.
Twelve years after this all began, against all odds, Top Gun: Maverick is playing in theaters around the world.
And Patches is eating a shoe on YouTube.
Patches also got married and had two children, which is why he can’t just eat any normal shoe.
And yet Patches found a way to make and eat a usable shoe nonetheless.

     How To Watch Top Gun 2 Online: When Is Maverick Streaming?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Top Gun 2 will receive an exclusive theatrical release before it drops on streaming services.
Considering Top Gun: Maverick is one of the studio’s biggest releases of the last few years and Tom Cruise has notably advocated for theatrical viewings over streaming releases, Paramount may decide to delay the sequel’s online availability.
If so, the Paramount+ streaming availability of 2022's Top Gun 2 could be delayed until August or September when theatrical attendance dies back down.
Before Top Gun: Maverick arrives online, audiences can stream the original 1986 Tom Cruise movie on Netflix and Paramount+ with subscriptions.
In order to watch Top Gun and Top Gun 2 back-to-back on streaming, viewers will need to have subscriptions to Paramount+ or purchase the sequel online.

     Tom Cruise’s Top Gun Maverick set to be the actor’s biggest career-opener, to net 100 mn dollars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Cruise-starrer Top Gun Maverick is all set to have a smashing opening at the box office, according to a Collider report.
The movie will have at least a $92 million opening, with some even stating that that number could go up to a whopping $125 million, considering the four-day long Memorial Day weekend.
And if the $125 million figure is true, then Top Gun Maverick could be Cruise’s biggest opener in his over four-decade long career.
“Top Gun: Maverick pulls off a feat even trickier than a 4G inverted dive, delivering a long-belated sequel that surpasses its predecessor in wildly entertaining style,” reads the critical consensus.
However, there is a settling down too, a recognition of age, of passing years.”Top Gun Maverick also features Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer, Monica Barbaro, and Glen Powell.
