     Summary: The St. Louis Blues rallied from a three-point deficit to pull off a crucial overtime win against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 5 of their second-round series on Wednesday night to keep their Stanely Cup hopes alive for at least one more game.
Tyler Bozak, the longtime Toronto Maple Leafs centre who helped the Blues capture their first Cup in 2019 , fended off elimination for St. Louis with a slap shot from the blue line at 3:38 in overtime for the 5-4 victory.
BLUES’ JORDAN BINNINGTON THROWS WATER BOTTLE AT AVALANCHE CENTER NAZEM KADRI DURING INTERVIEW: REPORTAfter trailing 3-0 through the second period, Vladimir Tarasenko put St. Louis on the board first with his first goal of the playoffs.

     The Blues Overcame Avalanche, but MacKinnon is Unstoppable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Game 5, Colorado Avalanche forward Nathan MacKinnon made the hockey world sit up and take notice of him.
He was dominant in a way only truly elite players like Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid has been – and in 59 career playoff games, MacKinnon has an astounding 36 goals and 82 points.
Two minutes later, MacKinnon put Colorado ahead, but St. Louis kept pressing, and Thomas’ second of the game sent the match to OT.
That said, if the Blues emerge victorious in Game Six, suddenly, all the pressure will be on the Avs.
If you had to start a team by choosing one player from the Avs or Blues, there’s no question MacKinnon would be the right choice.

     Summary: Cale Makar boarded a plane bound for St. Louis, leaving behind one thing he doesn’t fully believe travels from game to game or city to city — momentum.
The Colorado Avalanche hope the young defenseman is right after squandering a three-goal lead in an overtime loss.
The St. Louis Blues are eager to prove that feeling false.
This (loss) is in the past and momentum doesn’t carry from game to game.”The Blues were 56 seconds away from the curtain closing on their season.
“I personally felt bad after the game because (MacKinnon) put us on his back and he should have won us that game and unfortunately we couldn’t get it,” Makar said.

     Summary: The Avs swept both games at St. Louis after a poor showing in Game 2 at Ball Arena that evened the Western Conference semifinals 1-1.
The Blues limited Colorado to just 11 shots in the second and third periods after the Avs had 18 in the opening frame.
Colorado was clearly the better team in the first half of the game and St. Louis dominated the final period.
“I don’t have any different thoughts this morning on last night’s game than I had last night,” Bednar said.
You learn from it,” he said from DIA before boarding a charter flight to St. Louis.
