     Austin Butler Is the King of Cannes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Austin Butler is still coming up for air from his intense experience of portraying Elvis Presley in the upcoming Baz Luhurmann-directed biopic—but that air happens to be the salty French sea breeze at the Cannes Film Festival, and it seems to be working for him.
The journey of Luhurmann’s Elvis to Cannes has been a long and winding one, drawn out over four pre- and mid-pandemic long years that sent Butler down a serious Elvis rabbithole.
(Infamously, it was the bellwether event of Tom Hanks, who plays Elvis’s manager in the film, testing positive for COVID-19 in March 2020, that initially halted production.)
In his recent a profile in the June/July issue of GQ, the actor admitted that he’s very much still got the King on the brain: “You can lose touch with who you actually are.
A little soft, a little arrogant, overall quite cool.

     Summary: By the time Elvis filming ended in March 2021, Austin Butler had given himself so much to the role that his body "started shutting down," the actor said.
“Just images of Elvis everywhere, from every time period,” Butler told British GQ.
Medical issues aside, Butler discovered in his research for the role that he had something else in common with the music pioneer.
“His mother passed away when he was 23, and my mum passed away when I was 23,” Butler said.
Luhrmann, Hanks and Butler were joined on the red carpet by Priscilla Presley, who has been supportive of Butler and his performance in Elvis.

     “Elvis” Star Austin Butler Was Emergency Hospitalized After Filming Wrapped

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Austin Butler's portrayal of music icon Elvis Presley in the upcoming biopic Elvis is being considered the actor's career-defining role — but in a new interview with GQ, Austin revealed that his experience filming the movie was so intense, that he had to be hospitalized immediately after production wrapped.
Once production resumed in September 2020, the film didn't wrap until March 2021.
Elvis director Baz Luhrmann admitted that Austin's work ethic and immersion into his role of Elvis was unlike any actor he'd ever worked with.
“What's Up With Austin Butler's Voice?” and “Austin Butler's Voice Baffles Fans at the Met Gala” read headlines.
Even the writer of Austin's GQ cover story, Gabriella Paiella, pointed out that the actor couldn't shake his "husky Elvis” accent throughout their interview.

In a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival this Thursday, the 30-year-old actor spoke about what it took to become the King of Rock and Roll in Elvis.
"I basically put the rest of my life on pause for two years," he said, "and I just absorbed everything that I possibly could."
Overall, though extensive, the experience for Butler was well worthwhile: "The ability to get to explore that was just the joy of my life."
Also at the conference, Butler opened up about the most challenging part of playing the title character in the Baz Luhrmann-directed film.

Gisela SchoberEveryone knows that the most traditional shoes to wear with a black-tie look are a pair of patent leather lace-ups.
Staying true to the shit-kicking style of his character in the film, perhaps, Butler instead opted for a pair of winklepicker black leather boots.
Austin Butler's choice to wear a double rather than a single-breasted jacket also afforded the look extra sartorial weight.

     Baz Luhrmann’s ‘Elvis’ Is Utterly Exhausting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luhrmann’s fondness for this most hackneyed of techniques is but a symptom of a wider disease in his filmmaking, namely his disturbing addiction to hacking and remixing.
Elvis is a film for babies.
During scenes of dialogue, his Elvis voice occasionally sounds strained, but the main thing is that he is not distracting.
Opposite Butler, Tom Hanks, all prosthetics and creepy voice stylings, plays Colonel Tom Parker as a sort of predatory alien—but for some reason his performance never comes alive.
Elvis is such a gaudy, buzzing, relentless object, which for 2.5 hours lurches about flashing its gold like a drunk old millionaire in a strip joint.
