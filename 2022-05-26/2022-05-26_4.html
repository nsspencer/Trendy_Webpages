     Grieving husband of teacher killed in Texas school shooting has died, family says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The husband of one of the teachers killed in a Texas school shooting this week collapsed and died on Thursday while preparing for his wife's funeral, the family said.
Joe Garcia had been married to high school sweetheart, Irma Garcia, for 24 years before she was gunned down Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.
“It’s a classic case of broken heart syndrome from what’s been described,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Broken heart syndrome typically occurs immediately after a person has received horrific news, he added.
But some people may take time to emotionally process a loss, meaning broken heart syndrome wouldn’t occur right away.
