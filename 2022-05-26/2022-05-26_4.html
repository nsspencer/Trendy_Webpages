     Summary: Andy Fletcher, a founding member of multi-platinum synth-pop band Depeche Mode, has died.
Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode has passed,” wrote the Cure’s Lol Tolhurst on Twitter.
Depeche Mode in 1982: Andy Fletcher, left, Dave Gahan, Alan Wilder and Martin Gore.
In fact, the seeds of Depeche Mode were planted during the punk and new wave explosion of the late 1970s, when Fletcher and friend Clarke started a band called No Romance in China, which morphed into Composition of Sound.
When Fletcher and Clarke discovered Kraftwerk and other early electronic music, they swapped strings for circuits, added kindred spirit Gore and, not long after, brought on Gahan as vocalist.

     Summary: Andy “Fletch” Fletcher, keyboardist and one of the founding members of iconic British electronic band Depeche Mode, has died.
Speaking of his role in the group, Fletcher said in an interview published in Electronic Beats that he was “the tall guy in the background, without whom this international corporation called Depeche Mode would never work.
But bands like Kraftwerk or Depeche Mode actually work as divisions of labor collectives.
As a member of Depeche Mode, Fletcher was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.
It’s the same with Depeche Mode; we have moments where we don’t like each other, and moments when we love each other.
