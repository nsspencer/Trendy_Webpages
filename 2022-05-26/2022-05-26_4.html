     Avalanche news: Jared Bednar calls out Darcy Kuemper after Game 5 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the game, Bednar seemingly called out goalkeeper Darcy Kuemper with regards to the goalie’s performance, per Aarif Deen of Mile High Sports.
#Avs Bednar: "You can group Kuemps in with our team.
— Aarif Deen (@runwriteAarif) May 26, 2022Kuemper doesn’t really have a lot of excuses for this loss, he’ll just need to bounce back in Game 6.
Nathan MacKinnon scored two of his three goals in the first period to put the Avalanche up 2-0 before the first intermission.
It’s the most goals Kuemper has allowed in a game in this postseason, so a big rebound is expected of him by Bednar and the Avalanche.

     The Blues Overcame Avalanche, but MacKinnon is Unstoppable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Game 5, Colorado Avalanche forward Nathan MacKinnon made the hockey world sit up and take notice of him.
He was dominant in a way only truly elite players like Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid has been – and in 59 career playoff games, MacKinnon has an astounding 36 goals and 82 points.
Two minutes later, MacKinnon put Colorado ahead, but St. Louis kept pressing, and Thomas’ second of the game sent the match to OT.
That said, if the Blues emerge victorious in Game Six, suddenly, all the pressure will be on the Avs.
If you had to start a team by choosing one player from the Avs or Blues, there’s no question MacKinnon would be the right choice.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “They played with more desperation than us in the second half of the game,” Avs coach Jared Bednar said.
MacKinnon scored at 3:51 and 18:23, the latter on the power play, as Colorado outshot the Blues 18-9.
That dominance continued early in the second period and Landeskog got the third goal, a redirection off Devon Toews’ shot from the point at 4:03.
St. Louis got within 3-1 late in the second period, shortly after the Avs improved to 3-of-3 on the penalty kill.
… Blues defenseman Marco Scandella came off the injured list to make his debut in the series, replacing Calle Rosen.

     ‘Resilient’ Blues pull off incredible comeback in Game 5 vs. Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blues were going to be answering questions, and a lot of them: What happened to the Pavel Buchnevich–Robert Thomas–Vladimir Tarasenko line?
Who else is FREAKING OUT 🚨🚨🚨🚨 — Molly Bozak (@MollyBozak) May 26, 2022“It’s just character and leadership,” Blues coach Craig Berube said.
With 10:03 left, Thomas trimmed the team’s deficit to 3-2 on a heads-up feed from Buchnevich.
The Avs’ 3-0 lead was gone with 4:46 left in regulation, so at the least, the Blues had made a game of it.
“That was a heck of a play,” Berube said.
