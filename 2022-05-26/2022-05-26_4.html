     Avalanche news: Jared Bednar calls out Darcy Kuemper after Game 5 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the game, Bednar seemingly called out Kuemper with regards to the goalie’s performance, per Aarif Deen of Mile High Sports.
— Aarif Deen (@runwriteAarif) May 26, 2022Kuemper doesn’t really have a lot of excuses for this loss.
Nathan MacKinnon scored two of his three goals in the first period to put the Avalanche up 2-0 before the first intermission.
It’s the most goals Kuemper has allowed in a game in this postseason, so a big rebound is expected of him by Bednar and the Avalanche.
So far in the playoffs, Kuemper is 5-2 with a .250 GAA and .904 SV% across eight starts.
