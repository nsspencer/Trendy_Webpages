     Blues vs Avalanche Game 5 score: Tyler Bozak fends off elimination with overtime goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The St. Louis Blues rallied from a three-point deficit to pull off a crucial overtime win against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 5 of their second-round series on Wednesday night to keep their Stanely Cup hopes alive for at least one more game.
Tyler Bozak, the longtime Toronto Maple Leafs centre who helped the Blues capture their first Cup in 2019 , fended off elimination for St. Louis with a slap shot from the blue line at 3:38 in overtime for the 5-4 victory.

     Avalanche news: Jared Bednar calls out Darcy Kuemper after Game 5 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the game, Bednar seemingly called out goalkeeper Darcy Kuemper with regards to the goalie’s performance, per Aarif Deen of Mile High Sports.
#Avs Bednar: "You can group Kuemps in with our team.
— Aarif Deen (@runwriteAarif) May 26, 2022Kuemper doesn’t really have a lot of excuses for this loss, he’ll just need to bounce back in Game 6.
Nathan MacKinnon scored two of his three goals in the first period to put the Avalanche up 2-0 before the first intermission.
It’s the most goals Kuemper has allowed in a game in this postseason, so a big rebound is expected of him by Bednar and the Avalanche.

     The Blues Overcame Avalanche, but MacKinnon is Unstoppable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Game 5, Colorado Avalanche forward Nathan MacKinnon made the hockey world sit up and take notice of him.
He was dominant in a way only truly elite players like Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid has been – and in 59 career playoff games, MacKinnon has an astounding 36 goals and 82 points.
Two minutes later, MacKinnon put Colorado ahead, but St. Louis kept pressing, and Thomas’ second of the game sent the match to OT.
That said, if the Blues emerge victorious in Game Six, suddenly, all the pressure will be on the Avs.
If you had to start a team by choosing one player from the Avs or Blues, there’s no question MacKinnon would be the right choice.

     Islanders &amp; NHL Playoff News: Avalanche waste MacKinnon hat trick; old UFAs of note

     Summary: Two more games tonight as the second round continues with the Battle of Albert and the Hurricanes playing...somebody.
[Isles]Perfect coincidental timing: As Frans Nielsen announces his retirement, the newest Weird Islanders podcast has Dan talking to Steve about Weird Frans, Valtteri Filppula.
[LHH]Revisiting the Lightning’s 10 toughest opponents during their 10 consecutive series wins: The 2020-21 Islanders obviously top the list.
[Isles]According to CapFriendly, the Islanders signed forward Ruslan Iskhakov to an ELC just ahead of the deadline to do so.
Then Nathan MacKinnon completed a hat trick and would-be late game-winner with THIS (note the position of his blade on the actual shot...not easy):NATHAN MACKINNON IS THAT DUDE.

Just a collapse as a whole team tonight.

     ‘Resilient’ Blues pull off incredible comeback in Game 5 vs. Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blues were going to be answering questions, and a lot of them: What happened to the Pavel Buchnevich–Robert Thomas–Vladimir Tarasenko line?
Who else is FREAKING OUT 🚨🚨🚨🚨 — Molly Bozak (@MollyBozak) May 26, 2022“It’s just character and leadership,” Blues coach Craig Berube said.
With 10:03 left, Thomas trimmed the team’s deficit to 3-2 on a heads-up feed from Buchnevich.
The Avs’ 3-0 lead was gone with 4:46 left in regulation, so at the least, the Blues had made a game of it.
“That was a heck of a play,” Berube said.
