    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Carnival cruise ship caught fire as it was docked in Grand Turk Thursday morning, officials said.
The fire broke out inside the Carnival Freedom ship's funnel and was quickly extinguished as the ship was in the capital of Turks and Caicos, a Carnival spokesperson told NBC News Thursday morning.
"All guests and crew are safe, and the ship’s guests were cleared by local authorities to go ashore.
Part of the funnel on the Carnival Freedom’s ship was visibly charred and damaged after the Thursday morning fire.
The ship had left Port Canaveral in Brevard County, Florida, on Monday for a five-day cruise, officials said.
