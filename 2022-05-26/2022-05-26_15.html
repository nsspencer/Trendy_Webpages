     Klay Thompson's Emotional Quote After Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson spoke to TNT after the Golden State Warriros defeated the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night to advance to the NBA Finals.
On Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals with a 120-110 win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals.
Klay Thompson, who had missed each of the last two seasons due to injuries, is now in the NBA Finals for the sixth straight season that he has played.
That series is currently 3-2 in favor of the Celtics after they won Game 5 in Florida on Wednesday evening.
Game 6 will be back in Boston on Friday night where the Celtics can close it out, or the Heat can force a Game 7 back in Florida.

     Klay Thompson's Vintage Game 5 Celebrated as Warriors Advance to 2022 NBA Finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesThe Golden State Warriors are headed to their sixth NBA Finals in eight seasons, and it only feels right that a vintage Klay Thompson game in Thursday's 120-110 victory over the Dallas Mavericks put them there this year.
Thompson made just seven three-pointers in the first four games of the series but dropped 32 points behind eight made triples Thursday.
It was gorgeous basketball throughout, and it crescendoed with a Green behind-the-back pass to Thompson for another three-pointer in the third quarter.
It was also fitting Thompson's three-pointer with about three minutes remaining all but iced it.
That type of defense may be necessary in the NBA Finals against Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics or Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat, but Thompson's shooting could also swing the race for the Larry O'Brien Trophy like it did Thursday.

     3 Reasons Klay Thompson is hurting the Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson has long been one of the Golden State Warriors‘ best assets but his first postseason back from injury has left some questions regarding his status with the team.
The Golden State Warriors have oddly played better when Klay Thompson is on the bench this postseason.
Golden State Warriors with Klay Thompson on (off) courtOFF RTNG: 113.1 (112.6)DEF RTNG: 113.4 (97.6)NET RTNG: -0.3 (+15.0)Two things jump off the page.
The Warriors are playing significantly better defense without Thompson and their overall net rating shoots through the roof when he is on the bench.
Today, we look at how the Warriors have played better without Thompson — and why Klay is still one of the best and most important members of the team.

     Klay Thompson's Emotional Reaction to Reaching Finals Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this close-out game, they were led by Klay Thompson, who shared his emotional reaction after the game.
"I should've had 10 threes, I left like three on the board tonight," Klay joked before revealing what this moment meant to him.
I don't wanna get emotional, but I can't believe we're back.
Thompson's 32 points in this close-out game helped propel the Warriors back to a place where they have now been six of the last eight seasons.
To have a close-out game like this, to send his team back to the Finals, is an example of why that mindset makes him who he is.

     Klay Thompson powers Warriors past Mavericks and into NBA finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson shimmied his way to 32 points and the Golden State Warriors advanced to their sixth NBA finals in the past eight seasons by beating the Dallas Mavericks 120-110 in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals on Thursday night.
After missing the playoffs in 2020 and 2021 in back-to back injury-plagued seasons, the Warriors are returning to a familiar stage.
Golden State will host the winner of the Eastern Conference finals between Boston and Miami on 2 June in Game 1 of the NBA finals.
The star this game was Thompson, who sat out the past two seasons with injuries but showed flashes of his old self in this clincher.
After making just seven three-pointers in the first four games of the series, Thompson had eight this game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They're now the first franchise since Jordan's Chicago Bulls to reach six NBA Finals in an eight-season span.
In reality, the Warriors now have gone to six straight Finals when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are healthy.
Here are three takeaways from the Warriors dominating the Mavs on their way to the Finals yet again.
In the first halves of the first four games combined, Thompson scored 18 points.
Having two days off in between the first two games of the Finals will be huge for Thompson.

     Summary: Klay Thompson wasn't messing around the first half of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals on Thursday night at Chase Center.
After his fourth 3-pointer gave the Warriors a 45-32 lead, Thompson did an incredible shimmy as the Mavericks were forced to call a timeout.

Thompson and the Warriors are looking to punch a ticket to their sixth NBA Finals in the last eight seasons.
If the Warriors can close out the Mavericks in Game 5, the three-time NBA champion can shimmy all night long.

But on Thursday, Klay Thompson unleashed Game 6 Klay a game early.
Thompson and the Golden State Warriors were hosting the Dallas Mavericks for Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals.
Despite Golden State taking a 3-1 series lead into Game 5, Thompson’s performance had not been especially strong.
If he has found his shooting form, Golden State will be even better going forward.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are heading back to the NBA Finals for the sixth time in eight seasons.
Klay Thompson turned back the clock with his best game of the series, pouring in eight 3-pointers and 32 points to lead the way.
Luka Doncic got off to a rough start, but caught fire in the third quarter to lead the Mavericks' comeback attempt.
Golden State's bid to win the 2019 Finals effectively ended when Thompson tore his ACL.
Now, their trip to the 2022 Finals is coming thanks to perhaps the best game of Thompson's postseason.
