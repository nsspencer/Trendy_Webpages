     Heat's Tyler Herro: Listed questionable for Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herro (groin) is questionable for Friday's Game 6 at Boston.
Herro missed Game 4 and Game 5 -- both Heat losses -- due to the strained left groin he sustained during Game 3.
With their backs against the wall, the Heat are hoping to get the Sixth Man of the Year back Friday, but it's far from a guarantee.
With Herro out, the Heat managed just 82 and 80 points, respectively, in Games 4 and 5.

     Tyler Herro’s postseason struggles continue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After winning the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award for his standout regular season, Tyler Herro has been having a rough postseason.
In 14 games thus far in the NBA Playoffs, Herro has hit just 74/179 shots (41.3%) and 16/69 3-point attempts (23.2%).
Now, Herro will miss another game, as he’s been ruled out for Game 5 in Miami.
ESPN reported on Tuesday that Herro’s groin injury would normally keep him out for 2-4 weeks in the regular season, but he’s hoping to return sooner now that it’s do or die for the Heat.

     Patrick Beverley takes possible shot at Tyler Herro after ECF Game 5: ‘I don’t even think he could have did anything if he played’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herro is dealing with an injury right now that has forced him to miss pivotal playoff games.
“Tyler Herro, I don’t even think he could have did anything if he played, man” he said.
He’s averaging just 13.5 points per game in the playoffs, a far fall from his regular season average of 20.7 points per game.
Now, with Game 6 on the horizon and the Heat’s season on the line, the team will have to dig deep to try to get a win and force a Game 7.
Whether or not Herro is able to play in the upcoming Game 6 remains to be seen.
