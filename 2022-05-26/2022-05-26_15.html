     Ellen DeGeneres has left the building: ‘When we started the show, I couldn’t say “gay”’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 19 seasons, thousands of celebrity interviews, hundreds of pranks, countless dance breaks and nearly two decades, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” has officially come to an end.
Reflecting on how much has changed over the past 19 years in her last opening monologue, a tearful DeGeneres called the show “the greatest experience I’ve ever had beyond my wildest imagination.”“When we started the show, I couldn’t say ‘gay’ on the show,” DeGeneres said.
“I couldn’t say ‘we’ because that implied that I was with someone.
I sure couldn’t say ‘wife,’ and that’s because it wasn’t legal for gay people to get married, and now I say wife all the time.” (The trailblazing comedian married actor Portia de Rossi in 2008.)
“What a beautiful, beautiful journey that we have been on together,” DeGeneres told the crowd.

     Ellen DeGeneres ends daytime show with plea for compassion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ellen DeGeneres brought her nearly two-decade daytime talk show to an end Thursday with a celebrity lovefestLOS ANGELES (AP) - Ellen DeGeneres brought her nearly two-decade daytime talk show to an end Thursday with a celebrity lovefest and a forceful assertion of her achievement as a gay woman daring to be herself.
DeGeneres and guests Jennifer Aniston, Billie Eilish and Pink shared memories and affection as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” concluded its Emmy-winning, 3,200-plus episode run that began in September 2003.
DeGeneres' daytime reign hit a serious bump in 2020, when the show was alleged to be a toxic workplace and three producers exited amid the claims.
And I said, ‘OK, then I'll be on daytime every day,'" DeGeneres said Thursday.
DeGeneres wrapped her daytime show with a plea to her audience, one she said was worth repeating.

     Ellen DeGeneres Departs Daytime TV: “When We Started This Show, I Couldn’t Say ‘Gay’”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 19 years worth of giveaways, games, and yes, grooving, Ellen DeGeneres ended her long-running talk show on Thursday.
DeGeneres devoted her final monologue to talking about the societal progress we’ve seen since Ellen launched in September 2003.
“When we started the show, I couldn’t say ‘gay.’ I was not allowed to say ‘gay.’ I say it at home a lot—you know, ‘What are we having for our gay breakfast?’ or ‘Pass the gay salt,’ ‘Has anyone seen the gay remote?’—but we couldn’t say ‘gay.’ I couldn’t say ‘we,’ because that would imply that I was with someone.
Sure couldn’t say ‘wife,’ and that’s because it wasn’t legal for gay people to get married.”“Now I say ‘wife’ all the time,” she continued, as the camera showed her spouse of nearly 15 years, Portia de Rossi.
Jennifer Aniston, the first-ever Ellen guest, dropped by to give DeGeneres advice about concluding an iconic series.
