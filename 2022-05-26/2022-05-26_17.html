     Peru and Bolivia rocked by powerful 7.2 earthquake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake rattled large areas of Peru and Bolivia on Thursday morning.
The quake struck southern Peru in the Andes mountains, north of Lake Titicaca, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Earthquakes are common in Peru as the country is located on the collision zone between the South American and Nazca tectonic plates.
The Andes mountains and a number of volcanoes in southern Peru were formed in part due to tectonic plate movement.
USGS said that a 7.0 magnitude quake also struck in 2019 close to the location of Thurday’s quake.
