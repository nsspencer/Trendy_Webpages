     Ellen DeGeneres Used Her Final Show to Remind People She Wasn’t Allowed to Say Gay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At long last, Ellen DeGeneres is off of TV — but to her credit, the comedian’s last hurrah did come with some heartening words about LGBTQ+ progress.
During the final broadcast of her show Ellen on Thursday, the comedian shared some relevant words of hope.
“When we started this show I couldn’t say ‘gay’ on the show,” DeGeneres remembered, per Deadline, obliquely alluding to the “Don’t Say Gay” legislative controversies in Florida and across the U.S. “I couldn’t say ‘we,’ because that implied that I was with someone,” DeGeneres continued.
“Sure couldn’t say wife; that’s because it wasn’t legal for gay people to get married.
With the final credits rolling at last, we can finally switch the channel to something that’s “uplifting” for all of us.

     Ellen DeGeneres Departs Daytime TV: “When We Started This Show, I Couldn’t Say ‘Gay’”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 19 years worth of giveaways, games, and yes, grooving, Ellen DeGeneres ended her long-running talk show on Thursday.
DeGeneres devoted her final monologue to talking about the societal progress we’ve seen since Ellen launched in September 2003.
“When we started the show, I couldn’t say ‘gay.’ I was not allowed to say ‘gay.’ I say it at home a lot—you know, ‘What are we having for our gay breakfast?’ or ‘Pass the gay salt,’ ‘Has anyone seen the gay remote?’—but we couldn’t say ‘gay.’ I couldn’t say ‘we,’ because that would imply that I was with someone.
Sure couldn’t say ‘wife,’ and that’s because it wasn’t legal for gay people to get married.”“Now I say ‘wife’ all the time,” she continued, as the camera showed her spouse of nearly 15 years, Portia de Rossi.
Jennifer Aniston, the first-ever Ellen guest, dropped by to give DeGeneres advice about concluding an iconic series.

     Ellen DeGeneres ends daytime show with plea for compassion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ellen DeGeneres brought her nearly two-decade daytime talk show to an end Thursday with a celebrity lovefestLOS ANGELES (AP) - Ellen DeGeneres brought her nearly two-decade daytime talk show to an end Thursday with a celebrity lovefest and a forceful assertion of her achievement as a gay woman daring to be herself.
DeGeneres and guests Jennifer Aniston, Billie Eilish and Pink shared memories and affection as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” concluded its Emmy-winning, 3,200-plus episode run that began in September 2003.
DeGeneres' daytime reign hit a serious bump in 2020, when the show was alleged to be a toxic workplace and three producers exited amid the claims.
And I said, ‘OK, then I'll be on daytime every day,'" DeGeneres said Thursday.
DeGeneres wrapped her daytime show with a plea to her audience, one she said was worth repeating.

     Ellen DeGeneres walks away from her talk show empire and leaves behind a mixed legacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With tear-stained cheeks, Ellen DeGeneres signed off her chatshow for the final time on Thursday, ending a daytime TV juggernaught that had lasted 19 years.
Jerry Falwell christened DeGeneres “Ellen DeGenerate” and joined other prominent rightwingers in a public letter denouncing the episode.
In 1998, a year after DeGeneres came out, Ellen was cancelled – a decision, she said, that caught her blindsided.
But just because the show is over doesn’t mean DeGeneres’s career can’t keep chugging along.
Without the weight of daytime TV on her shoulders, DeGeneres is free to be as nice or as mean as she likes.
