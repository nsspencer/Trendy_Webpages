     'Look at Me: XXXTENTACION' develops an incomplete picture of a troubled life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Look At Me: XXXTENTACION" tries to thread a needle, celebrating the talent of the late musical star, who was murdered at age 20, and addressing his mental-health issues while acknowledging allegations of domestic violence.
Produced by his mother and his manager, the result is an awkward construct that doesn't overlook his violent behavior but occasionally downplays it.
She thinks I'm gonna kill her," Onfroy says in one recording, despite having insisted repeatedly that Ayala was lying about him.
Videos also capture various fights and assaults on others, which in essence became part of his brand.
To her credit, she also meets during the film with Ayala, who experienced threats and social-media backlash from his fans at the time because of his legal troubles.

     How the XXXTentacion Documentary ‘Look At Me’ Was Made
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been nearly four years since XXXTentacion was fatally shot in Deerfield Beach, Florida on June 18, 2018, and his name still evokes polarizing responses from the music world.
But on May 26, Look At Me: XXXTentacion debuted on Hulu, and the Fader Films-produced documentary explores the late rapper’s life and death in detail.
The documentary, which was directed by Sabaah Folayan, isn’t your typical cookie-cutter exploration.
In addition to the documentary, X’s estate will also be releasing a new single with Kanye West called “True Love” this Friday, which is slated to appear on Look At Me: The Album and Kanye’s Donda 2.
Complex spoke with director Sabaah Folayan about the making of Look At Me: XXXTentacion, depicting the truth, and more.

     Summary: Sabaah Folayan: Well, because the film was being made by people who loved him, and there's a built-in bias there.
From there, it just opened up into a really, really long conversation.
I think that's it.
But I think if you just dial down the energy level, you have a really, really common story.
And I think that's where #MeToo and cancel culture, that's the intention behind it.
