     Blue Beetle Set Photos Reveal First Look At Xolo Maridue√±a In Costume
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first pictures of star Xolo Maridue√±a in costume as DC's Blue Beetle have finally emerged.
This take on the Blue Beetle should look amazing if nothing else when Blue Beetle lands later on.
The suit looks good, which is a big thing‚Äîa lot of superhero suits only look good in motion (Robert Pattinson's Batman, for example), but the Blue Beetle suit looks good even in grainy photos taken from the set.
Blue Beetle is set to arrive on August 18th, 2023.
