     'Women Talking' Streaming: How to Watch 'Women Talking'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A pleasant surprise on this year’s Best Picture nominees list, director Sarah Polley’s Women Talking might not have stirred the same buzz as its fellow competitors, but it’d be a painful shame to overlook the project based on hype alone.
Based on the true story of a Mennonite colony in Bolivia, Women Talking follows eight main characters portrayed by Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Sheila McCarthy, Judith Ivey, Kate Hallett, Liv McNeil, and Michelle McLeod.
As the film is currently still in theaters, there’s no means of watching Women Talking online just yet.
But given that the film’s production company, Orion Pictures, is owned by Amazon, there’s at least a chance Prime Video will end up streaming the film in the coming weeks—especially as the Oscars draw nearer.
If not, the film should become available to rent and purchase on Amazon, YouTube, and Apple TV soon enough.

     ‘Women Talking’ tackles uncomfortable questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Upon seeing the costumes in “Women Talking,” I assumed that it was a period piece, perhaps set sometime in the 19th century.
“Women Talking” centers around an isolated Mennonite community that has had a series of violent sexual attacks come to light.
Despite addressing a true story, both the movie and book choose to not reference any of the real women involved.
In this, Polley manages to make the themes of the movie feel universal.
Verdict: “Women Talking” is a stunning drama held together by an excellent script and bold acting performances.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I had trouble with “Women Talking”.
In the cult these women live in, women are uneducated and illiterate.
“Women Talking” is based on Miriam Toews's 2018 novel of the same name which was, in turn, based on a true story of vicious serial rapes in an insular, ultraconservative Mennonite cult in Bolivia.
I thought “Women Talking” would make a better play than a movie because it basically takes place on one set.
“Women Talking” is currently showing at the Landmark theater in St. Louis.

     Movie Review: ‘Women Talking’ is Lacking the Right Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Movie Review: ‘Women Talking’ is Lacking the Right DirectorDirector: Sarah PolleyWriters: Sarah Polley and Miriam ToewsStars: Claire Foy, Rooney Mara, Jessie BuckleySynopsis: Do nothing.
This story is the basis of Women Talking, directed by Sarah Polley.
Thankfully, the film spares the audience from having to see the brutal attack take place on these women and children.
The entire film Women Talking is made up of these women debating, discussing, and planning.
Although the premise of the film does have tremendous potential, in the end, Women Talking does little to deliver on that opportunity.

     Straight ‘Women Talking’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Women Talking calls to mind another film hell-bent on bracing the truth: 1957’s 12 Angry Men, Sidney Lumet’s Oscar-nominated legend.
In ‘Talking’, we have the incandescent Rooney Mara, in a role as luminous as Henry Fonda’s was in the former.
The scandal that destroyed a faith’s reputationA little background: The headlines of the Bolivia Mennonite scandal hit the international press in 2011 like a threshing harrow.
The women sense no threat from him, and ask him to take notes of their debates, their court reporter.
People will be talking about Women Talking, because Polley waded into intimacies that no one has ever given a good poke.
