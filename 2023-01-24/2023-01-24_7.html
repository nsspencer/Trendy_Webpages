     Tyre Nichols suffered 'extensive bleeding' from beating, family's lawyers say after autopsy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Early findings in an autopsy show that Tyre Nichols, who died days after a traffic stop in Memphis, was severely beaten prior to his death, his family attorneys said Tuesday.
Nichols, 29, was hospitalized and died three days after Memphis, Tennessee, police officers stopped him Jan. 7.
The Shelby County Medical Examiner's office has not released an official cause of death, but Nichols' family has hired a forensic pathologist to review his case.
Preliminary findings from the review found that Nichols "suffered extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating," according to family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci.
Nichols' family met with Memphis officials Monday to view footage of Nichols' traffic stop, which Romanucci described as an "unabashed, nonstop beating."

     Tyre Nichols suffered from 'extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating': Independent autopsy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyre Nichols, the Black man whose death this month at the hands of five Memphis, Tennessee, police officers has triggered national outrage, suffered from "extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating," according to a preliminary independent autopsy commissioned by the family.
"Whatever it takes to clear my son's name and to get justice for my son," Rodney Wells told ABC News.
Nichols' family said he was kicked, pepper-sprayed and shocked with a stun gun, all while Nichols repeatedly asked, "What did I do?"
And once I heard that, I lost it," Rowvaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told ABC News on Monday.
And as he fell over they'd tell him 'sit back up,'" Rodney told ABC News.

According to his family, Nichols was a passionate skateboarder and a father of one who loved homemade cooking and photographing sunsets.
