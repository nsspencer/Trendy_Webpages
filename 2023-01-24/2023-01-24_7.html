     Knicks 105, Cavaliers 103: Scenes from Isaiah Hartenstein’s clutch defense. Really.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cavaliers superstar Donovan Mitchell — who has been connected with the Knicks from time to time, you may have heard — had the ball with 15 seconds remaining and the Knicks up by just two.
He easily drove past Julius Randle, and darted into the paint, where he was met at the basket by...I shit you now, Isaiah Hartenstein.
(via @KnicksMSGN)pic.twitter.com/I4Gqx1rfY3 — Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 25, 2023That block helped seal a 105-103 win for the Knicks.
The Knicks still gave up too many rebounds, but Hartenstein was frisky on D in his 23 minutes of playing time.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he reclaims the starting job from Jericho Sims while Mitchell Robinson is out.

     Summary: The Knicks needing a stop to preserve a two-point lead and snap a four-game losing streak.
Amid what has been a rocky start to plugging Robinson’s role, Hartenstein gave the Knicks’ quest its most significant boost yet.
The Knicks’ defense still allowed Cavaliers’ center Jarrett Allen to score 24 points, repeatedly piercing the heart of the defense, but Hartenstein said he felt the team defense was better.
When Mitchell drove toward Hartenstein, the center thought of Tom Thibodeau.
RJ Barrett repeated it after the game, too, so Hartenstein thought of Thibodeau’s voice: “Just being vertical, no matter what he does,” Hartenstein said.
