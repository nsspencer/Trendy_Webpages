     It’s All My Fault That Fireball Whiskey Is Being Sued
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week we told you about the company that makes Fireball was being sued in court for allegedly misleading consumers with the mini bottles of the popular acholic beverage that are being sold at gas stations in the Hudson Valley.
If you look at the labels of Fireball sold at gas stations they say it's cinnamon with whiskey flavoring, as compared to the real stuff which says it's cinnamon whiskey.
I'm one of those people that HATES when dumb lawsuits are filed but I do know that the fireball sold at gas stations confused me when I first saw them on sale.
If the person who filed the lawsuit wins, the company that makes Fireball, Sazerac Company, Inc., would be responsible for paying money to anyone who purchased mini bottles of the Fireball at gas stations.

     Fireball Cinnamon Faces Lawsuit Over Mini-Bottles That Don’t Contain Whiskey – NBC Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A class-action lawsuit has been filed in Cook County, Illinois against the makers of Fireball Cinnamon over what the plaintiff alleges is purposefully misleading packaging.
Made by parent company Sazerac, Fireball Cinnamon is a suite of products that include malt-based and wine-based alcoholic beverages made to “capture the essence” of the original Fireball Cinnamon Whisky — but don’t contain any actual whiskey.
Lawyers for the plaintiff provided images of both Fireball Cinnamon Whisky and Fireball Cinnamon for comparison.
A representative for Sazerac, the makers of both Fireball products, tells TODAY.com the company does not comment on ongoing litigation.
“Unlike Fireball Whisky, Fireball Cinnamon malt or wine based products can be sold in beer, malt beverage and wine stores for our fans who want a wider variety of convenient shopping locations,” it reads.
