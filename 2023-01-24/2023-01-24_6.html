     Microsoft Erases Gains After Saying Azure Growth to Decelerate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Microsoft Corp. shares declined after the company warned that revenue growth in its cloud-computing business will decelerate in the coming months and corporate software sales will slow, fueling concern about demand for the products that have driven its momentum in recent years.
Shares fell as much as 2.7% to $235.51 in pre-market trading.
Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in a call with investors Tuesday that Azure sales in the current period will slow by 4 or 5 points from the end of the fiscal second quarter, when gains were in the mid-30s percentage-wise.
That business had marked a bright spot in a lackluster earnings report for Microsoft, whose other divisions were held back by a slump in sales related to personal computer software and video games.

     Microsoft offers lackluster guidance, says new business growth slowed in December
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Microsoft called for $50.5 billion to $51.5 billion in fiscal third quarter revenue, which works out to 3% implied growth, while analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $52.43 billion.
Business weakened in December, including in growth of consumption of Azure cloud services, Hood said on the call.
"In our commercial business we expect business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3," she said.
The unit includes the Azure public cloud, Windows Server, SQL Server, Nuance and Enterprise Services.
Hood said she expects Azure cloud growth to slow again in the fiscal third quarter.

     Microsoft FQ2 2023 Quick Take: A Tale Of Two Halves (NASDAQ:MSFT)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty ImagesThe fiscal second quarter just ended continued to exhibit resilient results at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) despite persistent macroeconomic challenges, including major FX headwinds.
Specifically, improvements to margin preservation and expansion amid the looming economic downturn will be a key driver of potential upside recovery for Microsoft in the second half of calendar 2023.
Breaking Down the External Macro HeadwindsWe view these as temporary factors beyond Microsoft’s control that will continue to challenge its near-term fundamental performance.
Consumer WeaknessThe cyclical nature of PC demand will also remain a drag on Microsoft’s MPC results within the foreseeable future.
The impact of related cost-savings initiatives are expected to become more evident in the second half of calendar 2023, given the extended timeline of execution.
