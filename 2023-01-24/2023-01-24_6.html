     Andrea Riseborough’s Last-Minute and Star-Studded Oscars Campaign Pays Off With Surprise Best Actress Nom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a year crowded with best actress contenders, it pays to have famous friends in your court.
To Leslie had gone virtually unnoticed this awards season until late-breaking support from scores of A-list actors propelled Riseborough over the finish line.
Social media in particular has seen massive support for the film, and Riseborough’s performance, with an overwhelming eclectic bunch of celebrities expressing online praise.
Tan France, Jenny McCarthy, Frances Fisher, Rosanna Arquette, Debra Winger, Patricia Clarkson and Howard Stern are also among the names who showed support for the film and actress.
Riseborough isn’t the only surprise nomination in one of the year’s most competitive categories.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of all the surprises that happened with this year’s Oscar nominations, one of the buzzier ones is the Best Actress nomination for Andrea Riseborough.
Her eleventh-hour, word-of-mouth Oscar campaign for her performance in Michael Morris’ indie drama To Leslie was a success, with her name sitting amongst fellow nominees Cate Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh, Michelle Williams, and Ana de Armas.
It was so hard to believe it might ever happen because we really hadn’t been in the running for anything else.
Made without judgment, or commentary, just that magic of watching people behave,” actor Sarah Paulson told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month.
She’s been waiting in the wings for years now, and hopefully, this nomination means we’ll see more center-stage performances from her.

     How Andrea Riseborough Got That Surprise Oscar Nomination for ‘To Leslie’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, the film’s star Andrea Riseborough is nominated for the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role.
Awards pundits wrongly assumed that the celeb-backed campaign, while noteworthy, was a little too late to make a nomination happen.
It came down to support from the film community, Riseborough said Tuesday.
“The idea that you need endless resources, I don’t think that’s necessarily true,” Riseborough told Variety shortly after the Oscar noms were announced Tuesday morning.
After Riseborough nabbed a Spirit Award nomination, McCormack got to work with help from publicity powerhouses Shelter PR and Narrative PR.

     Andrea Riseborough Reacts To Surprise Best Actress Oscar Nomination For ‘To Leslie’: “I’m Not Entirely Sure How This Happened”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrea Riseborough’s late-blooming word-of-mouth awards campaign for her title role in To Leslie has resulted in the British star’s first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, upending received wisdom about the direction of this year’s race.
Riseborough joins Cate Blanchett, Ana de Armas, Michelle Williams and Michelle Yeoh in this year’s Oscar Best Actress race.
A fellow nominee today, Blanchett, singled out Riseborough’s performance in interviews at the recent Critics Choice Awards, where Blanchett won Best Actress.
Reacting to the groundswell of support, Riseborough said with a laugh: “I’m not entirely sure how the f*ck this happened.
It’s really not something I’ve ever experienced before.”In fact, there’s very limited precedent in Oscar history for a late-breaking grassroots awards campaign gathering enough steam to land a nomination.
