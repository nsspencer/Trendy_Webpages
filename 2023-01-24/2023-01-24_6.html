     Summary: The 2023 Oscars Nominated Judd Hirsch Again For The Fabelmans, But How Did It Take This Long?
He received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1980 for his portrayal of the tough, yet compassionate psychiatrist Dr. Berger in Robert Redford's "Ordinary People."
At long last, Hirsch earned his second Academy Award nomination for his brief, yet shattering turn as Uncle Boris in Steven Spielberg's "The Fabelmans."
Why has it taken 43 years for Hirsch, who is now 87 years old, to get his second shot at an Oscar?
Alas, he hasn't been the most prolific film actor over this span.

     Steven Spielberg On ‘Fabelmans’ Oscar Noms, His First Screenplay Nod, ‘Indiana Jones’ &amp; Why Theatrical B.O. “Will Come Back”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Spielberg’s autobiopic The Fabelmans notched seven Oscar nominations today including Best Picture and the filmmaker’s ninth directing nod.
That long delay for The Fabelmans in Spielberg’s career was never due to writers’ block nor the need to paint the most perfect portrait of his life.
However, Spielberg isn’t pessimistic about the future of theatrical or adult dramas on the big screen.
AMERICAN BEAUTY, Kevin Spacey, 1999He references two DreamWorks and Sam Mendes movies: Oscar Best Picture Winner American Beauty from 1999 and 1917 which debuted in 2019.
In regards to the future of the Indiana Jones franchise, which includes an early in the works Disney+/Lucasfilm series, Spielberg says he was “peripherally involved” with the next movie.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (JTA) – “The Fabelmans,” Steven Spielberg’s autobiographical drama about his Jewish upbringing, had an expected strong haul of Oscar nominations, picking up seven nods Tuesday morning.
“The Fabelmans” was the best picture nominee with the strongest Jewish themes, but it wasn’t the only one.
One possible silver lining for the remake’s producers: The 1930 film went on to win best picture that year.
Back to this year’s Oscars: “Top Gun: Maverick,” the action blockbuster sequel, picked up four nominations, including for best picture.
Skolimowski’s father was a member of the Polish Resistance and his mother hid a Jewish family in their house during World War II.

     Joyce Carol Oates Sure Tweets About The Fabelmans a Lot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No, instead Oates has become a pro bono critic on Twitter, where tastemakers and trolls flaunt themselves in perfect disharmony.
Since Christmas, she has tweeted at least a dozen times about her distaste for Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans.
Oates’s Twitter feed will tell you she is almost never joking.
Oates doesn’t think of her tweets as “engraved in stone,” as she told Bustle last year.
As for Oates’s Spielberg commentary, it’s only as self-aggrandizing and ephemeral as anything else on Twitter.
