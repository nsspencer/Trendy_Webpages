     'Doomsday Clock' moves to 90 seconds to midnight as nuclear threat rises
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The clock's hands are moved closer to or further away from midnight based on scientists' reading of existential threats at a particular time.
The new time reflects a world in which Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revived fears of nuclear war.
"Russia's thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict by accident, intention or miscalculation is a terrible risk.
The clock had been set to 100 seconds to midnight since 2020, which was already the closest it had ever come to midnight.
At 17 minutes to midnight, the clock was furthest from "doomsday" in 1991, as the Cold War ended and the United States and Soviet Union signed a treaty that substantially reduced both countries' nuclear weapons arsenals.

     The Doomsday Clock moves to 90 seconds to midnight, signaling more peril than ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world is closer to catastrophe than ever: the Doomsday Clock, the metaphorical measure of challenges to humanity, was reset to 90 seconds before midnight on Tuesday.
The clock created a stir when it was set to 100 seconds to midnight in 2020, the first time the famous clock had gone down to seconds rather than minutes.
The scientists behind the Doomsday Clock use it to alert humanity to threats from within — the perils we face from our own technologies, particularly through nuclear war, global climate change and biotechnology.
Of the new update, Mary Robinson, former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said: "The Doomsday Clock is sounding an alarm for the whole of humanity.
Much of Tuesday's announcement focused on Russia, and President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons and his refusal to accept anything other than victory in Ukraine.

     Ukraine war moves 'Doomsday Clock' to 90 seconds to midnight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — (AP) — With Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the specter of nuclear weapon use, Earth crept its closest to Armageddon, a science-oriented advocacy group said, moving its famous "Doomsday Clock" up to just 90 seconds before midnight.
“We are really closer to that doomsday,” former Mongolian president Elbegdorj Tsakhia said Tuesday at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists annual announcement rating how close humanity is from doing itself in.
The advocacy group started in 1947 to use a clock to symbolize the potential and likelihood of people doing something to end humanity.
It moved the clock 10 seconds closer than last year, making it the closest it has ever been to striking 12.
“We are sending a message that the situation is becoming more urgent,” Bulletin President Rachel Bronson said at the online announcement.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The Doomsday Clock has been ticking for 76 years.
“We are living in a time of unprecedented danger, and the Doomsday Clock time reflects that reality,” Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin, said in the release.
The US government, its NATO allies and Ukraine have a multitude of channels for dialogue; we urge leaders to explore all of them to their fullest ability to turn back the Clock.”What is the Doomsday Clock?
Originally, the organization was conceived to measure nuclear threats, but in 2007 the Bulletin made the decision to include climate change in its calculations.
The Doomsday Clock is set every year by the experts on the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 11 Nobel laureates.
