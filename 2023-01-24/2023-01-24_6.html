     “Stereotypes”: Deconstructing Stevie Nicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first things one thinks of when it comes to Stevie Nicks are the floaty dresses, sky-high boots, the on-stage twirling, and the “witchy” vibe that helped propel Fleetwood Mac to new levels of recognition in the 70s ….and beyond.
Fun fact: Christine McVie was the tie-breaking vote on bringing Nicks and Buckingham into the band.
This “new,” more pop-driven version of Fleetwood Mac exploded.
Nicks has been through a lifetime of drama, with drug problems, complicated relationships (many documented on the acclaimed Rumours), health issues, and plenty of loss.
Our new series, StereoTypes, delves into Nicks’ image, music, and more.
