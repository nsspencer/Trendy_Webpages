     Summary: Brignone told Shiffrin, “Congrats,” and Shiffrin responded, “Oh my god.”It was Shiffrin’s ninth win of the season.
Vonn was 33 when she won her last World Cup event and Stenmark was 32.
The record also comes nearly a year after Shiffrin didn’t win a medal in six events at the Beijing Olympics after entering amid big expectations.
Shiffrin can quickly add to her record total in another giant slalom at Kronplatz on Wednesday.
That was where Shiffrin made her World Cup debut as a 15-year-old in March 2011.

     Summary: American skier Mikaela Shiffrin felt all that and more after winning a record 83rd World Cup race Tuesday.
Shiffrin posted the fastest first run and was therefore the last skier to race in the second run.
Vonn was 33 when she won her last World Cup event and Stenmark was 32.
She didn’t take long to rebound from her Beijing performance, claiming her fourth overall World Cup title at the end of last season.
That was where Shiffrin made her World Cup debut as a 15-year-old in March 2011.

     Mikaela Shiffrin breaks women’s Alpine skiing World Cup wins record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Early Tuesday morning in the U.S., Shiffrin won her 83rd career World Cup ski race, a giant slalom in Italy, passing retired fellow U.S. racer Lindsey Vonn for the most career victories by a woman (or American of either gender).
Because the Alpine World Championships interrupt the World Cup schedule, Shiffrin can’t mathematically pass Stenmark until late February.
Alpine ski racing has a modest audience compared to the big U.S. professional sports, and Shiffrin’s record pursuit can potentially grow that audience, and Shiffrin’s brand.
Ski afficionados will explain that the months-long grind of the World Cup is the true test of greatness, and that would not be wrong.
(Also, Shiffrin won a combined three Olympic medals — two gold — at the 2014 and ’18 Games; the only American woman with more is Julia Mancuso, who won four).
