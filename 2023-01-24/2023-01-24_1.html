     'Rick and Morty' co-creator Justin Roiland out at Adult Swim, Hulu after domestic violence charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entertainment companies are cutting ties with "Rick and Morty" co-creator and star Justin Roiland following revelations that he faces felony charges of domestic violence.
He had an overall deal with the streamer and produced its animated series "Solar Opposites" and "Koala Man."
Hulu's announcement came soon after Adult Swim, which is owned by Cartoon Network, also cut ties with Roiland in connection to the charges.
Roiland helped create the cable channel's popular animated series "Rick and Morty," which premiered in 2013.
Roiland's voice roles will be recast, as well, said Marie Moore, the senior vice president of communications at Warner Bros.

     Adult Swim Severs Ties With RICK AND MORTY Co-Creator Justin Roiland Following Domestic Abuse Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this month, Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland was charged with felony domestic violence in Orange County, California, and while he denied the accusations when they were first brought against him back in 2020, Adult Swim has now decided to sever ties.
“Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland,” Cartoon Network/Boomerang svp communications Mairie Moore said in a brief statement.
Roiland was charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury, and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit.
The woman in question has not been named, but is believed to be someone Roiland was dating at the time of the alleged incident.
Several pre-trial hearings have already occurred, and Roiland is due to return to court on April 27.

     ‘Rick and Morty’ Co-Creator Justin Roiland Dropped by Adult Swim Following Domestic Violence Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adult Swim is severing ties with “Rick &amp; Morty” co-creator Roiland after he was charged with domestic violence.
“Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland,” the network said in a statement.
In addition to co-creating “Rick &amp; Morty” with Dan Harmon, Roiland also provides the voices of the two main characters on the show as well as various other characters.
Adult Swim had previously renewed “Rick &amp; Morty” in 2018 for 70 additional episodes with the intention of taking it to 100 episodes at least.
Roiland also has the animated comedy “Solar Opposites” at Hulu, which was renewed for a fifth season back in October.

     Hulu joins Adult Swim in cutting ties with ‘Rick and Morty’ co-creator Justin Roiland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hulu has severed ties with Justin Roiland, co-creator of its show “Solar Opposites” and the Adult Swim series “Rick and Morty,” the company announced Wednesday.
The announcement comes a day after Adult Swim announced it had ended its relationship with Roiland and several weeks after news began to circulate about domestic violence charges against Roiland.
“We have ended our association with Justin Roiland,” Hulu Originals and 20th TV Animation said in statement sent to The Times on Wednesday.
Perhaps the biggest void left by Roiland’s absence is on his Adult Swim show “Rick and Morty,” which also streams on Hulu.
Adult Swim, the Cartoon Network’s counterpart for mature audiences, aired six seasons the Emmy-winning “Rick and Morty,” which Roiland co-created with Dan Harmon.
