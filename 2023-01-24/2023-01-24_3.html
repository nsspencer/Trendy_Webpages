     Houston under severe weather threat Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesA bout of severe weather could be in store for Houston on Tuesday, so pack the umbrella.
Driving the news: A cold front pushing through the state could bring thunderstorms and other types of severe weather through the evening.
Threat level: The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gives Houston a slight risk (a 2 on a scale of 5) for severe weather, with higher risks for communities generally south of Harris County.
"It should be fairly widespread showers and storms," said Tim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston.
Yes, but: The total rainfall predicted between now and the end of April is still below average despite the threat of severe weather this week.

     Houston weather: Strong storms today; latest watches and warnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some storms may become strong to severe, with the most intense storms closer to the coast.
Watches and warnings are very likely on Tuesday, so remember that a watch means that severe storms are possible, but a warning means that one is happening and is issued for a smaller, very specific area.
With several inches of rain possible by early this afternoon, some street flooding will be possible.
The primary threat from the possible severe storms will be damaging winds with gusts from 30 miles per hour to 50 miles per hour.
Look for several rounds of showers and storms producing widespread rain across the Houston area.
