     Houston weather: Strong storms today; latest watches and warnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some storms may become strong to severe, with the most intense storms closer to the coast.
Watches and warnings are very likely on Tuesday, so remember that a watch means that severe storms are possible, but a warning means that one is happening and is issued for a smaller, very specific area.
With several inches of rain possible by early this afternoon, some street flooding will be possible.
The primary threat from the possible severe storms will be damaging winds with gusts from 30 miles per hour to 50 miles per hour.
Look for several rounds of showers and storms producing widespread rain across the Houston area.

     'Tornado Emergency' issued in Houston area for first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The storm caused major damage across town and a Tornado Emergency was issued for the first time.
One of those alerts issued by the National Weather Service was a 'Tornado Emergency' and it was the first time such an alert has been issued in the Houston area.
Here is the definition of a Tornado Emergency, verbatim from the National Weather Service: 'An exceedingly rare tornado warning issued when there is a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from an imminent or ongoing tornado.
This tornado warning is reserved for situations when a reliable source confirms a tornado, or there is clear radar evidence of the existence of a damaging tornado, such as the observation of debris.'
A Tornado Emergency was issued for the confirmed tornado east of #Houston - since the product's inception in 2016, this was the 1st time issued.
