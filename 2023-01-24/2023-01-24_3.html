     Lake Houston's spillway dam opened to help keep lake from flooding after Tuesday's rains

     Summary: Lake Houston's spillway dam opened to help keep lake from flooding after Tuesday's rainsHOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- As a precaution, the City of Houston opened Lake Houston's spillway dam to help keep the lake at normal levels after Tuesday's rains.
That means neighbors living downstream should secure their boats and other items if they're near the shoreline.
The forecast anticipates at least 2" to 5" inches of rain within the San Jacinto Watershed.
High winds exceeding 20 miles per hour are another major threat expected.

     Houston under severe weather threat Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesA bout of severe weather could be in store for Houston on Tuesday, so pack the umbrella.
Driving the news: A cold front pushing through the state could bring thunderstorms and other types of severe weather through the evening.
Threat level: The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gives Houston a slight risk (a 2 on a scale of 5) for severe weather, with higher risks for communities generally south of Harris County.
"It should be fairly widespread showers and storms," said Tim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston.
Yes, but: The total rainfall predicted between now and the end of April is still below average despite the threat of severe weather this week.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Eyewitness News has been following the movement of a storm front that had the potential for street flooding and tornadic activity in southeast Texas on Tuesday afternoon.
What precipitated was scene after scene of hazardous driving conditions, partially collapsed buildings, and, in on one occasion, outdoor fixtures being destroyed by projectile-like tree branches.
