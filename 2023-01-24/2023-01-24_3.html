     'Tornado Emergency' issued in Houston area for first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The storm caused major damage across town and a Tornado Emergency was issued for the first time.
One of those alerts issued by the National Weather Service was a 'Tornado Emergency' and it was the first time such an alert has been issued in the Houston area.
Here is the definition of a Tornado Emergency, verbatim from the National Weather Service: 'An exceedingly rare tornado warning issued when there is a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from an imminent or ongoing tornado.
This tornado warning is reserved for situations when a reliable source confirms a tornado, or there is clear radar evidence of the existence of a damaging tornado, such as the observation of debris.'
A Tornado Emergency was issued for the confirmed tornado east of #Houston - since the product's inception in 2016, this was the 1st time issued.
