     Statement from President Biden on the Shooting in Half Moon Bay, California
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jill and I are praying for those killed and injured in the latest tragic shooting in Half Moon Bay, California.
For the second time in recent days, California communities are mourning the loss of loved ones in a senseless act of gun violence.
Following a briefing from my homeland security team, I have directed my administration to ensure local authorities and the broader Half Moon Bay community have the full support of the federal government in the wake of this heinous attack.
Yesterday, Senator Feinstein — alongside Senators Murphy, Blumenthal and others — reintroduced a federal Assault Weapons Ban and legislation that would raise the minimum purchase age for assault weapons to 21.
I once again urge both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this Assault Weapons Ban to my desk, and take action to keep American communities, schools, workplaces, and homes safe.
