     Summary: Losers of seven of their last nine games, the Dallas Mavericks are at their lowest.
Nico Harrison was brought in to add talent to the Dallas Mavericks rosterIn the summer of 2021, Mark Cuban made bold moves on the Dallas Mavericks.
He replaced them with player friendly Jason Kidd and sneaker legend, Nico Harrison.
Today, the Dallas Mavericks sit as far away from being a contender as they ever have since Luka joined the team.
The Dallas Mavericks need better talent and it’s on Nico Harrison to get it.

     Mavs’ nightmare scenario for 2023 NBA trade deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luckily, the trade deadline is still not upon us, so there’s still time for the Mavs front office to shore up some of the holes on this roster.
Mavs nightmare scenario for the trade deadlineIt’s easier to identify the areas where Dallas is set than where they need help at this point.
The Mavs have been heavily involved in trade rumors, partly because everyone knows that they need help.
That needs to be addressed one way or another at the trade deadline.
Sitting out the trade deadline would be a terrible, terrible decision for several different reasons, and it’s an obvious nightmare scenario for the Mavericks.

     Summary: In the Dallas Mavericks’ most recent embarrassing loss against the Washington Wizards, the boys in blue and green found themselves down by four heading into the second quarter.
Instead, the Mavericks gave up a 8-1 run and lost the lead over the next two minutes of game action.
Surely you can make another run and establish the elusive 15-point lead that would go a long way towards securing a desperately needed win.
Instead, the Mavericks gave up a 12-1 run to end the half and trailed 65-60 entering the break.
We all remember that Bucks game; Dallas played really well and should have won it, but blew the game at the free throw line.
