     Celtics see win streak come to end with loss in Orlando
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sometimes in professional sports — and life in general, really, as we continue to descend closer towards undeniable madness with each passing day — there’s things that just don’t seem to make much sense.
The NBA-best Celtics’ struggles with the Orlando Magic, who even after Monday’s triumph over the Celtics remain in the third-worst spot in the East and 4.5 games out of the playoff play-in tournament, would certainly fall under that umbrella.
On the wrong end of a 113-98 final at Orlando’s Amway Center, the Celtics have now dropped three of four meetings with the Magic in 2022-23, with defeats to Orlando making up 23 percent of the Green’s total losses on the year.
”I think it says more about Orlando and how they played tonight,” Boston interim coach Joe Mazzulla said after the loss, which put an end to the C’s nine-game winning streak.
We had a lot of good moments of that, but I thought they played really well.”

On Tuesday night, the Heat beat the Celtics 98-95, evening their season series against Boston 2-2.
Celtics gave away the ball 17 times in the narrow loss to the HEAT, in a matchup the Celtics had a chance to win if they didn't again generate self-inflicted wounds.
pic.twitter.com/ySg1DVRsko — Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) January 25, 2023Kind of an odd way of phrasing things, right?
That's because it's a direct reference to a tweet the Dallas Cowboys sent out after their loss to the San Francisco 49ers -- a tweet that was, unusually, directed at Dak Prescott.

     Why Celtics said ‘unorthodox’ Magic give them issues after 3 straight losses to Orlando
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet, the C’s have struggled immensely against a young Magic squad that’s third-to-last in the East — and that trend continued Monday.
In what’s became commonplace this season, the Magic looked comfortable as they built up a double-digit lead on the Celtics in the first half.
While Boston did come back to force a tight game, the Magic eventually pulled away when Jayson Tatum was tending to an injury scare in the third quarter.
Orlando never looked back, and for the third straight game, the Magic beat the Celtics, this time in a 113-98 victory at Amway Center.
The win improved Orlando’s record to 18-29 on the season, meaning a sixth of the team’s wins have come solely against the first-place Celtics.

The Celtics return to Boston to host the Knicks on Thursday night.
Celtics offense comes unglued late: Boston was able to overcome some tired legs for the better part of three quarters but the Celtics went 6:21 without scoring midway through the fourth quarter, allowing the Heat to go on a 15-0 run and erase a 10-point Celtics lead.
Joe Mazzulla rode Pritchard, Tatum and Grant Williams for big minutes and there wasn’t much left in the tank against a stout Miami defense late.

     Summary: But the influx of young talent in the league right now is bonkers.
Jonathan Isaac’s return — and apparent return to form — and the fashion it came in only make that more emphatically the case.
Houston got a rare win as well, and they’re another example of being loaded with young talent featuring star talent like Jalen Green alongside solid cornerstone potential in Alperen Sengun, similar to Portland’s Shaedon Sharpe.
Monday, he peacefully thrived, posting 37 points (12-19 FG, 7-11 3P) and 12 assists (just three turnovers) in only 31 minutes.
Tyus Jones, starting in place of Ja Morant, stepped up big time with eight assists to one turnover in 31 minutes.
