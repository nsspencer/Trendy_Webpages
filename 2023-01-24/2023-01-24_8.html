     Explainer: What is the 'Doomsday Clock' and how does it work?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 24 (Reuters) - Atomic scientists reset the "Doomsday Clock" on Tuesday, moving its hands to 90 seconds to midnight - closer than ever before to the threat of annihilation.
WHAT IS THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK?
The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic timepiece showing how close the world is to ending.
A Chicago-based non-profit organization called the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists updates the time annually based on information regarding catastrophic risks to the planet and humanity.
At 90 seconds to midnight, the "Doomsday Clock" is now the closest it has ever been to midnight.

     Ukraine war moves 'Doomsday Clock' to 90 seconds to midnight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — (AP) — With Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the specter of nuclear weapon use, Earth crept its closest to Armageddon, a science-oriented advocacy group said, moving its famous "Doomsday Clock" up to just 90 seconds before midnight.
“We are really closer to that doomsday,” former Mongolian president Elbegdorj Tsakhia said Tuesday at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists annual announcement rating how close humanity is from doing itself in.
The advocacy group started in 1947 to use a clock to symbolize the potential and likelihood of people doing something to end humanity.
It moved the clock 10 seconds closer than last year, making it the closest it has ever been to striking 12.
“We are sending a message that the situation is becoming more urgent,” Bulletin President Rachel Bronson said at the online announcement.

     2023 'Doomsday Clock': This is how close we are to the apocalypse, scientists say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scientists revealed on Tuesday that the "Doomsday Clock" has been moved up to 90 seconds before midnight -- the closest humanity has ever been to armageddon.
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the metaphorical clock up 10 seconds from where it had stayed for the past two years, citing the escalation in Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
"The continuing stream of disinformation about bio weapons laboratories in Ukraine raises concerns that Russia itself maybe thinking of deploying such weapons."
The clock indicates how much time remains until midnight, theoretical doomsday.
In September, Putin issued a thinly veiled threat that Russia would resort to using nuclear weapons in its fight against Ukraine following several setbacks.

     The Doomsday Clock moves to 90 seconds to midnight, signaling more peril than ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world is closer to catastrophe than ever: the Doomsday Clock, the metaphorical measure of challenges to humanity, was reset to 90 seconds before midnight on Tuesday.
The clock created a stir when it was set to 100 seconds to midnight in 2020, the first time the famous clock had gone down to seconds rather than minutes.
The scientists behind the Doomsday Clock use it to alert humanity to threats from within — the perils we face from our own technologies, particularly through nuclear war, global climate change and biotechnology.
Of the new update, Mary Robinson, former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said: "The Doomsday Clock is sounding an alarm for the whole of humanity.
Much of Tuesday's announcement focused on Russia, and President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons and his refusal to accept anything other than victory in Ukraine.

     War in Ukraine pushes Doomsday Clock forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Data: Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Chart: Jacque Schrag/AxiosIn an annual update announced Tuesday morning, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the symbolic Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
Why it matters: The setting moves the clock's hands closer to midnight than it has ever been before.
The clock is a figurative tracker of the world's proximity to total human-caused destruction.
The big picture: Since its inception in 1947, the Doomsday Clock was initially used to represent the danger posed by nuclear weapons.
The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone’s control remains high," the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists said in a press release.
