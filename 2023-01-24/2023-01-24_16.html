     Southampton vs Newcastle United LIVE: League Cup result, final score and reaction

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (REUTERS)Joelinton fired Newcastle United a step closer to Wembley with the winner in an action-packed Carabao Cup semi-final first leg success at Southampton.
Saints thought they had swiftly levelled through Newcastle academy graduate Adam Armstrong but his bundled effort was ruled out for handball following VAR intervention.
Joelinton had a first-half effort controversially chalked off for an adjudged handball, while he wastefully blazed over with the goal gaping early in the second period.
Southampton finished a frantic encounter with 10 men after defender Duje Caleta-Car was dismissed four minutes from time for a second bookable offence.

     League Cup semifinal: Newcastle score first-leg win away to Southampton

     Summary: Newcastle are 90 minutes away from the League Cup final after securing a 1-0 victory away to Southampton in leg 1 of the sides’ semifinal at St. Mary’s Stadium on Tuesday.
[ MORE: How to watch Premier League in USA ]The second leg at St. James’ Park is in one week’s time, next Tuesday, Jan. 31.
The Brazilian hammered the ball past Gavin Bazunu to send the Geordie faithful behind the goal into rapturous celebrations, as they dream of a first major cup final appearance since the 1998-99 FA Cup (first League Cup final appearance since 1976), when they were beaten by treble-winning Manchester United.
The Magpies have scored just once in their last four Premier League games and have drawn three of their last four 0-0.
Jones will rotate his squad heavily in the next few days amid these League Cup semifinals, an FA Cup fourth round tie against Blackpool sandwiched in-between and then a game away at Brentford.

Joelinton appeared to open the scoring in the 39th minute, poking the ball home from close range, but the goal was disallowed for a handball.
Joelinton was in central to the action again in the 53rd minute, missing a wide-open net from point-blank range.
The visitors finally broke through in the 73rd minute, as Joelinton (who else?)
