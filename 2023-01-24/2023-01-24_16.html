     Miami Heat, Jimmy Butler bring amazing experience to disappointed young fan from Argentina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI – The Miami Heat gave an incredible moment to a fan who traveled a long way to see his favorite player.
Just before tipoff on Tuesday, Jimmy Butler was scratched by the Heat, much to the display of the young man who traveled over 4400 miles to see Butler play.
At halftime, the Heat ended up giving Felipe a jersey and a ball, trying to make it right for a disappointed young fan.
Heat player Gabe Vincent gave Felipe the gifts at halftime.
On Wednesday, Felipe had the chance to meet Jimmy Butler.

     Summary: Bam Adebayo throws down huge dunk to the delight of the Miami crowd (0:22)Bam Adebayo throws down huge dunk to the delight of the Miami crowd (0:22)The Miami Heat managed to get in a good social media dig at the Boston Celtics -- and, incredibly, the Dallas Cowboys.
On Tuesday night, the Heat beat the Celtics 98-95, evening their season series against Boston 2-2.
Celtics gave away the ball 17 times in the narrow loss to the HEAT, in a matchup the Celtics had a chance to win if they didn't again generate self-inflicted wounds.
pic.twitter.com/ySg1DVRsko — Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) January 25, 2023Kind of an odd way of phrasing things, right?
That's because it's a direct reference to a tweet the Dallas Cowboys sent out after their loss to the San Francisco 49ers -- a tweet that was, unusually, directed at Dak Prescott.

     Summary: Bidders line up for Miami Heat arena naming rightsWritten by Miami Today on January 24, 2023AdvertisementBankrupt FTX will pay more for basketball arena naming rights even as the county works to remove the crypto firm’s name, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told commissioners last week, and a new naming rights deal with someone else is on the way.
“There are companies coming forward speaking to our staff, to the Heat” about naming rights, the mayor said as commissioners pressed her for details.
This month the arena has had three names, now Miami-Dade Arena, as the county seeks a deal.
What are they doing?”The mayor said the program continues using the funds already received and the county expects an FTX payment this month.
“Any subsequent deal will carry all of the same terms and conditions related to that program,” she said.

In a video posted online before the game, the kid can be seen holding up a sign in hopes that his favorite player, Heat forward Jimmy Butler, would see it while he was warming up on the court.
The boy and his sister had traveled to Miami from Argentina for the game.
“Can we get a photo or a Big Face coffee?” Big Face is the name of the coffee brand Butler founded in 2021.
A great night for the NBA and the young boy, for sure.

     Summary: Attending an NBA game and not seeing your favorite player always stings but for 12-year-old Felipe, it was even more agonizing having flown in all the way from Argentina.
Along with his older sister Zoe, Felipe traveled more than 4,405 miles from South America to be at Miami's FTX Arena for their meeting with Boston Celtics.
The young fan held a sign that read: "Dear Jimmy: We flew over 4,405 miles to see you play.
After cameras caught Felipe and his sister and the clip soon went viral, repeatedly tagging the Heat and Butler, Miami made things right by half-time.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics were down three starters and their sixth man at the Miami Heat on Tuesday night.
This one had the makings of a loss, and possibly a blowout loss, written all over it.
In his last 25 games, through Tuesday against Miami, Hauser is at 28.6% from deep on 3.4 long-balls per game.
Derrick White had a really good game.
Williams and Al Horford will probably split those, with Horford playing Game 1 and Williams playing Game 2.
