     Knicks Fans Thrilled by Win vs. Donovan Mitchell, Cavs After NY's Offseason Interest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elsa/Getty ImagesOne of the top storylines of the 2022 offseason was the New York Knicks' reported interest in trading for three-time All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell.
Such was the case during Tuesday night's matchup at Madison Square Garden, as Knicks fans reveled in a 105-103 win that saw Mitchell come up short multiple times in crucial moments.
Failing to acquire a superstar like Mitchell understandably still had Knicks fans feeling disappointed, so Tuesday's win was extra special.
Fans on Twitter made sure to celebrate New York's victory at Mitchell's expense:Tuesday's win was New York's second victory over Cleveland on its home floor, and the team now leads the season series 2-1.
Mitchell and the Cavs (29-20) will look to get back on track when they visit the Houston Rockets (11-36) on Thursday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his stead, Darius Garland has stepped up magnificently for the Cavs.
Mitchell had nothing but high praise for Garland as the former discussed how Darius has elevated his game of late.
So much so, that Mitchell believes that Garland should be an All-Star this season:“At the beginning of the year, I was constantly telling him things, different things.
Really, really well,” Donovan said.
At this point, it wouldn’t be surprising if we see both men linking up in Utah this February for the highly-anticipated All-Star Game.
