     Scott Rolen elected to Hall of Fame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott Rolen has been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, it was announced today.
Carlos Beltran, in his first year on the ballot, received just 46.5% of the vote — the same percentage as Jeff Kent.
Beltran is a clear Hall of Famer based on performance, but his involvement in the sign stealing scandal with the Houston Astros in 2017 resulted in him losing support.
Torii Hunter, who was making his debut on the ballot as well, received 6.9%, meaning he will stay on the ballot for another year.
Omar Vizquel got more votes than Bobby Abreu, which vexes me.

     Rolen elected in 6th year; Wagner, Rollins, Abreu climb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of Rolen reaching Cooperstown started to really gain steam in 2021, when his percentage jumped to 52.9%.
While Rolen managed to break through in the 2023 voting, the news wasn't quite as good for the other former Phillies on the ballot.
Former Phillies closer Billy Wagner continued his push toward election, receiving 68.1% of the votes in his eighth year on the ballot.
Fellow outfielder Jayson Werth wasn't as fortunate, as he did not receive any votes in his first year on the ballot.
In addition to Wagner, Rollins and Abreu continuing their quest, six-time All-Star and 2008 World Series champion Chase Utley will be eligible for the Hall of Fame for the first time.

     Eight-time Gold Glove 3B Scott Rolen makes Baseball Hall of Fame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott Rolen has been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, sneaking over the threshold by the narrowest of margins.
Along with Helton, none of the other 27 players listed on the 2023 ballot cleared the 75% minimum for election.
Hall of Fame Voting Some 136 ballots were cast through the Baseball Writers' Association of America for this year's Hall of Fame class.
Soft-spoken Fred McGriff will enter the Hall alongside Rolen after being selected by an era committee at the winter meetings in December in San Diego.
Next season will be his 10th and final opportunity to gain election via the writers' ballot.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There was actually never a point in my life that I thought I was going to be a Hall of Fame baseball player,” Rolen said.
His Hall vote rose steadily to 17.2% in 2019, 35.3% in 2020, 52.9% in 2021 and 63.2% last year.
He didn't need to follow Ryan Thibodaux's Hall of Fame Ballot Tracker this year.
“When the phone call came and I saw baseball Hall of Fame on my phone," Rolen said, "you kind of look around, like, that actually did just happen.”They all cried, and a few minutes later Finn asked him to go out and toss a baseball.
“Most of the guys who moved to third probably came up as shortstops,” said Chipper Jones, the previous third baseman elected, in 2018.

     Summary: Scott Rolen has been elected to the Hall of Fame.
The Contemporary Baseball Era has previously elected Fred McGriff, so the Crime Dog will join Rolen in this year’s Hall of Fame class.
“But I look at Scott Rolen and say ‘Yes.’ How many better third basemen have played the game of baseball.
“Here’s the thing that Scott Rolen had that none of these other guys had.
The most recent former Phillie to be elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA before Rolen was the late-Roy Halladay in 2019.
