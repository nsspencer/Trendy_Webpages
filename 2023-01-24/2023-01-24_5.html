     Houston under severe weather threat Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesA bout of severe weather could be in store for Houston on Tuesday, so pack the umbrella.
Driving the news: A cold front pushing through the state could bring thunderstorms and other types of severe weather through the evening.
Threat level: The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gives Houston a slight risk (a 2 on a scale of 5) for severe weather, with higher risks for communities generally south of Harris County.
"It should be fairly widespread showers and storms," said Tim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston.
Yes, but: The total rainfall predicted between now and the end of April is still below average despite the threat of severe weather this week.
