     Germany's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' revels in nine Oscar nods
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BERLIN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Germany's reboot of the famous anti-war classic "All Quiet on the Western Front" landed nine Oscar nominations on Tuesday, including best picture, a haul that surprised its creators.
Albrecht Schuch, Edward Berger, and Malte Grunert arrive at the world premiere of "All Quiet on the Western Front" at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada September 12, 2022.
REUTERS/Mark Blinch"All Quiet on the Western Front" tells the story of young students who go to World War One blinded by right-wing propaganda and nationalist hate, something that Grunert says resonates with modern times.
The movie is also nominated for best international feature film, adapted screenplay, cinematography, visual effects and production design.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's the sort of unrelenting anti-war piece that would decondition John Rambo of his bloodlust: an endless montage of misery and malaise, pale-faced German boys shipped to the impassionate meat grinder to grind the meat of pale-faced French boys.
Their ignorance is broken in a hail of French artillery, their number culled as quickly as they reach the front.
War is hell, so the saying goes, but this is war stripped of Hollywood heroism, of the pretence of moral redemption.
Relentlessly brutal so it is, this is the epic, ambitious cinema that needs to be seen, and its awards recognition is duly deserved.
All Quiet on the Western Front is now streaming on Netflix in the UK.

     Oscars Make a Lot of Noise for Germany’s ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s suddenly a lot of noise around Edward Berger’s WWI epic, All Quiet on the Western Front.
The Netflix drama — the first-ever German adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque’s German anti-war classic — picked up nine Oscar nominations Tuesday, nearly tying the record for most-ever nominations for a non-English-language film.
All Quiet on the Western Front was the only non-English-language movie to make this year’s list of 10 nominees for best picture.
Just last week, the BAFTAs gave their seal of approval, with All Quiet on the Western Front leading the pack with 14 nominations.
Instead, with All Quiet on the Western Front, Berger has managed to create an epic war movie that refuses to romanticize war — an achievement the Academy recognized Tuesday.

     ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ makes some noise at the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Germany’s anti-war epic “All Quiet on the Western Front” based on Erich Maria Remarque’s 1929 classic World War I novel made a lot of noise at the 95th annual Oscar nominations January 24th.
As predicted, “All Quiet” was nominated for Best International Feature, and it has made history by becoming the first German-language movie to be nominated for Best Picture.
Though “All Quiet” director Edward Berger failed to get a nomination in the director category, he shares in one for adapted screenplay with Lesley Paterson and Ian Stokell.
This “All Quiet” would be the second adaptation of Remarque’s novel to win the Best Picture Oscar.
Universal’s lavish 1930 production won two Oscars: Best Picture and Best Director for Lewis Milestone and made its young lead, Lew Ayres, a star.

     Summary: It looks like it’s a forward march into Oscars season with the heavily accoladed war-drama All Quiet on the Western Front.
But in this case, I’m really proud of all the people who got nominated for the film, the effects, makeup, camera, production design, the entire crew, and at the BAFTAs.
BERGER: It’s a momentous moment for me the fact that, and I don’t use this word lightly because Germany has a problem with the word “proud” because of its history.
And so that contribution that got recognized, I’m really proud of.
GRUNERT: And I think there is another element, which for me is, is sort of beautiful and humbling.
