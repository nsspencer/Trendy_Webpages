     Tyre Nichols death: 2 Memphis Fire Department personnel also fired
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two personnel from the Memphis Fire Department have been fired, and an internal investigation has been launched after their involvement in the initial care of Tyre Nichols, who died Jan. 10 following a traffic stop, Fox News has learned.
"Last week, two MFD personnel involved in the initial patient care of Tyre Nichols were relieved of duty while an internal investigation is being conducted," the Tennessee city’s fire department told Fox News on Tuesday.
TYRE NICHOLS: MEMPHIS POLICE BODY CAM VIDEO OF TRAFFIC STOP IS ‘APPALLING,’ ATTORNEY SAYSCivil rights attorney Ben Crump on Monday described body camera footage showing the Jan. 7 traffic stop as "appalling" and "heinous" after reviewing the video with Nichols' family.
MPD initially pulled over Nichols, 29, on Jan. 7 around 8:30 p.m. for "reckless driving" near Raines Road and Ross Road in Memphis, according to a press release.
MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRES 5 OFFICERS INVOLVED IN TYRE NICHOLS’ ARREST BEFORE HIS DEATH 3 DAYS LATERA "confrontation occurred" during the stop, at which point Nichols ran away from police on foot.

     Tyre Nichols suffered from 'extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating': Independent autopsy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyre Nichols, the Black man whose death last month at the hands of five Memphis, Tennessee, police officers has triggered national outrage, suffered from "extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating," according to a preliminary independent autopsy.
"Whatever it takes to clear my son's name and to get justice for my son," Rodney Wells told ABC News.
Nichols' family said he was kicked, pepper-sprayed and shocked with a stun gun, all while Nichols repeatedly asked, "What did I do?"
And once I heard that, I lost it," Rowvaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told ABC News on Monday.
And as he fell over they'd tell him 'sit back up,'" Rodney told ABC News.

     Could better training prevent cases similar to Tyre Nichols?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WREG) — Civil rights attorney Ben Crump calls the death of Tyre Nichols an injustice and his legal team, now representing the Nichols family, is demanding police reform and training of MPD officers.
When bad training takes place, it’s the deprogramming that’s required in order to retrain and get better at what you do,” said attorney Antonio Romanucci, who is part of the family’s legal team.
So, I think we just have to implement them and follow these to prevent these kinds of tragedies,” he said.
The kind of tragedy they say should never have happened to Tyre Nichols or another person.
Attorneys representing the Nichols family they their lawsuit will be wide in scope as it looks into police practices in Memphis.
