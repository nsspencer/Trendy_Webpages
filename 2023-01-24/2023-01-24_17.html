     Justin Bieber sells music catalog to Hipgnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justin Bieber finalized the sale of his music catalog to Hipgnosis on Tuesday, placing most of his music under the ownership of the U.K. investment firm.

Details: Hipgnosis acquired all of Bieber's interest in his publishing copyrights, master recordings and neighboring rights for his entire back catalog, which comprises over 290 titles released before Dec. 31, 2021.
The financial terms were not disclosed but the deal is valued at an estimated $200 million, which is Hipgnosis' biggest acquisition to date, per multiple reports.

     Justin Bieber sells entire back catalog to Hipgnosis Song Management in "historic" deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justin Bieber has sold his entire back catalog of music — more than 290 songs — to Hipgnosis Songs Capital, the music rights investment company announced Tuesday.
Bieber has sold over 150 million records globally, Hipgnosis said, adding that all six of his albums have been certified platinum or multi-platinum.
"When Justin made the decision to make a catalog deal we quickly found the best partner to preserve and grow this amazing legacy was Merck and Hipgnosis," Braun said in the press release.
"Justin is truly a once in a generation artist and that is reflected and acknowledged by the magnitude of this deal."
Shakira struck a similar deal with Hipgnosis earlier this month, selling her catalog of about 145 songs, and 100% of her publishing rights.

     Summary: Pop star sold his music publishing and recording catalogue shares to Hipgnosis Songs Capital, the company said.
Pop juggernaut Justin Bieber has sold his music publishing and recording catalogue shares to the Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital for $200m, the company said, marking the industry’s latest blockbuster rights deal.
“The impact of Justin Bieber on global culture over the last 14 years has truly been remarkable,” Hipgnosis chief Merck Mercuriadis, a longtime music industry executive, said in a statement on Tuesday.
The sector had seemed to cool recently, but the Bieber deal shows investors are still hungry for music acquisitions.
