     American skier Mikaela Shiffrin wins record 83rd World Cup race, breaking tie with former teammate Lindsey Vonn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: American skier Mikaela Shiffrin won a record 83rd World Cup race Tuesday.
Shiffrin's giant slalom victory broke a tie on the all-time women's list with former American teammate Lindsey Vonn, who retired four years ago when injuries cut her career short.
Hours before breaking the record, Shiffrin posted on Twitter that she had been happy with her skiing and track was a "joy to ski."
Shiffrin can quickly add to her record total in another giant slalom at Kronplatz on Wednesday.
Shiffrin now has one more win than Vonn and 21 more wins than the next woman on the all-time list, Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria at 62.

     Summary: American skier Mikaela Shiffrin felt all that and more after winning a record 83rd World Cup race Tuesday.
Shiffrin posted the fastest first run and was therefore the last skier to race in the second run.
Vonn was 33 when she won her last World Cup event and Stenmark was 32.
She didn’t take long to rebound from her Beijing performance, claiming her fourth overall World Cup title at the end of last season.
That was where Shiffrin made her World Cup debut as a 15-year-old in March 2011.

     Summary: What other athletes have done before you is not something that can be broken.”AdvertisementAfter resetting the women’s World Cup victory record Tuesday in Italy, Shiffrin will have to become accustomed to being called the GOAT.
It’s very fitting that it would come in the moment when I’m thinking about it the least and don’t expect it at all.”Shiffrin passed fellow American Lindsey Vonn for the most World Cup wins by a woman.
Shiffrin matched Vonn’s 82 wins Jan. 8 by triumphing in a giant slalom in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, the 233rd World Cup race of her career.
Mikaela Shiffrin reacts after her U.S. record 83rd World Cup win Tuesday in Kronplatz, Italy.
Jeff Shiffrin, 65, was an anesthesiologist by trade and a photographer by hobby, known for snapping photos of his daughter on the World Cup trail.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. skier Mikaela Shiffrin now stands alone atop women's alpine skiing, after claiming World Cup win no.
She is the only skier in history to have won a race in all six World Cup disciplines: downhill, super-G, slalom, giant slalom, combined, and parallel.
In the 2018-19 World Cup season, she won 17 races — a mark no other male or female skier has ever equaled.

She's seen here at the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup event in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.

     Mikaela Shiffrin breaks women’s Alpine skiing World Cup wins record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Early Tuesday morning in the U.S., Shiffrin won her 83rd career World Cup ski race, a giant slalom in Italy, passing retired fellow U.S. racer Lindsey Vonn for the most career victories by a woman (or American of either gender).
Because the Alpine World Championships interrupt the World Cup schedule, Shiffrin can’t mathematically pass Stenmark until late February.
Alpine ski racing has a modest audience compared to the big U.S. professional sports, and Shiffrin’s record pursuit can potentially grow that audience, and Shiffrin’s brand.
Ski afficionados will explain that the months-long grind of the World Cup is the true test of greatness, and that would not be wrong.
(Also, Shiffrin won a combined three Olympic medals — two gold — at the 2014 and ’18 Games; the only American woman with more is Julia Mancuso, who won four).
