     Summary: Justin Bieber is big into big fits.
Big sunglasses.
Alongside wife Hailey Bieber (herself no stranger to big shades in a series of Saint Laurent and Celine frames) Bieber went oval.
And over at sibling outfit Emporio Armani, sunglasses were filled with lime green and amber lenses.
And as long as Bieber's wearing them, the sunglasses supremacy continues.

     Justin Bieber Sold His Music Catalog at the Ripe Old Age of 28
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justin Bieber has sold everything.
The private-equity-backed Hipgnosis Song Management bought Bieber’s entire music catalog, meaning publishing rights and his masters, for a lot of money presumably (Universal Music Group has retained the recorded-music copyright).
I’ve long maintained that Justin Bieber, who was discovered on YouTube by his manager, Scooter Braun, when he was barely a teenager, has already lived several lives.
These catalog sales have ramped up in the last half-decade or so.
Hipgnosis also has Barry Manilow and the other Justin, Justin Timberlake.
