     Rui Hachimura’s 4-word message to Lakers after Wizards trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rui Hachimura is finally getting a brand new start after a rather forgettable stint with the Washington Wizards, and he sure looks excited as he joins the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Wizards traded Hachimura to the Lakers on Monday in exchange for Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks.
The Lakers also took note that Rui Hachimura is the first Japanese player to join the historic franchise, and so the 24-year-old was beaming with pride for the incredible milestone.
Not to mention that he’s a solid two-way player who can improve LA’s wing position.
“We are excited to welcome Rui and his family to the Los Angeles Lakers.

     Summary: The Rui Hachimura trade gets the thumbs up from Lakers legend Magic Johnson.
Los Angeles got trade season started on Monday by acquiring Hachimura from Washington.
Johnson said that Hachimura is going to "really help the Lakers on both ends of the court," adding that his length and size will make a difference defensively.
Laker Nation, Rui Hachimura is going to really help the Lakers on both ends of the court.
Hachimura won't play against the Clippers on Tuesday, but he could make his Lakers debut on Wednesday.

     Lakers refuse to trade unprotected first-round pick for Bojan Bogdanovic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even after the Los Angeles Lakers traded for forward Rui Hachimura on Monday, the speculation they will pull off another trade before the Feb. 9 trade deadline has increased.
Could that next trade be for Detroit Pistons sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanovic?
Although Hachimura should help L.A. in multiple ways, he will not be enough to turn it into a championship contender.
The Pistons want an unprotected first-round pick, while the Lakers only want to give up one with some sort of lottery protection.
Via The Athletic (h/t Lakers Daily):“Detroit’s Bojan Bogdanović continues to be the name most often tied to the Lakers in league circles, but the Pistons are looking for an unprotected first-round pick, at a minimum, in a potential trade, according to league sources,” The Athletic’s Jovan Buha wrote.

     Lakers trade rumors: Bojan Bogdanovic remains a top target; Patrick Beverley most likely to be shipped out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let's take a look at the latest trade rumblings connected with the purple and gold ahead of the 2023 NBA trade deadline on Feb. 9.
At this point, their most likely move would be trading Beverley and a lottery-protected first-round pick for another wing or frontcourt upgrade.
Again, this comes back to a single question: Do the Lakers think a player like Bogdanovic can actually catapult them into even fringe contention?
If not, they're not likely to part with an unprotected pick to get him or anyone else.
This post will continue to update with the latest Lakers trade rumors/reports.

     Lakers trade: How Rui Hachimura can get the most out of his game alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former will help the Lakers as it would help anyone, specifically as it will take some of that defensive burden off LeBron James to cover for what is an incredibly small team.
Hachimura made 44 percent of his 3s last season, but he's down to 33 percent this season on pretty low volume.
To me, Hachimura could legitimately double his volume from three 3-pointers per game to something closer to six.
In the play below, swap out Delon Wright for LeBron James sucking the defense into the paint and imagine how many of these 3-point looks Hachimura could get with the Lakers.
If he does, and especially if it comes at a higher volume, the Lakers just picked up a real two-way contributor on the cheap.

     Summary: The Lakers have been teetering on life support throughout the first half of the NBA gauntlet.
However, the Lakers are three games under .500 nearly 50 games into their season.
Either way, the Lakers could have Hachimura under team control for another season after this one if they choose to retain him.
Ultimately, the Hachimura move should be just the start for a Lakers squad that’s been poorly constructed around James and Davis.
Hachimura won’t be enough to satisfy Shannon Sharpe and the legion of championship-or-bust Lakers fans.

     Summary: And for a Lakers team that has sported a number of 3- and 4-guard lineups, having someone taller than 6’4” on the wing is needed.
A byproduct of trading for Hachimura means that a deal for Cam Reddish is far less likely.
If the Lakers trade Nunn for Reddish, they can’t trade Nunn in a package for someone who would be way more likely to make the Lakers more of a threat.
While Hachimura is in the final year of his contract, the Lakers acquired him with the expectation of bringing him back.
The Lakers have been linked to a number of Hornets players, perhaps most notably in Terry Rozier.

     Lakers Trade Rumors: Pistons' Bojan Bogdanović Is 'Most Often Tied' to Potential Deal
    </h2>

     Summary: Brian Sevald/NBAE via Getty ImagesAfter acquiring Rui Hachimura on Monday, the Los Angeles Lakers may not be done making moves ahead of the Feb. 9 trade deadline.
Per The Athletic's Jovan Buha, Detroit Pistons forward Bojan Bogdanović is the player "most often tied" to the Lakers in a potential deal.
However, Buha notes, the Pistons "at a minimum" want an unprotected first-round pick, and the Lakers would prefer to only give up a lottery-protected pick for Bogdanović.
It's also a descending contract that pays Bogdanović $20 million next season and $19.03 million in 2024-25.
They are only two games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the No.

     Report: Indiana Pacers were 'finalist' for Rui Hachimura before Los Angeles Lakers trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yesterday, the Washington Wizards traded forward Rui Hachimura to the Los Angeles Lakers for Kendrick Nunn and second-round draft picks in 2023, 2028, and 2029.
The Indiana Pacers do have a history of multi-team trades with the Wizards and Lakers as they were involved in a five-team deal that sent Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles in 2021.
But the Pacers were not included in this Hachimura deal, even with reports suggesting that Indiana is in the market for a power forward.
Despite not being involved, according to NBA Insider Shams Charania, the Pacers were a finalist for Hachimura.
"The three finalists for Hachimura, I'm told, were the Lakers as well as the Pacers and Phoenix Suns," Charania said.
