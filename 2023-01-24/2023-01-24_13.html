     Classified documents discovered at Mike Pence’s home in Indiana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close aides to Mike Pence discovered about a dozen classified-marked documents stored in boxes at his home in Indiana last week and turned over the materials to the US justice department, according to a top adviser to the former vice-president.
“On Monday, 16 January, Vice-President Pence engaged outside counsel, with experience in handling classified documents, to review records stored in his personal home,” Jacob wrote.
The department has typically pursued cases of mishandled classified documents criminally when they involve aggravating factors: wilful mishandling of classified information, vast quantities of materials to suggest misconduct, disloyalty to the United States and obstruction.
The obstruction applies particularly to Trump because of his repeated refusal to fully surrender classified documents, including when he only partially complied with a grand jury subpoena issued in May demanding any classified materials.
For months, Trump also resisted conducting a search for any classified documents that the justice department suspected were still in his possession even after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, only for an eventual search in December to turn up two additional documents.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Mike Pence is the latest top public official to have been discovered possessing classified material in his personal home, according to a letter his lawyer sent to the National Archives.
A dozen documents with classified markings were discovered in Pence’s residence in Carmel, Indiana, in mid-January.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jacob indicated Pence was unaware of the existence of the documents and had enlisted an outside counsel after press reports of the discovery of documents at President Joe Biden’s own personal residence.
The Biden White House has similarly turned over classified documents to the National Archives that were found in the president’s personal home and an office he used following his stint as vice president.
“Former Vice President Mike Pence reached out today about classified documents found at his home in Indiana,” Comer said.
Pence had previously said that he had not brought classified documents home with him after leaving the vice presidency.
The Vice President is not waiving any privileges pertaining to the clearly labeled materials.”Jordain Carney and Burgess Everett contributed reporting.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:Today we learned that yet more classified documents slipped out of the White House and into the private home of a top official.
KELLY: So another day, another tranche of classified documents turning up somewhere they should not have been.
Now, Pence's aide said these documents were inadvertently boxed and transported when Pence left the White House two years ago.
Will this set off the same kind of investigation we are seeing with documents linked to President Biden and former President Trump?
Well, and I have to note, both Democrats and Republicans seem extremely concerned when someone from the other party is found with classified documents.
