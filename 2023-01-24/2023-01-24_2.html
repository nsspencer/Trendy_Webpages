    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In these stories, those who’ve exploited other people or cut corners to achieve their wealth actually get what they deserve.
In Triangle of Sadness, Swedish filmmaker Ruben Östlund takes that to an extreme degree.
(If you have a weak gag reflex, maybe don’t watch this one after a full meal.)
The outrageous dramedy is up for multiple Oscars this year, including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Östlund.
Triangle of Sadness isn’t streaming just yet, but it is available to rent and buy on platforms like Prime Video and Apple TV+.
