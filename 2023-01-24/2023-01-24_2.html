     Body Cam Video: Attorney Says Tyre Nichols was a “Piñata” for the Ex-Memphis Officers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a press conference Monday, the family of Tyre Nichols shared their reactions to the body camera footage of the traffic stop that left him with life-threatening injuries.
After two weeks of being left in the dark, Nichols’ family was finally able to see what led their loved one to fight for his life in the hospital.
Crump said Nichols was tased and pepper-sprayed in addition to the beating and being restrained, per the video.
