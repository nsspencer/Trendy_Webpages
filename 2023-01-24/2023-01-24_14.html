     Summary: "Everything Everywhere All at Once" stars Michelle Yeoh (left) and Stephanie Hsu.
Photos: Amy Sussman/Getty Images (left), Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesFour actors of Asian descent — Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan and Hong Chau — received Oscar nominations Tuesday morning.
Why it matters: It's the largest group of performers of Asian descent to be recognized in primary acting categories in a single year, Variety notes.
Yeoh, Hsu and Quan are nominated for their performances in "Everything Everywhere All at Once," and Chau for her performance in "The Whale."
Yeoh is also making history as the first, self-identified actress of Asian descent nominated for the lead actress award in the Oscars' nearly 100-year history.

     Hollywood Reporter celebrates Oscar nominee Michelle Yeoh as first person in category to 'identify as Asian'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Hollywood Reporter turned heads on social media Tuesday with their tweet celebrating Michelle Yeoh for being the first person who "identifies as Asian" to be nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards.
"Michelle Yeoh has made history as the first person who identifies as Asian to ever be nominated for best actress at the #Oscars," the tweet read.
Actor Dawn Bennett wrote, "'Identifies as Asian' She’s… Asian.
Freelance journalist Lindsey Wasson tweeted, "Saw ‘identifies as Asian’ trending and thought Gwen Stefani gave another interview or something.
Sun wrote that while Oberon is the first Asian nominee for her category at the Academy Awards, she hid her ancestry and "passed for white."

     Meet the Asian woman nominated before Michelle Yeoh for best actress Oscar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareThe tweet was, however, more accurate than saying Yeoh was the first — because before Yeoh, there was Merle Oberon: a biracial actress who was nominated for best actress in 1936 for her role in “The Dark Angel” (1935).
Born in what is now Mumbai in 1911, Oberon was the daughter of a mother of mixed South Asian origin and a White British father.
But she was perhaps best known for her starring role as Cathy in the 1939 film “Wuthering Heights,” produced by Samuel Goldwyn.
Oberon’s facade lasted after her death, in 1979, until a 1983 biography, “Princess Merle: The Romantic Life of Merle Oberon,” revealed her origins.
And so, with only her family and close confidants aware of her true identity in 1936, it was probable that she was nominated for best actress in 1936 as a White woman.

     Michelle Yeoh Is Quietly Out-Dressing Everyone This Awards Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michelle Yeoh’s answer to the sheer, metallic, and impossibly slinky dresses delighting paps on red carpets so far?
In lieu of hopping on the trend bus, the Everything Everywhere All at Once actor has been pedaling her own cycle of original outfits, which have looked nothing less than refreshing as the awards season juggernaut gathers pace.
With the Academy Awards just around the corner and Yeoh an insider’s favorite to take home the top prize, we’d like to see added drama.
Jordan Johnson Chung, who also dresses Sandra Oh, is behind Yeoh’s experimental-chic awards season turns, but you won’t catch the creative waxing lyrical about the looks via Instagram.
And that’s serious.” We’re seriously Team Yeoh this season.
