     The Banshees of Inisherin Defies Hollywood’s Fairytale Ireland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Banshees of Inisherin does not forget that context.
On Inisherin, we once again have a film set within a picturesque community of thatched roofs and horse drawn carriages.
And by setting The Banshees of Inisherin in roughly the same era as The Quiet Man, McDonagh is offering an authentic counterpoint to wistful American fairy tales.
Banshees’ Pádraic was born and raised all his life on Inisherin, and is so isolated on the island that even the Civil War occurring on the mainland almost seems like an abstraction.
The Banshees of Inisherin is a fable with a lot on its mind, including a contemplation of the futility of existence.

     Luck of the Irish: ‘Banshees of Inisherin,’ Paul Mescal and ‘Quiet Girl’ Push Ireland to Record Oscar Nom Haul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ireland is celebrating a record haul for the country at the 2023 Oscar nominations, which totals 14 nods across various categories.
“The Quiet Girl,” Colm Bairéad’s coming-of-age tale which began its awards haul at the 2022 Berlinale, made history by becoming the first Irish film to be nominated in the international feature category.
Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin,” co-produced by Ireland’s Metropolitan Films International, scored nine nominations, including four for actors Colin Farrell, Kerry Condon, Barry Keoghan and Brendan Gleeson.
“Banshees” beats the Irish record for most nominations, previously jointly held by “Belfast” and “In the Name of the Father,” which had seven each.
I want to dedicate this nomination to my two friends Charlotte [Wells] and Frankie [Corio] who I love dearly!

     After Oscar noms, searches soar for ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ - WEIS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Searchlight Pictures/20th Century StudiosThe film was already on the awards track before its three Golden Globe wins, but The Banshees of Inisherin‘s nine Oscar nominations apparently finally got the internet’s curiosity.
According to Google data compiled by the online gambling site Slotbox, searches for the Martin McDonagh-directed film jumped 1,150% following Tuesday’s Oscar nominations announcement.
On January 11, after the movie took home three Golden Globes — a Best Actor nod for Colin Farrell, one for Best Film in the Musical or Comedy category and one for Best Screenplay — searches had jumped 150%.
In fact, Google’s search automatically loads the common question “Is Inisherin a real place?” Alas, the picturesque Irish island town of the title doesn’t actually exist.
The Banshees of Inisherin received Oscar nominations for Best Actor for Farrell, Best Supporting Actor for Barry Keoghan and Best Supporting Actress for Kerry Condon, as well as Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Director for McDonagh.

     Summary: The island town of Inisherin may be fictional, but the locations around Ireland where The Banshees of Inisherin was filmed are beautifully real — and very visitable.
Inis Mór, Aran Islands, IrelandEither a 40- or 90-minute ferry ride from the Irish mainland is Inis Mór, the biggest of the Aran Islands.

The Banshees of Inisherin Credit: Searchlight PicturesAlso near Keem Beach, the quaint J.J. Devine's Pub — overlooking a huge bluff of the Cloughmore coast with the Irish mainland in the distance — was actually built specifically for Banshees because of the view.
Of the decision to use two disparate locations in creating Inisherin, McDonagh said in the film's production notes accessed by Town and Country, "Inisherin is a fictional island, so I didn't want it to be specifically one place.

     Summary: Ireland made history on Tuesday by landing its first Oscar nomination in the international film category.
As expected, Martin McDonagh’s Irish period tragicomedy The Banshees of Inisherin led the charge.
Many awards watchers had also suggested he was going up against none other than Tom Cruise and Top Gun: Maverick for the fifth best actor slot.
But there’s another Irish name likely to be on the lips of a number of the nominees come Oscars night.
In fact, she’s already been given a shout-out in Farrell’s Golden Globes acceptance speech: his four-legged co-star Jenny the donkey.

     Summary: The Best Supporting Actor Oscar category is seeing double yet again.
Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan received nominations as expected for their turns in Martin McDonagh‘s “The Banshees of Inisherin” on Tuesday, marking the fourth consecutive year a film has received double bids in the category.
After none the following year, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci garnered comeback noms for “The Irishman” (2019).
At a certain point, it seemed like both films could nab double noms, a la “Come to the Stable” and “Pinky.” In the end only Hirsch made it.
Chances are we won’t see an eighth this year as Quan has been steamrolling in supporting actor.
