     Groin injury, turnovers haunt Cavs' Mitchell in loss to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell was unsure about his status moving forward after his groin tightened up on the final play of Cleveland's 105-103 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.
"It felt the same as before," said Mitchell, who had missed the prior three games with groin tightness.
He later said he not only was dealing with groin tightness, but also cramping in both legs, all of which happened on that final drive.
"It's definitely both [frustration about the injury and his play], but more so [the injury].
But, from his vantage point, Mitchell said the loss was solely on his shoulders.
