     Summary: This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.
Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month.
A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return.
