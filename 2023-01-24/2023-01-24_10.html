     Groin injury, turnovers haunt Cavs' Mitchell in loss to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell was unsure about his status moving forward after his groin tightened up on the final play of Cleveland's 105-103 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.
"It felt the same as before," said Mitchell, who had missed the prior three games with groin tightness.
He later said he not only was dealing with groin tightness, but also cramping in both legs, all of which happened on that final drive.
"It's definitely both [frustration about the injury and his play], but more so [the injury].
But, from his vantage point, Mitchell said the loss was solely on his shoulders.

     Cavs’ Donovan Mitchell shoulders responsibility for late-game loss to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mitchell attempted a dunk, but Isaiah Hartenstein blocked the shot and Mitchell fell to the ground.
After the 105-103 loss to the Knicks, Mitchell was unsure about what comes next.
Mitchell didn’t even see his mother, Nicole, until the game.
Aside from the concern of Mitchell reaggravating his groin injury, the Cavs have continued to struggle with late-game execution.
“It’s the discipline point of it and just being OK with making the simple play that’s in front of you on both ends of the floor,” Bickerstaff said.

     The key for Knicks to survive brutal stretch may just be teamwork
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While it’s prudent to not overreact to one game, the win could help identify the blueprint for how the Knicks can survive a brutal stretch of schedule without their defensive anchor.
Heading into Tuesday night’s game, the Knicks had the toughest remaining strength of schedule of any team in the NBA.
However, New York’s final run showcased an offensive identity that can help get them to survive this tough stretch of schedule.
In the eight games prior to this stretch, the Knicks had averaged under 17 assists and topped 20 assists just once.
(via @KnicksMSGN)pic.twitter.com/I4Gqx1rfY3 — Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 25, 2023With the win, the Knicks are now one game behind the Heat for 6th place in the Eastern Conference.
