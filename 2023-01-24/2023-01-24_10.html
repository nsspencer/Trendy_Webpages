     Gulf Coast faces more tornado threats from storm system that hit Houston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A "multi-hazard storm system" that triggered multiple reports of damage from tornadoes and flooding in and near Houston on Tuesday is threatening to unleash further damage across the Gulf Coast.
Tornado damage was reported in Pasadena, where power lines were knocked out and radar indicated debris from one twister near the city reached about 8,000 feet in the air.
The Storm Prediction Center placed these areas in an "Enhanced Risk" zone, which is a level 3 out of 5 on its severe storm risk scale.
Louisiana's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness said the state faced "another severe weather threat this week" and residents should remain alert.
The hard-hit areas included many of the region's petrochemical plants, some of which had to be quickly shut down due to the severe weather.
