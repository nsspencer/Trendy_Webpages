     Miami Heat troll Boston Celtics and Dallas Cowboys with a single tweet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bam Adebayo throws down huge dunk to the delight of the Miami crowd (0:22)Bam Adebayo throws down huge dunk to the delight of the Miami crowd (0:22)The Miami Heat managed to get in a good social media dig at the Boston Celtics -- and, incredibly, the Dallas Cowboys.
On Tuesday night, the Heat beat the Celtics 98-95, evening their season series against Boston 2-2.
Celtics gave away the ball 17 times in the narrow loss to the HEAT, in a matchup the Celtics had a chance to win if they didn't again generate self-inflicted wounds.
pic.twitter.com/ySg1DVRsko — Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) January 25, 2023Kind of an odd way of phrasing things, right?
That's because it's a direct reference to a tweet the Dallas Cowboys sent out after their loss to the San Francisco 49ers -- a tweet that was, unusually, directed at Dak Prescott.

     Summary: Bidders line up for Miami Heat arena naming rightsWritten by Miami Today on January 24, 2023AdvertisementBankrupt FTX will pay more for basketball arena naming rights even as the county works to remove the crypto firm’s name, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told commissioners last week, and a new naming rights deal with someone else is on the way.
“There are companies coming forward speaking to our staff, to the Heat” about naming rights, the mayor said as commissioners pressed her for details.
This month the arena has had three names, now Miami-Dade Arena, as the county seeks a deal.
What are they doing?”The mayor said the program continues using the funds already received and the county expects an FTX payment this month.
“Any subsequent deal will carry all of the same terms and conditions related to that program,” she said.

     Summary: For anyone who thinks a basketball pick-and-roll is a work of art, the Miami Heat have taken it literally.
The Heat installed three Connected Canvas boards there, roughly 4-by-9 feet each, giving curious fans four digital art options.
In other words, the data view is a high-tech shot chart, while the art view is the AI rendering of the HEAT map.
2 is the Game Flow view, which encapsulates the Miami Heat up-tempo offense and their rapid ball movement or pick-and-roll plays.
Using the work of local photographers, the AI turns it into shifting pieces of artwork to celebrate Miami’s disparate communities.
