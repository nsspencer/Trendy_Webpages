     Summary: "There are people saying this is such a beautiful, organic movement, and I've got to tell you, this is not organic," said Vanity Fair's Rebecca Ford.
"[Riseborough] has a very well-connected manager, she is well-respected by actors, and they just took this moment to launch this campaign, and it is a campaign."

     How Andrea Riseborough Got That Surprise Oscar Nomination for ‘To Leslie’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, the film’s star Andrea Riseborough is nominated for the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role.
Awards pundits wrongly assumed that the celeb-backed campaign, while noteworthy, was a little too late to make a nomination happen.
It came down to support from the film community, Riseborough said Tuesday.
“The idea that you need endless resources, I don’t think that’s necessarily true,” Riseborough told Variety shortly after the Oscar noms were announced Tuesday morning.
After Riseborough nabbed a Spirit Award nomination, McCormack got to work with help from publicity powerhouses Shelter PR and Narrative PR.

     How Andrea Riseborough pulled off that shocking Oscar nomination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the credits rolled, Riseborough, Morris and actors Allison Janney, Maron and Andre Royo took the stage to talk with Demi Moore.
The campaign went virtual the next day with Kate Winslet, who worked with Riseborough on the upcoming drama “Lee,” leading a Q&amp;A.
The academy’s actors branch has 1,336 members, meaning that if every one of them voted, Riseborough would require around 200 or so mentions.
I’m no expert in math, but, given the low visibility of “To Leslie,” Riseborough must have sat atop a great many ballots.
But they’ve already moved on to the next chapter: Getting Riseborough that lead actress Oscar.
