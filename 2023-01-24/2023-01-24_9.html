     Lakers Rumors: LA Expects Rui Hachimura to Sign New Contract in Offseason After Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott Taetsch/Getty ImagesThe Los Angeles Lakers are penciling Rui Hachimura into their plans for the 2023-24 NBA season and beyond, according to The Athletic's Jovan Buha.
The Lakers acquired Hachimura from the Washington Wizards on Monday, sending Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks out as part of the deal.
Buha added L.A. is expected to extend the 24-year-old's stay this summer, when he's eligible to hit restricted free agency.
Hachimura didn't hit the heights the Wizards were expecting after they selected him ninth overall in the 2019 NBA draft.
Per NBA.com, he's shooting 42.0 percent on wide open three-pointers and 45.5 percent from the left corner.

     Summary: The Rui Hachimura trade gets the thumbs up from Lakers legend Magic Johnson.
Los Angeles got trade season started on Monday by acquiring Hachimura from Washington.
Johnson said that Hachimura is going to "really help the Lakers on both ends of the court," adding that his length and size will make a difference defensively.
Laker Nation, Rui Hachimura is going to really help the Lakers on both ends of the court.
Hachimura won't play against the Clippers on Tuesday, but he could make his Lakers debut on Wednesday.

     Lakers refuse to trade unprotected first-round pick for Bojan Bogdanovic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even after the Los Angeles Lakers traded for forward Rui Hachimura on Monday, the speculation they will pull off another trade before the Feb. 9 trade deadline has increased.
Could that next trade be for Detroit Pistons sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanovic?
Although Hachimura should help L.A. in multiple ways, he will not be enough to turn it into a championship contender.
The Pistons want an unprotected first-round pick, while the Lakers only want to give up one with some sort of lottery protection.
Via The Athletic (h/t Lakers Daily):“Detroit’s Bojan Bogdanović continues to be the name most often tied to the Lakers in league circles, but the Pistons are looking for an unprotected first-round pick, at a minimum, in a potential trade, according to league sources,” The Athletic’s Jovan Buha wrote.

     Lakers trade: How Rui Hachimura can get the most out of his game alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former will help the Lakers as it would help anyone, specifically as it will take some of that defensive burden off LeBron James to cover for what is an incredibly small team.
Hachimura made 44 percent of his 3s last season, but he's down to 33 percent this season on pretty low volume.
To me, Hachimura could legitimately double his volume from three 3-pointers per game to something closer to six.
In the play below, swap out Delon Wright for LeBron James sucking the defense into the paint and imagine how many of these 3-point looks Hachimura could get with the Lakers.
If he does, and especially if it comes at a higher volume, the Lakers just picked up a real two-way contributor on the cheap.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers have been teetering on life support throughout the first half of the NBA gauntlet.
However, the Lakers are three games under .500 nearly 50 games into their season.
Either way, the Lakers could have Hachimura under team control for another season after this one if they choose to retain him.
Ultimately, the Hachimura move should be just the start for a Lakers squad that’s been poorly constructed around James and Davis.
Hachimura won’t be enough to satisfy Shannon Sharpe and the legion of championship-or-bust Lakers fans.
