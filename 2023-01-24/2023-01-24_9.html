     Tyre Nichols suffered from 'extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating': Independent autopsy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Tyre Nichols, the Black man whose death this month at the hands of five Memphis, Tennessee, police officers has triggered national outrage, suffered from "extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating," according to a preliminary independent autopsy commissioned by the family.
"Whatever it takes to clear my son's name and to get justice for my son," Rodney Wells told ABC News.
Nichols' family said he was kicked, pepper-sprayed and shocked with a stun gun, all while Nichols repeatedly asked, "What did I do?"
And once I heard that, I lost it," Rowvaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told ABC News on Monday.
And as he fell over they'd tell him 'sit back up,'" Rodney told ABC News.
