     Groin injury, turnovers haunt Cavs' Mitchell in loss to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell was unsure about his status moving forward after his groin tightened up on the final play of Cleveland's 105-103 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.
"It felt the same as before," said Mitchell, who had missed the prior three games with groin tightness.
He later said he not only was dealing with groin tightness, but also cramping in both legs, all of which happened on that final drive.
"It's definitely both [frustration about the injury and his play], but more so [the injury].
But, from his vantage point, Mitchell said the loss was solely on his shoulders.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Knicks needing a stop to preserve a two-point lead and snap a four-game losing streak.
Amid what has been a rocky start to plugging Robinson’s role, Hartenstein gave the Knicks’ quest its most significant boost yet.
The Knicks’ defense still allowed Cavaliers’ center Jarrett Allen to score 24 points, repeatedly piercing the heart of the defense, but Hartenstein said he felt the team defense was better.
When Mitchell drove toward Hartenstein, the center thought of Tom Thibodeau.
RJ Barrett repeated it after the game, too, so Hartenstein thought of Thibodeau’s voice: “Just being vertical, no matter what he does,” Hartenstein said.

     RUMOR: Clippers interested in Isaiah Hartenstein reunion after Knicks signing turns disastrous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the reasons for their overperformance was the breakout season of backup center Isaiah Hartenstein, showing off his ability to function as a playmaking hub on offense.
However, Hartenstein just has not been able to perform as well as he did with the Clippers in the Big Apple.
Thus, even with the injury to starting center Mitchell Robinson, Hartenstein could find himself available in a trade.
According to Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer, league executives have said that the Clippers are interested in a trade for Isaiah Hartenstein to fill their much-needed frontcourt void behind starting center Ivica Zubac.
But it’s difficult to envision a better fit than Isaiah Hartenstein, as he has proved that he could thrive in LA.
