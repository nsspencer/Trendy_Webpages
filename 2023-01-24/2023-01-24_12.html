     Mikaela Shiffrin breaks Lindsey Vonn’s World Cup win record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vermont-schooled Mikaela Shiffrin missed out on a medal Friday after winning gold Thursday (pictured here).
Shiffren entered this racing season eight victories short of the women’s alpine skiing record, held by Lindsey Vonn with 82 first-place finishes.
On Tuesday, Shiffrin set the women’s alpine record in a giant slalom in Kronplatz, Italy, as her combined time for two giant slalom runs put her just ahead of Swiss skier Lara Gut-Behrami.
In slalom and giant slalom categories, Shiffrin holds first place.
Her record-breaking World Cup season comes after a difficult 2022 Winter Olympic season, in which she did not secure any medals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: American skier Mikaela Shiffrin felt all that and more after winning a record 83rd World Cup race Tuesday.
Shiffrin posted the fastest first run and was therefore the last skier to race in the second run.
Vonn was 33 when she won her last World Cup event and Stenmark was 32.
She didn’t take long to rebound from her Beijing performance, claiming her fourth overall World Cup title at the end of last season.
That was where Shiffrin made her World Cup debut as a 15-year-old in March 2011.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. skier Mikaela Shiffrin now stands alone atop women's alpine skiing, after claiming World Cup win no.
She is the only skier in history to have won a race in all six World Cup disciplines: downhill, super-G, slalom, giant slalom, combined, and parallel.
In the 2018-19 World Cup season, she won 17 races — a mark no other male or female skier has ever equaled.

She's seen here at the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup event in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.

     Mikaela Shiffrin Breaks Lindsey Vonn’s Record To Become Winningest Woman Alpine Skier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winning her 83rd World Cup race Tuesday, Mikaela Shiffrin has entered rarefied air as the winningest woman alpine skier of all time, edging past her tie with Lindsey Vonn.
Shiffrin took the win in a giant slalom race in Italy’s Kronplatz, finishing just 0.45 seconds ahead of Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland.
She had tied Lindsey Vonn’s World Cup record of 82 on January 8 in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia.
“It might take me a little bit to figure out what to say,” Shiffrin said after her landmark achievement, per the Associated Press.
Still, with the women’s alpine all-time record, the watch now turns to the overall World Cup record of 86, held by Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark.

     Mikaela Shiffrin breaks women’s Alpine skiing World Cup wins record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Early Tuesday morning in the U.S., Shiffrin won her 83rd career World Cup ski race, a giant slalom in Italy, passing retired fellow U.S. racer Lindsey Vonn for the most career victories by a woman (or American of either gender).
Because the Alpine World Championships interrupt the World Cup schedule, Shiffrin can’t mathematically pass Stenmark until late February.
Alpine ski racing has a modest audience compared to the big U.S. professional sports, and Shiffrin’s record pursuit can potentially grow that audience, and Shiffrin’s brand.
Ski afficionados will explain that the months-long grind of the World Cup is the true test of greatness, and that would not be wrong.
(Also, Shiffrin won a combined three Olympic medals — two gold — at the 2014 and ’18 Games; the only American woman with more is Julia Mancuso, who won four).
