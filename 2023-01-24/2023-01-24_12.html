     Washington Wizards’ Kyle Kuzma Says Dallas Mavericks ‘Don’t Play Winning Basketball’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma (33) drives against Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic (77) ... [+] during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Dallas, Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023.
After the Dallas Mavericks fell to the Washington Wizards at home Tuesday night, 127-126, Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma took to Twitter to chastise the Mavericks.
“The funny thing is they don’t play winning basketball,” Kuzma wrote, followed by a string of emojis.
Kuzma was responding to a tweet from The Dallas Morning News beat writer Callie Caplan, who had quoted Mavericks guard Spencer Dinwiddie after the game.
Dallas dropped games to the Wizards, Los Angeles Clippers (twice), Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers (twice) and Oklahoma City Thunder.

MISSED ’EM BOTHPorzingis also missed the first meeting against his former team in Washington, won by the Wizards 113-105.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Dallas Mavericks’ most recent embarrassing loss against the Washington Wizards, the boys in blue and green found themselves down by four heading into the second quarter.
Instead, the Mavericks gave up a 8-1 run and lost the lead over the next two minutes of game action.
Surely you can make another run and establish the elusive 15-point lead that would go a long way towards securing a desperately needed win.
Instead, the Mavericks gave up a 12-1 run to end the half and trailed 65-60 entering the break.
We all remember that Bucks game; Dallas played really well and should have won it, but blew the game at the free throw line.
