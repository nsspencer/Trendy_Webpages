    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pass from Malik Monk reached Talen Horton-Tucker near the three-point line, the Lakers guard catching the ball as he eyed former Lakers teammate Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.
Horton-Tucker then encountered another former Lakers teammate, Kyle Kuzma, trying to prevent him from scoring.
It was one of the many Horton-Tucker highlights during the Lakers’ 122-109 win over the Wizards.

     Summary: In Los Angeles’ win against the Washington Wizards on Friday night, James exploded for 50 points in what was a dazzling performance of offensive brilliancy.
However, the more important thing is James and the Lakers got a much-needed win to keep them afloat in the playoff race.
When game day is here, I’m here five hours before the game prepping.
I’m prepping myself individually.
I’m prepping on what I need to do to help this team be victorious.

     Summary: Turns out, LeBron James is great, and when he’s at his best, he’ll lay waste to a nearly inert Washington Wizards defense.
He was 2-3 from three-point range, though he turned down at least three good looks at three-point shots.

     LeBron James' greatness continues to give the Lakers hope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 37-year-old’s performance was a master class in offensive efficiency: 18-of-25 shooting, 6-of-9 3-point shooting and 8-of-8 free-throw shooting.It was James’ 14th 50-point game of his career, tying Rick Barry for the sixth-most in NBA history.
James has won 12 consecutive games when scoring 50-plus points.
He’s the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus times multiple times after turning 35.“The thing that stands out to me is that the league has never seen a player at this stage of his career do what he’s doing,” Vogel said.
“I think that’s the biggest thing that needs to be recognized.
It’s just unbelievable, the level that he’s playing at.”The current iteration of the 29-37 Lakers can only go as far as James can take them, fair or not.
