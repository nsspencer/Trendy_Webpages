     Here's What Kyle Kuzma Tweeted After The Wizards Lost To The Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Wizards lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in California by a score of 122-109 on Friday evening in California.
After the game, Kyle Kuzma sent out two tweets, which can be seen embedded below.
The Wizards had also played the Clippers on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and lost by a score of 115-109.
Kuzma spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Lakers after being drafted in the first-round of the 2017 NBA Draft.
In 2020, he won an NBA Title with the franchise, but was traded this past summer in the blockbuster deal that sent Russell Westbrook from the Wizards to the Lakers.

     Lakers release loaded injury report for huge matchup vs. Suns in Phoenix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers will face a challenge on Sunday when they travel to Arizona to face the Phoenix Suns, who hold the NBA’s best record.
According to L.A.’s injury report, LeBron James is still questionable to play due to a left knee ailment.
The Suns are without their leader, Chris Paul, who will miss several weeks with a fractured thumb.
The Lakers and Suns matched up in the first round of last year’s playoffs.
But Anthony Davis injured his groin in Game 4, and from that point on the Suns dominated the Lakers, winning the series in six contests.

    </h2>

     Summary: The UCLA product put up another disappointing performance, scoring 5 points and shooting abysmally from the field.
But the good news is that Lakers fans did end up with a lot to cheer about.
James once again scored 50 points and carried the Lakers to a win.
He spoke after the game about his desire to give the fans something to cheer about, recognizing how tough this season has been.
“The Laker faithful knows when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.

     Summary: The team followed that up with a tribute for the two 2020 NBA Champions and thanked them for their time in Los Angeles.
They both hugged former teammate LeBron James, the only guy on the court that they had played with while in Los Angeles.
I established myself, and it's really, really cool.
There is no doubt that Kuzma's time in Los Angeles was marked by ups and downs.
But when LeBron came to Los Angeles, he saw his role shift drastically.

     Summary: "They will win a round in the playoffs," Smith concluded as that prediction got a rise out of host Ernie Johnson.
That timetable has Paul likely missing the remainder of the regular season as the Suns end their 82-game schedule April 10 against Sacramento.
"One thing scares me for my Phoenix Suns.
"Utah against Phoenix would be a hell of a series because Utah, they are so streaky when it comes to shooting," Barkley continued.
I like my Suns, but in the second round of the playoffs, Utah against Phoenix would be a hell of a series."

The win came six days after James scored 56 against the Golden State Warriors, which was also a victory for L.A.
Oldest players to win scoring title With Friday's 50-point effort, LeBron James took over the league lead in scoring at 29.7 points per game.
"It was just about having those guys in there to win," Vogel said of his closing lineup.

This has become an undeniable fact, especially considering how this team has looked since the All-Star break.
As it turns out, however, Lakers fans might not be getting their wish of AD returning in the immediate future.
“I think Anthony Davis, you know, he’ll make more progress this week, they hope,” Woj continued.
That is, that the Lakers will be able to maintain their position in the West, which as of right now, will put them in the play-in tournament.

I mean listen: The Laker faithful know when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.
They know when you’re playing bad basketball, and they know when you’re playing good basketball, and it’s our job to go out there and play inspired basketball and good basketball for these fans that have seen so many great games, so many great performances and and so many greats over the years.

Does the idea of having to win two single-elimination games just to get “rewarded” with a series against the Suns sound terrible?
Will Sunday’s matchup be a somewhat accurate representation of what one of those first round playoff games will look like?
That type of rotation decision isn’t going to be the one that catapults the Lakers up to the Suns’ level of talent.
The Lakers and Suns will tip-off at 6 p.m. PT, with the game nationally televised on ESPN, and locally broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet.

     Summary: LeBron James came out with a vintage performance on Friday night as he carried the Los Angeles Lakers to a much-needed win over the Washington Wizards.
… I think for him, he leads the league in scoring because he’s the smartest player to play in the NBA.
Frye was also quick to point out how LeBron now leads the NBA in scoring.
The fact that these two are the top frontrunners for this year’s MVP title speaks volumes of what LeBron James is doing right now.
