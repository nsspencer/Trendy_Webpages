     Here's What Kyle Kuzma Tweeted After The Wizards Lost To The Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Wizards lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in California by a score of 122-109 on Friday evening in California.
After the game, Kyle Kuzma sent out two tweets, which can be seen embedded below.
The Wizards had also played the Clippers on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and lost by a score of 115-109.
Kuzma spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Lakers after being drafted in the first-round of the 2017 NBA Draft.
In 2020, he won an NBA Title with the franchise, but was traded this past summer in the blockbuster deal that sent Russell Westbrook from the Wizards to the Lakers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UCLA product put up another disappointing performance, scoring 5 points and shooting abysmally from the field.
But the good news is that Lakers fans did end up with a lot to cheer about.
James once again scored 50 points and carried the Lakers to a win.
He spoke after the game about his desire to give the fans something to cheer about, recognizing how tough this season has been.
“The Laker faithful knows when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Give the ball to LeBron James, get out of the way, and let him score 50 points.
The Washed King scored 50 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-109 victory over the Washington Wizards.
At 37, he now is the oldest player in NBA history to have multiple 50 point games in a season, passing Bernard King.
LeBron James-led teams have won for the 12th straight time when James has scored 50+ in a night.
“He’s really good at basketball, that LeBron James,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.

     Summary: The team followed that up with a tribute for the two 2020 NBA Champions and thanked them for their time in Los Angeles.
They both hugged former teammate LeBron James, the only guy on the court that they had played with while in Los Angeles.
I established myself, and it's really, really cool.
There is no doubt that Kuzma's time in Los Angeles was marked by ups and downs.
But when LeBron came to Los Angeles, he saw his role shift drastically.

"Utah against Phoenix would be a hell of a series because Utah, they are so streaky when it comes to shooting," Barkley continued.

I mean listen: The Laker faithful know when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.
They know when you’re playing bad basketball, and they know when you’re playing good basketball, and it’s our job to go out there and play inspired basketball and good basketball for these fans that have seen so many great games, so many great performances and and so many greats over the years.
If you want to read deeper and see them as a shot at Westbrook or a message of support for Lakers fans — or both — you’d also be within your rights to do so.

     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James is on an incredible scoring spree.
In fact it’s so historic that he was able to achieve an NBA record only done by Wilt Chamberlain before.
James dropped 50 points on Friday to lead the Lakers to a 122-109 win over the Washington Wizards.
LeBron James' last three games: ✅ 56 PTS✅ 23 PTS, 14 REB, 12 AST✅ 50 PTS The only other player in NBA history to record two 50-point games and a triple-double in a three-game span is Wilt Chamberlain (March 5-8, 1963).
The Lakers leader admitted he’s pissed that he’s not getting the respect he deserves when it comes to scoring despite being among the Top 3 leaders in points in NBA history.

This summer was no different, when he was met with the high expectations Lakers fans always put on their players.
— Nina Westbrook (@ninawestbrook) March 7, 2022Nina went as far as calling out media personality Skip Bayless by name, saying that he should apologize to Westbrook.
She said Bayless is responsible for coining the term, “Westbrick,” which frustrated fans have started using to criticize the point guard.
