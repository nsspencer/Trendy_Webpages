     Here's What Kyle Kuzma Tweeted After The Wizards Lost To The Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Wizards lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in California by a score of 122-109 on Friday evening in California.
After the game, Kyle Kuzma sent out two tweets, which can be seen embedded below.
The Wizards had also played the Clippers on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and lost by a score of 115-109.
Kuzma spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Lakers after being drafted in the first-round of the 2017 NBA Draft.
In 2020, he won an NBA Title with the franchise, but was traded this past summer in the blockbuster deal that sent Russell Westbrook from the Wizards to the Lakers.

    </h2>

     Summary: The team followed that up with a tribute for the two 2020 NBA Champions and thanked them for their time in Los Angeles.
They both hugged former teammate LeBron James, the only guy on the court that they had played with while in Los Angeles.
I established myself, and it's really, really cool.
There is no doubt that Kuzma's time in Los Angeles was marked by ups and downs.
But when LeBron came to Los Angeles, he saw his role shift drastically.

     Lakers: Analyst Blames 2 Losses on LeBron James' 56 Point Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Starting with Saturday, they took down the Golden State Warriors behind LeBron James' 56 point performance.
They followed that up with two losses in Texas, one of which was missed by LeBron resting his knee.
But at least one NBA analyst is finding a way to blame LBJ for those losses against the Rockets and Spurs.
"LeBron James went all out this past weekend not realizing you got two games that are more important than the game you just dropped 56 points in.
But if you’re LeBron James, you got to be calculated.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LeBron James came out with a vintage performance on Friday night as he carried the Los Angeles Lakers to a much-needed win over the Washington Wizards.
… I think for him, he leads the league in scoring because he’s the smartest player to play in the NBA.
Frye was also quick to point out how LeBron now leads the NBA in scoring.
The fact that these two are the top frontrunners for this year’s MVP title speaks volumes of what LeBron James is doing right now.

That timetable has Paul likely missing the remainder of the regular season as the Suns end their 82-game schedule April 10 against Sacramento.
"One thing scares me for my Phoenix Suns.
"Utah against Phoenix would be a hell of a series because Utah, they are so streaky when it comes to shooting," Barkley continued.
I like my Suns, but in the second round of the playoffs, Utah against Phoenix would be a hell of a series."

     Lakers hope youth movement gives them juice down stretch of regular season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even as he scored 50 points on Friday evening, he was hardly alone as the Lakers pulled away in the fourth-quarter stretch.
The Lakers young players were out in such force, that Russell Westbrook was benched for nearly the last nine minutes of the 122-109 win over Washington.
The Lakers went with a starting lineup of James, Westbrook, Reaves, Monk and Stanley Johnson for the fourth time this season (no Lakers lineup has started more than five times so far).
One is Westbrook, whose hit-or-miss performances keep building the Lakers’ hope that he might turn it on at the right time as he did in Washington last season.
As the Lakers play the young lineup more minutes, more might depend on how much those players can take on.

     Summary: Yes, despite reports that some in the organization have given up on the season, Wojnarowski says that Davis and the team are very much intent on him making a return for the playoffs.
He will also likely miss at least the team’s next three contests before his reevaluation, if that indeed takes place on Thursday.
If Davis is immediately cleared, that would leave him with 13 games left to ramp up, and any delay beyond Thursday will obviously cost him more.
Davis and the team are obviously hoping that continues this week.

Does the idea of having to win two single-elimination games just to get “rewarded” with a series against the Suns sound terrible?
Will Sunday’s matchup be a somewhat accurate representation of what one of those first round playoff games will look like?
That type of rotation decision isn’t going to be the one that catapults the Lakers up to the Suns’ level of talent.
The Lakers and Suns will tip-off at 6 p.m. PT, with the game nationally televised on ESPN, and locally broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet.

This has become an undeniable fact, especially considering how this team has looked since the All-Star break.
As it turns out, however, Lakers fans might not be getting their wish of AD returning in the immediate future.
“I think Anthony Davis, you know, he’ll make more progress this week, they hope,” Woj continued.
That is, that the Lakers will be able to maintain their position in the West, which as of right now, will put them in the play-in tournament.
