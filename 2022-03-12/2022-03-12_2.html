Popovich turned his big win into an NFT collection for charity, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Those are just two things no one ever saw mixing together in any way, really.

“All of us share in this record,” Popovich said Friday night after getting his record-breaking 1,336th victory when the San Antonio Spurs rallied to beat the Utah Jazz 104-102.
The Spurs have fully embraced a rebuild expedited by Kawhi Leonard’s forced departure from San Antonio along with the retirement of the Big Three.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So for 11 whole seconds, the winningest coach in the history of the NBA allowed his players to forget everything he’d ever taught them.
Then, once he had indulged this sideline celebration 11 seconds longer than he’d planned, Popovich spread his arms.
With his power restored, he ordered his jubilant Spurs to give him room, and they complied.
“I’m going to bring ‘em all in and have ‘em run suicides before the game (Saturday).”He hadn’t wanted any of this.
“Tonight he had to enjoy it,” said Murray, who in the locker room presented Popovich with a game ball before the coach was doused with water.
