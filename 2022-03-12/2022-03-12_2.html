     Here's What Kyle Kuzma Tweeted After The Wizards Lost To The Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Wizards lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in California by a score of 122-109 on Friday evening in California.
After the game, Kyle Kuzma sent out two tweets, which can be seen embedded below.
The Wizards had also played the Clippers on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and lost by a score of 115-109.
Kuzma spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Lakers after being drafted in the first-round of the 2017 NBA Draft.
In 2020, he won an NBA Title with the franchise, but was traded this past summer in the blockbuster deal that sent Russell Westbrook from the Wizards to the Lakers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Give the ball to LeBron James, get out of the way, and let him score 50 points.
The Washed King scored 50 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-109 victory over the Washington Wizards.
At 37, he now is the oldest player in NBA history to have multiple 50 point games in a season, passing Bernard King.
LeBron James-led teams have won for the 12th straight time when James has scored 50+ in a night.
“He’s really good at basketball, that LeBron James,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.

     Summary: The team followed that up with a tribute for the two 2020 NBA Champions and thanked them for their time in Los Angeles.
They both hugged former teammate LeBron James, the only guy on the court that they had played with while in Los Angeles.
I established myself, and it's really, really cool.
There is no doubt that Kuzma's time in Los Angeles was marked by ups and downs.
But when LeBron came to Los Angeles, he saw his role shift drastically.

But the good news is that Lakers fans did end up with a lot to cheer about.
James once again scored 50 points and carried the Lakers to a win.
He spoke after the game about his desire to give the fans something to cheer about, recognizing how tough this season has been.
“The Laker faithful knows when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.

… I think for him, he leads the league in scoring because he’s the smartest player to play in the NBA.
Frye was also quick to point out how LeBron now leads the NBA in scoring.
The fact that these two are the top frontrunners for this year’s MVP title speaks volumes of what LeBron James is doing right now.

I mean listen: The Laker faithful know when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.
They know when you’re playing bad basketball, and they know when you’re playing good basketball, and it’s our job to go out there and play inspired basketball and good basketball for these fans that have seen so many great games, so many great performances and and so many greats over the years.

I’m just trying to play through it until the end of the season because we’ve got to get some wins,” Horton-Tucker said.
I’m trying to play through it, (even if) it still hurts.”The good news is that it’s been playable for THT.
Talen Horton-Tucker has had a relatively underwhelming season thus far for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Seen as a rising star not too long ago, perhaps the lingering ankle injury has been a huge anchor in what the Laker faithful were hoping to be a breakout season from Talen Horton-Tucker.

I’m just trying to play through it until the end of the season because we’ve got to get some wins,” Horton-Tucker said.
Now, maybe Horton-Tucker is just too young and naive to feel hopeless about a season this lost.
