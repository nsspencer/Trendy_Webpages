But the good news is that Lakers fans did end up with a lot to cheer about.
James once again scored 50 points and carried the Lakers to a win.
He spoke after the game about his desire to give the fans something to cheer about, recognizing how tough this season has been.
“The Laker faithful knows when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.

     Summary: Give the ball to LeBron James, get out of the way, and let him score 50 points.
The Washed King scored 50 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-109 victory over the Washington Wizards.
At 37, he now is the oldest player in NBA history to have multiple 50 point games in a season, passing Bernard King.
LeBron James-led teams have won for the 12th straight time when James has scored 50+ in a night.
“He’s really good at basketball, that LeBron James,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.

     Lakers News: Warriors’ Stephen Curry Supports Russell Westbrook After Receiving Harassment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A few things that are unavoidable in 2022: pandemic discourse, Zendaya/Tom Holland PDA and Los Angeles Lakers star Russell Westbrook slander.
This summer was no different, when he was met with the high expectations Lakers fans always put on their players.
— Nina Westbrook (@ninawestbrook) March 7, 2022Nina went as far as calling out media personality Skip Bayless by name, saying that he should apologize to Westbrook.
She said Bayless is responsible for coining the term, “Westbrick,” which frustrated fans have started using to criticize the point guard.

     Summary: James regularly weighs in on whatever the NBA topic du jour is on his massive Instagram or Twitter accounts, or, failing that, in postgame interviews.
I mean listen: The Laker faithful know when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.
They know when you’re playing bad basketball, and they know when you’re playing good basketball, and it’s our job to go out there and play inspired basketball and good basketball for these fans that have seen so many great games, so many great performances and and so many greats over the years.
If you want to read deeper and see them as a shot at Westbrook or a message of support for Lakers fans — or both — you’d also be within your rights to do so.

     Summary: Talen Horton-Tucker started getting listed on the Lakers injury report with a “left ankle sprain” 10 days ago, and has only played in three of the team’s five games since then.
“My ankle, I had a Grade 2 sprain, so I’m still dealing with it.
I’m just trying to play through it until the end of the season because we’ve got to get some wins,” Horton-Tucker said.
Now, maybe Horton-Tucker is just too young and naive to feel hopeless about a season this lost.

     Summary: That opponent is a very familiar one in the Phoenix Suns, who the Lakers will travel to play on Sunday night.
Does the idea of having to win two single-elimination games just to get “rewarded” with a series against the Suns sound terrible?
Will Sunday’s matchup be a somewhat accurate representation of what one of those first round playoff games will look like?
That type of rotation decision isn’t going to be the one that catapults the Lakers up to the Suns’ level of talent.
The Lakers and Suns will tip-off at 6 p.m. PT, with the game nationally televised on ESPN, and locally broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet.
