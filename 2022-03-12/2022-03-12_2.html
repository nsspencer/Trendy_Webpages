     Tracking Weather Conditions In Downtown Pittsburgh Ahead Of St. Patrick’s Day Parade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By: KDKA-TV’s Falicia WoodyPITTSBURGH (KDKA) — We are less than three hours away from the start of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.
More than a quarter of a million spectators and over 200 marching bands and floats are expected to fill the snow-covered streets.
Safety is the top priority for the city, and you have to be careful as you are coming out here because if you are setting up early to watch the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, it is slick on the sidewalks.
You’ll still want to dress warm for today, and the wind gusts are making it feel even colder.
They will be strictly enforcing open container laws, watching out for underage drinking, any kind of public intoxication and any drinking under the influence.
