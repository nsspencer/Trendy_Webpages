     Here's What Kyle Kuzma Tweeted After The Wizards Lost To The Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Wizards lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in California by a score of 122-109 on Friday evening in California.
After the game, Kyle Kuzma sent out two tweets, which can be seen embedded below.
The Wizards had also played the Clippers on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and lost by a score of 115-109.
Kuzma spent the first four seasons of his NBA career with the Lakers after being drafted in the first-round of the 2017 NBA Draft.
In 2020, he won an NBA Title with the franchise, but was traded this past summer in the blockbuster deal that sent Russell Westbrook from the Wizards to the Lakers.

     LeBron James Leads Lakers Comeback With 50 Point Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Give the ball to LeBron James, get out of the way, and let him score 50 points.
The Washed King scored 50 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-109 victory over the Washington Wizards.
At 37, he now is the oldest player in NBA history to have multiple 50 point games in a season, passing Bernard King.
LeBron James-led teams have won for the 12th straight time when James has scored 50+ in a night.
“He’s really good at basketball, that LeBron James,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.

     LeBron James says Lakers fans ‘know when bad basketball is being played’ and ‘have the right to have any response they want’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James regularly weighs in on whatever the NBA topic du jour is on his massive Instagram or Twitter accounts, or, failing that, in postgame interviews.
I mean listen: The Laker faithful know when bad basketball is being played, and they know when good basketball is being played.
They know when you’re playing bad basketball, and they know when you’re playing good basketball, and it’s our job to go out there and play inspired basketball and good basketball for these fans that have seen so many great games, so many great performances and and so many greats over the years.
If you want to read deeper and see them as a shot at Westbrook or a message of support for Lakers fans — or both — you’d also be within your rights to do so.

     Summary: Turns out, LeBron James is great, and when he’s at his best, he’ll lay waste to a nearly inert Washington Wizards defense.
