    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo gallery: St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns to Salt Lake City After two-year hiatus, event brings Irish charm to Gateway(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Cici the basset hound walks in the Saint Patrick's Parade at the Gateway in Salt Lake City, on Saturday, March 12, 2022.
&lt; &gt;For the first time since 2019, Salt Lake City had an in-person St. Patrick’s Day parade — celebrating “new beginnings,” the parade’s theme, after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Starting at 200 South and 600 West, the parade went through The Gateway shopping center along Rio Grande Street — ending at 50 North and 400 West.
That route took the parade through The Gateway’s Olympic Legacy Plaza, where the annual siamsa (pronounced “sham-suh”) took place — a celebration of Irish food, performance and vendors.
The daylong party was set to close at 5 p.m., with a crowd singalong of “The Parting Glass,” a traditional Scottish song also sung widely in Ireland, particularly at wakes.
