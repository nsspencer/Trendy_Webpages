     Virginia Tech Gobbles Up The ACC Title, 82-67
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Virginia Tech used its advantages in quickness and experience and a career-night from guard Hunter Cattoor to defeat Duke 82-67 Saturday night and capture the 2022 ACC Tournament.
In doing so VT joined 2017 Duke as the only teams to win four games en route to winning the title.
And they had 18 assists, while a Duke team that consistently reverted to one-on-one play when things got tough could muster only nine assists on 24 made field goals.
Griffin missed an open 3 and Duke went into the locker room down 42-39.
But for now this is a Duke team going into March Madness off a great big downer.
