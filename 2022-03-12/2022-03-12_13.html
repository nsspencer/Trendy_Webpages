    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Virginia Tech secured an unlikely berth in the ACC Tournament Championship after Friday night's 72-59 win over UNC in the semifinals, setting up a seismic matchup with Duke at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.
Virginia Tech used a 9-0 run to start the second half against the Tar Heels to swing the game in its favor and never looked back.
"We'll win tomorrow if we can defend and we can rebound," Hokies coach Mike Young said.

     Duke vs Virginia Tech: 2021-22 college basketball game preview, TV schedule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)Duke and Virginia Tech meet in the highly anticipated ACC Championship Game; will the Blue Devils take care of business or do the Hokies have one more upset in them?
The Blue Devils will certainly have the talent advantage in this game.
Virginia Tech is up to 25th in KenPom and was 33rd in the NET rankings before that win over the Tar Heels.
On paper, this looks like a game that Duke should win, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any sort of a blowout.
Prediction: Duke 75, Virginia Tech 69

     Summary: Virginia Tech made it to their first-ever ACC Tournament Final and according to some are still battling for their spot in the field.
Justyn can be a little turnover prone but when he is playing under control this Virginia Tech team could knock off most opponents.
If Virginia Tech is going to pull the upset it is hard to envision that happening without Maddox or Pedulla stepping up.
Having said that, I am not sure I want to doubt what this Virginia Tech team is capable of right now.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Virginia Tech was better and confident enough to pull Keve Aluma on the final play which essentially announced they were going to live or die on a three.
It’s hard to overstate how impressive Virginia Tech was against the Tar Heels.
We have seen brilliant effort and passion from Boston College, Clemson, Syracuse and Virginia Tech in Brooklyn.
But Virginia Tech is the best of those and there is no question that the ACC will have its two best teams in the finals, even if the conference (and ESPN) would have preferred Duke-UNC again.
The Blue Devils do have one possibly significant advantage: Virginia Tech will have to play four games in four days.
