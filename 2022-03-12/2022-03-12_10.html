     Summary: (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)Duke and Virginia Tech meet in the highly anticipated ACC Championship Game; will the Blue Devils take care of business or do the Hokies have one more upset in them?
The Blue Devils will certainly have the talent advantage in this game.
Virginia Tech is up to 25th in KenPom and was 33rd in the NET rankings before that win over the Tar Heels.
On paper, this looks like a game that Duke should win, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any sort of a blowout.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Virginia Tech was better and confident enough to pull Keve Aluma on the final play which essentially announced they were going to live or die on a three.
It’s hard to overstate how impressive Virginia Tech was against the Tar Heels.
We have seen brilliant effort and passion from Boston College, Clemson, Syracuse and Virginia Tech in Brooklyn.
But Virginia Tech is the best of those and there is no question that the ACC will have its two best teams in the finals, even if the conference (and ESPN) would have preferred Duke-UNC again.
The Blue Devils do have one possibly significant advantage: Virginia Tech will have to play four games in four days.
