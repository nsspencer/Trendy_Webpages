     Summary: A woman allegedly stabbed a man she had met on a dating website in retaliation for the 2020 death of an Iranian military leader killed in an American drone strike, police say.
Nikoubin and the man met online on a dating website, Henderson police alleged in an arrest report.
Nikoubin allegedly stabbed the man in the neck “for revenge against US troops for the killing of Qassem Suleimani in 2020”, police wrote in a report.
US forces killed Suleimani, a top general in Iran’s military, in a drone strike in January 2020.
Nikoubin also ran out of the room, telling a hotel employee that she had just stabbed a man, police said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pompeo y Hook encabezaron la campaña de “máxima presión” del gobierno de Donald Trump contra Irán y según el informe, la inteligencia estadounidense evalúa que las amenazas a ambos han sido constantes desde que dejaron sus cargos y podrían intensificarse.
Las amenazas han persistido no obstante las negociaciones indirectas que el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden ha sostenido con Irán para el regreso de Estados Unidos al histórico acuerdo nuclear de 2015.
AnuncioEn su calidad de exsecretario de Estado, Pompeo recibió una protección automática de 180 días de la Oficina de Seguridad Diplomática del Departamento de Estado tras dejar el cargo.
Blinken concedió la protección a Hook, que junto con Pompeo fueron a menudo el rostro público del gobierno de Trump en la imposición de las fuertes sanciones contra Irán, después que dejara su servicio en el gobierno.
Funcionarios estadounidenses afirman que las amenazas fueron discutidas en las conversaciones nucleares en Viena, donde Irán ha exigido la eliminación de todas las sanciones en su contra de la era de Trump.

     Summary: Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles at the Iraqi city of Erbil late Saturday night in the vicinity of an unoccupied American consulate under construction, according to the Associated Press.
Social media users in Erbil posted clips of apparent missile strikes in Erbil followed by large explosions.
Iranian-backed militia media outlets quickly claimed that the attack was carried out by Iran using Fateh-110 short range ballistic missiles.
The caption said that the timing was “not accidental at all.”Iran has twice before launched ballistic missiles at Iraqi targets.
In January 2020, Iran also attacked U.S. forces with a ballistic missile strike on Al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.

     U.S. Looks Into Iraq Attack After Iran Says Israel Killed Colonels in Syria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. military is tracking reports of a missile attack near Washington's consulate in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil days after two Iranian colonels were reportedly killed during an airstrike in Syria that was blamed on Israel.
A Pentagon spokesperson told Newsweek that the Defense Department was "looking into the reported attack near Erbil," but did not provide any details.
A spokesperson for Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations told Newsweek there was no information so far on the event.
Rocket attacks have targeted U.S. positions in Iraq for years and have sometimes drawn U.S. strikes against pro-Iran militia positions, most recently ordered by President Joe Biden last June.
The pledge was reiterated in a letter sent by Iran to the U.N. Security Council the following day.

Yet that same week, Secretary of State Tony Blinken urged Russia to move the nuclear talks forward.

     Iran fires missiles at Irbil US consulate; Tehran: ‘Secret Israeli bases’ targeted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As many as 12 missiles were fired Sunday toward the US consulate in Iraq’s northern city of Irbil, with several missiles hitting the building, Iraqi and US security officials said.
Iranian state media agency IRNA, citing local reports, claimed without evidence that “secret Israeli bases” were targeted in the attack.
A US official said missiles hit the consulate, but a second American official later said there was no damage and no casualties at any US government facility.

On Sunday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted Iraqi media acknowledging the attacks in Irbil, without saying where they originated.
