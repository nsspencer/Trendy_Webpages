     Hailey Bieber Hospitalized After Suffering ‘Stroke-Like Symptoms’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hailey Bieber was briefly hospitalized this week after suffering “stroke-like symptoms” while having breakfast with her famous husband.
In a Saturday Instagram story, the 25-year-old model wrote that she was having a Thursday breakfast with Justin Bieber “when I started having stroke-like symptoms and was taken to the hospital.” At the hospital, Bieber wrote that doctors found that she had suffered “a very small clot to my brain, which caused a small lack of oxygen,” but that her “body passed it on its own” and she quickly recovered.
The outlet also reported that doctors were looking into whether Bieber’s condition was possibly spurred by COVID-19.
Last month, Bieber's hospital revealed her husband had tested positive for the deadly virus and was forced to cancel his scheduled show at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
In a statement to TMZ at the time, Justin Bieber’s representative said the singer “thankfully is feeling OK.” A representative for Hailey Bieber declined The Daily Beast’s request for comment about whether the model had COVID—and if her recent ailment was related.
