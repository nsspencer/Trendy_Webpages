     Summary: Written by Swarali JoshiraoSome cried, others applauded at City Pride Kothrud on Friday as The Kashmir Files, based on the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, opened on the big screen.
I hope we can return to Kashmir.”For Anushka Kaul, 21, a third-generation Kashmiri Pandit migrant, the film was a visual narrative of events she had grown up hearing.
The film has opened to packed houses across India and the governments of Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have declared it tax-free.
“When a film is made on the Holocaust, no one questions it but everyone wants to know the reason I made The Kashmir Files.
I did not act, I tried to live that life.”To highlight the tragic nature of the events, the film uses minimal music and builds upon silences.

     ‘The Kashmir Files’ review from the eyes of an Indian Muslim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly I have not seen even thousands of Kashmiri Muslims speak about Pandits.
Hence I am skeptical of the number of Kashmiri Muslims who genuinely feel some sense of shame and sadness regarding what happened to their Hindu minority.
This movie should be watched by every Indian and those who are passionate about humanity, social justice and fairness.
Kashmiri Muslims, rest of India and the world owes them an apology, at the least.
[1]__________________________________________________The film depicts the agony, the torture, and several years of waiting for justice of five lakh Kashmiri Hindus.

     Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s The Kashmir Files is a ‘brutally’ honest take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vivek Agnihotri’s directional (The Tashkent Files was his last in 2019), The Kashmir Files flits between Kashmir, on the fateful January 19, 1990 and Delhi 2016.
Krishna Pandit (Darshan Kumaar) is the new face of NU – India’s leading college – with majority Kashmiri Muslims.
His grandfather Pushkar Nath Pandit’s (Anupam Kher) demise and last wish to have his ashes spread in his home in presence of his four friends takes Krishna to Kashmir.
Agnihotri’s diatribe about it not being a ‘star’ film, sure it is no My Name Is Khan, but shouldn’t Kashmiri Pandits’ story, even though it lacks the Karan Johar frills, be out too?
Kashmiri Pandits ne bandoonken nahi uthayi but their story is coming out.
