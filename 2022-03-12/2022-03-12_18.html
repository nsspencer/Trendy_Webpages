     Mets acquire ace pitcher Chris Bassitt from the Oakland A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The move, which is the Mets first big splash after the MLB lockout ended, will send two pitching prospects, J.T.
Ginn and Adam Oller, to Oakland, while bringing in the All-Star Bassitt to shore-up their already-stellar lineup of pitchers.
Last season, Bassitt recorded a 3.15 ERA, and went 12-4 for the A’s — and earned his first All-Star appearance.
The Mets will now boast a fearsome roster of pitchers that includes Bassitt, Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer, Carlos Carrasco and Taijuan Walker.

     Mets land A's ace Bassitt for prospect Ginn, more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So important did the Mets consider this type of deal that they were willing to part with Ginn, one of the centerpieces of their 2019 Draft strategy and the pitching prospect most likely to make a near-term impact on their rotation.
They also gave up Oller, a former Minor League Rule 5 Draft pick who became a feel-good story last summer, breaking out as he made it to Triple-A Syracuse.
But with free agents such as Carlos Rodón and Yusei Kikuchi flying off the board in recent days, trades -- even expensive ones -- represented the surest avenue for the Mets to improve.

     A's trade Chris Bassitt to Mets for two prospects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oakland A's traded All-Star pitcher Chris Bassitt to the New York Mets on Saturday, first reported by Jeff Passan of ESPN and later confirmed by the team.
The A’s entered the offseason with several stars on the trade block, and Bassitt is the first domino to fall.
In Bassitt, the win-now Mets get another All-Star arm for their already stacked rotation, though the right-hander does come with some injury risk.
If there’s any consolation, it’s that Bassitt was himself a prospect acquisition in a star trade, for Jeff Samardzija in 2015.
Best of luck to Bassitt in New York, where he’ll join former Oakland teammates Mark Canha and Starling Marte!

     Mets Acquire Chris Bassitt From A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Mets searching for further pitching upgrades, Bassitt seemed like a logical target for New York to add to a rotation that also saw Max Scherzer come to Queens prior to the lockout.
Bassitt posted a 3.15 ERA, 25% strikeout rate, and 6.1% walk rate, as well as some very strong hard-hit ball numbers.
3 starter, and it provides the Mets will some front-of-the-rotation caliber pitching should deGrom, Carrasco, or any other pitchers miss time.
Between Bassitt and free agent signings Starling Marte and Mark Canha, there is a distinct shade of Oakland green-and-gold coming to the 2022 Mets roster.
Oller was originally a 20th-round pick for the Pirates in 2016, and his career includes stints in indy ball and the Australian Baseball League as well as minor league stretches with the Bucs, Giants, and (for the 2021 season) Mets.
