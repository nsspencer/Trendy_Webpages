     Mets get Chris Bassitt in trade with Oakland A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets have added the final piece to their 2022 starting rotation, acquiring starting pitcher Chris Bassitt from the Athletics.
Bassitt is coming off two really solid years in Oakland.
Last year, he made 27 starts and struck out 159 in 157.1 innings while posting a 3.15 ERA.
Bassitt is owed $8.8 million in 2022, which is his last season under contract before becoming an unrestricted free agent.
With the move, the Mets have added a solid veteran pitcher who figures to slot in right behind Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer in the starting rotation.

     A's trade Chris Bassitt to Mets for two prospects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oakland A's traded All-Star pitcher Chris Bassitt to the New York Mets on Saturday, first reported by Jeff Passan of ESPN and later confirmed by the team.
In return, the A's receive two right-handed pitching prospects.
Adam Oller turned 27 over the offseason and hasn't yet reached the majors, but he posted strong numbers last year in the upper minors.
He had a monster strikeout rate in Double-A and continued to succeed upon promotion to Triple-A, all as a starter.
Losing Bassitt is a bummer for Oakland fans, as he's been a star performer, team leader, and fan favorite, but this is the familiar rebuild cycle we've come to get used to.

     Mets land A's ace Bassitt for prospect Ginn, more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So important did the Mets consider this type of deal that they were willing to part with Ginn, one of the centerpieces of their 2019 Draft strategy and the pitching prospect most likely to make a near-term impact on their rotation.
They also gave up Oller, a former Minor League Rule 5 Draft pick who became a feel-good story last summer, breaking out as he made it to Triple-A Syracuse.
But with free agents such as Carlos Rodón and Yusei Kikuchi flying off the board in recent days, trades -- even expensive ones -- represented the surest avenue for the Mets to improve.

     Mets Acquire Chris Bassitt From A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Mets searching for further pitching upgrades, Bassitt seemed like a logical target for New York to add to a rotation that also saw Max Scherzer come to Queens prior to the lockout.
Bassitt posted a 3.15 ERA, 25% strikeout rate, and 6.1% walk rate, as well as some very strong hard-hit ball numbers.
3 starter, and it provides the Mets will some front-of-the-rotation caliber pitching should deGrom, Carrasco, or any other pitchers miss time.
Between Bassitt and free agent signings Starling Marte and Mark Canha, there is a distinct shade of Oakland green-and-gold coming to the 2022 Mets roster.
Oller was originally a 20th-round pick for the Pirates in 2016, and his career includes stints in indy ball and the Australian Baseball League as well as minor league stretches with the Bucs, Giants, and (for the 2021 season) Mets.
