    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LSU has fired men’s basketball coach Will Wade, and released the notice of allegations it received from the NCAA earlier this month.
Rothstein reports Kevin Nickelberry will be the interim head coach for the Tigers.
“Today, we informed Will Wade that he has been terminated for cause, pursuant to the provisions of his amended employment agreement as the Men’s Basketball Head Coach at LSU,” Tate said.
Earlier this week, SI’s Pat Forde reported LSU received a notice of allegations for its role in the corruption case.
Per Dellenger, Wade is cited for five level I violations in the notice of allegations.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Wade is out as LSU men's basketball coach, the school announced Saturday.
Wade was terminated for cause, LSU said.
The allegations accuse LSU football and basketball of a lack of institutional control over a span of eight years, with LSU charged with eight Level I violations between the two sports.
"The Notice contains serious allegations, including multiple charges alleging Coach Wade’s personal involvement in — or awareness of — Level I misconduct," the school said.
The school will immediately begin the search for its next head coach as assistant coach Kevin Nickelberry leads the team for the remainder of the season.

     Will Wade fired by LSU after NCAA accuses him of 5 major violations, unethical conduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LSU has fired basketball coach Will Wade after five seasons, the school announced Saturday.
The move comes three days after news broke that the school had received an NCAA notice of allegations regarding alleged rules violations in the basketball and football programs.
“Notably, our decision to terminate Coach Wade and Coach Armstrong is not an acknowledgement of agreement with any of the allegations.
LSU suspended Wade for several games at the end of the 2019 season, but reinstated him a month later.
According to contract amendment Wade signed upon his reinstatement in April 2019, he agreed not to sue LSU if the school fires him with cause, including if he was charged with major NCAA violations.
