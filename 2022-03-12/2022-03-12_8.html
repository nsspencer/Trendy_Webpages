    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twelve ballistic missiles were launched from outside Iraq to target Irbil, the capital of Iraq's autonomous northern Kurdish region on Sunday, the state news agency quoted the Directorate General of Counter Terrorism in Kurdistan as saying.
Earlier today, several rockets landed in Irbil, Kurdish officials said, and a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that there were no U.S. military casualties caused by the attack.
Kurdish officials did not immediately say where Saturday's incident took place.
A spokesperson for the regional authorities said there were no flight interruptions at Irbil airport.
Residents of Irbil posted videos online showing several large explosions, and some said the blasts shook their homes.
