     Mark Ruffalo Reveals Why He ‘Almost Quit’ Jennifer Garner’s 13 Going On 30
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A big reason for that is the chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, who played the roles of Jenna and Matty to perfection.
While 13 Going On 30 ’s cast may have looked like they were having a blast, in reality it was a nightmare for Mark Ruffalo to shoot.
[laughs]Luckily, Mark Ruffalo did do it and, thanks to his contribution, the "Thriller" dance is one of the movie’s most unforgettable scenes.
In that way, it’s a bit ironic to think Mark Ruffalo had to step out of his comfort zone in order to make the movie’s magic work.
Despite his discomfort, it’s clear he and Jennifer Garner both have mostly fond memories of making the movie together.
