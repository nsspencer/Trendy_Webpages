     The Real Winners and Losers from UFC Fight Night 203
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Russian light heavyweight contender was back in action in the UFC Fight Night 203 main event in Las Vegas, taking on former title challenger Thiago Santos with a title shot potentially hanging in the balance.
He ultimately scored a unanimous decision win, but the fight was widely panned by fans and pundits for its slow pace.
While Ankalaev's win over Santos was a bit of a stinker, the majority of the UFC Fight Night 203 broadcast was incredible.
It was a night full of fun and surprises, and one we'll be talking about for days to come.

     Magomed Ankalaev defeats Thiago Santos by decision in UFC Fight Night main event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Magomed Ankalaev defeated former title challenger Thiago Santos via unanimous decision (49-46, 49-46, 48-47) on Saturday night in the main event of UFC Fight Night in Las Vegas.
Ankalaev stood up and engaged Santos in a kickboxing match for most of the bout Saturday, which was a dangerous proposition.
Santos dropped Ankalaev with a looping left hook at the end of the second round, which was probably the most damaging blow of the bout.
In the fourth round, Ankalaev finally went for a takedown late and grounded Santos in a round that he was winning up until that point on the feet.
Santos, 38, is a former UFC light heavyweight title challenger, going to a split decision in a loss to Jones at UFC 239 in July 2019.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the UFC Fight Night main event, Magomed Ankalaev extended his winning streak to eight with a five-round unanimous decision over former light heavyweight title challenger Thiago Santos.
Scores were 49-46, 49-46, 48-47 for the No.6-ranked Ankalaev, now 17-1.
There was little action in the first 90 seconds, and Ankalaev ended that stalemate with a couple right hands that hit their mark and got Santos’ attention.
Both got busier to start round two, but Santos still wasn’t landing anything of note while Ankalaev got in a nice right hand-left kick combination.
In the closing 30 seconds, though, Santos might have stolen the round with a left hand over the top that dropped the Russian.
