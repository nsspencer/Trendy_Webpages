     Saudi Arabia executes 81 men in one day, in the biggest mass execution in decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, for terrorism and other offenses including holding "deviant beliefs," authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades.
The number dwarfed the 67 executions reported in the kingdom in all of 2021 and the 27 in 2020.
"These individuals, totaling 81, were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women and children," the interior ministry said in a statement.
"Crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organizations, such as ISIS (Islamic State), al Qaeda and the Houthis," it added.
Some traveled to conflict zones to join "terrorist organizations," the statement said.

     Saudi Arabia conducts mass execution of 81 people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia's state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Saturday that the kingdom had carried out a mass execution of 81 people, The Hill reports.
It was the largest known mass execution in the country's modern history.
NPR notes that while Saudi state media did not specify how the prisoners were executed, "death-row inmates" in Saudi Arabia "typically are beheaded" publicly.
In the same time period, the United States — which has almost ten times the population of Saudi Arabia — averaged less than 25 per year.
Saturday's mass execution killed more people in one day than were executed in either of the previous two years.

     Saudi Arabia Puts 81 Men to Death in Largest Mass Execution in Its Modern History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday in what was the kingdom’s largest mass execution in its modern history.
The number is astounding when you consider that Saudi Arabia executed 67 people in all of 2021 and 27 in 2020.
The number is even higher than the 63 people Saudi Arabia executed in January 1980 after convicting them of seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca a year earlier.
It was far from clear why Saudi Arabia chose Saturday to execute so many people, including 73 Saudis, seven Yemenis, and one Syrian.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons is reportedly planning a trip to Saudi Arabia next week to discuss oil prices.

     Saudi Arabia Puts 81 People to Death in its Largest Execution Ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The interior ministry didn’t disclose how the men were killed.
Rights groups have called on the Saudi leadership to end the death penalty and make improvements to the country’s justice system to provide for fair trials.
“The interior ministry announces this to assure everyone that this country…won’t hesitate to deter anyone who threatens security or disrupts public life…” it said.
In keeping with Islamic law, he said, the death penalty would remain in place for murder.
The kingdom faces intense scrutiny over its human-rights record that goes beyond the liberal use of the death penalty.
