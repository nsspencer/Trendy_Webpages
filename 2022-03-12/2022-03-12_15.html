     Rockets fired towards US consulate in northern Iraq city of Erbil: officials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As many as 12 ballistic missiles have struck the Iraq’s northern Kurdish regional capital Erbil, with some reports suggesting several hit the US consulate building.
A US official said the missiles were launched from neighbouring Iran early on Sunday morning, but there were no reports of casualties.
A second US official said there was no damage and no casualties at any US government facility, but Iraqi officials said several missiles had hit the US consulate.
“Several missiles fell on the city of Erbil,” said governor Omid Khoshnaw, quoted by the Iraqi news agency INA.
Iraq has been rocked by chronic instability since the defeat of the Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in 2017 by a loose coalition of Iraqi, US-led and Iran-backed forces.

     Ballistic Missiles Hit Iraq's Kurdish Capital, No Casualties - Officials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) -A dozen ballistic missiles launched from outside Iraq struck the country's northern Kurdish regional capital Erbil on Sunday, Kurdish officials said, adding there were no casualties.
Iraqi state TV quoted the Kurdistan region's counter-terrorism force as saying 12 missiles launched from outside Iraq hit Erbil.
Kurdish officials did not immediately say where the missiles struck.
Since then, Iran-aligned militias have regularly attacked U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, U.S. and many Iraqi officials say.
Shi'ite militia groups close to Iran warn in private that they will resort to violence if they are left out of any ruling coalition.

     BREAKING: Reported Ballistic Missile Attack Near U.S. Base in Erbil, Iraq
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Footage posted to social media reportedly shows the impact of at least five projectiles in Erbil, Iraq near a U.S. military base and consulate.
Unconfirmed reports indicate the attacks involved Fateh-110 ballistic missiles launched from Iran, not smaller rockets or artillery shells used in numerous previous attacks against U.S. installations in Iraq.
There are no immediate reports of casualties or U.S. retaliation for the reported attacks.
If confirmed, the attack would be the first of its kind since a coordinated missile strike against U.S. forces in Iraq in January 2020.
Sunday’s reported attacks come three days after two Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps members were reportedly killed in Syria in an Israeli airstrike.
