     New York Mets acquire RHP Chris Bassitt from Oakland Athletics after All-Star season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OAKLAND, Calif. -- All-Star right-hander Chris Bassitt, who made a remarkable recovery from a frightening line drive to the head last year, was traded by the Oakland Athletics to the New York Mets on Saturday for a pair of minor league pitchers.
Bassitt gives the Mets a much-needed starter for the middle of the rotation, seemingly a good fit behind aces Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer.
Bassitt wound up 12-4 with a 3.15 ERA in 27 starts, including his first career complete game, and was a first-time All-Star.
So the Mets need to add depth on the mound, especially with deGrom coming off an injury-abbreviated season and Scherzer set to turn 38 in July.
He was a combined 5-5 with a 3.33 ERA in two levels of Class A ball last year.

     A's trade Chris Bassitt to Mets for two prospects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oakland A's traded All-Star pitcher Chris Bassitt to the New York Mets on Saturday, first reported by Jeff Passan of ESPN and later confirmed by the team.
The A’s entered the offseason with several stars on the trade block, and Bassitt is the first domino to fall.
In Bassitt, the win-now Mets get another All-Star arm for their already stacked rotation, though the right-hander does come with some injury risk.
If there’s any consolation, it’s that Bassitt was himself a prospect acquisition in a star trade, for Jeff Samardzija in 2015.
Best of luck to Bassitt in New York, where he’ll join former Oakland teammates Mark Canha and Starling Marte!

     Mets Acquire Chris Bassitt From A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Mets searching for further pitching upgrades, Bassitt seemed like a logical target for New York to add to a rotation that also saw Max Scherzer come to Queens prior to the lockout.
Bassitt posted a 3.15 ERA, 25% strikeout rate, and 6.1% walk rate, as well as some very strong hard-hit ball numbers.
3 starter, and it provides the Mets will some front-of-the-rotation caliber pitching should deGrom, Carrasco, or any other pitchers miss time.
Between Bassitt and free agent signings Starling Marte and Mark Canha, there is a distinct shade of Oakland green-and-gold coming to the 2022 Mets roster.
Oller was originally a 20th-round pick for the Pirates in 2016, and his career includes stints in indy ball and the Australian Baseball League as well as minor league stretches with the Bucs, Giants, and (for the 2021 season) Mets.
