    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo gallery: St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns to Salt Lake City After two-year hiatus, event brings Irish charm to Gateway(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Cici the basset hound walks in the Saint Patrick's Parade at the Gateway in Salt Lake City, on Saturday, March 12, 2022.
&lt; &gt;For the first time since 2019, Salt Lake City had an in-person St. Patrick’s Day parade — celebrating “new beginnings,” the parade’s theme, after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Starting at 200 South and 600 West, the parade went through The Gateway shopping center along Rio Grande Street — ending at 50 North and 400 West.
That route took the parade through The Gateway’s Olympic Legacy Plaza, where the annual siamsa (pronounced “sham-suh”) took place — a celebration of Irish food, performance and vendors.
The daylong party was set to close at 5 p.m., with a crowd singalong of “The Parting Glass,” a traditional Scottish song also sung widely in Ireland, particularly at wakes.

     Denver St. Patrick's Day Parade makes a comeback after two unlucky years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER — The St. Patrick’s day Parade made a comeback in downtown Denver Saturday after two years of cancellations due to COVID-19.
She and her husband, Jason Steffens told Denver7 they’ve been taking their two daughters to the parade ever since they were little girls.
This is the one event that she loves and it killed her for two years to not have it," he said.
So we wanted to help them enjoy the downtown experience and also be a part of St. Patrick's Day because we have Irish in our family," added Oakley.
This year marked the 60th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in Denver.
