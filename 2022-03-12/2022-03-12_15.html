     Saudi Arabia Puts 81 Men to Death in Largest Mass Execution in Its Modern History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday in what was the kingdom’s largest mass execution in its modern history.
The number is astounding when you consider that Saudi Arabia executed 67 people in all of 2021 and 27 in 2020.
The number is even higher than the 63 people Saudi Arabia executed in January 1980 after convicting them of seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca a year earlier.
It was far from clear why Saudi Arabia chose Saturday to execute so many people, including 73 Saudis, seven Yemenis, and one Syrian.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons is reportedly planning a trip to Saudi Arabia next week to discuss oil prices.

     Saudi Arabia executes 81 men in one day, in the biggest mass execution in decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, for terrorism and other offenses including holding "deviant beliefs," authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades.
The number dwarfed the 67 executions reported in the kingdom in all of 2021 and the 27 in 2020.
"These individuals, totaling 81, were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women and children," the interior ministry said in a statement.
"Crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organizations, such as ISIS (Islamic State), al Qaeda and the Houthis," it added.
Some traveled to conflict zones to join "terrorist organizations," the statement said.

     Saudi Arabia kills 81 in its largest mass execution ever recorded
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia killed 81 alleged criminals Saturday, the largest mass execution recorded in the kingdom’s modern history.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has relaxed some of Saudi Arabia’s strict policies.
Critics of King Salman and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the capital punishment was unjust and secretive.
“The world should know by now that when Mohammed bin Salman promises reform, bloodshed is bound to follow,” said Soraya Bauwens, the deputy director of Reprieve, a London-based advocacy group.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the dismemberment of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia carries out its largest known execution in the kingdom's modern historyDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed 81 people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups, the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly plans a trip to Saudi Arabia next week over oil prices as well.
It did not say how the prisoners were executed, though death-row inmates typically are beheaded in Saudi Arabia.
In 2019, the kingdom beheaded 37 Saudi citizens, most of them minority Shiites, in a mass execution across the country for alleged terrorism-related crimes.
Saudi Arabia meanwhile remains engaged in diplomatic talks with its Shiite regional rival Iran to try to ease yearslong tensions.
