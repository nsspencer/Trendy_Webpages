     Iran deal could collapse on Russian demands, say France, UK, Germany
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.K., France and Germany warned on Saturday that last-minute Russian demands for protection from sanctions could sink a nuclear deal with Iran that is ready to be sealed.
Under the agreement, Iran would limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief.
However, Moscow’s requests to get guarantees that any future Russian business with Iran would be exempt from EU and U.S. sanctions threw a wrench in the works.
“This risks the collapse of the deal, depriving the Iranian people of sanctions lifting and the international community of the assurance needed on Iran’s nuclear programme.
The deal now on the table “can and should be concluded with the utmost urgency,” they said.

     U.S. Looks Into Iraq Attack After Iran Says Israel Killed Colonels in Syria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. military is tracking reports of a missile attack near Washington's consulate in northern Iraqi city of Erbil days after two Iranian colonels were reportedly killed during an airstrike in Syria that was blamed on Israel.
A Pentagon spokesperson told Newsweek that the Defense Department was "looking into the reported attack near Erbil," but did not provide any details.
A spokesperson for Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations told Newsweek there was no information so far on the event.
Rocket attacks have targeted U.S. positions in Iraq for years and have sometimes drawn U.S. strikes against pro-Iran militia positions, most recently ordered by President Joe Biden last June.
The pledge was reiterated in a letter sent by Iran to the U.N. Security Council the following day.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pompeo y Hook encabezaron la campaña de “máxima presión” del gobierno de Donald Trump contra Irán y según el informe, la inteligencia estadounidense evalúa que las amenazas a ambos han sido constantes desde que dejaron sus cargos y podrían intensificarse.
Las amenazas han persistido no obstante las negociaciones indirectas que el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden ha sostenido con Irán para el regreso de Estados Unidos al histórico acuerdo nuclear de 2015.
AnuncioEn su calidad de exsecretario de Estado, Pompeo recibió una protección automática de 180 días de la Oficina de Seguridad Diplomática del Departamento de Estado tras dejar el cargo.
Blinken concedió la protección a Hook, que junto con Pompeo fueron a menudo el rostro público del gobierno de Trump en la imposición de las fuertes sanciones contra Irán, después que dejara su servicio en el gobierno.
Funcionarios estadounidenses afirman que las amenazas fueron discutidas en las conversaciones nucleares en Viena, donde Irán ha exigido la eliminación de todas las sanciones en su contra de la era de Trump.

     Summary: An Iran deal under Biden will be eliminated when Republicans get the chance, but that may not matter to the Iranians, who gain plenty in the meantime.
NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE T here was speculation that earlier this week, the eleven months of negotiations in Vienna would finally end in a completed Iran deal.
Indeed, EU foreign minister, Josep Borrell Fontelles, tweeted that the final text of the agreement is “essentially ready and on the table.” As of Thursday, however, the deal has stalled — most notably due to Russian demands for protection from sanctions on its trade with Tehran.
Yet Iran, too, continues to have demands despite the hundreds of billions in sanctions relief and the lax nuclear limits it could inherit in this deal.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that Iran’s Tasnim news …

     Missiles fired from Iran fall near US consulate in Erbil, Iraq - report

     Summary: Some 12 missiles were fired from Iranian territory and fell near the US consulate in Erbil in northwestern Iraq on Saturday night.
The health minister of Kurdistan stated that there were no injuries or deaths reported in the attack on Saturday night.
Prime minister of the Kurdistan Region, Masrour Barzani, responded to the attack on Saturday night, writing "Erbil does not bow to cowards.
The missile attack came as negotiations to return to the JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran stalled in Vienna.
Iran-backed militias reportedly targeted the Al-Tanf base, where US forces are housed, in October in retaliation for an alleged Israeli airstrikes which targeted Iranian-backed forces in Syria last year.

     Summary: Talks to revive the deal have been held in fits and starts in Vienna since April, including representatives from China, France, Germany, Russia, Britain, the European Union, and Iran.
Last week, Russia demanded that Western sanctions not impact relations between Tehran and Moscow, an idea that Western powers have rejected.
The revival of the landmark nuclear accord between Iran and world powers is “essentially ready” but external powers are still presenting some roadblocks.
Moscow demanded guarantees last week that Western sanctions related to its invasion of Ukraine would not hamper economic and military relations between Iran and Russia.
The United States and European countries have rejected the idea, saying they have nothing to do with restoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the 2015 nuclear deal is officially known.

     Summary: PARIS, France — Britain, France, and Germany warned Saturday against moves to “exploit” the Iran nuclear negotiations — a tacit warning to Russia, which is accused of delaying an agreement to gain leverage in its invasion of Ukraine.
“Nobody should seek to exploit JCPOA negotiations to obtain assurances that are separate to the JCPOA,” said a statement on Saturday from the spokespersons for the British, French, and German foreign ministries — the three European parties to the negotiations.
After the talks halted on Friday, the US put the ball in Iran and Russia’s court.
Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran, prompting it to start disregarding the curbs laid down in the deal on its nuclear activity.
“A fair and comprehensive deal is on the table ready for conclusion,” the European statement said on Saturday.

A second US official said there was no damage and no casualties at any US government facility, but Iraqi officials said several missiles had hit the US consulate.
Later, Lawk Ghafari, the head of Kurdistan’s foreign media office, said none of the missiles hit the US facility but that areas around the compound had been hit by the missiles.
The Iraqi security officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties from the attack, which occurred shortly after midnight and caused material damage in the area.
