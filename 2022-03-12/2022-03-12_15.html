     Watch Rosalía Perform “Chicken Teriyaki” on ‘SNL’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rosalía kicked her big night with a performance of her latest single “Chicken Teriyaki,” which arrived back in February.
“I think it’s the most personal and confessional album that I’ve made so far,” she told the outlet.
Motomami is the most personal story I’ve told.
In my head, Motomami​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ makes sense as a concept, as a feminine figure building herself.
The album will include the previously released singles “Saoko” and ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“La Fama” with the Weeknd.

     Rosalía receives mixed reactions for SNL solo debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spanish singer Rosalía made her solo debut on Saturday Night Live earlier this evening (12 March) but received mixed reactions to her performance.
“Tonight’s Saturday Night Live musical guest Rosalía is brought to you by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,” wrote one, commenting on her dramatic outfit.
Another added: “Why is Rosalía wearing a comforter and a no slip bathmat on her head?”Some even suggested that she was lip synching instead of singing live.
“Rosalia or whatever is probably the worst snl performance I’ve ever seen,” added another.
However, some backed the performance, with one writing: “Really great singing performance, too, in La Fama.

     Watch Rosalía Perform ‘Chicken Teriyaki’ in ‘SNL’ Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following her U.S. talk show debut earlier this week, Rosalía appeared as a musical guest for the first time on Saturday Night Live.
To kick off her set, the Spanish singer delivered a playful performance of her dancehall-tinged track “Chicken Teriyaki,” the third single from her third studio album Motomami.
In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Rosalía revealed that her forthcoming LP is “the most personal and confessional album that I’ve made so far.” She also revealed that feminism is a central theme of the record.
“In my head, Motomami​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ makes sense as a concept, as a feminine figure building herself,” she added.
“So, that’s how it goes: It’s almost like a self-portrait, when an artist makes a self-portrait in the context of the modern world.”This week, both Rosalía and host Zoë Kravitz made their SNL debuts.

     Rosalía Rocks Lacy Red Dress And Tooth Stud For First Solo ‘SNL’ Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Musical guest Rosalía left it all on the floor in a heart-racing performance on ‘SNL’ on Mar.
Rosalía first took the stage rocking a lacy red dress, a heavy motorcycle jacket, and chunky black booties.
Changing to a head-to-toe white look complete with an enormously oversized white puffer, white gloves, and a cropped white top, Rosalía commanded the stage in front of a red background.
Rosalía was first announced as an SNL musical guest via the show’s Instagram on Feb. 17.
Whatever Rosalía does next, her performance on SNL shows she’s certainly worth keeping up with.
