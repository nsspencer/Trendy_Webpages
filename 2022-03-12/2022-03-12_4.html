     Amari Cooper trade: Browns finalize deal with Cowboys for four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aiming to arm quarterback Baker Mayfield with more weapons this offseason, the Cleveland Browns have finalized a trade that would land them veteran wide receiver Amari Cooper.
The Browns would send 2022 fifth- and sixth-round picks to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for Cooper and a sixth-round pick of Dallas', a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.
He’s set to count $16.3 million against the cap, and the Browns would like to retain his services.
Cowboys executive Stephen Jones was noncommittal last Monday at the NFL scouting combine when asked about Cooper's future with the team.
Multiple teams had interest in Cooper, but Cleveland ultimately got the deal done.

     Amari Cooper trade rumors: At least five teams interested in receiver, reportedly could be traded or released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys are weighing their options with wide receiver Amari Cooper.
At least five teams have expressed interest in the 4-time Pro Bowl talent should he be released or traded, according to ESPN.
The Browns are a team that has emerged as a "real player" for Cooper, according to Jordan Schultz.
The Cowboys would save $16 million towards the salary cap if they move Cooper prior to June 1.
With Mike Williams, Chris Godwin and Davante Adams being taken off the market by either the franchise tag or a contract extension, the top available wide receiver free agents include Allen Robinson, D.J.

     Dallas Cowboys Trade Amari Cooper to Cleveland Browns - BREAKING
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amari Cooper is going to the Cleveland Browns for what CowboysSI.com is told is package featuring two late-round picks.
FRISCO - The Dallas Cowboys spent part of Saturday continuing to attempt to negotiate an affordable way to keep Amari Cooper.
(It's now being reported: Cleveland gets Cooper and a sixth, the Cowboys get a fifth and a sixth.)
But a bigger concern than that for the Cowboys: Before the trade, Cooper was due his entire $20 million salary for 2022 guaranteed if he was on the roster on March 21.

     Cowboys Amari Cooper heading to the Cleveland Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cowboys Amari Cooper heading to the Cleveland BrownsBrowns landing WR Cooper in trade with Cowboysby Associated PressCLEVELAND (AP) — The Browns weren’t willing to wait for free agency or the NFL draft to get their No.
Cleveland general manager Andrew Berry filled his club’s biggest need on Saturday by agreeing to acquire Amari Cooper in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Saturday.
Cooper would give the Browns a deep threat, filling the void left when Odell Beckham Jr. forced his release last season.
The Cowboys were intent on dealing Cooper, who signed a five-year, $100 million contract extension in 2019 and hasn’t produced the way Dallas had hoped.
Cleveland may still add more receiving depth via free agency or in a draft loaded with talented prospects.

     Browns agree to trade for Cowboys WR Amari Cooper; Jarvis Landry granted permission to seek deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns have agreed to acquire Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper in exchange for a 2022 fifth-round draft pick and a swap of 2022 sixth-rounders, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Saturday.
NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported later Saturday that the team has granted veteran Jarvis Landry permission to seek a trade -- though Landry and his camp are open to remaining in Cleveland.
Garafolo added that if Landry return it likely would involve a paycut as Landry is set to earn $14.3 million this season.
That future crystalized shortly thereafter when Rapoport reported last week that the Cowboys intended to release the wide receiver if they were unable to find a trading partner.
Rapoport reported Saturday the Cowboys spent the week fielding trade calls, but he noted that Cooper's 2022 salary (which becomes fully guaranteed later this month) was a sticking point in negotiations.
