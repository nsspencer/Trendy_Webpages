     Amari Cooper trade: Browns finalize deal with Cowboys for four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aiming to arm quarterback Baker Mayfield with more weapons this offseason, the Cleveland Browns have finalized a trade that would land them veteran wide receiver Amari Cooper.
The Browns would send 2022 fifth- and sixth-round picks to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for Cooper and a sixth-round pick of Dallas', a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.
He’s set to count $16.3 million against the cap, and the Browns would like to retain his services.
Cowboys executive Stephen Jones was noncommittal last Monday at the NFL scouting combine when asked about Cooper's future with the team.
Multiple teams had interest in Cooper, but Cleveland ultimately got the deal done.

     Cowboys WR Amari Cooper Generating Trade Interest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amari Cooper may not hit free agency after all.
Clarence Hill Jr. of the Dallas Star-Telegram reports (via Twitter) that there is a “real trade market” for the wide receiver.
While the Cowboys were “likely” to release the receiver, they were still hoping to trade him…but there were reports indicating that the Cowboys weren’t receiving a whole lot of interest.
Teams also might be wary of their ability to attract Cooper if he does indeed hit free agency.
So, if another team has Cooper high on their list, their only option may be to acquire him via trade.

     Fantasy Football Impact: Cowboys Trade Amari Cooper to Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In fact, the most fantasy points a receiver has averaged in Kevin Stefanski’s offense is Stefon Diggs.
The move also hurts Jarvis Landry, who has more competition in the passing game, as well as Donovan People-Jones as a late flier.
I now see the third-year wideout as a player who could truly bust out in the stat sheets for fantasy fans.
In 44 regular-season games with Cooper, he averaged 297.4 passing yards, had a 2-to-0.6 touchdown to interception ratio and a passer rating of 103.

     Cowboys, Browns working to finalize trade to send Amari Cooper to Cleveland for 5th-round pick, swap of picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys are working to finalize a trade that will send wide receiver Amari Cooper to the Cleveland Browns, per a league source.
The Browns are believed to be giving up a fifth-round pick, along with a swap of sixth-round picks, in exchange for the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver.
Trade interest in Cooper increased last week at the NFL Scouting Combine when reports stated Dallas planned to release the receiver.
Dallas has been close to completing a long-term deal with wide receiver Michael Gallup.
In Cooper, the Browns add a formidable threat to their passing attack alongside Jarvis Landry and newly franchise-tagged tight end David Njoku.

     Browns agree to trade for Cowboys WR Amari Cooper; Jarvis Landry granted permission to seek deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns have agreed to acquire Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper in exchange for a 2022 fifth-round draft pick and a swap of 2022 sixth-rounders, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Saturday.
NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported later Saturday that the team has granted veteran Jarvis Landry permission to seek a trade -- though Landry and his camp are open to remaining in Cleveland.
Garafolo added that if Landry return it likely would involve a paycut as Landry is set to earn $14.3 million this season.
That future crystalized shortly thereafter when Rapoport reported last week that the Cowboys intended to release the wide receiver if they were unable to find a trading partner.
Rapoport reported Saturday the Cowboys spent the week fielding trade calls, but he noted that Cooper's 2022 salary (which becomes fully guaranteed later this month) was a sticking point in negotiations.
