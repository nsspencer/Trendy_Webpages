    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets have added the final piece to their 2022 starting rotation, acquiring starting pitcher Chris Bassitt from the Athletics.
Bassitt is coming off two really solid years in Oakland.
Last year, he made 27 starts and struck out 159 in 157.1 innings while posting a 3.15 ERA.
Bassitt is owed $8.8 million in 2022, which is his last season under contract before becoming an unrestricted free agent.
With the move, the Mets have added a solid veteran pitcher who figures to slot in right behind Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer in the starting rotation.

     Summary: The Oakland Athletics are trading starting pitcher Chris Bassitt to the New York Mets for two prospects.
The Mets are giving up JT Ginn and Adam Oller, the former of whom ranks fifth in the team’s system at Baseball America.
The Mets have been working to upgrade their starting pitching and the A’s are regularly looking to unload players due a big raise.

     New York Mets acquire RHP Chris Bassitt from Oakland Athletics after All-Star season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OAKLAND, Calif. -- Right-hander Chris Bassitt, who made a remarkable recovery from a frightening line drive to the head last year, was traded by the Oakland Athletics to the New York Mets on Saturday for a pair of minor league pitchers.
Bassitt gives the Mets a much-needed starter for the middle of the rotation, seemingly a good fit behind aces Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer.
Bassitt wound up 12-4 with a 3.15 ERA in 27 starts, including his first career complete game and All-Star selection.
So the Mets need to add depth on the mound, especially with deGrom coming off an injury-abbreviated season and Scherzer set to turn 38 in July.
He was a combined 5-5 with a 3.33 ERA in two levels of Class A ball last year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So important did the Mets consider this type of deal that they were willing to part with Ginn, one of the centerpieces of their 2019 Draft strategy and the pitching prospect most likely to make a near-term impact on their rotation.
They also gave up Oller, a former Minor League Rule 5 Draft pick who became a feel-good story last summer, breaking out as he made it to Triple-A Syracuse.
But with free agents such as Carlos Rodón and Yusei Kikuchi flying off the board in recent days, trades -- even expensive ones -- represented the surest avenue for the Mets to improve.

     Mets Acquire Chris Bassitt From A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Mets searching for further pitching upgrades, Bassitt seemed like a logical target for New York to add to a rotation that also saw Max Scherzer come to Queens prior to the lockout.
Bassitt posted a 3.15 ERA, 25% strikeout rate, and 6.1% walk rate, as well as some very strong hard-hit ball numbers.
3 starter, and it provides the Mets will some front-of-the-rotation caliber pitching should deGrom, Carrasco, or any other pitchers miss time.
Between Bassitt and free agent signings Starling Marte and Mark Canha, there is a distinct shade of Oakland green-and-gold coming to the 2022 Mets roster.
Oller was originally a 20th-round pick for the Pirates in 2016, and his career includes stints in indy ball and the Australian Baseball League as well as minor league stretches with the Bucs, Giants, and (for the 2021 season) Mets.
