     ‘The Kashmir Files’ review from the eyes of an Indian Muslim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly I have not seen even thousands of Kashmiri Muslims speak about Pandits.
Hence I am skeptical of the number of Kashmiri Muslims who genuinely feel some sense of shame and sadness regarding what happened to their Hindu minority.
This movie should be watched by every Indian and those who are passionate about humanity, social justice and fairness.
Kashmiri Muslims, rest of India and the world owes them an apology, at the least.
[1]__________________________________________________The film depicts the agony, the torture, and several years of waiting for justice of five lakh Kashmiri Hindus.

     Summary: Written by Swarali JoshiraoSome cried, others applauded at City Pride Kothrud on Friday as The Kashmir Files, based on the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, opened on the big screen.
I hope we can return to Kashmir.”For Anushka Kaul, 21, a third-generation Kashmiri Pandit migrant, the film was a visual narrative of events she had grown up hearing.
The film has opened to packed houses across India and the governments of Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have declared it tax-free.
“When a film is made on the Holocaust, no one questions it but everyone wants to know the reason I made The Kashmir Files.
I did not act, I tried to live that life.”To highlight the tragic nature of the events, the film uses minimal music and builds upon silences.

     The Kashmir Files: Brutally realistic insight into Pandits’ tragedy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Anand Venkitachalam Score: 9.6/10 New Delhi: Finally released in theatres, director Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s passion project “The Kashmir Files” is a beautifully crafted cinematic experience which is exquisite in its pure depiction of raw emotion.
Boasting fantastic direction and production, “The Kashmir Files” is not just a movie but a learning experience.
Corroborated by a plethora of evidence at his disposal, “Kashmir Files” is an unapologetic insight which beckons heavy introspection on part of all Indians regardless their political inclinations or religious beliefs as to why the Hindus of Kashmir have been forgotten by their own countrymen.
Bhasha Sumbli plays the role of Sharda Pandit, an Kashmiri Hindu and the daughter-in-law of Pushkar Nath Pandit.
But this takes almost nothing away, “The Kashmir Files” is a solid effort which requires great guts to make, something which director Vivek Agnihotri and his entire crew have shown.
