     LSU fires men's basketball coach Will Wade after NCAA charges program with multiple major violations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Wade is out as LSU basketball coach, the university announced Saturday.
"We can no longer subject our University, Department of Athletics, and—most importantly—our student-athletes, to this taxing and already-lengthy process without taking action."
Wade went 108-51 as the Tigers' coach with two NCAA Tournament appearances.
LSU's final game before the NCAA Tournament was an SEC Tournament quarterfinals loss to Arkansas.
“I can’t comment on any of that stuff," Wade said Thursday at the SEC Tournament.

     LSU Fires Will Wade, Releases Notice of Allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LSU has fired men’s basketball coach Will Wade, and released the notice of allegations it received from the NCAA earlier this month.
Rothstein reports Kevin Nickelberry will be the interim head coach for the Tigers.
“Today, we informed Will Wade that he has been terminated for cause, pursuant to the provisions of his amended employment agreement as the Men’s Basketball Head Coach at LSU,” Tate said.
Earlier this week, SI’s Pat Forde reported LSU received a notice of allegations for its role in the corruption case.
Per Dellenger, Wade is cited for five level I violations in the notice of allegations.

     Will Wade Reportedly Fired by LSU After Receiving NCAA Notice of Allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The news came after the NCAA served LSU a Notice of Allegations that outlined allegations of violations within the program under Wade, which were first reported by Pat Forde of Sports Illustrated.
"Coach Wade met Friday with University and NCAA officials.
"The University regrets that Coach Wade did not choose to fulfill his obligations to LSU when he was first asked to do so.
Coach Wade's explanations and clarifications offered during the meeting, absent actual evidence of misconduct, satisfy his contractual obligation to LSU."
Ultimately, Wade's LSU career ended after the Notice of Allegations.

     Will Wade fired by LSU after NCAA accuses him of 5 major violations, unethical conduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LSU has fired basketball coach Will Wade after five seasons, the school announced Saturday.
The move comes three days after news broke that the school had received an NCAA notice of allegations regarding alleged rules violations in the basketball and football programs.
“Notably, our decision to terminate Coach Wade and Coach Armstrong is not an acknowledgement of agreement with any of the allegations.
LSU suspended Wade for several games at the end of the 2019 season, but reinstated him a month later.
According to contract amendment Wade signed upon his reinstatement in April 2019, he agreed not to sue LSU if the school fires him with cause, including if he was charged with major NCAA violations.

     Summary: LSU has fired basketball coach Will Wade for cause, the school announced Saturday.
Associate head coach Bill Armstrong was also fired.
Nickelberry is a former head coach at Hampton and Howard.
The school's case is being handled by the IARP process, an independent body designed to handle complicated NCAA violations cases.
In a November 2019 game at VCU, for example, multiple fans sitting near the LSU bench wore faux FBI apparel.
