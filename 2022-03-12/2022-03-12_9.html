    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - A chilly March Day didn’t stop hundreds of people from showing their St. Patrick’s Day spirit in downtown Roanoke Saturday.
So we’re excited for the music, and the food, and the horses and the floats,” said Cesilee Lineberry.
The Freedom First St. Patrick’s Day Parade and some of the wind gusts helped bring in more foot traffic to downtown Roanoke businesses.
“We definitely have had a lot more traffic this morning because of the parade,” said Olivia King, general ganager of Mast General Store.
2022 marks the first time Mast General Store has been open in Roanoke for the parade.

     Summary: Photo gallery: St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns to Salt Lake City After two-year hiatus, event brings Irish charm to Gateway(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Cici the basset hound walks in the Saint Patrick's Parade at the Gateway in Salt Lake City, on Saturday, March 12, 2022.
&lt; &gt;For the first time since 2019, Salt Lake City had an in-person St. Patrick’s Day parade — celebrating “new beginnings,” the parade’s theme, after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Starting at 200 South and 600 West, the parade went through The Gateway shopping center along Rio Grande Street — ending at 50 North and 400 West.
That route took the parade through The Gateway’s Olympic Legacy Plaza, where the annual siamsa (pronounced “sham-suh”) took place — a celebration of Irish food, performance and vendors.
The daylong party was set to close at 5 p.m., with a crowd singalong of “The Parting Glass,” a traditional Scottish song also sung widely in Ireland, particularly at wakes.
