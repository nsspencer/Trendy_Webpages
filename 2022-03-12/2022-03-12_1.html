     San Antonio has a lot of feelings after Gregg Popovich breaks NBA record to become ‘winningest’ coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: William LutherAfter much anticipation and some delays following a number of losses as of late, San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed – once again – that he is a basketball legend.
With the Spurs’ “nail-biting” Friday night win against the Utah Jazz at the AT&amp;T Center, Popovich beat Don Nelson’s record to become the “winningest” coach in NBA history.
Naturally, San Antonians had a lot of feelings about Coach Pop’s major milestone.
Although the city may not have gone honking (though we’ll blame it on the latest cold front), locals and Spurs fans worldwide took to social media to recognize Popovich’s greatness.
