     Manchester United vs Tottenham live: Cristiano Ronaldo nets hat-trick in five-goal thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sublime Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick helped secure a massive three points for Manchester United, as they beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 at Old Trafford.
The 37-year-old, who is now professional football's all-time top scorer, opened the scoring from range, before cancelling out equalisers from Harry Kane and a Harry Maguire own goal.
Spurs enjoyed long spells of possession and threatened throughout, but struggled to create enough clear-cut chances to get anything from the game.
The result means United go fourth in the table, putting the pressure on Arsenal, who still have four games in hand on the Red Devils.
Spurs however sit seventh, remaining three points behind their north London rivals, having played two games moreBackground reading(Photo: Martin Rickett/PA Images via Getty Images)
