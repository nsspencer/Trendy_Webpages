     ‘The Kashmir Files’ review from the eyes of an Indian Muslim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly I have not seen even thousands of Kashmiri Muslims speak about Pandits.
Hence I am skeptical of the number of Kashmiri Muslims who genuinely feel some sense of shame and sadness regarding what happened to their Hindu minority.
This movie should be watched by every Indian and those who are passionate about humanity, social justice and fairness.
Kashmiri Muslims, rest of India and the world owes them an apology, at the least.
[1]__________________________________________________The film depicts the agony, the torture, and several years of waiting for justice of five lakh Kashmiri Hindus.

     The Kashmir Files tries showing 1990 exodus ‘truth’ but Vivek Agnihotri gives it death blow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disturbing and discomforting are the two words that best describe the cinematic experience of The Kashmir Files directed by Vivek Agnihotri.
The director opens a black chapter of Kashmir’s history – the 1990 exodus of lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits during the peak of terrorism in the state.
Vivek Agnihotri called the film “truth of Kashmir ” and rightly shows the infamous Nadimarg massacre of 2003 when 24 Kashmiri Pandits were reportedly killed.
The movie almost blames it to be one of the reasons for the displacement of Kashmiri Pandits.
The Kashmir Files also tries to pin the blame on Farooq Abdullah and the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in Delhi.

     Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s The Kashmir Files is a ‘brutally’ honest take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vivek Agnihotri’s directional (The Tashkent Files was his last in 2019), The Kashmir Files flits between Kashmir, on the fateful January 19, 1990 and Delhi 2016.
Krishna Pandit (Darshan Kumaar) is the new face of NU – India’s leading college – with majority Kashmiri Muslims.
His grandfather Pushkar Nath Pandit’s (Anupam Kher) demise and last wish to have his ashes spread in his home in presence of his four friends takes Krishna to Kashmir.
Agnihotri’s diatribe about it not being a ‘star’ film, sure it is no My Name Is Khan, but shouldn’t Kashmiri Pandits’ story, even though it lacks the Karan Johar frills, be out too?
Kashmiri Pandits ne bandoonken nahi uthayi but their story is coming out.
