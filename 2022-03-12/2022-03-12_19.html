     Mountain West may be toughest conference in college basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS — At one point during the Wyoming-Boise State Mountain West semifinal game Friday night, Cowboys coach Jeff Linder called out a play for his team to run.
That’s the most for the Mountain West since getting five bids in 2013—and even then the league wasn’t as deep as it is now.
The Broncos will play San Diego State, which held off Colorado State 63-58 to make its fifth straight title game.
Call it patience or apathy or football monomania, but the Pac-12 should be hearing basketball footsteps from the Mountain West.
Boise State, San Diego State, Colorado State and Wyoming are ready to face an opponent that doesn’t know every play call and every tendency.
