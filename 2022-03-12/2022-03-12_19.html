     Raiders, DE Maxx Crosby agree on 4-year, $95 million extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders have reached a four-year, $95-million contract extension with their defensive end (DE) Maxx Crosby, with $53 million of guaranteed money, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
"I want to be of service to other people going through whatever they're going through right now," Crosby said on Friday.
Staying away from alcohol turned Crosby into one of the best pass rushers of the league.
He had the third-best DE/outside linebacker run stop win rate of 31 percent and the second-best pass-rush grade of 91.9.
His incredible performance convinced the Raiders to keep him with an annual salary of $23.75 million, the fourth-highest in his position.
