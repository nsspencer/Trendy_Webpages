     Hailey Bieber Released From Hospital After ‘Medical Emergency’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 06: Hailey Bieber attends the 10th Annual LACMA ART+FILM GALA honoring Amy Sherald, Kehinde Wiley, and Steven Spielberg presented by Gucci at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 06, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.
Hailey Bieber was hospitalized with a brain condition that doctors think might be COVID-related according to gossip website TMZ.
The site says that Bieber was admitted to a Palm Springs area hospital a few days ago after suffering a “medical emergency.” Apparently the 25 year old was displaying conditions that are more typical for much older people.
TMZ‘s headline indicated that her issues were COVID-related, but their reporting merely says that doctors were running tests to see if the issue was related to COVID.
The gossip site says that Hailey has been released from the hospital; doctors don’t seem to know what caused her issues.
