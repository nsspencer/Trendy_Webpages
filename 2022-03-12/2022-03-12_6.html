     Report: Iran suspends talks with Saudi after mass execution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has decided to temporarily suspend its secret Baghdad-brokered talks aimed at defusing yearslong tensions with regional rival Saudi Arabia, Iranian state-linked media reported Sunday, a day after Saudi Arabia carried out its largest known mass execution in its modern history.
Iraq’s foreign minister earlier had said the fifth round of talks between Saudi and Iranian representatives was due to resume on Wednesday.
Iran, the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, and Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
Angry Iranians protesting the execution stormed two Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran, fueling years of animosity between the nations.
ADVERTISEMENTThe pause in diplomatic talks between the countries that have long competed for influence across the Middle East comes at a tense time for the region.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iran has suspended the latest round of talks with regional rival Saudi Arabia, a website affiliated with Iran’s top security body has reported.
But a day later the website Nour news reported that “Iran has unilaterally suspended talks with Saudi Arabia”, without providing a reason.
It said no specific date had been scheduled for a new round of talks.
Saudi Arabia has described the talks as cordial but exploratory, while Tehran says they had gone a “good distance”.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have backed opposing sides in regional conflicts and political disputes in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq for years, and Saudi Arabia has led an Arab coalition waging war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen since 2015.

     Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Claims Missile Attack, Raising Tensions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iran’s top paramilitary force appeared to take responsibility for a missile attack early Sunday that slammed into northern Iraq, sending U.S. troops rushing for shelter, shattering windows and creating new complications for diplomatic efforts to ease tensions with Tehran.
While the Iranian force didn’t explicitly take responsibility for the missile strikes in Iraq, the statement appeared to confirm that the attack originated in Iran.
The Iranian group said it carried out a missile attack on what it claimed were Israeli targets.
Israeli officials declined to comment on the strike.
American, Iraqi and other world leaders condemned the missile strike as a destabilizing act as the Israeli military stepped up its defenses and U.S. officials considered how to respond.

     Biden is letting Putin run the Iran nuclear talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It starts with a strange, little-known fact: Russia is acting as a go-between for the United States in nuclear talks with Iran.
But shouldn’t America also sever the relationship with Putin in the Iran talks?
Russian continues to act as a go-between for the US in the Iran nuclear talks despite Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.
Yet that same week, Secretary of State Tony Blinken urged Russia to move the nuclear talks forward.
President Biden letting Russia run the nuclear talks with Iran makes the US seem weak.

     U.S. Won’t Negotiate Ukraine-Related Sanctions with Russia to Save Iran Nuclear Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. won’t negotiate exemptions to Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia to save the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and instead would try to strike an alternative agreement that excludes Russia if the Kremlin doesn’t back off from last-minute demands, a senior State Department official said.
In response, Iran expanded its nuclear work, breaching most limits in the deal.

European officials also said Friday they would be open to exploring an alternative accord with Iran without Russia.
Mr. Ulyanov on Friday said his country’s demands weren’t the only reason an agreement on reviving the nuclear deal hadn’t been reached.
