    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the regular season slowly starts to wind down, it seems like the Milwaukee Bucks are heating up.
The reigning champs are riding a six-game win streak as they open their second West Coast road trip against a Golden State Warriors team that has had an interesting stretch of games lately.
The Bucks blew the doors off the Warriors back in mid-January at Fiserv Forum.
The Warriors didn’t have Draymond Green for that one (and likely won’t tonight either) while the Bucks were without Jrue Holiday.
In the last game, the Bucks held Curry in check to 12 points on 50.5 percent true shooting, limiting him to 11 shots.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks could have one of the key players of their championship team back as early as next week.
Apparently, there is growing optimism that Brook Lopez could be ready to suit up for the team as he works on his conditioning, per Marc J. Spears of Undefeated.
To recall, Lopez has been out ever since playing in the opening night of the 2021-22 season.
There is growing optimism that Bucks center Brook Lopez (back) and guard George Hill (neck) could return to action next week, sources tell @andscape_ @espn.
We’ll figure out what’s best for him for this trip.”Lopez’s potential return couldn’t come at a better time for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks are 6-1 in games Jevon Carter has played with the franchise this season.
But honestly, I like to pick up, you know, that’s how I’ve been playing basketball for a long time.
Carter is currently scoring 5.1 points per contest with the Bucks, which would be a career-high.
The Bucks will not ask Carter to shoulder a significant burden offensively, but if he can continue to knock down a solid amount of 3-pointers, it would help Milwaukee tremendously.
Early on, it is hard to not like what Jevon Carter has shown with the Milwaukee Bucks throughout these first seven games.
