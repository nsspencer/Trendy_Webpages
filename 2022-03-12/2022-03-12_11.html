     Saudi Arabia executes 81 men in one day, in the biggest mass execution in decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Saudi Arabia flag flies on the top of the country's consulate building in Istanbul.
Reuters —Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, for terrorism and other offenses including holding “deviant beliefs,” authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades.
“These individuals, totaling 81, were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women and children,” the interior ministry said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security according to its laws.
SPA, Saudi Arabia’s state news agency, said the accused were provided with the right to an attorney and were guaranteed their full rights under Saudi law during the judicial process.

     Saudi Arabia conducts mass execution of 81 people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia's state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Saturday that the kingdom had carried out a mass execution of 81 people, The Hill reports.
It was the largest known mass execution in the country's modern history.
NPR notes that while Saudi state media did not specify how the prisoners were executed, "death-row inmates" in Saudi Arabia "typically are beheaded" publicly.
In the same time period, the United States — which has almost ten times the population of Saudi Arabia — averaged less than 25 per year.
Saturday's mass execution killed more people in one day than were executed in either of the previous two years.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia carries out its largest known execution in the kingdom's modern historyDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed 81 people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups, the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly plans a trip to Saudi Arabia next week over oil prices as well.
It did not say how the prisoners were executed, though death-row inmates typically are beheaded in Saudi Arabia.
In 2019, the kingdom beheaded 37 Saudi citizens, most of them minority Shiites, in a mass execution across the country for alleged terrorism-related crimes.
Saudi Arabia meanwhile remains engaged in diplomatic talks with its Shiite regional rival Iran to try to ease yearslong tensions.

     Saudi Arabia Puts 81 People to Death in its Largest Execution Ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The interior ministry didn’t disclose how the men were killed.
Rights groups have called on the Saudi leadership to end the death penalty and make improvements to the country’s justice system to provide for fair trials.
“The interior ministry announces this to assure everyone that this country…won’t hesitate to deter anyone who threatens security or disrupts public life…” it said.
In keeping with Islamic law, he said, the death penalty would remain in place for murder.
The kingdom faces intense scrutiny over its human-rights record that goes beyond the liberal use of the death penalty.
