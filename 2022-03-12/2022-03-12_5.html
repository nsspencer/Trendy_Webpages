     Summary: On Friday night, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich became the NBA’s all-time winningest coach with his 1336th victory.
!”While James has never played for the Spurs, he did play for Popovich with Team USA.
Popovich was an assistant coach on the 2004 national team, then took over for Mike Krzyzewski after the 2016 Olympic Games.
James has played for Team USA three times, his first coming in 2004 with Popovich.
In 2014, Popovich said anybody who doesn’t like James should “swim in a lake,” and on James’ 36th birthday, Popovich explained what makes him such a special player.

     Summary: William LutherAfter much anticipation and some delays following a number of losses as of late, San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed – once again – that he is a basketball legend.
With the Spurs’ “nail-biting” Friday night win against the Utah Jazz at the AT&amp;T Center, Popovich beat Don Nelson’s record to become the “winningest” coach in NBA history.
Naturally, San Antonians had a lot of feelings about Coach Pop’s major milestone.
Although the city may not have gone honking (though we’ll blame it on the latest cold front), locals and Spurs fans worldwide took to social media to recognize Popovich’s greatness.
