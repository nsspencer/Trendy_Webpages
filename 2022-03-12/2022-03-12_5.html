    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In another last-second thriller, the Villanova Wildcats took down the Creighton Bluejays, 54-48, for their fifth Big East title in eight years.
With 15 seconds remaining, Villanova’s Justin Moore converted on a tough layup to clinch the Big East Championship.
For his efforts, he was named the Big East Tournament Most Outstanding Player.
And then at the end we got ‘Gillespied.’”Yet, according to Wright, Gillespie’s back-to-back threes were not the shots that put away Creighton.
With the Big East title, Villanova earns an automatic bid for the upcoming tournament, and more importantly, a likely position as a No.

     Villanova Bracket Watch: Saturday Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everyday until Selection Sunday, we’re applying the NCAA Tournament Seeding guidelines to the Bracket Matrix to see where Villanova will land.
Now Villanova is poised for a 6th BET Title, and beyond that a high seed in the NCAA Tournament.
This one may go against conventional thinking because Nova beat Tennessee.
The only way that’s going to happen is if Nova wins a conference title and Duke doesn’t.
I added in a couple extra points in there, but let’s boil it down to the big four essentials: Nova wins, Duke loses, Kentucky wins, Kansas wins.

To win tonight and for you to win the Big East Tournament, what's it mean to you?
Q. Collin, you've become the first player to win Scholar-Athlete, Big East Player and Tournament Most Outstanding Player in the same year.
Q. Collin, did you watch -- I obviously know you guys got knocked out in the quarters, but did you watch the whole Big East Tournament?
