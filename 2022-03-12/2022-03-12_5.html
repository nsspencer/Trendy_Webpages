     Missiles hit Kurdish capital in Iraq, no casualities, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A dozen ballistic missiles struck Iraq's northern Kurdish regional capital Erbil early Sunday morning, local officials said.
The missiles were launched from the "east outside Iraq's borders" towards a new United States consulate building and residential areas, according to a statement from the Kurdistan Regional Government.
Iran borders Iraq to its east, though the statement did not name the country.
Initial reports shared on social media had claimed the missiles may have struck the US consulate building, but Lawk Ghafuri, press spokesperson for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), said Sunday that only areas around the compound were hit.
"None of the missiles hit the new US consulate which is still under construction in Erbil," Ghafuri said in a statement on Twitter, attributed to the Kurdistan Counter Terrorism Forces.

     Iraq: Multiple ballistic missiles strike Erbil
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Multiple ballistic missiles struck Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, on Saturday night, Iraqi authorities said.
The missiles were launched from Iran, Kurdish officials claimed.
Saturday's attack is the first to use ballistic missiles since Iran staged a retaliatory attack on US bases in Iraq days after Soleimani's killing.
Iran first used ballistic missiles in Iraq against Iranian Kurdish opposition parties in the Koya district in September 2018.
Sabreen News, an Iranian-backed Telegram channel close to Iraqi paramilitaries, said the Erbil attack was not related to the Revolutionary Guard killings in Syria.

     IRGC claims responsibility for missiles towards Iraq
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some 12 missiles were fired from Iranian territory and fell near the US consulate in Erbil in northwestern Iraq on Saturday night.
On Sunday morning, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was done in response to the "recent crimes of the fake Zionist regime."
The statement seemed to be referring to a recent alleged Israeli airstrike that targeted sites near Damascus, killing two IRGC officers.
The health minister of Kurdistan stated that there were no injuries or deaths reported in the attack on Saturday night.
Iran-backed militias reportedly targeted the Al-Tanf base, where US forces are housed, in October in retaliation for an alleged Israeli airstrikes which targeted Iranian-backed forces in Syria last year.
