     James Bradberry agrees to deal with Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Giants cut cornerback James Bradberry this month, but they’ll be seeing him a couple of times during the 2022 season.
The Eagles announced that Bradberry has agreed to terms on a one-year contract.
Bradberry was set to make a $13.4 million salary before being released.
Bradberry will join Darius Slay and Avonte Maddox at the top of the cornerback depth chart for the Eagles, who will be trying for their second straight playoff appearance during the 2022 season.
Adding a corner like Bradberry to the defense should be a big boost to that bid.

     James Bradberry to the Eagles: Ex-Giants Pro Bowl CB signs with NFC East rival for 2022 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It didn't take long for James Bradberry to find a new NFL home.
The Pro Bowl cornerback was placed on the trade block heading into the 2022 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, but after weeks of shopping him to no avail, the club opted to instead release him outright on May 9.
Less than 10 days later, he not only landed with a new team, but it's a bitter rival of the New York Giants -- signing a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, per CBS Sports NFL insider Josina Anderson.
The deal is reportedly worth $10 million, per NFL Network, and will allow Bradberry to attempt to exact some sort of football vengeance against Big Blue by battling them at least twice next season.
Bradberry will now join his third NFL team and second in the NFC East, but on a prove-it deal, hoping to help re-establish his brand around the league opposite First-Team All-Pro cornerback Darius Slay.

     Summary: Sources: Former #Giants Pro Bowl CB James Bradberry has agreed to terms with the #Eagles on a 1-year deal for $10M.
— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) May 18, 2022In a move that could make Philadelphia the favorites in the NFC East, Howie Roseman has landed James Bradberry on a one-year deal.
The Giants had previously released the Pro Bowl cornerback, saving almost $12 million in salary cap space.
Now paired with Slay, Philadelphia can bring their young cornerbacks along slowly, while making Jonathan Gannon’s versatile defense that more explosive.
Even more important, Bradberry will have a chance to match up with the Giants twice, and he’s familiar with everyone on the Eagles roster.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former New York Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry has agreed to terms on a one-year, $10 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.
Bradberry was released by New York on May 9 due to salary cap issues that made his current contract unfeasible.
Bradberry started his career with the Carolina Panthers, leading the team in passes defensed in each of his four seasons with the team.
Bradberry also became the first Giants cornerback to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2016 when he made the team in 2020.
Bradberry will also likely play opposite another Pro Bowl-caliber corner in Darius Slay, who collected his fourth Pro Bowl selection in 2021, creating a dangerous 1-2 combination in the Eagles secondary.
