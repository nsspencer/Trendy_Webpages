     John Daly Is Leading PGA Championship: Golf World Reacts

     Summary: GRAND BLANC, MI - SEPTEMBER 14: John Daly hits his tee shot on the second hole during the first round of the Ally Challenge presented by McLaren at Warwick Hills Golf &amp; Country Club on September 14, 2018 in Grand Blanc, Michigan.
(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)It's early, but John Daly is currently at the top of the leaderboard for the 2022 PGA Championship.
"Waking up to see John Daly at the top of the leaderboard is just incredible," one fan wrote.
"John Daly is your leader at the 2022 PGA Championship," another fan wrote.
It would be incredible to see Daly leading the pack after Thursday.

     A bettor could win $100,000 if John Daly wins the PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A bettor woke up this morning and decided it was the perfect day to place $100 on John Daly to win the PGA Championship, a wager that would win $100,000.
Or does this bettor actually think the 56-year-old golfer has a legitimate shot to pull off his first PGA Championship win since 1991?
While Daly’s odds are appropriately long, he did begin the tournament briefly at the top of the leaderboards through two holes (-1).
But he’d end his day with three straight bogeys to move to 2-over par and finish with an opening-round score of 72.
Potentially three more days of sweating it out for this optimistic bettor.

     PGA Championship 2022: To nobody's surprise, John Daly is the most surprising man at Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fast play, it turned out, might have been the key to this early success.
On the seventh hole, I heard a quiet voice behind me urging Micheel to hurry up as he stalked his ball in the left rough.
According to her, this was not a forgetful error, but a targeted protest at slow play—"he was making a point," she said, although it's not clear that he told anyone publicly.
On one hole, he apparently had to wait so long that he changed his club three times with shifting winds.
Nor does the cart help matters; he needs it, but it only gets him to his ball faster, giving him more time to wait.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shaggy John Daly produced yet another wild ride around a PGA Championship.
At the 2021 PGA Championship on Kiawah Island, Daly needed fans to help him get out of some sand when he got stuck.
Daly was disqualified from the PGA Tour Champions Regions Tradition last week after failing to do that after the second round.
The PGA championship is his fifth career tour event and second major.
“On top of that, it’s the toughest green on the golf course,” he said of the 18th.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Daly has had a fairly mediocre season so far on the PGA Tour Champions.
Daly, of course, has seen his fair share of being booted out of tournaments in his heyday on the PGA Tour.
In his first round at the 2022 PGA Championship, Daly found something a bit special and turned back the clock.
Daly was paired with Woods at the 2007 PGA Championship.

     John Daly Drilled a 40-Yard Field Goal During a Colts Preseason Game the Night Before His Shocking 1991 PGA Championship Victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than three decades have passed since John Daly shocked the golf world by winning the 1991 PGA Championship.
John Daly was never supposed to be in the 1991 PGA Championship, let alone in contentionJohn Daly was never supposed to compete at the 1991 PGA Championship.
In the second round, a 5-under round of 67 gave him a one-shot lead after 36 holes.
That game on Saturday, August 10, 1991, which they lost to the Seattle Seahawks, 17-7, was actually the Colts’ second preseason game.
The 1991 PGA Championship remains one of golf’s great upsets/surprises.
