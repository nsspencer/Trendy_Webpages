     Avalanche's Darcy Kuemper: Officially starting Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kuemper will guard the home goal Tuesday in Game 1 of the Avalanche's second-round series versus the Blues, Peter Baugh of The Athletic reports.
Kuemper allowed on four goals on 61 shots in three appearances during the first-round sweep over the Predators.
He suffered an eye injury that kept him out of that series' Game 4, but after a week off, he's been cleared to play again.
The Blues are likely to be a tougher test, but Kuemper has been one of the steadiest goalies in the league this year.

     NHL commissioner Gary Bettman: Altitude-Comcast dispute "frustrating, very disappointing"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said it is “frustrating and very disappointing” to see Altitude TV’s dispute with Comcast carry through a third consecutive Avalanche regular season and pointed the blame at the cable company.
“It’s terrible for fans,” Bettman said Tuesday night before the Avalanche opened its second-round playoff series against St. Louis.
Asked if he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, Bettman said: “I hope there is a resolution to it.
Bettman said he likes the current bracket-style playoff format in which teams aren’t re-seeded after each round.
“The excitement is being back in full buildings, seeing the energy around the game and a real normalcy returning to our game,” Bettman said.

     Recap: Manson the hero in overtime as Avalanche take Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, Josh Manson scored on the team’s 54th shot and the Avalanche took a 1-0 series lead in this 3-2 victory.
The Blues took the lead at 6:25 and held the score for the balance of the first 20 minutes.
The score occurred just three minutes into the period and the Avalanche took the momentum from there.
First, the Avalanche blew their chance on the power play, and almost immediately after the Blues got their own power play, which was the first in the game for them.
Conversely, St. Louis only needed one shot on goal in their lone power play to put this game in doubt.

     Avalanche win Game 1 from Blues thanks to Josh Manson’s first career playoff goal

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic didn’t trade for Josh Manson for him to score goals.
He smiled moments after the puck hit the net as he waited to ride the elevator down from his box.
With the Avalanche dominating play and pressing for a goal eight minutes into overtime, the forward darted toward the net off a draw.
He didn’t get a shot off, but he snatched the puck back behind the Blues’ net.
Unlike Manson, Landeskog didn’t see the puck go in.
