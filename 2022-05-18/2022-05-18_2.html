     Game One Injury Report: Warriors vs. Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are set to host the Dallas Mavericks in Game One of the Western Conference Finals.
His absence removes both shooting and shot creation from a Mavericks team that has done relatively well generating both this postseason.
The Warriors will host the first two games of this series before heading on the road for games two and three.
With Dallas proving they belong here after their decisive Game 7 victory over Phoenix, the Warriors will have to come prepared for a hard fought series.

     Summary: This year’s NBA Draft is one of those special times the Dallas Mavericks actually get to make their pick.
Never mind the fact the Dallas Mavericks are currently entrenched in their most successful playoff run since their 2011 Championship season.
The NBA news cycle never stops and when 26 of the 30 NBA teams are at home licking their wounds, there’s no better time than now to start NBA Draft conversations.
Dallas Mavericks fans can be excited about the team this year and the 2022 NBA Draft all at the same time.
Given the Dallas Mavericks already have the diminutive Jalen Brunson on the roster, Hardy’s height is a concern.

And things will have to change for the Mavericks to put Wednesday’s debacle behind them.
“We’ve lost two games in a row on the road and found a way to get back in the series.
The Warriors were trying to get the ball out of Dončić’s hands and the Mavericks were trying to do the same to Curry.
But when Curry came out of the locker room with two 3-pointers and Thompson got his first points of the game, the Warriors busted open a 64-47 advantage.

     Did The Warriors Make A Draft Mistake?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriros had the opportunity to draft Chris Duarte, who made an NBA All-Rookie Team.
The Golden State Warriors are playing in their sixth Western Conference Finals in the last eight seasons, so it's fair to say they don't make many mistakes.
However, one could ask the question if they would have been even better this season if they did something different during the 2021 NBA Draft.
The Warriors had the seventh overall pick (Jonathan Kuminga) and the 14th overall pick (Moses Moody).
He was also doing so on a bad team, so he did not get the kind of open looks he would get on a team like the Warriors.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ultimate goal was never to stop Doncic -- that's nearly impossible -- but to slow him, making sure everything he got was earned and not given.
Dallas coach Jason Kidd said: "They did a really good job, Wiggins picking him up full court.
It was just the Warriors' previous game -- Game 6 against the Memphis Grizzlies -- that Wiggins was asking associate head coach Mike Brown whether he could pick up Tyus Jones full court.
Wiggs is going to keep doing it, but it's just one more thing to think about and that's good playoff basketball."
So now it's just about continuing to improve game by game, and he's one of the best in the business at doing it."

If the Warriors are inconsistent against the Mavericks, then Golden State’s season ends before June.
The Dallas Mavericks vs. the Golden State Warriors have reached the Western Conference Finals in what should be a fascinating chess match.
However, the Warriors’ best playoff lineup — with Poole, Curry and Thompson in a three-guard set — is undersized and Doncic will hunt those smaller players and feast.
2) Is Dallas’ defense ready for Stephen Curry and the Warriors’ motion?
