     Dr. Taylor Swift Diagnoses NYU Grads As Cringe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As an honoree, Swift donned one of those floppy little Henry VIII berets and a purple robe and delivered a commencement address to a stadium full of NYU graduates.
In a speech that ran the length of 2.3 “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)”s, Swift thanked her family for their support and told the grads, “Welcome to New York.
The crux of the speech came when Swift gave her “officially solicited” advice to the crowd of new grads.
The best advice of all is “Learn to live alongside cringe.” “No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively,” she advised.
Even the term cringe might someday be deemed cringe.” As an example of how to live with your cringe, Swift revisited her tradwife aesthetic days: “I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife.

Times when the right thing is to fight, times when the right thing is to turn and run.

Sometimes the right thing to do is to listen to the wisdom of those who have come before us.
