     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – For the third time in these playoffs, the Mavericks are behind 1-0 in a series.
And things will have to change for the Mavericks to put Wednesday’s debacle behind them.
“We’ve lost two games in a row on the road and found a way to get back in the series.
The Warriors were trying to get the ball out of Dončić’s hands and the Mavericks were trying to do the same to Curry.
But when Curry came out of the locker room with two 3-pointers and Thompson got his first points of the game, the Warriors busted open a 64-47 advantage.

     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks were not expected to be here.
If the Warriors are inconsistent against the Mavericks, then Golden State’s season ends before June.
The Dallas Mavericks vs. the Golden State Warriors have reached the Western Conference Finals in what should be a fascinating chess match.
However, the Warriors’ best playoff lineup — with Poole, Curry and Thompson in a three-guard set — is undersized and Doncic will hunt those smaller players and feast.
2) Is Dallas’ defense ready for Stephen Curry and the Warriors’ motion?

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- Something has dawned on Stephen Curry as the Golden State Warriors stage their first legitimate title quest in nearly three years: He's now the old guy.
You're thinking about what you were doing at that age, trying to come into this scene and [play] playoff basketball."
East finals on ESPN/ABC The top-seeded Miami Heat lead the Boston Celtics, 1-0, with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line.
The Warriors spent much of the night in transition against a Mavericks team that prefers to let Doncic pick apart possessions in the half court.
Thanks to dogged defensive work from Andrew Wiggins, the Warriors made life difficult for Doncic in his first conference finals appearance.

Dallas Mavericks fans can be excited about the team this year and the 2022 NBA Draft all at the same time.
Given the Dallas Mavericks already have the diminutive Jalen Brunson on the roster, Hardy’s height is a concern.
