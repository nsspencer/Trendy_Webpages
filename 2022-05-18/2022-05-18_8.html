     This Is Us' Mandy Moore Warns Fans About Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the second to last episode of the series, Mandy Moore's character, Rebecca Pearson, dies surrounded by her family.
But Mandy promises that the series finale won't be anywhere near as sad.
In some regards, it has to be this way, she said, because the Pearson family doesn't just stop existing when the show ends.
As Mandy said, "You finish telling one person's story and it's like, 'Yeah, but they have children or they will continue having a life.
And their children will have children will have children.

     'This Is Us' airs most emotional episode yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The following story contains spoilers about Tuesday's episode of "This Is Us."
(CNN) Six seasons, more than a hundred episodes and plenty of anticipatory grief led to an emotional hour of "This Is Us" on Tuesday.
The penultimate episode of the series titled, "The Train," culminated in the death of the Pearson family matriarch, Rebecca Pearson [Mandy Moore] of Alzheimer's.
At one point she's greeted by her former physician, Dr. Nathan Katowski [Gerald McRaney] who delivered her triplets in the first episode of the series, but this time he was her bartender, pouring her a well-deserved Vesper.
"You're as tough as they come, Rebecca Pearson," he said.

The final episode doesn’t have many loose ends to tie up, and that was very intentional, Fogelman revealed.

     This Week in TV: ‘This Is Us’ Series Finale, ‘Angelyne’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some two dozen broadcast shows end their seasons in the coming week — one of which, NBC’s This Is Us, will have its series finale after six tear-jerking seasons.
It would be next to impossible to watch everything, but let THR point the way to worthy options for the coming week.
Emmy Rossum (who also executive produces) stars as Angelyne after spending several years obsessing over her story and helping steer the series.
The limited series premieres Thursday on Peacock.
HBO’s late night series Pause With Sam Jay begins its second season at 11 p.m. Friday.
