     Summary: In that role, he maintained an active presence around the state, building name recognition that played an important role in his primary victory.
“He spent a lot of time in communities throughout the state,” said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who did not take sides in the primary.
Several months later, he entered the Senate primary, the first major Democratic candidate to jump into the race, and cemented an overwhelming fund-raising advantage over his nearest rivals.
Mr. Fetterman campaigned on issues like raising the minimum wage, promoting criminal justice reform and supporting voting rights, abortion rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q.
Mr. Fetterman has repeatedly described himself as a progressive in the past, but in the Senate race he did not seek the left-wing mantle.

     John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects, capping a bizarre final few days of the campaign after the lieutenant governor suffered a stroke last week.
Fetterman checked into a hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Friday as he was on his way to a campaign event.
Gisele Barreto Fetterman told CNN that President Joe Biden phoned her husband to congratulate him after his win, but the candidate was asleep after his surgery hours earlier.
She took the call instead and said Biden offered congratulations, wished her husband a speedy recovery and said he couldn't wait to support him in the closely watched race in November.
While the hospital stay injected a level of uncertainty into the race, Fetterman had long been the front-runner, holding a steady polling lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.

     Summary: Fetterman wins Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, GOP...Marc LevybyJohn Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, easily won the state's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate on Tuesday, but the Republican race appeared headed for a recount.
The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary.
Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary, which was a two-candidate race early Wednesday with celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz holding a two-tenths of a percentage point lead over former hedge fund CEO David McCormick.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.

Fetterman, the leading Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate on Tuesday’s primary ballot, suffered a stroke last week and has been hospitalized since.
He said the stroke was caused by a clot from his heart being in “an A-fib rhythm for too long.” Fetterman said doctors were able to remove the clot and reverse the stroke.
“John Fetterman is about to undergo a standard procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator,” his campaign said in a statement Tuesday.

He’s someone who has a different kind of connection to voters,” Fetterman strategist Rebecca Katz said in an interview.
While there’s certainly vigorous debate in the Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania about the future of the Republican Party, the Democrat primary in Pennsylvania shows that the fight is over in the Democrat Party.
