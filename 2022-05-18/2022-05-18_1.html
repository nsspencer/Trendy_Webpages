     'Rare and unusual' monkeypox cases are causing global concern. Here's what we know.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The sudden surge of cases has prompted concern from public health professionals around the world.
Those droplets typically can’t travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required to spread monkeypox, according to the CDC.
The CDC says monkeypox cases in the United States are very rare.
Wednesday’s case in Massachusetts is the first U.S. monkeypox case this year, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health said Wednesday’s case poses no risk to the public.

     Massachusetts public health officials confirm case of monkeypox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston — The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) today confirmed a single case of monkeypox virus infection in an adult male with recent travel to Canada.
Initial testing was completed late Tuesday at the State Public Health Laboratory in Jamaica Plain and confirmatory testing was completed today at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Since early May 2022, the United Kingdom has identified 9 cases of monkeypox; the first case had recently traveled to Nigeria.
UK health officials report that the most recent cases in the UK are in men who have sex with men.
This clinical guidance is consistent with recommendations from UK health officials and US federal health officials, based on identified cases.

     Summary: (CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is collaborating with Massachusetts health officials on an investigation into a case of monkeypox , the agency said Wednesday in a statement.
The case of monkeypox was confirmed in a man in Massachusetts who had recently traveled to Canada, state health officials announced earlier in the day.
Canadian health officials said no cases of monkeypox have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The Massachusetts case is the first case reported this year.
The first known travel-associated monkeypox case in the US involved a man traveling from Nigeria to Texas in July 2021.

     Summary: Rare monkeypox outbreak in U.K., Europe and U.S.: What is it and should we worry?
Enlarge this image toggle caption CDC/Getty Images CDC/Getty ImagesThere's a monkeypox outbreak in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain.
The outbreak is quite small — just 36 suspected cases spread across the three countries, including eight in England and 20 in Portugal.
Up until this current outbreak, a person sick with monkeypox spread the virus to between zero and one person, on average.
"I would be more worried about camelpox than monkeypox," Rimoin says, "because that's closer on the genetic tree to smallpox."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But health authorities in Europe have confirmed more than a dozen cases this month and are investigating dozens more.
Some infections confirmed in the United Kingdom “have no travel links” to a place where monkeypox is regularly found, officials said, suggesting the virus may be spreading through the community.
Mass vaccination against smallpox “presumably” curbed monkeypox infections for a time among humans, researchers wrote in a 2005 article.
AdvertisementThe disease can spread through contact with animals, infected people and materials used by infected people, health authorities say.
British health authorities announced two new infections Wednesday, for a total of nine infections confirmed in England since May 6.

     Summary: It is not yet clear if the man, who lives in Massachusetts and who traveled to Canada by car, is connected to the growing outbreak of monkeypox cases in Europe.
The development adds the United States and possibly Canada to a growing list of countries reporting monkeypox cases in an outbreak first spotted in the United Kingdom.
The U.K. Health Security Agency announced Wednesday that it had detected two additional cases, bringing to nine the number reported there this month.
Prior to this outbreak the U.K. had only ever detected seven monkeypox cases.
However, in the past few years there has been small increases in exported monkeypox cases.
