     1st monkeypox case in US this year reported in Massachusetts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Massachusetts resident has tested positive for monkeypox, health officials confirmed Wednesday, making it the first case of the rare virus detected in the United States this year.
It comes after four more cases of monkeypox were identified in the U.K recently, bringing its nationwide total to nine since the beginning of May.
Hearing about cases of monkeypox in the U.K. encouraged doctors to "think more broadly about the patient's diagnosis," Shenoy said.
Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus.
In 2003, 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six U.S. states, the first human cases reported outside of Africa.

     Massachusetts public health officials confirm case of monkeypox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston — The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) today confirmed a single case of monkeypox virus infection in an adult male with recent travel to Canada.
Initial testing was completed late Tuesday at the State Public Health Laboratory in Jamaica Plain and confirmatory testing was completed today at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Since early May 2022, the United Kingdom has identified 9 cases of monkeypox; the first case had recently traveled to Nigeria.
UK health officials report that the most recent cases in the UK are in men who have sex with men.
This clinical guidance is consistent with recommendations from UK health officials and US federal health officials, based on identified cases.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is collaborating with Massachusetts health officials on an investigation into a case of monkeypox, the agency said Wednesday in a statement.
The case of monkeypox was confirmed in a man in Massachusetts who had recently traveled to Canada, state health officials announced earlier in the day.
Canadian health officials said no cases of monkeypox have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The Massachusetts case is the first case reported this year.
The first known travel-associated monkeypox case in the US involved a man traveling from Nigeria to Texas in July 2021.

     Summary: Rare monkeypox outbreak in U.K., Europe and U.S.: What is it and should we worry?
Enlarge this image toggle caption CDC/Getty Images CDC/Getty ImagesThere's a monkeypox outbreak in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain.
The outbreak is quite small — just 36 suspected cases spread across the three countries, including eight in England and 20 in Portugal.
Up until this current outbreak, a person sick with monkeypox spread the virus to between zero and one person, on average.
"I would be more worried about camelpox than monkeypox," Rimoin says, "because that's closer on the genetic tree to smallpox."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But health authorities in Europe have confirmed more than a dozen cases this month and are investigating dozens more.
Some infections confirmed in the United Kingdom “have no travel links” to a place where monkeypox is regularly found, officials said, suggesting the virus may be spreading through the community.
Mass vaccination against smallpox “presumably” curbed monkeypox infections for a time among humans, researchers wrote in a 2005 article.
AdvertisementThe disease can spread through contact with animals, infected people and materials used by infected people, health authorities say.
British health authorities announced two new infections Wednesday, for a total of nine infections confirmed in England since May 6.
