     Avalanche Win Eighth Straight Playoff Game Over Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER (AP) — Josh Manson scored 8:02 into overtime, Darcy Kuemper made 23 saves in his return to the net from an eye injury, and the Colorado Avalanche overcame a sluggish start to beat the St. Louis Blues 3–2 on Tuesday night in Game 1 of their second-round series.
Manson sent a shot from near the blue line through a sea of players that went in just over the shoulder of Jordan Binnington.
Valeri Nichushkin and Samuel Girard also scored for an Avalanche team that had a weeklong layoff after sweeping Nashville.
Colorado outshot the Blues by a 54-25 margin, including 13–0 in OT.
Ryan O’Reilly had a first-period goal and Jordan Kyrou tied it late for St. Louis.

     Avalanche-Blues Game 1 Quick Hits: Missed opportunities matter not after Josh Manson's OT game-winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blues get the bounceEven Norris Trophy finalists have a hiccup every now and then and St. Louis capitalized on Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar’s early game boo-boo.
The puck bounced off Blues center Ryan O’Reilly and then Blues winger Brayden Schenn and right back to O’Reilly for the 1-0 lead 6:25 into the game.
Second-period dominationThe second period was complete Avalanche domination.
The first goal was scored by winger Valeri Nichushkin, who skated free of Blues defenseman Nick Leddy to pound home a rebound.
Missed opportunitiesFor all of its dominance from the second period on, the Avalanche still led only 2-1 halfway through the third.

     NHL commissioner Gary Bettman: Altitude-Comcast dispute "frustrating, very disappointing"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said it is “frustrating and very disappointing” to see Altitude TV’s dispute with Comcast carry through a third consecutive Avalanche regular season and pointed the blame at the cable company.
“It’s terrible for fans,” Bettman said Tuesday night before the Avalanche opened its second-round playoff series against St. Louis.
Asked if he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, Bettman said: “I hope there is a resolution to it.
Bettman said he likes the current bracket-style playoff format in which teams aren’t re-seeded after each round.
“The excitement is being back in full buildings, seeing the energy around the game and a real normalcy returning to our game,” Bettman said.

     Recap: Manson the hero in overtime as Avalanche take Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, Josh Manson scored on the team’s 54th shot and the Avalanche took a 1-0 series lead in this 3-2 victory.
The Blues took the lead at 6:25 and held the score for the balance of the first 20 minutes.
The score occurred just three minutes into the period and the Avalanche took the momentum from there.
First, the Avalanche blew their chance on the power play, and almost immediately after the Blues got their own power play, which was the first in the game for them.
Conversely, St. Louis only needed one shot on goal in their lone power play to put this game in doubt.
