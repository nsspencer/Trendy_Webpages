     Summary: When Joe Sakic acquired Josh Manson before the trade deadline, the plan wasn’t for him to be the hero in overtime.
Manson, known for his stay-at-home defensive abilities, scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 on Tuesday to lift the Avalanche to a resilient 3-2 victory over the St. Louis BluesListen to “Josh Manson’s Overtime Heroics” on Spreaker.

     Recap: Manson the hero in overtime as Avalanche take Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, Josh Manson scored on the team’s 54th shot and the Avalanche took a 1-0 series lead in this 3-2 victory.
The Blues took the lead at 6:25 and held the score for the balance of the first 20 minutes.
The score occurred just three minutes into the period and the Avalanche took the momentum from there.
First, the Avalanche blew their chance on the power play, and almost immediately after the Blues got their own power play, which was the first in the game for them.
Conversely, St. Louis only needed one shot on goal in their lone power play to put this game in doubt.

     Kiszla: Sneaky good move by Joe Sakic gives Avalanche 3-2 playoff victory vs. St. Louis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lost in the glorious din of a groovy 3-2 Avalanche playoff win was a sneaky good score made by front-office honcho Joe Sakic way back at the NHL trade deadline.
But check back with me when Giroux is watching from the sofa while Manson takes the ice in the NHL Finals.
Prior to the playoffs, Avs big shot Nathan MacKinnon said the team’s best players would have to drive the bus on the road to the Cup.
“He’s big on the penalty kill.
It was a quiet little move by Sakic that blew the roof off Ball Arena when Manson scored in overtime.
