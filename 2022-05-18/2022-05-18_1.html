     Summary: In that role, he maintained an active presence around the state, building name recognition that played an important role in his primary victory.
“He spent a lot of time in communities throughout the state,” said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who did not take sides in the primary.
Several months later, he entered the Senate primary, the first major Democratic candidate to jump into the race, and cemented an overwhelming fund-raising advantage over his nearest rivals.
Mr. Fetterman campaigned on issues like raising the minimum wage, promoting criminal justice reform and supporting voting rights, abortion rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q.
Mr. Fetterman has repeatedly described himself as a progressive in the past, but in the Senate race he did not seek the left-wing mantle.

     Opinion | Is John Fetterman the Future of the Democratic Party?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Fetterman has served as lieutenant governor since 2019 and, before that, for four terms was the mayor of Braddock, a town east of Pittsburgh with just over 1,700 residents.
Mr. Fetterman will face either the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz or the financier David McCormick.
That Mr. Biden could not do better outside the cities and close-in suburbs has made many Democrats pessimistic about what’s possible in those areas.
Mr. Fetterman’s background, his attention to the state’s rural communities and his manner — the work clothes, a straightforward speaking style — could make some difference.
In the winning Fetterman model, he narrows the massive margins that have been run up by Republicans.

     John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects, capping a bizarre final few days of the campaign after the lieutenant governor suffered a stroke last week.
Fetterman checked into a hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Friday as he was on his way to a campaign event.
Gisele Barreto Fetterman told CNN that President Joe Biden phoned her husband to congratulate him after his win, but the candidate was asleep after his surgery hours earlier.
She took the call instead and said Biden offered congratulations, wished her husband a speedy recovery and said he couldn't wait to support him in the closely watched race in November.
While the hospital stay injected a level of uncertainty into the race, Fetterman had long been the front-runner, holding a steady polling lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.

     Summary: Even if you don’t know a single policy he supports, chances are good that you know what John Fetterman looks like.
Fetterman easily won today’s Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, and will run in November in a race that could decide control of the chamber.
By contrast, Fetterman looks like he was hacked together from spare parts in an oil-streaked Pittsburgh chopper garage.
And in a recent focus group of Donald Trump voters, some even said they’d consider voting for Fetterman.

Fetterman’s campaign announced on Sunday that he’d had a stroke on Friday, after his weekend schedule was cleared without explanation.
Fetterman credited his wife, Gisele, for noticing the symptoms early and taking him to the hospital.
“The amazing doctors here were able to quickly and completely remove the clot, reversing the stroke; they got my heart under control as well,” he said, adding that he did not have “cognitive damage.”

     Summary: Updated May 18, 2022 at 2:02 AM ETJohn Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, easily won the state's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate on Tuesday, according to a race call by The Associated Press, but the Republican race appeared headed for a recount.
The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.
It's time to deal them back in, and electing John to the United States Senate would be a big step forward for Pennsylvania's working people."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Fetterman has won the Democratic nomination in the Pennsylvania Senate primary, the Associated Press projects, setting up the race to fill the seat of retiring Republican Pat Toomey.
So why did the face of the Democratic-wave election in 2018 fall so resoundingly flat in a high-profile Senate race?
Unlike Lamb, Fetterman had garnered a national profile during the George Floyd protests and displayed savvy on social media, which he translated into name recognition and fundraising dollars.
“They think Fetterman is the answer to Trump because he’s the guy that can win them back Trump voters.
Earlier this year, when I spoke with both Lamb and Fetterman, Lamb intoned that he would be returning to his 2018 playbook for winning.
