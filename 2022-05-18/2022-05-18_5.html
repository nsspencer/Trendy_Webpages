     ‘BMF’ star Lil Meech allegedly stole a $250,000 Richard Millie watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems as though life may be imitating art in a way “BMF” fans would’ve never expected from the show’s star Lil Meech.
He allegedly stole a $250,000 Richard Millie watch and was caught red-handed.
He was arrested for grand theft, TMZ reported.
Judging from his facial expression, this may not be at the top of the list of things to worry about as far as Lil Meech is concerned.
The cops are also accusing him of trying to trade the watch for a different Richard Millie watch at another store, TMZ reported.

     Lil Meech Arrested on Fraud and Grand Theft Charges in Miami
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to several confirmed reports, Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr. has been arrested and charged with first-degree organized fraud and first-degree grand theft.
The rising actor of Starz’s BMF series is now facing 60 years in prison if convicted.
The 22-year-old son of famed drug kingpin Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory was arrested in Miami for the charges, but being that the ranking of that type of crime in Florida is so high, it’s likely that the feds will be taking over jurisdiction of his case.
First-degree organized fraud carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
Ironically, Big Meech is currently serving 30 years in federal prison for controlling and overseeing a national cocaine trafficking ring.

     Free Lil Meech! 'BMF' Actor Arrested For Stealing $250K Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lil Meech, lead actor in the hit STARZ series BMF, has reportedly been arrested for allowing a love for expensive jewelry lead him to stealing a $250,000 Richard Mille watch.
Cops also accuse him of trying to trade the watch for a different Richard Millie piece at a different store.
Lil Meech hasn’t reacted to charges publicly, but he recently posted an Instagram photoshoot to let fans know he’s unbothered.”STAY INFORMED!
It seems a bit odd that Lil Meech would attempt to steal jewelry given the seriously iced-out BMF chain he’s been known to rock around his neck.
We pray that everything works out for the budding actor, especially with Season 2 of BMF scheduled to begin filming soon in Atlanta.

     Summary: Lil Meech, the BMF actor and son of Big Meech, has been arrested for grand theft after allegedly stealing a $250,000 Richard Mille watch.
