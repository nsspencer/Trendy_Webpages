     Martin Shkreli is out of prison early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Martin Shkreli — the so-called "Pharma Bro" of Wall Street — has been released from prison early, the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed to Axios on Wednesday.
Driving the news: Shkreli was transferred on May 18 from the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Allenwood Low to community confinement, the FBP said in a statement.
"Community confinement means the inmate is in either home confinement or a Residential Reentry Center (RRC, or halfway house)," the FBP said.
The other side: “I am pleased to report that Martin Shkreli has been released from Allenwood prison and transferred to a BOP halfway house after completing all programs that allowed for his prison sentence to be shortened,” his lawyer, Ben Brafman, said in a statement to The Washington Post.
The big picture: Shkreli, who gained notoriety for having raised the price of an AIDS drug by 5,000%, is widely known as the “Pharma Bro” of Wall Street.

     'Pharma bro' Martin Shkreli released from federal prison and into New York halfway house

     Summary: Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli departs the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, August 3, 2017 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
Getty ImagesNotorious "Pharma bro" fraudster Martin Shkreli was released from a federal prison in Pennsylvania on Wednesday and into a U.S. Bureau of Prisons halfway house at an undisclosed location in New York to complete the rest of his criminal sentence, his lawyer said.
"Getting out of real prison is easier than getting out of Twitter prison," Shkreli, 39, wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday, referring to his ban from Twitter, which dates to his harassment of a female journalist in 2017.
Shkreli, a New York City resident who was convicted of securities fraud in 2017, previously was due to be released from the Allenwood low-security federal correctional institution on Sept. 14.
It also reflects the fact that Shkreli already had spent nearly six months in jail before he was sentenced.

     'Pharma bro' Martin Shkreli released from prison, sent to halfway house
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical investor convicted of securities fraud, has been released from prison after having served part of a seven-year sentence.
It said he is projected to be released from federal custody on Sept. 14.
Shkreli, 39, was sentenced in 2018 after he was found guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds and a former drug company, Retrophin.
In April, Shkreli's law firm asked to withdraw from representing him, saying the drug company, now called Phoenixus AG, had stopped paying its legal bills.
The law firm, Duane Morris, said Shkreli “has no assets” with which to continue to pay fees.

     Martin Shkreli, so-called ‘Pharma Bro’ released from prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) — The former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli, who courted international headlines after his company skyrocketed prices on a lifesaving drug in 2015, has been released from a prison stay tied to an unrelated securities fraud case.
Washington Post reports Shkreli’s lawyer, Ben Braufman said in a statement: “I am pleased to report that Martin Shkreli has been released from Allenwood prison and transferred to a BOP halfway house after completing all programs that allowed for his prison sentence to be shortened.”Braufman said Shkreli will now report to a halfway house.
“Shkreli essentially ran his company like a Ponzi scheme where he used each subsequent company to pay off defrauded investors from the prior company,” Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said at that time.
The move was widely condemned, though then-CEO Shkreli defended it, saying it was the market at work.
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Denis Cote also barred Shkreli from holding positions in the pharmaceutical industry for life.
