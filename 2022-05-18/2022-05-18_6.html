     ‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli released from prison early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Martin Shkreli, the “Pharma Bro” entrepreneur who astronomically increased the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000%, and became a symbol of corporate Wall Street greed, has been released from prison.
In a statement released on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said he had been released to a halfway house.
“We can confirm Martin Shkreli transferred on May 18, 2022, from the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Allenwood Low to community confinement overseen by the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) New York Residential Reentry Management (RRM) Office,” the statement said.
He was originally due to be released from prison in September 2023.
After his company acquired the Daraprim, it raised the price from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet, prompting national outcry.

     'Pharma bro' Martin Shkreli released from federal prison and into New York halfway house
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli departs the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, August 3, 2017 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
Getty ImagesNotorious "Pharma bro" fraudster Martin Shkreli was released from a federal prison in Pennsylvania on Wednesday and into a U.S. Bureau of Prisons halfway house at an undisclosed location in New York to complete the rest of his criminal sentence, his lawyer said.
"Getting out of real prison is easier than getting out of Twitter prison," Shkreli, 39, wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday, referring to his ban from Twitter, which dates to his harassment of a female journalist in 2017.
Shkreli, a New York City resident who was convicted of securities fraud in 2017, previously was due to be released from the Allenwood low-security federal correctional institution on Sept. 14.
It also reflects the fact that Shkreli already had spent nearly six months in jail before he was sentenced.

     'Pharma bro' Martin Shkreli released from prison, sent to halfway house
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical investor convicted of securities fraud, has been released from prison after having served part of a seven-year sentence.
It said he is projected to be released from federal custody on Sept. 14.
Shkreli, 39, was sentenced in 2018 after he was found guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds and a former drug company, Retrophin.
In April, Shkreli's law firm asked to withdraw from representing him, saying the drug company, now called Phoenixus AG, had stopped paying its legal bills.
The law firm, Duane Morris, said Shkreli “has no assets” with which to continue to pay fees.

     Martin Shkreli’s ex Christie Smythe on his release: ‘I’d love to see him’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christie Smythe, the 39-year-old ex-journalist who was dumped by convicted “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli from prison, said they are still friends and she’s hoping to see him now that he’s gotten an early release into an NYC halfway house.
“I spoke to him a few days ago,” Smythe told The Post Wednesday just hours after Shkreli’s release from Allenwood federal prison.
Now that Martin Shkreli is out of jail and in an NYC halfway house, ex-girlfriend Christie Smythe hopes to see him again soon.
Shkreli was so annoyed that Smythe revealed their relationship to the media, he broke off their romance via a letter from his lawyer.
Though he was widely reviled as “Pharma Bro,” Smythe said Shkreli has been wrongly painted as a villain.

     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight Shkreli left the Allenwood, Pa., minimum-security prison Wednesday and is being transferred to a halfway house under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, according to statements from his lawyer and a prison bureau spokesman.
AdvertisementDonald Murphy, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said Shkreli will remain in the halfway house until mid-September.
Murphy did not answer questions with respect to which specific programs facilitated Shkreli’s transfer to a halfway house, citing Shkreli’s privacy and safety.
Shkreli built close relationships with well-heeled Wall Street investors as he worked to build his hedge fund business.
For a time, he remained involved with Phoenixus, the drug company that originally engineered the price hike under its former name, Turing Pharmaceuticals, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
