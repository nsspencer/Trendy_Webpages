     Why Kurt Busch is NASCAR’s greatest journeyman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A former NASCAR Cup Series champion shouldn’t usually be considered a journeyman, but Kurt Busch’s career makes him arguably the greatest.
Kurt Busch has seen a lot throughout his NASCAR career; that much is an understatement.
Throughout it, the Las Vegas, Nevada native has become the greatest journeyman the sport has ever seen.
After five consecutive winning seasons with Stewart-Haas Racing, Busch joined Chip Ganassi Racing, where he added three winning seasons to that streak.
But Chip Ganassi Racing ended up being sold to Trackhouse Racing Team following the 2021 campaign, and Busch found himself teaming with Bubba Wallace at 23XI Racing.

     Summary: 23XI Racing team owner Denny Hamlin speaking the Friday afternoon before last weekend’s AdventHealth 400 at Kansas Speedway.
And with the win, brothers Kurt and Kyle Busch have now tied Bobby and Donnie Allison with a total of 94 NASCAR Cup Series victories.
And it takes a really good group of people that want to just get down in there and grind with this building of a new team with 23XI, right?
I couldn’t be happier for the team and for Billy Scott, our crew chief, who is the leader of this group.
Q: Winning with that number 45 of Adam Petty meant a lot to you, didn’t it?
