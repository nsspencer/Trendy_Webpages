     Summary: In that role, he maintained an active presence around the state, building name recognition that played an important role in his primary victory.
“He spent a lot of time in communities throughout the state,” said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who did not take sides in the primary.
Several months later, he entered the Senate primary, the first major Democratic candidate to jump into the race, and cemented an overwhelming fund-raising advantage over his nearest rivals.
Mr. Fetterman campaigned on issues like raising the minimum wage, promoting criminal justice reform and supporting voting rights, abortion rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q.
Mr. Fetterman has repeatedly described himself as a progressive in the past, but in the Senate race he did not seek the left-wing mantle.

     John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects, capping a bizarre final few days of the campaign after the lieutenant governor suffered a stroke last week.
Fetterman checked into a hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Friday as he was on his way to a campaign event.
Gisele Barreto Fetterman told CNN that President Joe Biden phoned her husband to congratulate him after his win, but the candidate was asleep after his surgery hours earlier.
She took the call instead and said Biden offered congratulations, wished her husband a speedy recovery and said he couldn't wait to support him in the closely watched race in November.
While the hospital stay injected a level of uncertainty into the race, Fetterman had long been the front-runner, holding a steady polling lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Malcom Kenyatta, who was defeated in the Democratic primary for one of Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate seats, said late Tuesday that he would campaign with the winner, Lt. Gov.
John Fetterman, ahead of the general election in November.
And if anybody knows Malcolm Kenyatta, I’m going to be out there doing everything we can to make sure we preserve democracy and don’t allow it to die on our watch,” said Kenyatta.
And I don’t think any of us will neither John Fetterman – who is our nominee,” Kenyatta added.
Fetterman was projected to win the Democratic primary, defeating Kenyatta and, by a more narrow margin, Rep. Conor Lamb (D) in the race to fill the vacancy left by Sen. Pat Toomey’s (R) retirement.

He’s someone who has a different kind of connection to voters,” Fetterman strategist Rebecca Katz said in an interview.
While there’s certainly vigorous debate in the Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania about the future of the Republican Party, the Democrat primary in Pennsylvania shows that the fight is over in the Democrat Party.
But I think his base respects him for saying it.”“He’s done a great job at building an extraordinary base, not just here in Pennsylvania, that’s excited to get out and get the vote for him.
"We’re going to win in November the same way we won tonight — by fighting for every county, and every vote," he said.
