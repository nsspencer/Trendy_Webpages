     Target Stock Sinks 25% on Earnings Miss, High Costs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Target shares tumbled after the retailer posted lower quarterly earnings and said it would absorb higher costs this year rather than raise its prices.
Sales at the Minneapolis-based retailer increased in the most recent quarter as shoppers spent more on food and groceries and even luggage as they prepared to travel again, but supply-chain costs and inflationary pressures cut into profit.
Like Walmart Inc., its larger rival, Target reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street’s forecasts.

     Summary: Its market cap, which stood at $99.82 billion after the close Tuesday, fell to about $72 billion Wednesday.
Even so, CEO Brian Cornell said the company missed the mark as its gains were "accompanied by unusually high costs."
The company's net income in the quarter fell to $1.01 billion, or $2.16 per share, from $2.1 billion, or $4.17 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $25.17 billion from $24.20 billion a year ago, above analysts' expectations of $24.49 billion.

    </h2>

     Summary: Target Corporation released earnings today for the first quarter of 2022, and they amounted to a stunning miss.
advertisementadvertisementThe retail giant reported a 52% drop in profit, missing Wall Street’s forecasts by a mile.
However, high supply-chain costs and other inflationary pressures cut into profits, sometimes in dramatic fashion: Target predicted fuel and freight costs will be $1 billion higher this year than it had expected.
On Wednesday, Target said in addition to increased shipping costs, earnings were also hurt by underperforming sales and inventory writedowns in those discretionary categories.
Target said major price hikes aren’t in the cards just yet over there, because it understands customers’ finances are hurting right now, too.
