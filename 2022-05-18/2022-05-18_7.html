     Ryan O’Reilly Avalanche Career Remains an Enigma (+)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the morning of Game 1 in the St. Louis-Colorado series, Blues center and captain Ryan O’Reilly briefly reflected on his six-season stay with the Avalanche.
And O’Reilly will be booed again, just as the Predators’ Matt Duchene was in the first round.
He used to be a fan favorite in Denver, though, and many Avs fans still rue the day he left.
He’s since won a Stanley Cup and a Conn Smythe Trophy with the Blues, while the Avs haven’t been past the second round since 2002.
If the Avs fail to get to a conference final again, O’Reilly will likely have a lot to do with that.

     Blues vs Avalanche Game 1 score: Josh Manson nets overtime winner for Colorado

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manson’s goal won the game for Colorado, 3-2, and put the Avalanche up 1-0 in the Western Conference semifinals against the Blues.
"He played unbelievable, gave us a chance to win," Blues defenseman Colton Payne said.
"They have a good team.
We have a good team.

     Blues had to win that one, but Avalanche defense shut them down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead, the Avalanche grinded a win out of a game they controlled from (near) start to finish, and today St. Louis must be wondering whether that was their best chance to win a game in Denver.
You can dig through Natural Stat Trick’s archives and find countless lopsided games this year that looked like this where the Avalanche won comfortably.
Puck luck last night was decidedly on the side of St. Louis.
Avalanche Defensemen ShineEvan detailed the dramatic mismatch at the back-end before this series, and Game 1 proved him prophetic.
For all the hope that this year would be different with a healthier and deeper Blues team, Game 1 sure looked a lot like last year’s four-game sweep.

     Avalanche's relentless offensive activity didn't produce blowout vs. Blues in Game 1, but it provided a blueprint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Generating shots wasn’t a problem in Game 1, a 3-2 overtime triumph for Colorado.
The Blues blocked 27 in front of Jordan Binnington and the goalie stopped 51 of the 54 that weren’t blocked.
In Game 3 at Nashville, Colorado won 7-3 en route to sweeping the series.
“But I thought they were good and they played the right way and spent a lot of time in the offensive zone.
But everyone on our team is watching those guys and how they play and how they compete and the details to their game.

Here are three takeaways from Colorado’s Game 1 win:Manson Delivers in OvertimeManson came to the Avalanche at the trade deadline.
Manson scored the game-winning goal in overtime, whipping a seeing-eye shot from the point past Binnington for the win.

After winning their first five games of this postseason, Colorado hosts the Blues for Game 2 on Thursday.
