     ‘Downton Abbey: A New Era’ Review: Gilded, Aged
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The stately series that began its story with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 has now arrived at the tail end of the 1920s.
The choppy waters of modernity are materializing on the horizon.
To stay afloat, this amiable sequel decides to ever so slightly democratize itself: The upstairs-downstairs division that has long separated the estate’s masters from their servants begins to leak.
Simon Curtis, the director, and Julian Fellowes, the “Downton Abbey” creator who also wrote “A New Era,” proceed to have their own actors compete to see who can land the best meta-zingers about the profession.
“I’d rather earn my living down at the mine,” Maggie Smith’s sniffy Dowager Countess quips.
