     Henry Talbot Doesn't Appear in 'Downton Abbey: A New Era'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Downton Abbey is missing one of its main characters in Downton Abbey: A New Era: Matthew Goode's Henry Talbot.
Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) explains his absence by saying her husband is traveling the world racing cars, and doesn't want to come home.
But, in reality, actor Matthew Goode's schedule did not allow for him to appear in the second Downton film.
In the first Downton Abbey film, he is briefly seen returning home after traveling abroad.
Downton Abbey: A New Era is in theaters starting on May 18, 2022.

     'Downton Abbey: A New Era' is fan service of the highest order
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: bar in its effort to cater to die-hard fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the expense of more casual viewers.
The action of the story switches back and forth between the two locales, Downton and France.
The film’s subtitle refers most explicitly to the advent of talkies, which were just becoming a thing in the late 1920s.
But “A New Era” has multiple other meanings as well, including the film’s message of gay tolerance (arguably somewhat anachronistic for the time).
In that sense, maybe “Downton Abbey” isn’t really giving its fans what they want, but what they have always needed to accept in this epic saga: that time doesn’t stand still.
