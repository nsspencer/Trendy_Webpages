    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been five years since Chris Cornell tragically died on May 18th, 2017.
On the fifth anniversary of his passing, Soundgarden and Chris’ widow, Vicky Cornell, shared separate statements about the late singer.
Thank you for loving him so much that through that love for Chris you have loved us too.
Thankfully, the most recent development was somewhat positive, with Vicky relinquishing Soundgarden’s social media accounts and website back to the band last June.
In 2020, Vicky oversaw the first Chris Cornell posthumous solo release, No One Sings Like You Anymore.

     Summary: Chris Cornell goes airborne during a Soundgarden show, circa early ’90s.
“Of those four main grunge bands, we’ve lost [Nirvana’s] Kurt Cobain, we’ve lost [Alice in Chains’] Layne Staley, and we’ve lost Chris Cornell.
I really don’t,” said photographer Chris Cuffaro, who shot Cornell and Soundgarden in the late ’80s and early ’90s.
And by the time a reunited Soundgarden went on tour in 2017, Cornell’s dark days seemed to be well behind him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s difficult at times to drive around Seattle and not recognize the ultramega imprint that Chris Cornell left behind on his hometown.
The wake that Chris Cornell left behind is especially immense because the impact he made upon the world was so incredibly enormous.
I remember I was talking to someone once while writing my book, Total F*cking Godhead: The Biography of Chris Cornell.
Then a thought crossed their mind: “How would Chris Cornell sing this.” Suddenly everything became clear.
Chris Cornell may no longer be with us, but he’s always there.
