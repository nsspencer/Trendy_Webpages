     Progressive Summer Lee declares slim victory after overcoming “multimillion-dollar smear campaign”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Summer Lee declared victory late Tuesday in the Democratic primary race to represent Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House, voicing confidence that the remaining uncounted votes will favor her campaign over corporate attorney Steve Irwin's.
"We built a movement in Western Pennsylvania that took on corporate power, stood up for working families, and beat back a multimillion-dollar smear campaign."
"Young and working people were able to defeat Super PACs through local organizing," said Varshini Prakash, the group's executive director.
If her victory is confirmed, Lee will face off against Republican Mike Doyle, the council president of Plum, Pennsylvania who ran unopposed in the GOP primary.
"We got here because of the power of the people," Lee said during her election party Tuesday night.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH, PA. – Today, State Representative Summer Lee scored a historic victory by being elected as the first Black woman to Congress from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
On election night, Gainey started off his victory speech by thanking Summer Lee.
Summer really inspired me and gave me the confidence that I could win,” Gainey told me at the time.
Almost immediately at Gainey’s victory party, people began saying that Summer Lee could be elected as the next Congresswoman from Pittsburgh.
“We wanna send a message today that we can prevail on a positive message, on a positive vision that lifts people up and doesn’t just tear folks down.”Today, the forces of dark money were defeated and Summer Lee was elected.

     Summer Lee Clinging To Lead In Historic PA Congressional Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been nearly a day since polls closed in critical primary elections in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, but at least one race involving a Black woman running for Congress still doesn’t have a winner.
Lee has a slim lead over Steve Irwin, an attorney who’s also a part of the party’s long-entrenched establishment in Western Pennsylvania.
Lee actually ran with the support of at least one local pro-Israel group.
Taken along with Gainey’s election and other developments, a Lee victory would be historic and could signal a shifting of political power in the Pittsburgh area.
Lee would be the first Black woman to represent any part of Pennsylvania in Congress assuming she wraps up the nomination and what should be an easy general election in the heavily blue district.
