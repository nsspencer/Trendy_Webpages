     Why Kurt Busch is NASCAR’s greatest journeyman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A former NASCAR Cup Series champion shouldn’t usually be considered a journeyman, but Kurt Busch’s career makes him arguably the greatest.
Kurt Busch has seen a lot throughout his NASCAR career; that much is an understatement.
Throughout it, the Las Vegas, Nevada native has become the greatest journeyman the sport has ever seen.
After five consecutive winning seasons with Stewart-Haas Racing, Busch joined Chip Ganassi Racing, where he added three winning seasons to that streak.
But Chip Ganassi Racing ended up being sold to Trackhouse Racing Team following the 2021 campaign, and Busch found himself teaming with Bubba Wallace at 23XI Racing.
