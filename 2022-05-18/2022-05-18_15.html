     Jason Kidd roasts Suns after latest bench fine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Kidd roasts Suns after latest bench fineThe Dallas Mavericks cannot stop running afoul of the NBA’s bench decorum rules, but coach Jason Kidd is just using those fines as a way to roast everyone publicly.
The NBA announced Wednesday that the Mavericks had been fined $50,000 for violating league rules regarding “team bench decorum.” The league’s statement said that Mavericks players “stood for an extended period in the team bench area” and “were on or encroaching upon the playing court” during the team’s Game 7 win over Phoenix.
Kidd was asked about the fine later Wednesday and was clearly unimpressed by it.
He questioned who had complained, as the game “was a blowout, so I don’t think the fans complained.”Jason Kidd on $50K fine for bench decorum violations: “I know about the fine.
Kidd has been casually dropping savage quotes throughout the playoffs and his team is backing him up by winning games.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were a lot of things that went wrong for the Dallas Mavericks in their Game 1 loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.
Dallas tried to fight Golden State in its own game, but the team failed big time.
The Mavs attempted 48 shots from deep and made just 11 for a 22.9 percent shooting clip.
“And we just didn’t make them.”Despite the poor performance from the Mavs, though, Jason Kidd remains confident that they can bounce back.
He reminded his team and the Warriors just that, noting that they have always found a way to answer.
