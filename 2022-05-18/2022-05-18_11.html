“I’m just interested in meeting him, but I know he’s a great player and I’m excited playing next to him,” Bradberry said.
“And I’m definitely looking forward to it.”Subscribe to the Eagle Eye podcastApple Podcasts | Google Play | Spotify | Stitcher | Art19 | Watch on YouTube

     Former Pro Bowler James Bradberry To Sign One-Year Deal With Eagles, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry has agreed to sign a one-year deal worth $10 million with the Eagles, according to a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.
The Giants released Bradberry on May 9 after failing to find a trade partner for their former Pro Bowl cornerback.
New Giants general manager Joe Schoen had been working on a trade since before free agency began in March.
Schoen acknowledged that he thought there would be more interest in the veteran.
“I thought there would be more interest,“ Schoen said on WFAN Sports Radio.

     Eagles sign James Bradberry: Giants' dead cap hit larger than what Philadelphia paid to ink CB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants are taking steps toward rebuilding their roster, making tough salary cap decisions along the way.
James Bradberry was a victim of the salary cap, as the Giants had to release him in order to sign their draft picks and create much needed salary cap space.
The Giants saved $10,136,111 in salary cap space with the move, but unfortunately had to witness Bradberry sign with the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday.
Bradberry agreed to a one-year, $10 million contract with the Eagles -- as the Giants will pay more in dead cap space from Bradberry's contract than what he'll make in Philadelphia.
Along with Bradberry, Logan Ryan was a cap casualty -- as New York is paying $12,650,000 in dead cap as a result of his release.

     Eagles agree to terms with CB James Bradberry on one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former New York Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry has agreed to terms on a one-year, $10 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.
Bradberry was released by New York on May 9 due to salary cap issues that made his current contract unfeasible.
Bradberry started his career with the Carolina Panthers, leading the team in passes defensed in each of his four seasons with the team.
Bradberry also became the first Giants cornerback to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2016 when he made the team in 2020.
Bradberry will also likely play opposite another Pro Bowl-caliber corner in Darius Slay, who collected his fourth Pro Bowl selection in 2021, creating a dangerous 1-2 combination in the Eagles secondary.
