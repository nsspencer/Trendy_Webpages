     Summary: There were a lot of teams interested in James Bradberry.
Not a lot of Pro Bowl cornerbacks pop up on the free agency market in the middle of May.
Bradberry and Darius Slay give the Eagles a legit set of corners for the first time in a while.
“I’m just interested in meeting him, but I know he’s a great player and I’m excited playing next to him,” Bradberry said.
“And I’m definitely looking forward to it.”Subscribe to the Eagle Eye podcastApple Podcasts | Google Play | Spotify | Stitcher | Art19 | Watch on YouTube

     Former Pro Bowler James Bradberry To Sign One-Year Deal With Eagles, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry has agreed to sign a one-year deal worth $10 million with the Eagles, according to a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.
The Giants released Bradberry on May 9 after failing to find a trade partner for their former Pro Bowl cornerback.
New Giants general manager Joe Schoen had been working on a trade since before free agency began in March.
Schoen acknowledged that he thought there would be more interest in the veteran.
“I thought there would be more interest,“ Schoen said on WFAN Sports Radio.

     Eagles sign James Bradberry: Giants' dead cap hit larger than what Philadelphia paid to ink CB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants are taking steps toward rebuilding their roster, making tough salary cap decisions along the way.
James Bradberry was a victim of the salary cap, as the Giants had to release him in order to sign their draft picks and create much needed salary cap space.
The Giants saved $10,136,111 in salary cap space with the move, but unfortunately had to witness Bradberry sign with the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday.
Bradberry agreed to a one-year, $10 million contract with the Eagles -- as the Giants will pay more in dead cap space from Bradberry's contract than what he'll make in Philadelphia.
Along with Bradberry, Logan Ryan was a cap casualty -- as New York is paying $12,650,000 in dead cap as a result of his release.

     Philadelphia Eagles: Signing James Bradberry is a compounding victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two weeks of campaigning via everyone from Darius Slay to your fine friends here at Section 215, Howie Roseman answered the wishes of his semi-adoring Philadelphia Eagles fan base and signed the best darn cornerback on the market, James Bradberry, to a one-year, $10 million contract.
Remember the days of having to trot out cornerbacks like Leodis McKelvin, Michael Jacquet, and Nolan Carroll?
James Bradberry actually chose the Philadelphia Eagles over 11 other teams who expressed interest in his services.
The Philadelphia Eagles’ entire defense improves with the addition of James Bradberry.
That’s exactly what the Philadelphia Eagles did by signing James Bradberry, and really, the only “loser” in this deal is the New York Giants, who lost their best cornerback due to a poor allocation of resources by their former general manager.

     Giants will pay James Bradberry more than Eagles in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former New York Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry signed a one-year deal with the rival Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday, a move that will cost the Giants in more ways than one.
In fact, the Giants will pay a larger dead cap hit for Bradberry than Philly will pay in his 2022 salary.
Last year, Bradberry followed that up with another solid campaign and established himself as a cornerstone of the Giants’ defense.
Schoen tried to trade Bradberry but was unsuccessful.
This is just another case of Schoen cleaning up from the excesses and miscalculations of the previous administration led by his predecessor, Dave Gettleman.

     Eagles agree to terms with CB James Bradberry on one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former New York Giants Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry has agreed to terms on a one-year, $10 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.
Bradberry was released by New York on May 9 due to salary cap issues that made his current contract unfeasible.
Bradberry started his career with the Carolina Panthers, leading the team in passes defensed in each of his four seasons with the team.
Bradberry also became the first Giants cornerback to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2016 when he made the team in 2020.
Bradberry will also likely play opposite another Pro Bowl-caliber corner in Darius Slay, who collected his fourth Pro Bowl selection in 2021, creating a dangerous 1-2 combination in the Eagles secondary.
