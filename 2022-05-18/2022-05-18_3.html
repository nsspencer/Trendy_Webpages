     Progressive Summer Lee declares slim victory after overcoming “multimillion-dollar smear campaign”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Summer Lee declared victory late Tuesday in the Democratic primary race to represent Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House, voicing confidence that the remaining uncounted votes will favor her campaign over corporate attorney Steve Irwin's.
"We built a movement in Western Pennsylvania that took on corporate power, stood up for working families, and beat back a multimillion-dollar smear campaign."
"Young and working people were able to defeat Super PACs through local organizing," said Varshini Prakash, the group's executive director.
If her victory is confirmed, Lee will face off against Republican Mike Doyle, the council president of Plum, Pennsylvania who ran unopposed in the GOP primary.
"We got here because of the power of the people," Lee said during her election party Tuesday night.
