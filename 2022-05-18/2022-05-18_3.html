     This Is Us' Mandy Moore Warns Fans About Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the second to last episode of the series, Mandy Moore's character, Rebecca Pearson, dies surrounded by her family.
But Mandy promises that the series finale won't be anywhere near as sad.
In some regards, it has to be this way, she said, because the Pearson family doesn't just stop existing when the show ends.
As Mandy said, "You finish telling one person's story and it's like, 'Yeah, but they have children or they will continue having a life.
And their children will have children will have children.

     'This Is Us' airs most emotional episode yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The following story contains spoilers about Tuesday's episode of "This Is Us."
(CNN) Six seasons, more than a hundred episodes and plenty of anticipatory grief led to an emotional hour of "This Is Us" on Tuesday.
The penultimate episode of the series titled, "The Train," culminated in the death of the Pearson family matriarch, Rebecca Pearson [Mandy Moore] of Alzheimer's.
At one point she's greeted by her former physician, Dr. Nathan Katowski [Gerald McRaney] who delivered her triplets in the first episode of the series, but this time he was her bartender, pouring her a well-deserved Vesper.
"You're as tough as they come, Rebecca Pearson," he said.

     Summary: But with the last episode of Season 6 looming, the This Is Us series finale promo promises to wrap up the incredible story covering 100 years of one American family.
The penultimate episode of This Is Us took care of many of the final loose ends floating around from the series’ puzzlebox leanings as it said goodbye to the Pearson matriarch.
However, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she revealed the finale is far less intense.
And their children will have children will have children.
This story could just go on forever and ever and ever.’”But that doesn’t mean the finale won’t be satisfying.
