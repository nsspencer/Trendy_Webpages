     Rob Gronkowski, Bucs discussed possible return to football: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Retired tight end Rob Gronkowski was close to returning to the football field this season.
Gronkowski had multiple conversations with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers around Thanksgiving about returning to the NFL to help his former team make the playoffs, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
According to the report, Gronk was "bored" without football and reached out to the Bucs to inquire about playing again.
Gronkowski retired for the second time following the 2021 season after catching 55 passes for 802 yards and six touchdowns.
Gronkowski’s return to the Tampa Bay sidelines couldn't hurt considering the Bucs have struggled to a 6-8 record.

     Summary: According to Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times, Gronkowski and the Buccaneers had “several conversations” about the tight end returning to the franchise around Thanksgiving.
Stroud reports that Gronkowski and the Buccaneers talked about different options for his return, including Gronkowski possibly joining the practice squad to get back into football shape.
But, the Bucs were also willing to add Gronkowski to the 53-man roster.
Despite missing several games with fractured ribs, Gronkowski caught 55 passes for 802 yards with six TDs.
4 in passing yards, though they’re No.

     Rob Gronkowski Discussed Second Unretirement With Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Rob Gronkowski retired for a second time, many suspected the June transaction would also lead to another temporary step away from football.
Brady’s QBR figure is his worst in the 17-season QBR era, and his timing with wideouts — particularly Mike Evans — has been off.
Gronk’s first unretirement, which keyed a 2020 trade with the Patriots, played a significant role in the Bucs claiming their second Super Bowl title two years ago.
Although longtime Bucs tight end Cameron Brate remains on the roster, a scary concussion scene paused his season.
Rookie Cade Otton leads Bucs tight ends with 357 receiving yards.

     Summary: All season, Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans have been hopeful that tight end Rob Gronkowski would come out of retirement once again to rejoin Tom Brady and help the Bucs make another playoff run.
As it turns out, the future Hall of Famer reached out to the team about that possibility back in November, per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times.
Though they had multiple conversations around Thanksgiving, Gronkowski ultimately decided to remain retired for now, per Stroud.
“It was more of a conversation than anything else,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said, according to Stroud.
I’m kinda bored 😐… — Rob Gronkowski (@RobGronkowski) December 21, 2022For now, it looks like the Bucs will continue to push for the playoffs with veteran Cameron Brate, and rookies Cade Otton and Ko Kieft, splitting the reps at tight end in Gronk’s absence.

     Summary: Rob Gronkowski has been retired for a year, but the 33-year-old seemingly has kept the door open for an NFL return.
The former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end put Twitter in a frenzy after he tweeted, “I’m kinda bored,” on Wednesday.
However, it didn’t stop two NFL teams from reaching out to Gronkowski about a second comeback.
“It was more of a conversation than anything else,” Bowles told reporters, per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times.
Tampa Bay has utilized rookies Cade Otton and Ko Kieft at tight end, along with veterans Cameron Brate and Kyle Rudolph, which has not produced the best of results.

     Summary: TAMPA ― Saying he was “bored” not playing football, retired tight end Rob Gronkowski contacted the Bucs last month about a possible return to the team.
He agreed to rejoin Brady in Tampa Bay in 2020, and the Bucs traded for his rights from New England.
Let’s do this @FanDuel pic.twitter.com/I5i2whjcO7 — Rob Gronkowski (@RobGronkowski) December 22, 2022The Bucs could certainly use Gronkowski as a blocker and pass-catcher.
“They’re playing very well,” Bowles said.
They’re doing very well.”So Gronkowski will remain retired ― for now ― though the Bucs seemingly will always keep the door open for him.
