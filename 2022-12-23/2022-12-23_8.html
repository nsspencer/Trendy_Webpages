     ‘Serpent’ serial killer Charles Sobhraj freed from Nepalese prison

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Photograph: Atish Patel/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring his time in jail in Nepal, Sobhraj had raised eyebrows by marrying a Nepalese woman 40 years his junior.
She said she would remain in Nepal and join Sobhraj later, as she still had court cases going on.
Sikawoti, who described the serial killer as “an extraordinary person”, said that now he had been released, Sobhraj intended to “tell his story to the world”.

     Serial killer Charles ‘The Serpent' Sobhraj freed from Nepal prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Sobhraj, a convicted killer who police say is responsible for a string of murders in the 1970s and 1980s, was released from a Nepal prison on Friday after nearly two decades behind bars.
Sobhraj was driven out of Central Jail in Kathmandu by a cavalcade of police cars a little after midday, Ishwari Prasad Pandey, a jailor at the Central Jail, told Reuters.
His notoriety and exploits have been the subject of several dramatizations, including a Netflix and BBC joint production released last year.
Sobhraj escaped from India’s Tihar jail in 1986 after drugging prison guards with cookies and cakes laced with sleeping pills.
“Jail authorities will hand him over to the department of immigration today,” Sobhraj’s lawyer, Chintan told Reuters earlier on Friday.

     French serial killer Charles "The Serpent" Sobhraj​, released from prison in Nepal, says "I feel great"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kathmandu, Nepal — Confessed French serial killer Charles Sobhraj was freed from prison in Nepal on Friday after serving most of his sentence for the murders of American and Canadian backpackers.
The country's Supreme Court had ordered Wednesday that Sobhraj, 78, who was sentenced to life in prison in Nepal, be released because of poor health, good behavior and having already served most of his sentence.
Agence France-Presse reports that Sobhraj was taken to immigration detention and then to Kathmandu airport to be deported to France.
Sobhraj was held for two decades in New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar prison on suspicion of theft but was deported without charge to France in 1997.
Sobhraj is the subject of the 2021 Netflix series "The Serpent," inspired by his 1970's killing spree, starring Tahar Rahim and Jenna Coleman.
