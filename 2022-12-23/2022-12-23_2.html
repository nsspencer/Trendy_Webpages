     Jury begins deliberations in trial to see whether Tory Lanez shot Megan Thee Stallion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jurors began deliberations Thursday at the trial of rapper Tory Lanez, who is charged with shooting and wounding hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet.
The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for just over three hours after hearing the last part of the defense’s closing argument that began a day earlier and a brief rebuttal from Los Angeles County prosecutors.
They did not reach a verdict and will return Friday to resume talks on the three felony counts brought against the 30-year-old Canadian rapper: discharging a firearm with gross negligence, assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.
The counts could lead to up to 22 years in prison and deportation for Lanez, who has pleaded not guilty.

     Summary: “He said this case was about sexual relationships.
This case has always been about the shooting,” Ta argued.
But you are all better than that.”Mgdesyan used his closing argument to challenge the credibility of Megan’s accusation.
Primarily, he cited a lack of DNA linking Lanez to the 9mm handgun.
He further claimed that Megan’s friend, Kelsey Harris, shot the rapper after Lanez revealed he was sleeping with both women.

     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jurors have began deliberating at the trial of rapper Tory Lanez, who is charged with shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet and leaving her wounded.
FULL STORYLOS ANGELES (AP) — Jurors began deliberations Thursday at the trial of rapper Tory Lanez, who is charged with shooting and wounding hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet.
The counts could lead to up to 22 years in prison and deportation for Lanez, who has pleaded not guilty.
The attorney, George Mgdesyan, alleges Megan created a more sympathetic narrative by pinning the shooting on Lanez.
Megan Thee Stallion was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her prominence has surged since.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite not being a plaintiff in the trial, Megan has been the target of rampant misinformation and extensive backlash for speaking out about the harm she experiences.
In a new statement, Fontaine, known more frequently as Pardi, reflected on the double-edged sword that women like Megan often face when they decide to pursue justice.
“To any woman, especially ones of color, that has suffered an injustice I feel for you,” he wrote on Instagram following closing arguments in the trial on Thursday.
This whole story has not been about the shooting, it’s only been about who is Tory having sex with.
“In an instant you can go from victim to defendant in the eyes of the public,” he wrote.

     Jury to Resume Deliberations Friday in Tory Lanez Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Jurors in the trial of rapper Tory Lanez -- who is charged with shooting and wounding fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion after an argument in the Hollywood Hills -- are set to resume deliberations Friday, one day after being handed the case.
The downtown Los Angeles jury spent just over three hours Thursday considering the case against Lanez, 30, before going home for the day.
Megan Thee Stallion said the vehicle was stopped soon afterward by police, who ordered all of the occupants out, as her feet were still bleeding.
Harris testified that she didn't know who shot Megan Thee Stallion, didn't want to be involved in the case and denied receiving any "hush money" from Lanez.
In a video posted on Instagram Live following the shooting, Megan Thee Stallion said, "Tory shot me.
