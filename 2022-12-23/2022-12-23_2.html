     Tory Lanez guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion. Everything to know on the shooting case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A jury has found rapper Tory Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Pete.
Prosecutors said the two artists got into a heated dispute when Pete derided Peterson’s rap skills.
Initially, Pete told police that she was hurt by stepping on broken glass at Jenner’s party.
Then Peterson turned around and told Pete she needed “to stop lying” to Harris about their relationship.
Pete told the court that she and Peterson had become friends and bonded over the loss of their mothers in the months before the shooting.
