     Why Is the Second Knives Out Film Titled Glass Onion?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the movie isn't called Knives Out 2—it's titled Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.
So why is the sequel called Glass Onion?
They also sing "Looking through the bent-backed tulips /To see how the other half live / Looking through the glass onion."
A "glass onion" is a contradiction: It is multi-layered, but completely transparent.
Just like the mystery at the heart of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.

     Rian Johnson Breaks Down Glass Onion’s “Arrival” Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We’re going to have them be totally new deals every single time,” Johnson says of the films in the Knives Out franchise.
“Poor Kathryn,” says Johnson with a smile.
“Kathryn showed up and she’s like, ‘I’m in a Benoit Blanc mystery and everyone wears fabulous costumes.
I wrote it during lockdown, which is probably part of the reason why it takes place on a Greek island,” Johnson said.
What do you want?’”For more insights on Glass Onion’s arrival scene, check out the video for Johnson’s Notes on a Scene with Vanity Fair.

     Hugh Grant’s ‘Glass Onion’ Cameo Is a Win for the Gays
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Benoit Blanc is canonically married and/or in a long-term romantic relationship with Hugh Grant.
The Hugh Grant cameo in Glass Onion comes about halfway through the film, during a prolonged flashback sequence.
And yet, he’s Hugh Grant, so naturally, he looks fantastic with that pink apron, face full of flour, and emotional support jar of brown sugar.
“Yes, he obviously is,” Johnson responded before he hinted at the Grant cameo.
This man loves mysteries, bubble baths, neckerchiefs, and snuggling up with Hugh Grant at night.

     Rian Johnson Knows the Tech Bro in 'Glass Onion' Looks Very Familiar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The opening gambit of writer-director Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, his second in his series of Agatha Christie–style whodunits, is one of mischief.
“A friend of mine said, ‘Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon,’” Johnson notes.
But Glass Onion is a lot more than that—it’s also a really fun time.
WIRED: One of the things that initially stands out about Glass Onion is that it takes place during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Rian Johnson: As a huge whodunit fan, growing up, so many of the ones I loved were period pieces set in England.
