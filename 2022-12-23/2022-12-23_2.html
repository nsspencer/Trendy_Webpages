     Rian Johnson Breaks Down Glass Onion’s “Arrival” Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We’re going to have them be totally new deals every single time,” Johnson says of the films in the Knives Out franchise.
“Poor Kathryn,” says Johnson with a smile.
“Kathryn showed up and she’s like, ‘I’m in a Benoit Blanc mystery and everyone wears fabulous costumes.
I wrote it during lockdown, which is probably part of the reason why it takes place on a Greek island,” Johnson said.
What do you want?’”For more insights on Glass Onion’s arrival scene, check out the video for Johnson’s Notes on a Scene with Vanity Fair.

     Rian Johnson Knows the Tech Bro in 'Glass Onion' Looks Very Familiar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The opening gambit of writer-director Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, his second in his series of Agatha Christie–style whodunits, is one of mischief.
“A friend of mine said, ‘Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon,’” Johnson notes.
But Glass Onion is a lot more than that—it’s also a really fun time.
WIRED: One of the things that initially stands out about Glass Onion is that it takes place during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Rian Johnson: As a huge whodunit fan, growing up, so many of the ones I loved were period pieces set in England.

     ‘If we run out, we’re screwed’: The making of that shocking ‘Glass Onion’ scene
    </h2>

     Summary: Warning: This story contains spoilers for “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.”Peel back the layers of “Knives Out 2’s” titular glass onion, and what do you get?
In “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” Miles is eager to show off his shiny art collection to his posse of morally corrupt friends after inviting them to a murder-mystery party at his private Mediterranean estate.
Until, of course, it came time to shoot the climactic scene in which Miles’ esteemed guests turn against him and smash his statue garden to smithereens.
She starts by shattering one of the glass statues in his lair — then another, and another.
“They cut just before I go, ‘I’m so f— sorry.’”Company Town Should Netflix’s ‘Glass Onion’ stay in theaters longer?

     'Glass Onion' Symbolism, Explained: Unpacking The Irony Of Miles Bron, The Mona Lisa, And Hydrogen Fuel 'Klear'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As you probably must have figured out (because Benoit Blanc points it out, too), “glass” and “onion” are self-contradictory in nature.
So, Miles loaned it to them, and in exchange, he moved the Mona Lisa from the Louvre to the Glass Onion.
FYI, the (ugly) artistic representation of Miles sits right across the painting of Mona Lisa.
So, despite all his adulation for the Mona Lisa, Bron fails to see his fundamental flaw, while Rian Johnson exposes our preference for instant fame over long-lasting greatness.
Sidenote: the final frame of “Glass Onion” is that of Helen sitting exactly like Mona Lisa.

     SAG Ensemble head-scratcher: ‘Glass Onion’ could shake up important precursor race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Can “Glass Onion” now shake up the important precursor race of Best Film Ensemble at the SAG Awards?
It’s good to remember that the SAG Ensemble nominations only allows for five movies vs. the 10 for the Best Picture Oscar.
Currently, “Glass Onion” is in fourth place among Gold Derby Experts, behind the casts of “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “The Fabelmans” and “Women Talking,” all of which should receive solo SAG Awards bids, as well.
SEE ‘Glass Onion’ can succeed where ‘Knives Out’ failed at the SAG AwardsAn interesting factor aiding “Glass Onion” is how the SAG Awards have frequently included at least one Netflix movie among its nominations, going back to “Beasts of No Nation” in 2015.
PREDICT the 2023 SAG Awards nominees through January 10Make your predictions at Gold Derby now.

     ‘Glass Onion’ Is Actually About Living in the Age of Musk, Ye and Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They travel to the island ostensibly to solve the (fake) murder of Bron himself.
But after Blanc instantly figures out the game, a real murder happens on the island.
Then, a twist: In a flashback, we learn that Brand is already dead, and her murder will soon be reported.
The “Andi Brand” on the island is her twin sister Helen, who has hired Blanc to solve the murder.
Under direct scrutiny from the clever Blanc, though, all of the myths that Bron’s friends and followers build up around him quickly vanish.
