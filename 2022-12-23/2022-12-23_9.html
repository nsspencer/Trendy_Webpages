     One dead in shooting at Mall of America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shooting inside the Nordstrom department store at the Mall of America left one person dead Friday night, according to a law enforcement source.
The mall was briefly put on lockdown around 8 p.m. That was lifted about an hour later, at which point the Mall closed for the night and asked remaining customers to head home.
Police did not immediately confirm the location of the shooting, but Bloomington Mayor Tim Busse said it was inside Nordstrom, one of the mall's original tenants and anchor stores.
Police did not immediately say how many people were involved, whether any arrests have been made or what led up to the shooting.
It's not a first for gunplay inside the state's biggest shopping mall, which last saw a shooting incident in August.
