     French serial killer Charles "The Serpent" Sobhraj​, released from prison in Nepal, says "I feel great"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kathmandu, Nepal — Confessed French serial killer Charles Sobhraj was freed from prison in Nepal on Friday after serving most of his sentence for the murders of American and Canadian backpackers.
The country's Supreme Court had ordered Wednesday that Sobhraj, 78, who was sentenced to life in prison in Nepal, be released because of poor health, good behavior and having already served most of his sentence.
Agence France-Presse reports that Sobhraj was taken to immigration detention and then to Kathmandu airport to be deported to France.
Sobhraj was held for two decades in New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar prison on suspicion of theft but was deported without charge to France in 1997.
Sobhraj is the subject of the 2021 Netflix series "The Serpent," inspired by his 1970's killing spree, starring Tahar Rahim and Jenna Coleman.

     Summary: Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the release of Sobhraj, known as the "bikini killer" in Thailand, and 'The Serpent" for his evasion of police, on Wednesday citing his advanced age and health.
Associates have previously described Sobhraj, 78, as a con artist, a seducer, a robber and a murderer.
France's interior and justice ministries did not respond to Reuters questions about whether Sobhraj might face criminal charges in France.
The statute of limitations for most serious crimes in France is 20 years.

Photograph: Atish Patel/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring his time in jail in Nepal, Sobhraj had raised eyebrows by marrying a Nepalese woman 40 years his junior.
She said she would remain in Nepal and join Sobhraj later, as she still had court cases going on.
Sikawoti, who described the serial killer as “an extraordinary person”, said that now he had been released, Sobhraj intended to “tell his story to the world”.

     Charles Sobhraj: French serial killer 'The Serpent' released from Nepali jail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Charles Sobhraj, the infamous French serial killer who inspired the award-nominated TV series “The Serpent,” walked free from a Nepali prison Friday.
He has been handed over to the immigration department.
The officials at the immigration department informed us that he would be deported to France soon, as early as today,” Ishwari Prasad Pandey, an official at Nepal Central prison told CNN.
He was freed after Nepal’s top court on Wednesday ordered his release on the grounds of his age and health.
In 2014, a Nepali court convicted Sobhraj for the 1975 murder of Canadian tourist Laurent Carrière, handing down a 20-year sentence.
