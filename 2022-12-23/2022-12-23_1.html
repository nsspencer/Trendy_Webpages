     FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to be released on $250 million bail and will live with his parents
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roos proposed strict bail terms, including the $250 million (€235 million) bond — which he said is believed to be the largest federal pretrial bond ever — and house arrest at his parents' home in Palo Alto.
An important reason for allowing bail was that Bankman-Fried, who had been jailed in the Bahamas, agreed to be extradited to the US, Roos said.
Near its end, he was asked by Gorenstein whether he understood he would face arrest and owe $250 million (€235 million) if he chose to flee.
The bail was described as a "personal recognisance bond," meaning the collateral did not need to meet the bail amount.
In a series of interviews before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he never intended to defraud anyone.

     FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried On $250m Bail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former crypto multi-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried will get to spend Christmas with his parents, who are both Stanford Law School professors.
The judge ruled that Bankman-Fried would be freed $250m bail on Thursday, but he would have to remain under strict supervision at his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California.
Meanwhile Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the fraud Bankman-Fried is accused of as among the largest in US history.
The DoJ has charged Bankman-Fried with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Bail conditionsThe charges facing Bankman-Fried carry a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison.

     Sam Bankman-Fried’s $250 Million Bail Doesn’t Mean He Has It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s $250 million bail package is one of the largest in U.S. history, but it doesn’t mean he actually has to put up that kind of money.
At Bankman-Fried’s bail hearing on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, both the prosecution and defense agreed that the former billionaire’s assets have “diminished significantly.” Bankman-Fried has said he may have only $100,000.
The $250 million personal recognizance bond approved by the judge was secured by the equity in Bankman-Fried’s parents home in Palo Alto, California, which is almost certainly not worth anywhere near that amount.
Failing to provide the signatories by the January deadline won’t necessarily see the crypto founder awaiting trial behind bars, however.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein, who approved Bankman-Fried’s bail on Thursday, previously dealt with another high-profile defendant who couldn’t find two people besides his wife and brother to sign a $10 million bond: Bernard Madoff.
