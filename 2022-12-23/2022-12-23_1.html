     'Glass Onion' ending explained: The answer is in the title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Looking through a glass onion” is to seek understanding of complexity when there is none.
Filmmaker Rian Johnson isn’t quite making fun of his audience with his latest movie, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.
Warning: Spoilers for Knives Out: A Glass Onion Mystery below.
NetflixThroughout Glass Onion, the characters in Johnson’s movie refer to the image of a glass onion, and there also happens to be an elaborate glass dome that sits atop Miles’ absurdly expensive home.
Ultimately, the thrill of Glass Onion isn’t the answers to its biggest questions, but how it unmasks them.

     Summary: Glass Onion, the sequel to Knives Out, follows the further adventures of super-sleuth Benoit Blanc.
So instead of real-life murder-solving, he apparently did what all of us did in 2020: play Among Us.
note: This story contains spoilers for Glass Onion.]
Most importantly, Sondheim co-wrote (with Psycho star Anthony Perkins) a murder-mystery movie called The Last of Sheila, which was Rian Johnson’s most direct inspiration for Glass Onion, according to the director himself.
The show ran for 264 episodes and more than a few movies, making Lansbury one of the most recognizable murder-mystery actors of all time.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Within seconds, Blanc solves Bron’s mystery, much to the billionaire’s chagrin.
He’s destroyed his reputation, exposed himself as a murderer and incinerated his house — and the “Mona Lisa” to boot.
From the moment Helen Brand brings her case to Blanc, Bron is the obvious suspect.
Of course, when Bron’s foolishness culminates in the destruction of the “Mona Lisa,” it’s just a movie.
And Twitter may not be the “Mona Lisa” — not by a long shot — but it is the closest thing the world has to a virtual public square.

Whether you’re planning a European vacation, or want new material for your next daydream getaway, the filming locations in Glass Onion are sure to impress.
“So there's different views from each villa, and they lead up to the [Glass Onion] with the best view on top,” Heinrichs added.
Spetses, GreeceJohn Wilson/NETFLIX“We were also not too far from the island of Spetses, where we did shoot as well,” Heinrichs told the publication.
“There was some outdoor stuff for which we shot a few things on location last fall in Connecticut and New York, and then everything inside was built in Serbia,” Heinrichs told the outlet.

     Summary: The opening gambit of writer-director Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, his second in his series of Agatha Christie–style whodunits, is one of mischief.
“A friend of mine said, ‘Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon,’” Johnson notes.
But Glass Onion is a lot more than that—it’s also a really fun time.
WIRED: One of the things that initially stands out about Glass Onion is that it takes place during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Rian Johnson: As a huge whodunit fan, growing up, so many of the ones I loved were period pieces set in England.

Here are all the cameos you might have missed in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.
We will assume that Lansbury’s experience playing amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher helped her become an Among Us champ.
In the original Knives Out, he voiced a character named Detective Hardock in an in-universe TV series watched by Ana De Armas’ character.

What might help me understand what Renner would put into a sauce with his name and face on it?

     Summary: If we've learned anything from this nonsensical saga, it's that Elon Musk might not be the genius he's spent years stylizing himself into.
Bron faxes nonsensical business ideas to his employees, similar to how Musk governs Twitter — even firing people — via half-considered tweets.
Bron sets impossible deadlines for tasks he doesn't even understand, which is sort of like Musk and his strange code reviews.
But what's more important is what the film has to say about people like Bron and Musk.
Similarly, Musk bullied his way into power and formed his massive wealth off valuations of his companies.
