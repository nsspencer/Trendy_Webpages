     Summary: Tory Lanez found guilty of shooting Megan Thee StallionEnlarge this image toggle caption Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for BMI Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for BMIThe singer and rapper Tory Lanez has been found guilty of assaulting the rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
Megan Pete was one of the first names called for the prosecution, and she gave her account of the assault, pointing to Peterson in court as the shooter.
Harris' testimony was highly anticipated as potential corroboration for Pete's account of the night, which pegged Peterson as the shooter.
(When asked by defense attorney Mgdesyan in open court about accepting any bribe from Peterson, Harris replied, "No, and I would actually like to make that very clear.")
One fact that was unequivocal, though; Megan Pete was shot.

     Summary: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — In a courtroom that turned chaotic after a trial that seethed with tension, a Los Angeles jury on Friday found rapper Tory Lanez guilty of three felonies in the 2020 shooting of hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion.
Three young children, including Lanez' son, sat in the front row of the courtroom while the verdict was read.
Supporters of Megan and Lanez gathered outside the courthouse for most of the eight-day trial and crowded the courtroom and the hallway.
The attorney, George Mgdesyan, argued Megan created a more sympathetic narrative by pinning the shooting on Lanez.

     Tory Lanez found guilty in 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A Los Angeles jury on Friday found rapper and singer Tory Lanez guilty of three charges related to the July 2020 shooting of fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion in the Hollywood Hills, the Los Angeles County District Attorney told CNN.
Megan accused Lanez of shooting her in the foot after she exited a vehicle they had been riding in following an argument.
In her testimony during the trial, Megan said things were tense in the car between her, Lanez, and her former friend and assistant, Kelsey Harris, Billboard Magazine reports.
But Billboard reports Megan was uncomfortable doing so because she knew Harris had a crush on the Canadian singer and rapper.
Lanez was taken out of the courtroom by bailiffs in handcuffs after the verdict was read, according to CNN affiliate KCBS.
