Whether you’re planning a European vacation, or want new material for your next daydream getaway, the filming locations in Glass Onion are sure to impress.
“So there's different views from each villa, and they lead up to the [Glass Onion] with the best view on top,” Heinrichs added.
Spetses, GreeceJohn Wilson/NETFLIX“We were also not too far from the island of Spetses, where we did shoot as well,” Heinrichs told the publication.
“There was some outdoor stuff for which we shot a few things on location last fall in Connecticut and New York, and then everything inside was built in Serbia,” Heinrichs told the outlet.

     Rian Johnson Breaks Down Glass Onion’s “Arrival” Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We’re going to have them be totally new deals every single time,” Johnson says of the films in the Knives Out franchise.
“Poor Kathryn,” says Johnson with a smile.
“Kathryn showed up and she’s like, ‘I’m in a Benoit Blanc mystery and everyone wears fabulous costumes.
I wrote it during lockdown, which is probably part of the reason why it takes place on a Greek island,” Johnson said.

     Hugh Grant’s ‘Glass Onion’ Cameo Is a Win for the Gays
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Benoit Blanc is canonically married and/or in a long-term romantic relationship with Hugh Grant.
The Hugh Grant cameo in Glass Onion comes about halfway through the film, during a prolonged flashback sequence.
And yet, he’s Hugh Grant, so naturally, he looks fantastic with that pink apron, face full of flour, and emotional support jar of brown sugar.
“Yes, he obviously is,” Johnson responded before he hinted at the Grant cameo.
This man loves mysteries, bubble baths, neckerchiefs, and snuggling up with Hugh Grant at night.

     Rian Johnson Knows the Tech Bro in 'Glass Onion' Looks Very Familiar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The opening gambit of writer-director Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, his second in his series of Agatha Christie–style whodunits, is one of mischief.
“A friend of mine said, ‘Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon,’” Johnson notes.
But Glass Onion is a lot more than that—it’s also a really fun time.
WIRED: One of the things that initially stands out about Glass Onion is that it takes place during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Rian Johnson: As a huge whodunit fan, growing up, so many of the ones I loved were period pieces set in England.

     ‘Glass Onion’ fun murder mystery offering
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” Grade B+: This entertaining whodunit was the kind of offering that most often has been the bailiwick of Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple.
This follow-up to the 2019 streaming service production “Knives Out” has Blanc being accidentally invited to a murder mystery weekend being held on a remote island by billionaire Miles Bron (Ed Norton).
“Glass Onion” can be enjoyed simply for watching Blanc solve the case.
Either way, there is no mystery as to why this latest offering from writer/director Rian Johnson works so well.
“Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” is a standard murder mystery elevated by a very talented cast.
