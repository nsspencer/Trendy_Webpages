     Tory Lanez found guilty in 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A Los Angeles jury on Friday found rapper and singer Tory Lanez guilty of three charges related to the July 2020 shooting of fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion in the Hollywood Hills, the Los Angeles County District Attorney told CNN.
Megan accused Lanez of shooting her in the foot after she exited a vehicle they had been riding in following an argument.
In her testimony during the trial, Megan said things were tense in the car between her, Lanez, and her former friend and assistant, Kelsey Harris, Billboard Magazine reports.
But Billboard reports Megan was uncomfortable doing so because she knew Harris had a crush on the Canadian singer and rapper.
Lanez was taken out of the courtroom by bailiffs in handcuffs after the verdict was read, according to CNN affiliate KCBS.

     Summary: Tory Lanez found guilty of shooting Megan Thee StallionEnlarge this image toggle caption Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for BMI Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for BMIThe singer and rapper Tory Lanez has been found guilty of assaulting the rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
Megan Pete was one of the first names called for the prosecution, and she gave her account of the assault, pointing to Peterson in court as the shooter.
Harris' testimony was highly anticipated as potential corroboration for Pete's account of the night, which pegged Peterson as the shooter.
(When asked by defense attorney Mgdesyan in open court about accepting any bribe from Peterson, Harris replied, "No, and I would actually like to make that very clear.")
One fact that was unequivocal, though; Megan Pete was shot.

     Tory Lanez Found Guilty in Megan Thee Stallion Shooting Trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rapper Tory Lanez was found guilty in the Los Angeles trial over the 2020 roadside shooting of Megan Thee Stallion, the jury announced Friday.
“I want to start by highlighting the bravery of Megan Pete,” Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement.
Women, especially Black women, are afraid to report crimes like assault and sexual violence because they are too often not believed.
This trial, for the second time this month, highlighted the numerous ways that our society must do better for women.
The trial began Dec. 12 with testimony from Pete herself, who claimed Peterson had shot her in an emotional retelling of the roadside assault.

     LA jury convicts Tory Lanez of shooting Megan Thee Stallion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — In a courtroom that turned chaotic after a trial that seethed with tension, a Los Angeles jury on Friday found rapper Tory Lanez guilty of three felonies in the 2020 shooting of hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion.
Three young children, including Lanez' son, sat in the front row of the courtroom while the verdict was read.
Supporters of Megan and Lanez gathered outside the courthouse for most of the eight-day trial and crowded the courtroom and the hallway.
The attorney, George Mgdesyan, argued Megan created a more sympathetic narrative by pinning the shooting on Lanez.
Megan Thee Stallion was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her prominence has surged since.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A jury in Los Angeles found rapper Tory Lanez guilty on all three charges in the shooting of hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion on July 12, 2020 in the Hollywood Hills.
Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón in a statement recognized the "bravery" of Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, pointing to some of the commentary around the case.
"Women, especially Black women, are afraid to report crimes like assault and sexual violence because they are too often not believed," Gascón said in his Friday statement.
"It's ridiculous that some people think the simple phrase 'Protect Black Women' is controversial.
Megan Thee Stallion whose legal name is Megan Pete makes her way from the Hall of Justice to the courthouse to testify in the trial of Rapper Tory Lanez for allegedly shooting her on Dec. 13, 2022, in Los Angeles.
