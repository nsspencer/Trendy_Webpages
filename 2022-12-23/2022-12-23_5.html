AdvertisingThe NORAD Santa Tracker, now in its 67th year has been recognized as one of the Department of Defense‚Äôs most successful outreach programs.
The NORAD Santa Tracker has had an internet presence since 1997 and now includes an educational website for children, noradsanta.org, an app and corresponding social media channels.
