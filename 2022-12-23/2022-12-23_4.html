     Which 2 NFL Teams Could Have Been Calling About Rob Gronkowski?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his final season with the Tampa Buccaneers, Gronkowski had 55 catches for 802 yards and eight touchdowns.
Being that Gronkowski hasn‚Äôt played in a game since the 2021 playoffs, how much value could he truly bring to a team this season?
If the Green Bay Packers made a playoff push, they could be a team to call Gronkowski.
Their best tight end is Robert Tonyan, but he hasn‚Äôt been targeted as much as he‚Äôs been in years past.
With their receiving weapons thin, and a rookie tight end to boot, the Giants could also use Gronkowski‚Äôs services for the postseason.

     Rob Gronkowski Discussed Second Unretirement With Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Rob Gronkowski retired for a second time, many suspected the June transaction would also lead to another temporary step away from football.
Brady‚Äôs QBR figure is his worst in the 17-season QBR era, and his timing with wideouts ‚Äî particularly Mike Evans ‚Äî has been off.
Gronk‚Äôs first unretirement, which keyed a 2020 trade with the Patriots, played a significant role in the Bucs claiming their second Super Bowl title two years ago.
Although longtime Bucs tight end Cameron Brate remains on the roster, a scary concussion scene paused his season.
Rookie Cade Otton leads Bucs tight ends with 357 receiving yards.

     Summary: TAMPA ‚Äï Saying he was ‚Äúbored‚Äù not playing football, retired tight end Rob Gronkowski contacted the Bucs last month about a possible return to the team.
He agreed to rejoin Brady in Tampa Bay in 2020, and the Bucs traded for his rights from New England.
The Bucs drafted two tight ends, Washington‚Äôs Cade Otton (37 receptions, 357 yards, 2 TDs) and Minnesota‚Äôs Ko Kieft (seven receptions, 80 yards, 1 TD).
They‚Äôre doing very well.‚ÄùSo Gronkowski will remain retired ‚Äï for now ‚Äï though the Bucs seemingly will always keep the door open for him.
