According to Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles, Gronkowski was not so sure a month ago.
When it‚Äôs just a discussion, I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time.‚ÄùThere were several conversations between Gronkowski and the Bucs, but nothing came of them.
Gronkowski still has not totally shut the door on playing in the NFL again.

     Summary: By Colin Gallant ¬∑ 2 min readRob Gronkowski and Tom Brady have been one of the most electric duos in football whenever they‚Äôve played together, and a Gronk-Brady reunion was gaining serious traction just a few weeks ago.
The 33-year-old said he was ‚Äúbored‚Äù not playing football, and the retired tight end reportedly contacted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about a possible return to the team.
The Bucs had several conversations with Gronk around Thanksgiving about the possibility of reuniting him with Brady to help the struggling squad secure a playoff berth.
I‚Äôm kinda bored üòê‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Rob Gronkowski (@RobGronkowski) December 21, 2022Ultimately, Gronkowski decided to stay retired, despite the fact he had been working out and getting back into game shape.
Although it looks like a potential Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady reunion will have to wait, it seems to be a door that will never fully close if the four-time Super Bowl champion is serious about coming out of retirement for the second time in his fantastic career.

     Rob Gronkowski Discussed Second Unretirement With Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Rob Gronkowski retired for a second time, many suspected the June transaction would also lead to another temporary step away from football.
Brady‚Äôs QBR figure is his worst in the 17-season QBR era, and his timing with wideouts ‚Äî particularly Mike Evans ‚Äî has been off.
Gronk‚Äôs first unretirement, which keyed a 2020 trade with the Patriots, played a significant role in the Bucs claiming their second Super Bowl title two years ago.
Although longtime Bucs tight end Cameron Brate remains on the roster, a scary concussion scene paused his season.
Rookie Cade Otton leads Bucs tight ends with 357 receiving yards.
