     Ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison says she and Sam Bankman-Fried misled FTX investors in court plea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison said she and FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried misled lenders about how much the company was borrowing from the cryptocurrency exchange.
Ellison revealed her actions in a Dec. 19 plea hearing in a Manhattan federal court, Bloomberg reported.
Bankman-Fried, 30, the disgraced crypto exchange founder , faces multiple charges from the Southern District of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The charges include conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and commit campaign finance violations.
Ellison said that "if Alameda’s FTX accounts had significant negative balances in any particular currency, it meant that Alameda was borrowing funds that FTX’s customers had deposited on the exchange," the Bloomberg report said.

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange FTX, will return to Stanford’s campus under house arrest in his parents’ Stanford residence, as first reported by The SF Standard.
Neither professor will be teaching classes at Stanford Law School next quarter.
In anticipation of his arrival, Stanford has increased security and closed some private university streets around the residence, according to University spokesperson Dee Mostofi.
The conditions of Bankman-Fried’s house arrest include remaining at his parents’ Stanford residence, wearing an ankle monitor, undergoing regular mental health evaluations and a $1000 cap on credit withdrawals, according to court filings.
“[His parents] request privacy for their family during this time,” their spokesperson wrote.

     Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX execs received billions in hidden loans, ex-Alameda CEO says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives received billions of dollars in secret loans from the crypto mogul’s Alameda Research, the hedge fund’s former chief told a judge when she pleaded guilty to her role in the exchange’s collapse.
Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang both pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors as part of their plea agreements.
Bankman-Fried has acknowledged risk-management failures at FTX but said he does not believe he has criminal liability.
A flurry of customer withdrawals in early November amid concerns about commingling of FTX funds with Alameda prompted FTX to declare bankruptcy on Nov. 11.
Bankman-Fried was arrested in capital Nassau on Dec. 12 and arrived in the United States on Wednesday after consenting to extradition.

     Sam Bankman-Fried’s troubles deepen as both FTX co-founder and Alameda Research CEO take plea deals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried for weeks seemed to be trying to get ahead of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s widely expected cooperation deal with prosecutors, subtly casting blame on her for FTX’s collapse.
Wang was far more integral to FTX than Ellison, making him a more dangerous witness for Bankman-Fried.
Following his first US court appearance Thursday after being extradited from the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond.
But the government claims Alameda and FTX were under Bankman-Fried’s control and set up from the beginning to defraud customers and investors.
Bankman-Fried owned 90% of Alameda, compared to Wang’s 10% and was the trading firm’s chief executive officer until late last year, when he appointed Ellison.

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on a $250 million bond as he faces the fallout of FTX's collapse.
But as Thursday's events showed, the economics of bail for rich people can get very complicated — and very bespoke — very quickly.
If he doesn't, some unknown group of people, to be finalized by Jan. 5, will be on the hook for $250 million.
That will be forfeited if Bankman-Fried skips bail.
Bankman-Fried is going to have to find other people, collectively worth $250 million or more, who can guarantee his bail.

     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried leaving Manhattan Federal Court on Dec. 22 Matthew McDermottWang, who co-founded FTX in 2019 with Bankman-Fried and Nishad Singh, owned the other 10 percent of the company.
Per the SEC’s complaint, Bankman-Fried gave Alameda special privileges on the FTX platform, including a “virtually unlimited ‘line of credit’” funded by the latter’s customers.
Bankman-Fried, Ellison, and Wang were all aware that FTX investors became more vulnerable to crypto markets as Alameda increased its borrowing backed by FTT collateral.
Twitter/@compound248The fraud allegedly continued through the final days before FTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11.
The system finally caved in on Nov. 9, after crypto exchange Binance backed out of a bid to acquire FTX and customers withdrew $5 billion from the platform.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareAfter the demise of his FTX crypto empire in November, Sam Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a hapless but well-intentioned chief executive who made a series of calamitous mistakes, but never knowingly committed fraud.
Even though FTX had allegedly already given Alameda billions of dollars in customer funds, Bankman-Fried began to give Alameda even more money to cover those positions, the SEC alleged.
Additionally, as the majority owner of Alameda, Bankman-Fried may have had more insight into the state of its affairs than he is letting on.
After initially resisting extradition, Bankman-Fried was returned to the US and was released on a $250 million bail package.
AdvertisementAt a court hearing on Dec. 19, Ellison said she and Bankman-Fried knowingly misled lenders about how much Alameda was borrowing from FTX.
