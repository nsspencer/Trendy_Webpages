     Yikes! Hackers Had Access to LastPass Users' Password Vaults
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With that data in hand, the attackers can potentially access users’ entire collection of passwords and other data stored with LastPass if they can find a way to guess a user’s master password.
LastPass says it should not have access to users’ master passwords.
That comforting reassurance doesn’t necessarily apply though for users with weaker master passwords.
Affected LastPass customers may also find themselves awash in annoying phishing attempts trying to trick them into unwittingly handing over their keys to the kingdom.
At the time, the company cryptically said that the attacker was able to access “certain elements” of “customers’ information,” without providing more detail.

     Summary: The logo for online password manager service LastPass is reflected on the internal discs of a hard drive.
(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Password manager company LastPass gave an update of its security incident from August, which prompted security researchers to tell admins that they really need to take steps to protect their environments.
Dan Benjamin, co-founder and CEO at Dig Security, said the series of LastPass breaches point to the critical need to prioritize cloud data security and implement stronger security measures to protect customer data.
Benjamin said the legacy approach to data security has proven ineffective in modern IT environments time and time again.
“The latest LastPass breach originated in the cloud — no endpoint or on-prem device could have detected the incident,” Benjamin said.

     Customer details compromised in LastPass breaches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The data breaches LastPass suffered in August and November 2022 resulted in confidential customer information being compromised.
In a statement, LastPass explained that the August breach saw a malicious actor steal source code and technical information from LastPass’ development environment that was then used to target an employee.
This allowed the hacker to gain access to credentials and keys, which they then used to access LastPass’ third-party cloud storage service in November 2022.
As LastPass does not know, store or maintain user master passwords, this reduces the chance of compromise.
LastPass warned its customers to be wary of social engineering or phishing attacks in the wake of the attack.

     LastPass: Hackers accessed and copied customers’ password vaults
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LastPass: Hackers accessed and copied customers’ password vaultsPassword manager LastPass announced on Thursday that hackers had accessed and copied a backup of data including customers’ passwords in an encrypted format.
“If you reuse your master password and that password was ever compromised, a threat actor may use dumps of compromised credentials that are already available on the Internet to attempt to access your account,” LastPass CEO Karim Toubba explained, describing so-called credential stuffing attacks.
Toubba wrote: “The master password is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by LastPass.
The blog post added that any customers which use LastPass’ default settings, including using a unique master password consisting of a minimum of twelve characters, do not need to take any actions.
In the meantime, our services are running normally, and we continue to operate in a state of heightened alert.

     Summary: LastPass hacker stole customer password vaults Getty ImagesLastPass CEO, Karim Toubba, has confirmed that a threat actor has stolen customer password vaults.
At that time, Toubba said there was no evidence of customer data or password vaults being accessed.
This data is encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption and requires the user's master password to decrypt.
Change your LastPass master password nowHow this impacts you as a LastPass customer really depends upon how strong your master password is.
I would have to agree, plus changing that master password to something much stronger.

     LastPass attacker stole password vault data, showing Web2's limitations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Password management service LastPass was hacked in August 2022, and the attacker stole users’ encrypted passwords, according to a Dec. 23 statement from the company.
This means that the attacker may be able to crack some website passwords of LastPass users through brute force guessing.
Luckily, the vaults are encrypted with a Master Password, which should prevent the attacker from being able to read them.
But these also rely on cloud services to store encrypted password vaults.
If an attacker manages to obtain the password vault from the password manager service, they may be able to crack the vault and obtain all of the user’s passwords.
