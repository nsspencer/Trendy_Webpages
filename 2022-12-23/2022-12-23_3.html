     How Sam Bankman-Fried made his $250M bail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on a $250 million bond as he faces the fallout of FTX's collapse.
But as Thursday's events showed, the economics of bail for rich people can get very complicated — and very bespoke — very quickly.
If he doesn't, some unknown group of people, to be finalized by Jan. 5, will be on the hook for $250 million.
That will be forfeited if Bankman-Fried skips bail.
Bankman-Fried is going to have to find other people, collectively worth $250 million or more, who can guarantee his bail.

     Sam Bankman-Fried to be under house arrest on Stanford campus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange FTX, will return to Stanford’s campus under house arrest in his parents’ Stanford residence, as first reported by The SF Standard.
In anticipation of his arrival, Stanford has increased security and closed some private university streets around the residence, according to University spokesperson Dee Mostofi.
“It’s a pathetic look on Stanford’s part when someone visiting campus sees all of the security around his house, wonders why they’re there, and finds out that a man accused of defrauding $1.8 billion is under house arrest in his childhood home,” wrote Alexander Worley ’25.
The conditions of Bankman-Fried’s house arrest include remaining at his parents’ Stanford residence, wearing an ankle monitor, undergoing regular mental health evaluations and a $1000 cap on credit withdrawals, according to court filings.
“[His parents] request privacy for their family during this time,” their spokesperson wrote.

     Summary: Why Hanukkah Starts On A Different Day Every Year?
Hanukkah, also known as "Chanukah" and commonly known as "the Festival of Lights," is an eight-day holiday celebrated worldwide by Jewish population.
The Origin Of Word 'Hanukkah' The word itself derives from the holiday's purpose: the rededication of the Holy Temple.
Hanukkah begins on the eve of Kislev 25, which falls in late November or early December on the Hebrew calendar.
This year, Hanukkah runs from Dec. 18 to Dec. 26 — several weeks later than in 2021, when the festival lasted from Nov. 28 to Dec. 6.

     Caroline Ellison Admits She And Bankman-Fried Conspired To Deceive FTX Customers And Investors, Reports Say

     Summary: ToplineCaroline Ellison, a longtime confidante of befallen crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, claims she and the former billionaire FTX founder agreed to deceive the exchange’s investors, lenders and customers, according to court documents released Friday—a damning accusation as Bankman-Fried faces a slew of criminal charges tied to allegations he stole billions of dollars from FTX customers.
Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, departs from court in New ... [+] York, US, on Thursday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission separately filed fraud charges against Ellison and Wang on Wednesday, accusing Ellison of “manipulating” the price of FTX’s native cryptocurrency, FTT, as directed by Bankman-Fried.
Federal prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of fraudulently using FTX investors’ funds to pay Alameda Research’s expenses, and misleading Alameda’s lenders and FTX’s investors about the two firms’ financial condition.

     Sam Bankman-Fried’s troubles deepen as both FTX co-founder and Alameda Research CEO take plea deals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried for weeks seemed to be trying to get ahead of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s widely expected cooperation deal with prosecutors, subtly casting blame on her for FTX’s collapse.
Wang was far more integral to FTX than Ellison, making him a more dangerous witness for Bankman-Fried.
Following his first US court appearance Thursday after being extradited from the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond.
But the government claims Alameda and FTX were under Bankman-Fried’s control and set up from the beginning to defraud customers and investors.
Bankman-Fried owned 90% of Alameda, compared to Wang’s 10% and was the trading firm’s chief executive officer until late last year, when he appointed Ellison.

Roos said Bankman-Fried carried out a "fraud of epic proportions" that led to the loss of billions of dollars of customer and investor funds.
Bankman-Fried has acknowledged risk-management failures at FTX but said he does not believe he has criminal liability.
A flurry of customer withdrawals in early November amid concerns about commingling of FTX funds with Alameda prompted FTX to declare bankruptcy on Nov. 11.
Bankman-Fried was arrested in capital Nassau on Dec. 12 and arrived in the United States on Wednesday after consenting to extradition.

     Summary: There is a second way to acquire a bail bond.
A defendant, or someone on their behalf, may pledge collateral in the full amount of the bond.
Then, if the defendant fails to appear in court, the pledged collateral is forfeit to the court.
So, in Bankman-Fried’s case, that would mean he would need a benefactor to step up and pledge property worth $250 million to get the bond.
But that did not happen either.
