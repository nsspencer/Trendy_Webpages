     Shooting at Mall of America leaves 19-year-old man dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 19-year-old man is dead after a verbal altercation became violent in a Nordstrom branch at the Mall of America on Friday evening.
The officer tried to perform life-saving measures on the victim but the man ultimately succumbed to his injuries, authorities said.
The Mall of America in Minnesota was put on lockdown after the shooting, the Bloomington Police Department said, but was reopened a little over an hour later shortly after 9 p.m.
After reviewing surveillance footage of the incident, authorities believe a verbal altercation began between two groups of people before it turned physical.
During the conflict a man allegedly pulled out a gun and shot the 19-year-old, Hodges said.
