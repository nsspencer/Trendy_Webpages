     1 dead in Mall of America shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 19-year-old man is dead after a verbal altercation became violent in a Nordstrom branch at the Mall of America on Friday evening.
Bloomington Police Chief Booker Hodges said in a press conference late Friday evening that at approximately 7:50 p.m., an officer heard gunshots near the Nordstrom at the mall.
The Mall of America in Minnesota was put on lockdown after the shooting, the Bloomington Police Department said, but was reopened a little over an hour later shortly after 9 p.m.
After reviewing surveillance footage of the incident, authorities believe a verbal altercation began between two groups of people before it turned physical.
“This is before Christmas, and now they’re having to bury one of their loved ones.”The Nordstrom will remain closed on Saturday but the Mall of America will open as usual.
