     U.S. deep freeze disrupts travel and cuts power to 1.5 million ahead of holiday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a column of bitter cold that stretched from Texas to Montana starting to march eastward, more than 240 million people were under weather advisories on Friday, the National Weather Service said.
About 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses were without power on Friday, according to tracking site Poweroutage.us.
About 187,000 customers were without power in North Carolina alone, where strong winds have hampered restoration efforts.
In Maine, with about a tenth of North Carolina's population, power was out to more than 114,000 customers Friday afternoon.
Severe winds, ice and snow also upended commercial air traffic during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

     Gigantic US winter storm leaves millions without power and cancels holiday plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The storm, estimated to be 2,000 miles wide, has produced driving snow and plummeting temperatures, knocking out power from Texas to Maine.
Officials ordered cars off the roads as US forecasters warned of “potentially crippling impacts across central and eastern” parts of the country.
The arrival of the artic blast produced widespread disruption to utilities, with more than 1.5m households estimated to be without power.
In Tennessee, power authorities asked customers to reduce power usage “as much as possible without reducing safety” after localized sharp drops in voltage and intermittent power outages were recorded.
The weather service’s map “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” forecasters said.
