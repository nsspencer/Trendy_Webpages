     Mayor Adams’ whereabouts unknown as NYC experiences severe weather and flooding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams, did not reveal his current location, but said he will return Saturday..“The mayor is still in touch with everybody on the ground,” Levy told Gothamist.
“He is coordinating all the city’s responses.”Levy said the mayor conducted a conference call this morning with city officials.
His absence comes as parts of Queens experience severe coastal flooding and residents were ordered to seek higher ground Friday morning.
Temperatures are expected to drop precipitously to the teens in the evening, potentially causing black ice conditions on city streets.
His absence is a contrast to earlier this year when the mayor traveled to all five boroughs during the first major snowstorm in January.

     Volatile weather creates accessibility issues for NYC transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Volatile weather creates accessibility issues for NYC transitThe heavy rain, high-speed winds and dropping temperatures have made reliable train service less accessible to some New Yorkers.
Dustin Jones is a Bronx resident who says he has no access to train service at the Burnside Avenue station on Jerome Avenue in Mount Hope due to being in a wheelchair.
The federal government is on track to assist in upgrades to four subway stations in New York City to improve transit accessibility for all New Yorkers – Burnside Avenue is one of those stations.
The funding will go to make essential upgrades and improve accessibility at the Burnside Avenue station in the Bronx and at the Myrtle, Norwood, and Avenue I subway stations in Brooklyn.
It’s slippery – why would you want to take a chance and carry a stroller up the stairs in weather like this?
