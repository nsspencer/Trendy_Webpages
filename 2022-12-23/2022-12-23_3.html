    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 19-year-old man is dead after a verbal altercation became violent in a Nordstrom branch at the Mall of America on Friday evening.
Bloomington Police Chief Booker Hodges said in a press conference late Friday evening that at approximately 7:50 p.m., an officer heard gunshots near the Nordstrom at the mall.
The officer tried to perform life-saving measures on the victim but the man ultimately succumbed to his injuries, authorities said.
The Mall of America in Minnesota was put on lockdown after the shooting, the Bloomington Police Department said, but was reopened a little over an hour later shortly after 9 p.m.
“This is before Christmas, and now they’re having to bury one of their loved ones.”The Nordstrom will remain closed on Saturday but the Mall of America will open as usual.

     Police: 19-year-old killed in shooting at Mall of America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BLOOMINGTON, Minn. — (AP) — A teenager was killed during a shooting at the Mall of America on Friday that sent frightened customers at the nation’s largest shopping center racing into a lockdown just before the holiday weekend, police said.
"We’re going to lock you up with them.”The mall is expected to reopen Saturday but the Nordstrom store will remain closed, Hodges said.
Some videos show shoppers running for cover after a loud bang is heard.
“Of course we wanted to come early and do some Christmas shopping,” Hefty said.
Pat Hanlon, the team’s executive vice president of communications, said he believes some players were in the mall at the time of the shooting.
