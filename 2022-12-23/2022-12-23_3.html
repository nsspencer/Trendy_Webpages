     Volatile weather creates accessibility issues for NYC transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Volatile weather creates accessibility issues for NYC transitThe heavy rain, high-speed winds and dropping temperatures have made reliable train service less accessible to some New Yorkers.
Dustin Jones is a Bronx resident who says he has no access to train service at the Burnside Avenue station on Jerome Avenue in Mount Hope due to being in a wheelchair.
The federal government is on track to assist in upgrades to four subway stations in New York City to improve transit accessibility for all New Yorkers – Burnside Avenue is one of those stations.
The funding will go to make essential upgrades and improve accessibility at the Burnside Avenue station in the Bronx and at the Myrtle, Norwood, and Avenue I subway stations in Brooklyn.
It’s slippery – why would you want to take a chance and carry a stroller up the stairs in weather like this?

     Gigantic US winter storm leaves millions without power and cancels holiday plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The storm, estimated to be 2,000 miles wide, has produced driving snow and plummeting temperatures, knocking out power from Texas to Maine.
Officials ordered cars off the roads as US forecasters warned of “potentially crippling impacts across central and eastern” parts of the country.
The arrival of the artic blast produced widespread disruption to utilities, with more than 1.5m households estimated to be without power.
In Tennessee, power authorities asked customers to reduce power usage “as much as possible without reducing safety” after localized sharp drops in voltage and intermittent power outages were recorded.
The weather service’s map “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” forecasters said.

     Summary: More than one million customers in the US are experiencing power outages amid the winter weather and frigid temperatures, according to the website PowerOutage.US.
John Normile/Getty Images Snow collects on a bison at Longfield Farm in Goshen, Kentucky, on December 23.
A winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday.
A winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST.
One of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time.
