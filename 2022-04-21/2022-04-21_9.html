     Summary: Cities around the U.S. and world have already held, or will hold, events before the end of April to commemorate Earth Day, which is officially Friday.
But before celebrating environmental awareness with various festivals, people had to recall the disaster that motivated the creation of Earth Day itself.
On Jan. 28, 1969, a massive oil spill started in the Pacific Ocean near Santa Barbara, California.
Over the next five years, multiple lawsuits were filed against Union Oil to help pay for the damages.
After seeing the damage from an airplane, Sen. Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin and environmental advocate Denis Allen Hayes were inspired to create Earth Day.
