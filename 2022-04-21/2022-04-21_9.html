     Photos from Highlights of Golden State Warriors vs. Denver Nuggets in NBA first-round playoffs Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry came off the bench for the third consecutive game, the team announced Thursday just before tip-off for Game 3 of their first-round series against the Denver Nuggets.
If Golden State has its way, there will be more dominance from its three-guard lineup featuring Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole.
A win Thursday night would just about sew up the series: No NBA team has ever lost a 3-0 series lead, and these Warriors have looked dominant over the first two games.
In his eighth career playoff run, this is the first time Curry has started off the bench in consecutive postseason games.

     Preview: Jokic and the Nuggets look to reset at home for Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors will battle it out at Ball Arena in Game 3 tonight.
They dominated the third quarter in Game 2, outscoring Denver by 14, so look for a different intensity out of this group in the second half.
If Golden State collapses the paint on drives, then attack the basket and drive and kick.
Tire them out on the offensive end because if the Nuggets can increase the pace on offense, the altitude might slow Golden State down on their end.
Never stay stagnant on the perimeter or else Golden State can preserve their energy on offense.

     Jeff Green makes NBA history while holding the Nuggets' "ship" together
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Longtime veteran Jeff Green got into Barton’s face and then turned his attention to Cousins only moments later.
In Game 1, Green became the first player in league history to play for eight different playoff teams in his career.
Before the Nuggets took on the Warriors in Game 1, Green was tied with James Edwards and Nazr Mohammed for most teams ever represented in the playoffs.
His production stayed consistent — double-figure scoring for five of his last six teams — and Green quickly carved a role as one of the team’s elder voices.
Via cuts through the lane or off-ball screens to free up Denver’s shooters, Green vowed to put his imprint on this series.

     Denver Nuggets: Bones Hyland and Will Barton are X-factors against the Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)After the first two games against the Golden State Warriors, it’s clear for the Denver Nuggets that the playoffs might end early.
But if they are to put up a fight in this series, Bones Hyland and Will Barton need to step up in a big way.
The impact of a Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.-less roster showed how much of a struggle offensively the Denver Nuggets are having compared to their last opening-round series.
The Denver Nuggets will need a Herculean effort to match Golden State pound for pound in scoring.
Alongside Barton, The rookie Bones Hyland also can be critical for the Nuggets coming off the bench.
