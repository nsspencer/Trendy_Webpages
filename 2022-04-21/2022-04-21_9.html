     Steven Stayner's Kids: Where Are Ashley and Steven Jr. Now?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His family was happy to have him back, but things were different.
Steven had become a famous figure, and not everyone liked all the attention he was getting.
Regardless, he went on to start a family, and while he probably wanted nothing more than to live a quiet life with his kids outside the spotlight, the Stayner family story was far from over.
But before we get into that, let’s get to know Steven’s two kids: Ashley and Steven Stayner Jr., who are both featured in the documentary.

     Summary: A real American horror story indeedEpisode 3 is all about Cary Stayner and this is when the story turns even darker.
When you see pictures of Cary Stayner, he might look moody.
But Cary Stayner seems to have been cut from a very different cloth than Steven Stayner.
Ten years after the TV series about his brother Steven Stayner was aired on TV to record-breaking ratings.
For the record, Steven Stayner died in a hit-and-run accident when he was just 24 years old.

     Summary: Watch : The Truth Behind Our Obsession With True Crime StoriesWhen 14-year-old Steven Stayner turned up at a police station, more than seven years after he was kidnapped while walking home from school, it felt like a miracle.
But as Kay also said that night, "We expected him to come back.
Added Steven's father, Del Stayner, "I never stopped looking, every time I saw a crowd on TV or a picture of a lot of people in a magazine.
I always looked very closely in hopes of spotting Steven."
The parents of five, who had kept all the presents their son never got to open after going missing a few weeks before Christmas in 1972, ultimately got their wish thanks to Steven's bravery.

     Summary: His mother, Kay, had been late to pick him up at school, and instead of walking safely home, he vanished.
Then, after Parnell kidnapped 5-year-old Timothy White, Stayner waited until Parnell was gone one night to break out and help White avoid his same fate.
Without Stayner’s perspective, though, we’re mostly left to guess about what it was like being thrust into the spotlight as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.
The two-part series, in which Stayner himself played a cop involved in the rescue, was watched by 40 million Americans.
And in the background of all this was Stayner’s older brother, Cary.

     Steven Stayner's Brother Cary Stayner Is Still in Prison

     Summary: The new three-part Hulu docuseries Captive Audience explores the tragic story of the Stayner family — specifically the fraught lives of their two sons, Steven Stayner and Cary Stayner.
Specifically, the media scrutiny seemed to affect his older brother Cary, who clashed with his brother after his return.
And in 1999, the Stayner family was back in the news — but this time, for a less than positive reason.
Four hikers visiting Yosemite National Park had been brutally murdered, and Cary Stayner had confessed to the crimes.

     Kidnapping Survivor Steven Stayner 'Captive Audience' Hulu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Stayner's kidnapping was the inspiration for the TV movie "I Know My First Name is Steven."
Stayner’s kidnapping case inspired the much-watched 1989 TV movie series "I Know My First Name is Steven."
While Stayner lived long enough to see the TV movie debut — and according to "Captive Audience," he liked it — his life was cut short at the age of 24.
The film continues to show the collateral damage of Stayner's kidnapping even after his death, as his older brother grow up to become a predator.
“This is the story of how a story gets told, and how the media’s magnifying glass impacts the characters caught in the narrative,” Hulu states in a synopsis for "Captive Audience: A Real American Horror Story"

     Hulu’s ‘Captive Audience’ May Be the Craziest True Crime Documentary of the Year
    </h2>

     Summary: Where to Stream: Captive Audience Powered by ReelgoodThere are twisty true crime stories, and then there’s Captive Audience.
On the afternoon of December 4, 1972, Steven Stayner was approached by a man on his way home from school.
As emotionally difficult as this story is, it’s only a third of the saga that Captive Audience captures.
Captive Audience compares its ratings success to Super Bowl numbers.
Captive Audience makes the argument that Cary Stayner’s murder spree was a cry for attention to differentiate him from his kidnapped brother.
