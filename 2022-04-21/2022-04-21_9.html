     Summary: This story originated in the Columbia Journalism Review and is part of “Climate &amp; Democracy,” a series from the global journalism collaboration Covering Climate Now.
On the first Earth Day, in 1970, America’s TV networks were not shy about taking a position on the news of the day.
So when the evening newscasts lavished so much attention on Earth Day, and made their support for tackling pollution so clear, the effects were profound.
Before long, Nixon had created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other legislation that to this day ranks among the strongest environmental laws on earth.
Which brings us to this Earth Day.

     Summary: The president’s order, however, will not ban logging of mature and old-growth trees, they added, and the administration is not considering a nationwide prohibition.
“Allowing logging of mature and old federal forests should become a practice of the past,” they wrote.
AdvertisementTimber companies are likely to object to any new limits on their access to trees in federal forests, and experts will debate what counts as a mature tree.
The fight over old-growth forests has been going on for decades.
In 1991, a federal judge blocked all logging of old-growth trees in the Pacific Northwest’s national forests to protect the northern spotted owl’s shrinking habitat.

Here’s how Earth Day came to be a holiday—and why activists hope it will continue to shape a more sustainable future.
How did Earth Day get its start?
Just 10 years after the first Earth Day, Nelson wrote in the EPA Journal that predictions of the end of the golden era of environmentalism were preemptive and inaccurate.

     Summary: It’s a far cry from the sprint toward clean energy that Biden — and his supporters — envisioned when he took office.
Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat with a national reputation for climate action.
“Climate action was a pillar of President Biden’s campaign, and his promises on this existential issue were a major reason the public elected him,″ Tisdel said.
But his tone has become more pessimistic recently, especially as Biden’s climate proposals remain stalled in Congress.
“We’re using every tool available to get this country powered by clean energy by 2035,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.
