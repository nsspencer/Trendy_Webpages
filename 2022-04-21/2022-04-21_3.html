     TNT's Charles Barkley on Minnesota Timberwolves after Game 3: 'They're dumber than rocks'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Tell you what though, one of my things that I always believe happened tonight," Barkley said during TNT's postgame studio highlights.
All that talent and they're dumber than rocks," he continued on Minnesota.
"When they have to think, they can't think," he said in response to fellow 'Inside the NBA' analyst Kenny Smith about the Timberwolves' inability to produce in half-court offense.
The coaching staff at Minnesota should be just as embarrassed as the players," Barkley finished as TNT switched to the late game.
Memphis leads the series at 2-1 after the Game 3 win, with Game 4 upcoming on Saturday in Minneapolis.

     Summary: I’ve only seen them at their house.”A little while later, Towns saw victorious Memphis players hooting and hollering in the middle of the Timberwolves’ house.
Despite dropping Game 1 and falling behind by 26 tonight, the Grizzlies now lead the first-round series 2-1 entering Game 4 Saturday.
Minnesota particularly keyed on containing Ja Morant, the Grizzlies star who feasted in Game 2.
With another creator on the floor, Memphis ensured the Timberwolves couldn’t as easily load up on Morant.
Morant (16 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds) did so many helpful things, even when not scoring efficiently (5-for-18).
