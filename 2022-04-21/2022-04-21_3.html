     3 observations from Warriors’ victory over Nuggets in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors took their 2-0 first-round series lead on the road to visit the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.
Here are 3 observations from Golden State’s critical victory.
The Warriors overwhelmed the Nuggets with ball movement in the first halfBoth teams shot better than 50% from the floor in the first half.
The problem was that the Nuggets couldn’t do anything to restrict Golden State’s passing.
That, of course, means that they bet against Golden State’s ability to make shots moving through very small pockets of space beyond the screen.
