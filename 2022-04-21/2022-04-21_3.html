     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies took a couple of pretty powerful haymakers from the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 3.
The Memphis Grizzlies are the basketball version of that fighter.
This builds confidence for a Grizzlies team that already wasn’t too short on it.
His poise and ability to navigate the storm remains so important for a Memphis team that is young, but has scar tissue from previous postseason shortcomings.

     What's the Biggest X-Factor For the Timberwolves In This Series?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rematch in Memphis was a far cry from the fluid and high-octane offense Minnesota displayed in the series opener.
Knowing what we know now since the start of the series, some of the Wolves’ biggest concerns have been on display.
Naz Reid was inserted for the rest of the first half, and the Timberwolves trailed by 11 at the break.
Since the All-Star break, the Timberwolves have been riding the hot hand of sixth-man Malik Beasley and his impeccable marksmanship from three.
Or how about when the Timberwolves went on the road and picked up arguably their two biggest wins of the second half in Miami and Denver.
