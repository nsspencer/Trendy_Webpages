Morgan tweeted an edited 30-second promotional clip of the interview, which is set to air next Monday, to his 7.9 million Twitter followers.
Yes, Trump and Morgan got into it over the 2020 election, with the former President calling Morgan a "fool" if he believed the election was free and fair.
It's hard to describe what a favor Morgan did for Trump here with the edited clip.

     Piers Morgan slams Trump, jokingly ‘storms off’ in British TV return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Piers Morgan made his long-awaited return to British TV Thursday morning — jokingly storming off the set in a move that mocked his dramatic exit last year during an on-air rant about Meghan Markle.
“He has concocted a story with no evidence so far, that it was all fraudulent.”However, Morgan’s heated debate did come with repercussions.
“She [Jenner] has now read the statement from Donald Trump saying this is a rigged promo, and called me ‘repulsive’ and canceled the interview,” Morgan added.
“I think most British people now share my view about Meghan Markle, and indeed Prince Harry, whose behavior continues to be utterly deplorable,” Morgan said.
Morgan mocked his own exit on “Lorraine” — jokingly fleeing the set while yelling, “I’m storming off!

     Donald Trump denies storming out of Piers Morgan interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donald Trump has said he did not storm out of an interview with Piers Morgan, instead claiming the British television presenter misleadingly edited a video of their meeting to create a buzz around his new show.
Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go.
