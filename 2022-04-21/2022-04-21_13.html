     Summary: OMG, RIP CNN+.
We hardly knew ye.
Seriously, we literally hardly knew ye, because ye came and went so fast.
If you took the time to say “CNN-plus” out loud, you might’ve missed the entire life of the news network’s much-ballyhooed, multimillion-dollar streaming service.
On Thursday, the company announced CNN+ will shut down April 30, sending shockwaves through the online-o-sphere.

     CNN+ Streaming Service Will Shut Down Weeks After Its Start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Executives at Discovery, wary of antitrust rules, were constrained from advising their counterparts at CNN until the merger was done.
CNN+ had lost its champion when Mr. Zucker left in February because of an undisclosed romantic relationship with a colleague.
Mr. Perrette had a message: Marketing of CNN+ was to be suspended, pending a formal review of the business, three people familiar with the conversation said.
Discovery wanted to merge its other subscription platforms — Discovery+ and HBO Max — into one giant streaming service.
Executives at CNN+ said they had secured 150,000 paying subscribers and were on a pace to hit first-year subscription goals.

     Greg Gutfeld Spends Entire Show Gloating at Ex-Colleague Chris Wallace Over CNN+ Demise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fox News star Greg Gutfeld gleefully gloated over the sudden collapse of CNN’s much-hyped streaming service on Thursday, taking the opportunity to make several jokes at the expense of his former longtime colleague Chris Wallace.
Discovery’s streaming president J.B. Perrette added that “some of this was avoidable” but the “prior leadership decided to just keep going” with the planned March launch.
“The Democratic bench is thinner than Chris Wallace’s demo reel from CNN+,” Gutfeld snarked during the program’s first segment.
“Look for independent voices with free time, so I guess that eliminates Chris Wallace,” Gutfeld smugly joked, prompting co-host Jeanine Pirro to chortle in approval.
After Wallace heaped praise on President Joe Biden’s inauguration speech last year, Gutfeld roundly mocked the anchor with an over-the-top performance.

     CNN+ shutting down less than month after launch with Chris Wallace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN is shutting down its CNN+ streaming service less than a month after its launch, a spectacular flameout for a venture that had attracted stars like Chris Wallace and Alison Roman and was seen as a way to attract a new generation of news consumers.
Executives said some CNN+ programming and employees will be absorbed into the television network and website but there will be layoffs.
Because of contracts with cable and satellite companies, CNN+ could not stream the CNN television network.
Unlike CNN+, which was charging customers $5.99 a month, broadcast networks like ABC, CBS and NBC offer free news-streaming services.
“Couldn’t do it.”The CNN+ service’s flagship was arguably Wallace’s daily interview show, for which he left his previous job as “Fox News Sunday” host.

     Summary: CNN’s announcement that it would shut down struggling streaming service CNN+ less than a month after its launch infuriated fired staffers, according to sources.
CNN+ via AP“All the CNN talent were basically doing double duty — Don Lemon, just announced his show a few days ago,” one staffer lamented.
The roughly 300 staffers were offered six months’ severance as well as first dibs on job opportunities within CNN, according to sources.
“Everyone is aghast and furious.”Hunt left MSNBC and joined CNN+ for a reported salary of $1 million per year.
The company’s long-term broader strategy is to merge the Discovery+ streaming service with that of HBO Max.
