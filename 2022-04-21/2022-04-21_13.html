    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But despite the attempt at openness, his strained relationships with the rest of his family—especially his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William—were still evident in the more tense moments of his public outings.
In a moment of questioning by Today’s Hoda Kotb, Harry subtly revealed exactly how sensitive the subject of his family ties continues to be.
Kotb asked if Harry missed his brother and dad, and he responded with a masterful deflection.
“I mean, for me, the moment I’m here, focused on these guys,” he said, referring to the competitors at the Invictus Games.
According to a royal source who spoke to the Daily Mail, the results of Harry’s comments are unambiguous.
