     Arrest made in death of 51-year-old Queens woman found in duffel bag near home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A 44-year-old man was arrested Thursday in the death of 51-year-old Orsolya Gaal, who was found over the weekend inside a duffel bag in Queens, the New York City Police Department said.
Bonola made a confession to police after he was arrested, a law enforcement official previously said.
At Thursday's news conference, Essig said Bonola had made "incriminating statements."
Based on the preliminary investigation, authorities believe Gaal and Bonola, a handyman employed by her family, had an intimate relationship, police said at the news conference.
The relationship had been "on and off" for about two years, police said, and was "considered at an end" when Gaal was killed early Saturday.
