    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski says Luka Doncic's calf injury rehab is ongoing and will see him miss Game 3 against the Jazz.
(1:03)SALT LAKE CITY -- Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic has been ruled out for Game 3 against the Utah Jazz on Thursday night.
Doncic missed Games 1 and 2 with a left calf injury, but has progressively increased his workload on the practice floor in recent days.
"If there's going to be risk, I don't think I'm going to play," Doncic said Wednesday.
"I don't know if I'm going to be 100%.

     Mavs rumors: Luka Doncic's target return date from injury, revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mavs will be without superstar Luka Doncic yet again for Thursday’s Game 3 matchup against the Utah Jazz.
However, it appears that the All-Star guard is nearing his return and he should be back in the fold sooner rather than later.
The Mavericks plan to bring Luka Doncic back from injury for Saturday's Game 4 in Utah after ruling him out for tonight's Game 3, league sources say.
The Mavs can’t expect Brunson to go on an offensive explosion every single game, though, and they certainly need Luka back as soon as possible.
Be that as it may, the Mavs will be cautious in bringing back their cornerstone stud.

     BREAKING: Mavs Plan For Luka Doncic Return in Game 4 vs. Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks were able to stay competitive with the Utah Jazz while Luka Doncic recovered from his calf strain.
The Dallas Mavericks, despite being without superstar Luka Doncic in their first-round playoff series so far due to a calf strain, have managed to stay competitive with the Utah Jazz.
After losing a closely-contested Game 1, Jalen Brunson exploded for 41 points in Game 2 to tie the series at 1-1 as the scene shifts to Salt Lake City.
The Mavs were 2-1 vs. the Jazz in those games.
The Mavs have one beat the Jazz in Utah one time in the last six years, and that came in Jan. 2020 as Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way with Doncic out due to an ankle injury.

     Mavericks rule out Luka Doncic for Game 3 vs. Jazz due to left calf strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic will miss Thursday’s Game 3 against the Utah Jazz (9:30 ET, TNT) as he continues to recover from a left calf strain.
Luka Dončić (left calf strain) is out for Game 3 in Utah.
Doncic has made considerable progress this week in his recovery from a left calf strain — partaking in more basketball activity Tuesday and Wednesday than initially hoped — but Dallas decides to wait until Game 4.
We shouldn’t rush anything, but step by step, I think I’m improving a lot, and I’m getting better,” he said.
That’s roughly the recovery time for the mildest calf strain, known as grade one.
