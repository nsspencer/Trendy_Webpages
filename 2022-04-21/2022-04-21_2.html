     Summary: This is Mike Tyson actually beating the crap out of someone who won’t ever be able to pay us enough to switch places with him in that kind of situation.
https://t.co/0623EXLgmQ — TMZ (@TMZ) April 21, 2022According to TMZ, Tyson’s patience ran out when an overzealous fan talked nonstop behind the former heavyweight champion’s seat after taking a selfie with him.
Eventually, though, we’re told Tyson had enough of the guy behind him talking in his ear … and told him to chill.
Can you imagine the feeling the moment one realizes that “Iron” Mike Tyson is about to use your head as a speed bag?
The fan was left with some cuts on the right side of his forehead after the brutal bludgeoning from Mike Tyson.

     Mike Tyson Filmed Punching Fellow Plane Passenger in Face Multiple Times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A video of an incident on a plane on Wednesday appears to show Mike Tyson repeatedly punching a fellow passenger after he wouldn’t leave the boxer/actor/podcaster alone.
A witness said the passenger was overly excited upon discovering he was sitting behind Tyson, and he secured a selfie with him.
But as the passenger continued to try to talk to Tyson, he apparently annoyed him enough to be told to relax.
The retired boxer allegedly then turned around to punch the man in the face multiple times, as seen in the footage on TMZ.
Tyson, however, sat there in silence as the man put the gun away.
