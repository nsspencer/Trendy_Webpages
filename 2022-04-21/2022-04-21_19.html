     Pixar’s Lightyear is going to be about traveling through time as well as space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pixar and Disney’s upcoming Lightyear feature has already thrown people with the idea of it being an origin story about the “real” space ranger Toy Story’s Buzz Lightyear is apparently based on.
That aspect of the feature immediately raised questions about whether Toy Story’s been set in some sort futuristic universe this whole time without acknowledging it, or if the studios were dancing around Lightyear actually being an in-universe movie about Buzz.
Lightyear’s latest trailer doesn’t clarify if either of those situations are the case, but it does lay out the broad strokes of the movie’s plot and reveal yet another interesting twist to its story.
In the new trailer, Buzz (Chris Evans) along with his earthbound partner Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba) are finally prepping for a launch involving one of Star Command’s first gates seemingly designed to facilitate long distance.
Lightyear hits theaters on June 17th.

     Buzz Lightyear travels to the future in his movie’s latest trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buzz Lightyear’s big test flight doesn’t go exactly how he planned in the latest trailer for his new movie, Lightyear.
The movie will tell the story of the original Buzz Lightyear, the intergalactic traveler who inspired the toy hero, and in this latest trailer we get to see him in action.
The trailer starts out by showing us a bit of Buzz’s regular astronaut life, but he’s quickly sent hurtling decades into the future on accident.
Once he arrives in this mysterious new time, Buzz encounters hostile robots, including his eventual nemesis, Zurg.
Buzz himself is voiced by Chris Evans, while his best friend, and her granddaughter in the future, are voiced by Uzo Aduba (Orange is the New Black).

     Blast off with Pixar and the brand new ‘Lightyear’ trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Summer movie season kicks off in right about two weeks’ time and, like in recent years, a Disney movie will be kicking it off.
Now it’s Lightyear’s turn, and being the sole Pixar offering for this calendar year (unless they’ve added another Cars sequel that they haven’t told anybody about) it’s got some big shoes to fill.
Disney dropped the new trailer earlier on Thursday, and it looks like you’d probably expect it would for a “hard” sci-fi version of… Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.
As Buzz tries to find a way back home through space and time, he’s joined by a group of ambitious recruits and his charming robot companion cat, Sox.
Given that this one isn’t an original Pixar project, you can bet your bottom dollar they’re not gonna send this one to Disney+.

     How ‘Lightyear’ Used Inspiration From NASA to Design Its Retrofuturistic Spaceships
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pixar’s “Lightyear,” an origin story based on the beloved astronaut Buzz Lightyear from the “Toy Story franchise,” takes the series into new galaxies with a fleet of NASA-inspired spaceships.
“Ours is very much inspired by the technology and the films of our childhood in the ‘70s and ‘80s,” Peltz says, mentioning “2001: A Space Odyssey” and even “Interstellar” as inspiration.
“We also wanted to achieve a level of detail that will allow those lighters to realize those images.
“We looked at the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA, that huge structure where they build the giant space rockets,” he says.
PIXARDetail was important to Peltz’s design — he wanted a mechanical reality to the aesthetic of Star Command.

     Summary: Directed by Angus MacLane (co-director “Finding Dory”) and produced by Galyn Susman (“Toy Story That Time Forgot”), Disney and Pixar’s “Lightyear” opens in U.S. theaters on June 17, 2022.
PIXARWalt Disney dropped a third theatrical trailer for Pixar’s Lightyear this morning, one timed to play with DreamWorks Animation’s (pretty damn enjoyable) The Bad Guys this weekend.
The trailer opens with Lightyear’s (professional/platonic) relationship with Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba) before he sets off on a mission that accidentally (?)
MAKING SPACE – In Disney and Pixar’s “Lightyear,” Buzz Lightyear (voice of Chris Evans) and Alisha Hawthorne (voice of Uzo Aduba)—his long-time commander, fellow Space Ranger and trusted friend—are marooned on a hostile planet.

     Pixar’s Lightyear Trailer: To Infinity and We Yawned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Chris Evans once said, Pixar’s upcoming film Lightyear “isn’t Buzz Lightyear the toy.
This is the origin story of the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on.” Or as Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter put it, “we designed Buzz Lightyear with the idea that he was a toy based on some really cool character from an epic blockbuster film.
The second trailer, released April 21, taps into some serious Top Gun: Maverick energy.
Buzz Lightyear commandeers a spaceship with Keke Palmer’s Izzy Hawthorne in tow.
Also, “the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on,” voiced by Evans, looks like a de-aged Patrick Warburton fused with Jay Leno?
