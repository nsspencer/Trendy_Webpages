     Shohei Ohtani's Extension Leverage Would Soar with 2nd MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a slow start to the season at the plate and on the mound, Ohtani looks back on track in his bid for a second consecutive AL MVP — and a massive contract extension.
The 27-year-old is in the second year of a two-year, $8.5M deal signed in 2021 to avoid arbitration.
deal signed in 2021 to avoid arbitration.
If he wins MVP, he’ll be the 33rd MLB player to win multiple awards — and the 13th to go back-to-back.
Last season, Ohtani’s MVP performance was one of the few bright spots on an underachieving team, but leading the Angels to their first postseason since 2014 could lock up his second MVP (current favorite, +350).

     Pshhh … Shohei Ohtani Couldn’t Even Throw a Perfect Game Last Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I was immersed in 18 innings of cruddy White Sox baseball (and NBA Playoffs action) when I saw a tweet joking about the possibility of Shohei Ohtani throwing a perfect game with 20 strikeouts.
So, I quickly flipped over the Angels-Astros game on MLB.TV to see that Ohtani really was already through five perfect ones against the Astros at Minute Maid Park.
Ohtani’s slider was on another level last night, garnering 23 Called Strikes+Whiffs for a staggering 66% CSW% on that pitch.

     Angels' Shohei Ohtani: Dazzles in first win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ohtani (1-2) picked up the win in Wednesday's 6-0 victory over the Astros, scattering one hit and one walk over six scoreless innings while striking out 12.
Not only was Ohtani brilliant on the mound, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning and firing 55 of 81 pitches for strikes while generating 20 swinging strikes, he gave himself all the run support he needed by going 2-for-4 at the plate with a walk, a double, a run scored and two RBI.
The two-way superstar tied his MLB career high in strikeouts with the performance, and he'll carry a 4.40 ERA, 1.05 WHIP and dominant 26:4 K:BB through 14.1 innings into his next start.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Japanese star made history even before making it to the mound on Wednesday.
"Getting six runs in the first and starting off a game like that, it's kind of hard to get locked in and get the outs," Ohtani said through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.
When it looked like he might be approaching a perfect game, Astros catcher Jason Castro was able to squeak out a single in the sixth inning.
Before giving up that first hit, 27-year-old Ohtani had two hits, two RBIs and scored a run.
Ohtani used his deadly slider throughout the game, throwing it 35 times.

     Angels' Shohei Ohtani makes history even before he takes the mound to dominate Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday night in Houston, Shohei Ohtani's latest appointment with history was prelude to a dominating performance on the mound against the division-rival Astros.
In all, 11 Angels hitters came to the plate in the top of the first, and that means Ohtani came to the plate twice (he walked and doubled).
Now that the universal DH is in effect, Ohtani will almost certainly be the first and last to achieve this rare feat.
Speaking of Ohtani the starting pitcher, after that bit of history he got busy dominating the Astros.
That's still not vintage Ohtani, which means the (first-place) Angels might be able to bank on improving numbers from this point forward.
