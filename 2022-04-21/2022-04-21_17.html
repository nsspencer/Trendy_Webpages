     Barcelona Beat Real Sociedad But Four Defenders Suffer Injuries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona bounced back from consecutive defeats by winning 1-0 at Real Sociedad on Thursday.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his ninth goal in eight La Liga starts as Barca reclaimed second place.
Aubameyang's goal, which was a close-range header after Ferran Torres had looped a cross over the Sociedad keeper, came from Barca's only shot on target.

Sociedad piled on the pressure in search of an equalizer but Barca's back-up defensive duo of Garcia and Lenglet stood firm under siege.

     Entire Barcelona defence suffer injuries during second half of 1-0 win over Real Sociedad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona’s entire starting defence suffered injuries during Thursday evening’s 1-0 win over Real Sociedad.
Pique, who had been limping since the first half, eventually came off after 82 minutes and was replaced by Clement Lenglet.
As well as these substitutions, left-back Alba pulled a muscle midway through the second half, and had continued to play while visibly struggling.
A fifth defender, Lenglet, later received medical treatment from Barcelona medical staff after going down holding his head.
The club endured a major injury crisis in attack throughout the autumn, and are currently missing star midfielder Pedri, who ruptured his hamstring during the Eintracht loss.

     Real Sociedad 0-1 FC Barcelona: Aubameyang strikes as Xavi's side return to second in league table
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona returned to second in the La Liga table as they overcame a stubborn Real Sociedad 1-0 at the Reale Arena.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continues his purple patch in front of goal, nodding into an unguarded net after Torres' knockdown.
Dembele hit the post in the interim, but the Gabonese was on hand to make sure at the second attempt.
Sorloth does really well to find his strike partner, but Isak uncharacteristically strikes wide of the post!
Sociedad are really knocking on the door here as Sorloth races through, and ter Stegen shows off his reflexes to deny the Norwegian.

Real Sociedad made its first two changes moments earlier, with Rafinha and Jose Zaldua off for Jon Guridi and Antoni Gorosabel.
It takes forever to get the ball out of play to make the change as Real Sociedad looked to take advantage.
