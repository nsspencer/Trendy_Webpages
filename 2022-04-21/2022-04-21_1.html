    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted by USDA Rural Development Staff in RuralRural Americans are on the frontlines of climate change impacts and increasingly severe weather that threatens their health, safety and livelihoods.
USDA invested $17.3 million through the Water &amp; Waste Disaster Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the landfill.
Similarly, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria caused a tremendous increase in waste disposal at the Juncos Landfill, causing it to nearly close operations.
USDA Rural Development awarded the landfill’s operators a $23.7 million Water &amp; Waste Disaster Disposal Direct Loan and Grant, allowing the landfill to continue operations for up to 21 more years.
USDA Rural Development has the resources rural communities need to build a more resilient future.

     Summary: The claim: Differences in ocean and the atmospheric warming are not explained by climate change scienceAccording to NASA, 90% of global warming is occurring in Earth's oceans.
One social media user claims this fact presents a major challenge to the idea that global warming is occurring at all.
"Do you want to know why global warming crap is wrong?
Surface ocean water and the surface atmosphere in contact with the ocean water are actually warming at similar rates, he said in an email.
Fact check: Misleading data used in claim alleging a global cooling trendUSA TODAY has previously debunked claims that climate change theory defies the laws of physics or overstates the role of CO2 in climate change.

     Summary: HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Climate change is an issue that affects all of us, especially in a place like Hawaii — islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
What do you say to those who don’t really understand why climate change is such a critical issue?
We know the science and the connections between what causes climate change and what those changes and those impacts are.
Engaging with community, getting outside, observing, getting involved, getting your hands in the dirt and taking that action.
And some of those things start to then build positive feedback where we’re investing in ourselves and our own health.

     Summary: On Earth Day 2022, which falls on Friday, Google addressed the pressing challenge of climate change through its doodle.
“Acting now and together to live more sustainably is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” the company said.
Today’s Google Doodle uses real time-lapse imagery from Google Earth Timelapse and other sources to showcase the impact of climate change across different regions.
Throughout the day, the doodle images will change to represent different locations of the earth and the impact of global warming in these areas over the years.
Google shows Harz Forests in Germany destroyed by bark beetle infestation due to rising temperatures and severe drought.

     Summary: The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from the United Nations is the first time the group has tackled this thorny question head-on.
There is a chance to make a difference in schools, cities, counties, and professionsDiscussion around how to address climate change tends to exist in polar opposites.
In between, there are schools, counties, cities, professions, and peer groups that can push for climate action.
For example, many of these professions have formal standards or informal networks where they can form new norms that prioritize climate change.
These social movements have exploded as the first generation growing up with the harsher realities of climate change becomes a political force globally.

Thanks in-part to a $250,000 grant through USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), ABS Global was able to purchase and install a 657 kilowatt (kW) solar array.
[visit https://abs.link/to/solarpower/ to view project video and photos]The project highlighted in today’s visit is a great example of how USDA Rural Development is taking several actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in rural communities.
Since fiscal year (FY) 2020, USDA has invested $7.3 million on climate-smart infrastructure through the REAP program.
