He was taken into custody and charged early on Thursday with murder, criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to the killing of Gaal, as confirmed by NYPD reports according to the New York Post.
Sources told NBC that Bonola and Gaal had likely argued on Friday night before the woman was killed, after being stabbed at least 58 times according to police.
Bonola was arrested thanks to a pair of blood-soaked boots that had been left at the victim's house, according to the New York Post.
Spoke to a few of my staff members that know her, joking around in conversation," Gabriel Veras told NBC.
