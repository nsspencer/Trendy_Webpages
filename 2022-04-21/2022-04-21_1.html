    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man has been charged with the murder of Queens mother Orsolya Gaal, whose slain body was found abandoned in a duffel bag in New York last Saturday.
He was taken into custody and charged early on Thursday with murder, criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to the killing of Gaal, as confirmed by NYPD reports according to the New York Post.
Sources told NBC that Bonola and Gaal had likely argued on Friday night before the woman was killed, after being stabbed at least 58 times according to police.
