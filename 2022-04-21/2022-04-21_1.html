     Orsolya Gaal Suspect David Bonola Charged With Queens Mom's Murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man has been charged with the murder of Queens mother Orsolya Gaal, whose slain body was found abandoned in a duffel bag in New York last Saturday.
He was taken into custody and charged early on Thursday with murder, criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to the killing of Gaal, as confirmed by NYPD reports according to the New York Post.
Sources told NBC that Bonola and Gaal had likely argued on Friday night before the woman was killed, after being stabbed at least 58 times according to police.
Bonola was arrested thanks to a pair of blood-soaked boots that had been left at the victim's house, according to the New York Post.
Spoke to a few of my staff members that know her, joking around in conversation," Gabriel Veras told NBC.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A handyman was arrested Thursday in the death of a Queens mother who was stabbed nearly 60 times and whose body was found stuffed in a duffel bag over the weekend, the New York City Police Department said.
David Bonola, 44, of Queens, was taken into custody on charges of murder, criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon in the killing of Orsolya Gaal, according to police.
Chief of Detectives James Essig said in a news conference Thursday that Bonola was in “an intimate relationship” with Gaal for two years.
After Bonola arrived at Gaal's home around 12:30 a.m. to 12:40 a.m. Saturday, the pair argued and a knife was brandished, according to Essig.
Essig said Bonola was captured in security camera footage wheeling the bag down 75th Avenue in Forest Hills.
