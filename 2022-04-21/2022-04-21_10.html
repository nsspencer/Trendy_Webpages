     CNN+ Streaming Service Will Shut Down Weeks After Its Start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Executives at Discovery, wary of antitrust rules, were constrained from advising their counterparts at CNN until the merger was done.
CNN+ had lost its champion when Mr. Zucker left in February because of an undisclosed romantic relationship with a colleague.
Mr. Perrette had a message: Marketing of CNN+ was to be suspended, pending a formal review of the business, three people familiar with the conversation said.
Discovery wanted to merge its other subscription platforms — Discovery+ and HBO Max — into one giant streaming service.
Executives at CNN+ said they had secured 150,000 paying subscribers and were on a pace to hit first-year subscription goals.

     Summary: Former President Donald Trump weighed in shortly after news broke that CNN+ will cease operations.
"Congratulations to CNN+ on their decision to immediately FOLD," he said in a written statement.
He also insulted CNN+ host Chris Wallace, formerly of Fox News, by bringing up his late father.
Trump, a longtime critic of CNN, went on to insult CNN+ host Chris Wallace by invoking his late father, Mike Wallace, one of the original correspondents for CBS's "60 Minutes."
Insider's Claire Atkinson and Steven Perlberg previously reported that CNN spent up to $250 million on the March 29 launch.

     CNN+ shutting down less than month after launch with Chris Wallace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN is shutting down its CNN+ streaming service less than a month after its launch, a spectacular flameout for a venture that had attracted stars like Chris Wallace and Alison Roman and was seen as a way to attract a new generation of news consumers.
Executives said some CNN+ programming and employees will be absorbed into the television network and website but there will be layoffs.
Because of contracts with cable and satellite companies, CNN+ could not stream the CNN television network.
Unlike CNN+, which was charging customers $5.99 a month, broadcast networks like ABC, CBS and NBC offer free news-streaming services.
“Couldn’t do it.”The CNN+ service’s flagship was arguably Wallace’s daily interview show, for which he left his previous job as “Fox News Sunday” host.

     CNN+ is dead: Here’s what killed the streaming news service only a month after it began
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN+, the online streaming service that debuted March 29, is dead, or at least dying: It will shut down for good April 30.
Some programming may find its way to a single-destination streaming service that will combine Discovery+ and HBO Max.
So much so that a live feed of CNN wasn’t part of it, even during breaking news stories, thanks to the network's agreement with cable systems.
There was no must-see show or feature that would make people drop what they were doing and watch, live or otherwise.
The death of CNN+ wasn’t about bad journalism or bad politics.
