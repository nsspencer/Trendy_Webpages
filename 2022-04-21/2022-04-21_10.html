     Mavericks' Luka Doncic: Ruled out for Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doncic (calf) has been ruled out for Thursday's Game 3 against the Jazz, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.
Although Doncic said he was "feeling great" after taking part in individual drills following Thursday's shootaround, the Mavericks were pessimistic that he'd be able to play in Game 3.
The point guard will officially be held out for a third consecutive playoff game, which should lead to increased roles for Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson once again.
However, the Mavericks expect Doncic to return in Saturday's Game 4 against Utah, NBA writer Marc Stein reports.

     BREAKING: Mavs Plan For Luka Doncic Return in Game 4 vs. Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks were able to stay competitive with the Utah Jazz while Luka Doncic recovered from his calf strain.
The Dallas Mavericks, despite being without superstar Luka Doncic in their first-round playoff series so far due to a calf strain, have managed to stay competitive with the Utah Jazz.
After losing a closely-contested Game 1, Jalen Brunson exploded for 41 points in Game 2 to tie the series at 1-1 as the scene shifts to Salt Lake City.
The Mavs were 2-1 vs. the Jazz in those games.
The Mavs have one beat the Jazz in Utah one time in the last six years, and that came in Jan. 2020 as Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way with Doncic out due to an ankle injury.
