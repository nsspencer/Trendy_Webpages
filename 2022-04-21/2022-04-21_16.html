     Snap reports ‘challenging’ quarter that missed sales and profit estimates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CEO of Snap Inc. Evan Spiegel walks to a morning session at the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference on July 07, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho.
Snap missed Wall Street expectations for profit and sales, and forecast disappointing revenue growth in the current quarter, when it reported first-quarter results on Thursday.
However, daily users grew 18% annually, more than expected.
Snap was down about 4% at one point before recovering to rise over 7% at one point in volatile extended trading.
Spiegel blamed some of Snap's issues during the quarter on macroeconomic conditions, including advertisers who paused their campaigns after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February.

     Snap Concedes “Challenging” Quarter, Swings to Net Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, hit $1.06 billion in revenue during the first quarter, falling within its modest forecasts of reaching between $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion in revenue, but swung to a net loss as Apple’s iOS privacy changes continue to impact Snap’s advertising business.
Despite reaching net income for the first time since going public in 2017 in Q4, Snap reported a $359.6 million net loss for its latest quarter.
The company noted it also saw growth in the number of submissions to Spotlight, Snapchat’s TikTok competitor, but did not share any updated figures on the number of users.
“The first quarter of 2022 proved more challenging than we had expected, and our team was able to make significant progress against our goals despite increased volatility in the operating environment,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks published on Thursday.
Next week, Snap is expected to launch new products at its partner summit on April 28.
