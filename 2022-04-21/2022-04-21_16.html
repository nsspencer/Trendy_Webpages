     UC Berkeley Lifts Campus-Wide Lockdown After Police Apprehend Suspect Who Made 'Threats of Violence'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "But suffice it to say that after a quick initial investigation, those threats were deemed to be legitimate, serious and of grave, grave concern."
April, a senior who asked that her last name not be used, said she thought the incident probably involved a student experiencing a mental health issue.
Sitting outside the locked-down student center on Thursday morning, she said mental health issues among students are increasingly common.
She said on-campus counseling and other mental health resources are too limited and often not easily accessible, which can be particularly detrimental for students facing crises.
In a statement to students and faculty, posted Thursday afternoon, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ called it "an unsettling day for our community."

     UC Berkeley lifts shelter-in-place order after campuswide threat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UC Berkeley community on Thursday was ordered to shelter in place for more than four hours due to what officials described as a credible campuswide threat.
AdvertisementUC Police first alerted the campus to the threat on Twitter at 9:30 a.m.“Please go inside and move away from doors and windows,” they said.
UCPD has determined based upon its investigation that it is appropriate to end the shelter in place.
In response to the threat, officials with the Berkeley Unified School District placed nearby public schools on a “soft lockdown” out of an abundance of caution, including Berkeley High School, Berkeley Technology Academy, Willard Middle School, Emerson Elementary School, Sylvia Mendez Elementary School, Washington Elementary School and King Child Development Center.
“UCPD has determined based upon its investigation that it is appropriate to end the shelter in place,” they said.

     UC Berkeley lifts shelter-in-place order issued over threats to ‘specific individuals,’ police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shelter-in-place order at UC Berkeley that began mid-morning and lasted more than four hours as police investigated a “credible campus-wide threat” was lifted Thursday afternoon.
At about 2 p.m., UC Berkeley police located the person they had been searching for all morning at a location off campus, university officials said in a statement.
“According to UCPD, the security situation has been addressed and the individual poses no immediate threat,” university officials said.
UC Berkeley police learned Thursday at about 7:30 a.m. that a person affiliated with the university “issued serious and credible threats of violence towards other, specific individuals who work or learn at the university,” university officials said.
The shelter-in-place order left many students and faculty feeling unsafe and confused due to vague communication from law enforcement and university officials.
