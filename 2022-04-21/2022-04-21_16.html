     Robert McIntyre Makes Blind Ace in Zurich Classic of New Orleans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ever hole out a shot and not see it?
Robert McIntyre's tee shot at the par-3 14th hole landed short of the green and he stopped watching.
Robert McIntyre teed off at the par-3 14th hole on Thursday at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and turned away, seeing it was landing short of the green and thinking that was that.
Then, the high-fives ensued and McIntyre wore an incredulous smile.
The Scottish duo of McIntyre-Laird was 6 under through 14 holes after the ace.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No offense to the man, the one and only Jay Haas; he accomplished much in his career.
Haas hasn’t played a full PGA Tour schedule since 2005.
His last tour win was in 1993, three years before Masters champ Scottie Scheffler was born.
He’s 18 years older than rookies on the PGA Tour Champions.
So while it was charming to see 68-year-old Jay team up with son Bill at this week’s Zurich Classic at New Orleans, it had the hint of a publicity stunt in a game built on meritocracy.

     Summary: -- Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele are a good team even when they're playing for cash and not just a flag.
"But we are going into a format on Friday that we really like - I think Xander and I really like alternate shot.
Garrigus told Golf Channel that he was focused only on the Zurich Classic, and plenty of focus appeared to be in place.
Cantlay and Schauffele -- who have gone on vacations together when they weren't representing their country in the cups -- were extremely effective on the greens.
The 68-year-old father had four of their seven birdies, three of them from the 15-foot range, in their 65.

     Summary: 2, respectively, in the Official World Golf Ranking and were the betting favorites.
But that doesn’t mean the Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay team is any less stacked.
1 for birdie, Cantlay then made eagle on 2, then each of them made two more birdies going out to turn with a 7-under 29.
“I wasn’t really thinking about 59 just because it’s best ball,” Cantlay said about his mindset coming down 18.
So the buffer, we’re only one shot ahead, but we are going into a format on Friday that we really like,” Cantlay said.

     Summary: Sam Snead set the record by making the cut at the 1979 Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic at 67 years, 2 months and 23 days.
Snead was actually in the field when Jay Haas made his TOUR debut at the 1973 Wyndham Championship.
It was fun today,” Jay Haas said after the round.
“This course has a handful of holes that are really, really tough, like you've got to hit a really good drive, and you've got probably a long iron in, a few par-3s that you have long irons in.
So that's really impressive.

"It counts for me," said Schauffele of the 59 which set a new Zurich Classic scoring record.
The bigger story here is that Cantlay and Schauffele have a head start on a field in which they were already the co-favorites.
That alternate shot format is the same format in which Cantlay and Schauffele went 2-0-0 in last year's Ryder Cup"It's just the first quarter," Cantlay said.
