     Rosie Perez "hates" flying, initially turned down The Flight Attendant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementAs it turns out, The Flight Attendant’s Rosie Perez is no different when it comes to her reluctance to board a plane.
In an interview on The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, the actor shared that she actually turned down the role at first due to her hatred of flying.
And she goes, “Well, I don’t really like flying.” And I think, “Does she know this is [a show] about a flight attendant?”“I was just playing it cool.
But the flying thing really was an issue,” Perez tells Noah.
“First day, first scene, out the bag, I said, ‘This is going to be a hit.’”AdvertisementThe second season of The Flight Attendant premieres on April 21 on HBO Max.

     The Flight Attendant’s Surprising Season Two Direction for Cassie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Flight Attendant’s first-season finale left Cassie (Kaley Cuoco) in a hopeful position—newly sober and freshly aware of a CIA-asset program for which Shane (Griffin Matthews), a flight attendant/CIA operative, recommended her.
She’s on the cusp of her one-year sobriety anniversary, but her outlook seems too optimistic to last.
As she fell deeper into a mess of her own making, she was also confronting personal demons in surreal fantasy sequences involving, for example, multiple versions of her one-night stand (Michiel Huisman) and a giant bunny.
“Coming into Season two, it was really about, how are we going to handle Cassie, because she’s not drinking,” reveals Steve Yockey on a Zoom call with co-showrunner Natalie Chaidez.
“So we very much have a very similar Cassie in terms of behavior.

     "The Flight Attendant" returns with double the baggage and showcase for Kaley Cuoco
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The Flight Attendant" demonstrates why "it's a lot" is a favorite idiom of mine.
Since our flight attendant was blackout drunk, she has no memory of what happened.
Kaley Cuoco in "The Flight Attendant" (Jennifer Rose Clasen/HBO Max)Cuoco still plies the zany comedic side with aplomb, playing to strengths that have served her so well in other shows, including the animated cult hit "Harley Quinn."
There's no denying the soaring pleasure of "The Flight Attendant" despite these minor irritations even so, because Cuoco is simply that good at captaining our way through Cassie's muchness.
Season 2 of "The Flight Attendant" debuts with two episodes on Thursday, April 21 on HBO Max.

     Flight Attendant Recap: Double Trouble — Grade the Season 2 Premiere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Season 1 of The Flight Attendant followed the same route as the novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian, Season 2 of the HBO Max dramedy ventures into new territory.
And while the first season dealt with Cassie’s relationship with her father, Season 2 will reunite with her estranged mother, played by none other than Sharon Stone.
Cassie’s rival Jada is lead attendant on the flight, and she is not buying Cassie’s new sober, making-better-choices attitude.
There, she watches as he and a mysterious, blonde woman (who conspicuously has the same back tattoo as our in-over-her-head flight attendant!)
Right above Courier and Blonde Lady’s room is a group of men who appear to be listening in on their activity.

     The Flight Attendant Returns, Dizzy and Fizzy As Ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the case of The Flight Attendant, that anxiety is heightened because even the first season teetered on the brink of not working.
This is the mood of The Flight Attendant at its most essential: absurd setting + absurd circumstances + real emotional grounding + fun costuming + plot???????
It’s true that The Flight Attendant turns melodramatic-thriller fodder like a helicopter on a cliff into background noise, but to its credit, that’s because it’s making space for a more compelling foreground.
For all its overblown goofiness, The Flight Attendant retains some hold on artful parallels.
But whatever happens, season two of The Flight Attendant has demonstrated it understands how to build up to an inevitable emotional crash.
