     Summary: But I need an apartment,’” Mr. Licht said, according to the recording.
(To avoid running afoul of CNN’s agreements with cable carriers, CNN+ did not include the live programming that was featured on its cable network.)
Mr. Perrette also referred to Discovery’s “painful” history launching similar smaller streaming services — focused on cars, food and golf — and said that they were costly to market and had limited audiences.
“We have failed almost at every turn launching these products,” he said, according to the recording of the meeting.
Still, two people inside CNN said the service had about 150,000 paying subscribers and was on pace to hit the network’s first-year goals.
