     Summary: Tony award winner and 'Mad Men' star Robert Morse dies at 90Enlarge this image toggle caption Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesActor Robert Morse, who started his career on Broadway and then became a 'Mad Men' star, has died at 90.
The news was confirmed by Jordan Bell of the talent agency BRS/Gage, who said via email that Morse "died peacefully at home after a brief illness."
On Broadway, Morse originated the role of J. Pierrepont Finch on How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, for which he won a Tony Award.
Morse also won a Tony Award for his 1990 one-man show Tru, in which he played Truman Capote.
Younger audiences, however, will recognize him from the AMC TV hit Mad Men, in which he played Bertram Cooper, advertising mogul and founding partner of Sterling Cooper.

     Robert Morse, Impish Tony-Winning Comedy Star, Is Dead at 90
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His death was confirmed by his agent, David Shaul.
The plot revolved around the determined efforts of an ambitious young window washer named J. Pierrepont Finch, played with sly humor by Mr. Morse, to climb to the top of the corporate ladder.
Among the show’s many high points was the washroom scene in which Mr. Morse delivered a heartfelt rendition of the song “I Believe in You” while gazing rapturously into a mirror.
“How to Succeed” ran for more than 1,400 performances and won seven Tony Awards, including one for Mr. Morse as best actor in a musical, as well as the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
A 1967 film adaptation, with Mr. Morse and Mr. Vallee repeating their roles, was a hit as well, and the show has been revived on Broadway twice.
