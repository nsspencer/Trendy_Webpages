     Summary: Following his last appearance as Vision in WandaVision, Paul Bettany teases his possible return to the MCU.
In WandaVision, Wanda manipulated reality to bring back Vision using chaos magic, while S.W.O.R.D had resurrected the original body of Vision to utilize him as a living weapon, known as White Vision.
Therefore, Bettany says he believes that Vision may return soon, though he claims to be unsure of when that may be.
Nonetheless, Bettany presents a valid point on the unanswered whereabouts of White Vision.
Just like the loose ends in the finale of WandaVision, Bettany continues to remain discreet about cementing a definite answer to his return.
