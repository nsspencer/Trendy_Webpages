     Mavericks rule out Luka Doncic for Game 3 vs. Jazz due to left calf strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic missed Thursday’s Game 3 victory over the Utah Jazz as he continues to recover from a left calf strain.
Luka Dončić (left calf strain) is out for Game 3 in Utah.
— Mavs PR (@MavsPR) April 21, 2022The Mavericks reportedly expect Doncic to return for Game 4 on Saturday, according to veteran NBA writer Marc Stein.
Doncic has made considerable progress this week in his recovery from a left calf strain — partaking in more basketball activity Tuesday and Wednesday than initially hoped — but Dallas decides to wait until Game 4.
We shouldn’t rush anything, but step by step, I think I’m improving a lot, and I’m getting better,” he said.
