We hardly knew ye.
Seriously, we literally hardly knew ye, because ye came and went so fast.
If you took the time to say “CNN-plus” out loud, you might’ve missed the entire life of the news network’s much-ballyhooed, multimillion-dollar streaming service.
On Thursday, the company announced CNN+ will shut down April 30, sending shockwaves through the online-o-sphere.

     CNN+ Streaming Service Will Shut Down Weeks After Its Start

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Executives at Discovery, wary of antitrust rules, were constrained from advising their counterparts at CNN until the merger was done.
CNN+ had lost its champion when Mr. Zucker left in February because of an undisclosed romantic relationship with a colleague.
Mr. Perrette had a message: Marketing of CNN+ was to be suspended, pending a formal review of the business, three people familiar with the conversation said.
Discovery wanted to merge its other subscription platforms — Discovery+ and HBO Max — into one giant streaming service.
Executives at CNN+ said they had secured 150,000 paying subscribers and were on a pace to hit first-year subscription goals.

     Trump Celebrates CNN+ Shutting Down, Slams Chris Wallace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President Donald Trump celebrated Thursday's sudden shutdown of CNN's new streaming service and slammed one of the top talents the network had secured for its launch.
"Congratulations to CNN+ on their decision to immediately FOLD for a lack of ratings, or viewers in any way, shape, or form," Trump said in a Thursday statement.
"In any event, it's just one more piece of CNN and Fake News that we don't have to bother with anymore!"
Earlier this year, Trump also celebrated former CNN head Jeff Zucker's abrupt resignation, calling him "a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long."
Wallace became an unexpected rival for Trump, who expected Fox News and its anchors to interview him without challenging the former president and his administration.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN is shutting down its CNN+ streaming service less than a month after its launch, a spectacular flameout for a venture that had attracted stars like Chris Wallace and Alison Roman and was seen as a way to attract a new generation of news consumers.
Executives said some CNN+ programming and employees will be absorbed into the television network and website but there will be layoffs.
Because of contracts with cable and satellite companies, CNN+ could not stream the CNN television network.
Unlike CNN+, which was charging customers $5.99 a month, broadcast networks like ABC, CBS and NBC offer free news-streaming services.
“Couldn’t do it.”The CNN+ service’s flagship was arguably Wallace’s daily interview show, for which he left his previous job as “Fox News Sunday” host.

     Summary: Fox NewsFox News star Greg Gutfeld gleefully gloated over the sudden collapse of CNN’s much-hyped streaming service on Thursday, taking the opportunity to make several jokes at the expense of his former longtime colleague Chris Wallace.
Discovery’s streaming president J.B. Perrette added that “some of this was avoidable” but the “prior leadership decided to just keep going” with the planned March launch.
“The Democratic bench is thinner than Chris Wallace’s demo reel from CNN+,” Gutfeld snarked during the program’s first segment.
Story continues“Look for independent voices with free time, so I guess that eliminates Chris Wallace,” Gutfeld smugly joked, prompting co-host Jeanine Pirro to chortle in approval.
After Wallace heaped praise on President Joe Biden’s inauguration speech last year, Gutfeld roundly mocked the anchor with an over-the-top performance.
