     Summary: Wordle is a daily word game owned by the New York Times.
Players get six tries to figure out the five-letter word of the day.
If a word guessed by the user has a letter that is in the word of the day, but not in the right order, the letter box turns yellow.
If any letters are incorrect and not included in the final word, the box turns gray.
But, if any of the letters guessed are in the word and are in the right position, the box turns green.
