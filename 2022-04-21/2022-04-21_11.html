     UC Berkeley campus on lockdown after 'credible threat'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UC Berkeley campus is currently locked down due to a "credible threat," UCPD said Thursday.
In-person classes have been canceled for the rest of the day, and campus services such as parking garages, libraries and dining halls are closed until further notice.
The Daily Californian, the UC Berkeley student newspaper, reports the threat originated at the Cesar Chavez Student Center, a student services building near the Bancroft and Telegraph entrance to campus.
Berkeley High School, Berkeley Technology Academy, Willard Middle School, Emerson Elementary School, Sylvia Mendez Elementary School, Washington Elementary School and King Child Development Center are on "soft lockdown," according to the Berkeley Unified School District.
"Based on direct coordination on campus, this incident does not appear to require that community members take action beyond avoiding campus," the Berkeley Police Department said in a statement.
