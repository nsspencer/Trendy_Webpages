     Robert McIntyre Makes Blind Ace in Zurich Classic of New Orleans
    </h2>

     Summary: Ever hole out a shot and not see it?
Robert McIntyre's tee shot at the par-3 14th hole landed short of the green and he stopped watching.
Robert McIntyre teed off at the par-3 14th hole on Thursday at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and turned away, seeing it was landing short of the green and thinking that was that.
Then, the high-fives ensued and McIntyre wore an incredulous smile.
The Scottish duo of McIntyre-Laird was 6 under through 14 holes after the ace.

     Jay Haas has cut record in sight after vintage opener at Zurich Classic of New Orleans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Snead set the record by making the cut at the 1979 Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic at 67 years, 2 months and 23 days.
Snead was actually in the field when Jay Haas made his TOUR debut at the 1973 Wyndham Championship.
It was fun today,” Jay Haas said after the round.
“This course has a handful of holes that are really, really tough, like you've got to hit a really good drive, and you've got probably a long iron in, a few par-3s that you have long irons in.
So that's really impressive.
