     Guy Lafleur, Dynamic Star of the Montreal Canadiens, Dies at 70
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guy Damien Lafleur was born on Sept. 20, 1951, in Thurso, Quebec, to Rejean and Pierette Lafleur.
“When I was a kid, all we saw on TV was the Canadiens, and all I wanted to be was Béliveau,” he told the Hall, referring to the longtime Canadiens star Jean Béliveau.
He was spectacular in top-tier junior hockey, scoring 103 and 130 goals for the Quebec Ramparts in the 1969-70 and 1970-71 seasons, and the Canadiens selected him with the No.
Lafleur started relatively slowly, scoring 29, 28 and 21 goals in his first three seasons before he broke out with 53 in the 1974-75 season.
With his blond hair flowing in the days before players routinely wore helmets, Lafleur became a star for a storied Montreal franchise, an innovator with a stick in his hands.
