     Summary: But Golden State found a way to win anyways, beating the Nuggets 118-113 to take a 3-0 lead in the series.
In a game where defense seemed optional at times, the Warriors had too many turnovers and missed key open shots.
Nikola Jokic got an easy layup to give the Nuggets an 111-109 lead with 3:20 left in the game.
He re-entered the game minutes later and seemed fine.
The Warriors hold a 3-0 lead over the Nuggets in the best-of-seven series.

     Summary: After returning from knee injuries twice before during the playoffs, Curry understood it might take some time to find his rhythm.
With two playoff games under his belt, Curry is still experiencing some mild but manageable discomfort in his injured foot, but feeling well overall.
But not starting has made Curry have to adjust his pregame routine.
“If you’re worried about anything other than trying to win the game, then you’re approaching it wrong to begin with,” Curry said.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are just one win away from advancing to the Western Conference semifinals.
Poole and Curry led the team with 27 points each, while Thompson added 26 points on 6-for-13 3-point shooting.
Aaron Gordon also had a strong game for Denver, scoring 18 points to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists.
Now, Golden State needs just one more win for a sweep and a second-round matchup against either the Memphis Grizzlies or Minnesota Timberwolves.
The Warriors' newest death lineup featuring Curry, Thompson, Poole and Wiggins doesn't work without Green's otherworldly defensive ability and basketball IQ.
