     Summary: I’ve only seen them at their house.”A little while later, Towns saw victorious Memphis players hooting and hollering in the middle of the Timberwolves’ house.
Despite dropping Game 1 and falling behind by 26 tonight, the Grizzlies now lead the first-round series 2-1 entering Game 4 Saturday.
Minnesota particularly keyed on containing Ja Morant, the Grizzlies star who feasted in Game 2.
With another creator on the floor, Memphis ensured the Timberwolves couldn’t as easily load up on Morant.
Morant (16 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds) did so many helpful things, even when not scoring efficiently (5-for-18).

The Memphis Grizzlies are the basketball version of that fighter.
This builds confidence for a Grizzlies team that already wasn’t too short on it.
His poise and ability to navigate the storm remains so important for a Memphis team that is young, but has scar tissue from previous postseason shortcomings.

     Summary: Tyus Jones hit two dagger three-pointers against his former team down the stretch, and the Grizzlies seized back home-court advantage.
They stunned a Wolves team that won Game 1 on the road 130-117 but took an ugly 124-96 loss in Game 2.
They went 8:34 of game time between the second and third quarters without a basket until Russell swished a three.
Brunson appeared to hurt his back midway through the second quarter when Royce O’Neale hit him full speed from behind.
It was very easy to tell and to feel that so, last couple of years we haven’t been in the playoffs.
