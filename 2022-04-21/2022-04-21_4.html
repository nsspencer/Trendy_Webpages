     Britain's Queen Elizabeth turns 96 with little fanfare
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Queen Elizabeth II turned 96 on Thursday, receiving a rousing "Happy Birthday" from a military band outside her Windsor Castle home, after a troubled year hit by health concerns.
Her grandson Prince William and his wife Kate called her "an inspiration to so many across the UK, the Commonwealth and the world."
But his 43 percent approval rating is still well behind that of his mother (69 percent), his eldest son Prince William (64 percent) and his daughter-in-law Kate Middleton (60 percent).
Last month there was controversy after the queen's disgraced second son Prince Andrew supported her at Prince Philip's memorial service.
The queen is head of state of Britain and 14 other Commonwealth countries around the world.
