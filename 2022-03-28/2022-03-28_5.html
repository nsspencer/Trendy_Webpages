     Miami Heat: Recent Skid Doesn’t Impact Title Contending Ability
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s no running around it, as the Miami Heat have walked through an alley of trouble after suffering four straight losses to Philadelphia, Golden State, New York, and Brooklyn Saturday night.
Despite holding the advantage on paper, Miami continued to be outperformed and even outclassed by teams who were without their first, second, or even third option, other than Brooklyn, of course.
To encapsulate it all, a lackluster defensive effort didn’t help the Heat’s chances.
For a team that was starting to gain some positive media attention in recent weeks, Miami’s outlook of being in title contention has now become a fallacy to many.
Now, before the rest of their schedule stands a team that is accused to be a shadow of themselves.

     Coup’s Takeaways: HEAT Bounce Back To Handle Kings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kings had zero answers for the HEAT, who also happened to hit just about every three they took (19-of-40, including a season-high three from Jimmy Butler, who scored 27).
But beyond the machinations of what transpired on the court, after a week the HEAT just had you take any win you can get in order to get right.
First the most obvious one, which is that Max Strus replaced Duncan Robinson in the starting lineup.
In this case, since Strus hadn’t been playing regularly when everyone was healthy an available, those ripples were significant.
Even in short minutes, Vincent has the talent to swing a playoff game in the coming months, and the HEAT are better when he’s available.

     Tyler Herro gets brutally honest on Heat’s brutal stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat finally ended their four-game losing streak on Monday with a big win over the Sacramento Kings.
It was a crucially important victory for the Heat whose struggles of late have led to a major bust-up within the squad.
Last Wednesday, in Miami’s 118-104 loss to the Golden State Warriors, Jimmy Butler got into a heated altercation with head coach Erik Spoelstra mid-game.
After the win, the Heat remain atop the Eastern Conference with a 48-28 record.
Herro is confident that his team will get back to winning ways sooner rather than later, though.

     Miami Heat vs Sacramento Kings: Heat search for rhythm against perpetually struggling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of those teams, the Miami Heat will meet up against Sacramento Kings.
Kings have been struggling (yet again)The Kings have won two games in a row and that too without their main players in Sabonis and Fox.
Not having Tyler Herro surely hurts the Heat on the offensive end and the team’s scoring balance has taken a hit.
I see Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo coming up a strong offensive night and I believe the Heat are coming with a strong offensive outing.
Prediction: The Kings have been doing better recently but against the Heat, they can feel the lack of shot creators.
