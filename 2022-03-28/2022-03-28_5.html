    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Biden Pitches $5.8 Trillion Plan With Record Tax Hike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden unveiled a $5.8 trillion budget request designed to appease moderate Democrats on Monday, with a proposal that emphasized deficit reduction, additional funding for police and veterans, and flexibility to negotiate new social spending programs.
Congress historically sets presidential budgets aside, and razor-thin Democratic majorities mean most proposals stand a slim chance of passing -- but they do form a key messaging device.
The White House included measures that would add up to the biggest tax increase in history in dollar terms, helping stabilize deficits relative to the size of the economy.

     Biden to ask Congress to fund the police with $32 billion in new spending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Details: The budget proposal to be released Monday will include $20.6 billion for the next fiscal year for Department of Justice discretionary spending on federal law enforcement, crime prevention and intervention.
That's $2 billion more than the $18.6 billion enacted for the current fiscal year.
The proposal also would mandate $30 billion in new spending over the next decade on a variety of programs to expand law enforcement and crime prevention.
The expanded discretionary spending would increase resources for federal prosecutors and give additional resources to state and local law enforcement to put more police on the beat.
It would significantly increase funds for law enforcement agencies to trace firearms found at crime scenes.

     Biden news latest: President returns home fighting off criticism over Putin gaffe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Joe Biden on Vladimir Putin’s leadership of RussiaPresident Joe Biden returned home on Sunday fighting off criticism from world leaders and experts for the unscripted shot the president took at Vladimir Putin over the weekend in which he remarked that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”.
The comments, which many critics say could inflame tensions and harden Mr Putin’s resolve, seemed to distract from what would otherwise be considered a successful four-day trip to Europe.
The president’s remarks were made as he toured Poland, where he warned Russia not to tread one inch on a Nato ally’s soil.
The president returned home to an administration struggling to earn back the electorate’s goodwill.
Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to bottom out on issues that matter most to voters, such as the economy, the ongoing pandemic and an increasingly complicated foreign policy crisis.

     Summary: As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, the proposed budget includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and "countering Russian aggression to support Ukraine."
Biden will speak about his budget proposal later on Monday.
"At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America," Biden wrote.
"Federal funding for the equipment, systems, and personnel that comprise the Nation's critical election infrastructure has been episodic or crisis-driven," the White House budget proposal said.
One notable plank of the proposal includes "making (mail-in) ballots postage-free," which is a priority for left-leaning voting rights groups.

Biden's budget also proposes to increase the corporate tax rate -- taxes that corporations pay on their profits -- to 28%.

     Biden’s budget plan: Higher taxes on rich, lower deficits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing.
The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households.
The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020.
They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation.

Biden has enjoyed some rare bipartisan support for his handling of the Ukraine crisis.
Just 26% of Americans have faith that Biden can manage a crisis or the military, according to last week’s AP-NORC poll.
Only 36% said his approach has been “about right,” while 56% said Biden has not been tough enough on Russia.
