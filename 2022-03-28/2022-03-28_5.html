     ASK IRA: Are the Heat getting cut down to size?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you play two big men in today’s NBA, it is because one of them has the type of 3-point range that retains the respect of the defense.
That Heat had that with Kelly Olynyk, and, to a degree, with Meyers Leonard.
Even with Dewayne Dedmon converting his occasional threes or Omer Yurtseven showing such range in limited minutes, it’s not as if that would definitively open the lane for Bam Adebayo or Jimmy Butler.
The problem is that the power forwards are decidedly undersized, when counting P.J.
Ultimately, Bam Adebayo simply has to come up big on the boards on a nightly basis.

     Miami Heat: Recent Skid Doesn’t Impact Title Contending Ability
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s no running around it, as the Miami Heat have walked through an alley of trouble after suffering four straight losses to Philadelphia, Golden State, New York, and Brooklyn Saturday night.
Despite holding the advantage on paper, Miami continued to be outperformed and even outclassed by teams who were without their first, second, or even third option, other than Brooklyn, of course.
To encapsulate it all, a lackluster defensive effort didn’t help the Heat’s chances.
For a team that was starting to gain some positive media attention in recent weeks, Miami’s outlook of being in title contention has now become a fallacy to many.
Now, before the rest of their schedule stands a team that is accused to be a shadow of themselves.

     Coup’s Takeaways: HEAT Bounce Back To Handle Kings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kings had zero answers for the HEAT, who also happened to hit just about every three they took (19-of-40, including a season-high three from Jimmy Butler, who scored 27).
But beyond the machinations of what transpired on the court, after a week the HEAT just had you take any win you can get in order to get right.
First the most obvious one, which is that Max Strus replaced Duncan Robinson in the starting lineup.
In this case, since Strus hadn’t been playing regularly when everyone was healthy an available, those ripples were significant.
Even in short minutes, Vincent has the talent to swing a playoff game in the coming months, and the HEAT are better when he’s available.

     Tyler Herro gets brutally honest on Heat’s brutal stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat finally ended their four-game losing streak on Monday with a big win over the Sacramento Kings.
It was a crucially important victory for the Heat whose struggles of late have led to a major bust-up within the squad.
Last Wednesday, in Miami’s 118-104 loss to the Golden State Warriors, Jimmy Butler got into a heated altercation with head coach Erik Spoelstra mid-game.
After the win, the Heat remain atop the Eastern Conference with a 48-28 record.
Herro is confident that his team will get back to winning ways sooner rather than later, though.

     Summary: Charlie Moore is one of at least three starters the Miami Hurricanes will lose from their Elite Eight team.
High school recruits and college players considering transferring now are more familiar with the Hurricanes’ fast-paced, team-oriented brand of basketball and their fun-loving culture.
“These days you have to recruit the transfer portal because brining in high school kids alone makes you very, very young,” Larranaga said.
Aire is 6-10 and a native of Nigeria who attends Bishop McNamara High School in Forestville, Md.
