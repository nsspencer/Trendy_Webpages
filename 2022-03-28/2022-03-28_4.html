     Summary: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — No one on North Carolina State’s roster was born the last time the Wolfpack reached their last Final Four 24 years ago.
Raina Perez was the closest to being alive back in 1998 — being born a few months after that run by legendary N.C State coach Kay Yow’s team.
“It’s huge for this program and it will take a lot of hard work and grit, especially since it’s UConn,” Perez said of reaching the Final Four.
UConn had a little easier time with Indiana, using a 16-0 run to start the third quarter to pull away from the Hoosiers.
“I agreed to a series with UConn starting next year,” Moore said.
