     Roman Abramovich Believes He Was Poisoned by Russia: Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roman Abramovich at the Kremlin in 2016.
Photo: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty ImagesRoman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch who has been attempting to broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, may have been poisoned along with multiple Ukrainian negotiators earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The Guardian’s Shaun Walker confirmed the reports and added new details about symptoms:A source with direct knowledge has just confirmed to me the WSJ/Bellingcat reports that Abramovich suffered symptoms of poisoning.
With his purchase of the Chelsea Football Club 19 years ago, Abramovich, who made billions in post-Soviet early 1990s Russia, had positioned himself as a West-friendly oligarch.
Abramovich is likely eager to reinforce his reputation as he shuttles back and forth between capitals.
