     Why Tesla's Planned Stock Split Is a 'Good Thing for the Retail Investor'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The company did not indicate what the ratio would be for the stock split, or when the split would take place.
Tesla split its stock 5-for-1 in 2020, around the same time Apple also split its stock.
A stock split does not affect the value of the stock that investors hold.
"A stock split for a company with a stock price per share this high is always a good thing for the retail investor," says Seth Goldstein, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.
Tesla's stock price took off immediately after its stock split in 2020.
