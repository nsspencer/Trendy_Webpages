     Tesla wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend; shares gain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders, according to a filing Monday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said the electric car maker will ask at its annual shareholders meeting "for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company's common stock in the form of a stock dividend."
A stock dividend is a dividend paid to shareholders in the form of additional company shares instead of cash.
In other words, if there is a 6-for-1 split, investors will get a stock dividend of five shares for every one share of Tesla they own.
The company last split its stock in August 2020.

     Tesla to seek shareholder approval for stock split; shares surge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: March 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split in the form of a dividend, the electric-car maker said on Monday, sending its shares up about 5%.
The stock split, if approved, would be the latest after a five-for-one split in August 2020 that made Tesla shares cheaper for its employees and investors.
Tesla shares soar after stock split in 2020 Tesla shares soar after stock split in 2020Since the stock split in 2020, they have surged 128%, boosting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion and making it the biggest U.S. automaker by that measure.
"This (stock split) could further fuel the bubble in Tesla's stock that has been brewing over the past two years," said David Trainer, chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs.

     Tesla Seeks Shareholders' Approval for Stock Dividend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, a stock dividend is substantially different than a cash dividend, and whether they benefit shareholders at all is debatable.
Key Takeaways Tesla is planning a stock dividend after it gets its shareholders' approval.
Stock dividends have much more in common with stock splits than they do with cash dividends.
Stock dividends, unlike cash dividends, dilute the value of each share like a stock split.
The Bottom LineTesla is looking for shareholder approval for a "stock dividend," which, despite the name, is much more like a miniature stock split than it is like a conventional cash dividend.

     Tesla Seeks 2nd Stock Split in Less Than 2 Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Tesla jumped at the opening bell Monday after the electric car maker announced its second stock split in less than two years.
Tesla's shares are up more than 60% over the past year, with each costing more than $1,000.
A stock split does would change the price-per-stock, but not the overall value of those holdings.
Tesla had a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, which went into effect one day after the company announced that it planned to sell up to $5 billion worth of its stock.
Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced a 20-for-1 split in February Amazon.com Inc. said this month that it would do a split of the same ratio.
