     Kristen Stewart Wore a Completely See-Through Lace Chanel Dress to the Oscars 2022 After Party: See Pics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kristen Stewart’s sartorial journey throughout her campaign for Spencer—which began with a chic Chanel nightgown at the Venice Film Festival back in September 2021—has been nothing short of interesting.
After wearing short shorts in a Chanel ensemble for the Oscars 2022 ceremony, Stewart went more glam for the Vanity Fair after party in a completely sheer lace Chanel gown.
The long-sleeved lace see-through long gown from Chanel is black (a fave color of Stewart’s), and it has a deep V-neck neckline.
Stewart wore her hair down for the ceremony but opted for an easy updo with chunky pieces framing her face for the after party.
For makeup, Stewart stayed consistent with her signature triangular-shaped smokey eye and a rosy-nude lip.

     Kristen Stewart Swapped Her Oscars 2022 Heels for a Comfier Shoe Almost Immediately — See Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kristen Stewart was apparently tired of carrying the weight of being a style icon at the Oscars 2022, as she participated in an immediate post-red carpet outfit change.
When Kristen first hit the Oscars red carpet, she did so in a custom Chanel ‘fit, complete with shorts.
“Kristen Stewart immediately changed out of heels and into flats the second she got off the red carpet.
And, well, Kristen technically even walked the red carpet in the loafers and was photographed with fiancée Dylan Meyer.
Along with Internet sleuthing on who last wore shorts to the Oscars, Tara and Kristen focused on creating an Oscars outfit that was totally K.Stew.

     Kristen Stewart's Oscars 2022 red carpet make-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A master of the signature beauty look, Kristen Stewart is our poster girl for polished rock 'n' roll glamour.
On the red carpet her delicate features often showcase lived-in smoky eye make-up and a hint of nude lipstick which together look effortless (although we know they're not).
In addition, her creamy complexion is always suffused with luminosity, a purposeful luxe touch which elevates her tomboyish nonchalance.
Last night at the 2022 Oscars ceremony the vibe was no different, with the actress keeping "her make-up look classic and authentically Kristen," as her long-term make-up artist Jillian Dempsey explains.
On Stewart's lips was their "go-to lipstick", Depmsey revealed on her Instagram Stories: the Rouge Allure L’Extrait Lipstick in 812 – a radiant pale pinky-nude.

     The Only Thing Better Than Kristen Stewart's Oscars Shorts Was the Shoes She Ditched Her Heels For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, the Spencer star, who was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Princess Diana, walked the 2022 Oscars red carpet in a sheer white button-down (which was barely buttoned), a sleek black blazer, and — wait for it — shorts.
While we're obsessed with Stewart's unconventional, head-to-toe Chanel look, it's the choice she made post-red carpet that we're saluting even more.
After she graced Hollywood's fanciest carpet in classic black pumps, Stewart promptly ditched her heels and slipped into something more comfortable: socks and loafers.

     Oh, God, Is Kristen Stewart’s 2022 Oscar Look Going to Bring Back Formal Shorts?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s get one thing straight: Spencer star Kristen Stewart’s Oscar look was perfection.
Perfection.
I loved everything about Stewart’s look, including—especially?—her change into white socks and loafers, and as a queer woman, seeing Stewart arrive at Hollywood’s biggest night with fiancée Dylan Meyer felt particularly meaningful to me.
Now that I’ve extolled the virtues of Stewart’s Oscar look and the apparent joy of her relationship, let’s get down to brass tacks.
Board shorts and bike shorts, I’m more than okay with, but the luxe, frequently pinstripe kind that The O.C.’s Marissa Cooper would so often pair with a barely-there tube top and—horror of horrors—a shrug?
