    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A US official has cast doubt on claims that sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators were victims of a poisoning earlier this month.
The Guardian's Shaun Walker said Mr Abramovich lost his sight for several hours and had to be treated in Turkey.
Mr Abramovich has reportedly travelled between Moscow and Kyiv during the several rounds of negotiations amid the war.

     Roman Abramovich, Ukrainian negotiators poisoned in Kyiv talks - WSJ
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian-Israeli oligarch Roman Abramovich and three Ukrainian negotiators in the ceasefire talks were allegedly poisoned during a meeting in Kyiv in early March, Netherlands-based open-source intelligence group Bellingcat confirmed a Wall Street Journal report on Monday.
Sources claimed they were poisoned by Russian hardliners who want to sabotage ceasefire negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, the report stated.
A source close to Abramovich, however, said that it was not clear who targeted the oligarch and the Ukrainian delegation.
Emergency services wearing protective clothing work near the bench where former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned in Salisbury, Britain, March 13, 2018.
A US official said on Monday that intelligence suggests the sickening of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators was due to an environmental factor, not poisoning.
