     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Biden news latest: President not walking back Putin comment, says ‘ridiculous’ to think US would take him down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Biden stands by Putin removal comment but insists he's not changing policyPresident Joe Biden refused to back down from comments he made at the weekend saying Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power, but insisted that he was not advocating for a change in policy.
He returned home on Sunday fighting off criticism from world leaders and experts for the unscripted shot the president took at Vladimir Putin over the weekend.
“I’m not walking anything back,” he told NBC News reporter Kelly O’Donnell on Monday at the White House.
“The fact of the matter is, I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the actions of this man.”The president returned home to an administration struggling to earn back the electorate’s goodwill.
Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to bottom out on issues that matter most to voters, such as the economy, the ongoing pandemic and an increasingly complicated foreign policy crisis.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man,” Biden said.
Biden on Monday rejected the idea that his comment could escalate tensions over the war in Ukraine or that it would fuel Russian propaganda about Western aggression.
“The fact they do doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage about it.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stalled in many areas.
French President Emanuel Macron said Sunday he “wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what do we want to do collectively?
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said then that Biden was “speaking from the heart” rather than articulating a legal conclusion.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power."
The first question to Biden was: "Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that?
"Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin," Biden added.
His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a "butcher" and saying he "cannot remain in power."
"I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin," Macron said in an interview with France 3.

AdvertisementThe budget says the increase funds efforts like countering global threats, modernizing U.S. nuclear forces and improving cybersecurity.
It's no coincidence that Biden's budget calls for an increase in defense spending amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
Last year, Biden's budget sought to increase the deficit over 10 years by almost $1.4 trillion.
Biden's budget also proposes to increase the corporate tax rate -- taxes that corporations pay on their profits -- to 28%.

     Biden’s budget plan: Higher taxes on rich, lower deficits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing.
The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households.
The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020.
They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation.

     Summary: Rather, they argue that Biden was saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over neighboring nations.
The improvised comment about Putin wasn't planned and surprised aides who were watching Biden's speech on television or at the event site.
In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West's confrontation with Russia.
Biden said Monday that he doesn't care what Putin thinks about the comment, saying, "He's going to do what he's going to do."
"I wouldn't use terms like that because I'm still in talks with President Putin," Macron said during an interview on Sunday with French Channel France 3.

The President claimed his budget proposal "will be among the largest investments in our national security in history."
The national security spending proposal has already sparked criticism on both sides of the aisle.

Biden's budget proposal for the 2023 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, lays out his administration's priorities, including campaign promises to make the wealthy and companies pay more tax.
It is merely a wish list as lawmakers on Capitol Hill make the final decisions on budget matters.
BILLIONAIRES TAXLindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said Biden's tax hikes would harm U.S. workers and the overall economy, while increasing deficits.
The budget plan also targets U.S. corporate buybacks, requiring company executives to hold on to company shares that they receive for several years after a stock buyback.

President Joe Biden says 'brutality will never grind down the will to be free' and "Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
Richard Haass, an American diplomat who heads the Council on Foreign Relations, said Biden had “made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous”.
“Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.”The comments by @potus made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous.
The US president has already personalised the conflict by calling Putin a thug, a murderous dictator, war criminal and now a butcher.
