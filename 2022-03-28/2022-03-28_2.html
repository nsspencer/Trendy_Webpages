     Summary: What happenedIs this the mother of all short squeezes that AMC Entertainment ( AMC 23.22% ) investors have been waiting for?
After another week of a rapidly rising stock price, shares of AMC were soaring 22.2% at 11:30 a.m. EST on Monday.
So whatAMC remains a highly shorted stock, with more than 20% of its shares outstanding sold short.
