     Will Smith Owned the Williams Sisters’ Story Onscreen. Then He Stole Their Moment.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The table was set for a moment of family triumph.
Venus and Serena Williams were dressed and seated for the grand occasion on Sunday night, and Will Smith, who had played their father Richard with uncanny similitude in the movie “King Richard,” was poised to win the Oscar for best actor.
But then, as so often happens with the Williamses, things got complicated — and, through no fault of the sisters, an evening that should have affirmed their against-great-odds rise to stardom instead became about Smith slapping the comedian Chris Rock onstage.
When Smith accepted the Oscar, he delivered a tearful, rambling, semi-apologetic speech in which he said that “art imitates life” and “I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams.”Serena, watching the speech from a front-row box seat, covered her face with her hand.
Unexpected and uncomfortable to watch, Smith’s failure to control his temper or rise to the occasion turned the night into one that the Williams sisters will never forget, for all the wrong reasons.

Venus Williams: I’m absolutely obsessed with the tennis fashions and the surge in tennis skirts.
And I think tennis also plays into that, because it’s a game that you can play anywhere.
I’ve obviously played tennis forever and I know the Lacoste brand, and I know the history behind it from tennis.
