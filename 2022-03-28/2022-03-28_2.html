     Tesla (TSLA) announces another stock split; shareholders to vote later this year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla (TSLA) announced today that it is planning a new stock split, and it is going to put it to a shareholder vote later this year.
Back in 2020, Tesla announced a five for one stock split.
At the time, Tesla’s stock was trading at around $1,300 a share, but the stock split announcement sent its stock price surging to a record high of $2,000 a share.
— Tesla (@Tesla) March 28, 2022The announcement today sent Tesla’s stock price up 5% in pre-market trading – or about $1,060 a share.
Traditionally, companies have announced stock splits to make their price per share more reasonable after their stock price has risen considerably.

     Tesla Jumps on Plan to Seek Approval for Another Stock Split
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla Inc. said it’s planning a second stock split in roughly two years, giving a lift to shares that had been trading lower on news Covid-19 is again disrupting operations.
In an oddly worded tweet early Monday, Tesla said it will seek shareholder approval to authorize additional stock to enable a split.
In a follow-up regulatory filing, the company said increasing the number of its common shares will allow for a split by way of a dividend.
The ratio of the split is one of the details that will be worked out later.

     Summary: Tesla aims to ask the shareholders at the 2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to vote their opinion about another stock split.
This is certainly a forward-looking statement by Tesla and if the company shareholders don’t approve it, the 2022 TSLA stock split will be called off.
The first-ever Tesla stock split took place back in 2020.

     Will a Second Tesla Stock Split Spark Another Rally?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla (TSLA, $1,010.64) on Monday signaled its second stock split in less than two years and became the third company in the trillion-dollar market cap club to propose a split in the past couple of months.
The company's notice of a Tesla stock split follows Amazon.com's (AMZN, $3,295.47) proposed 20-for-1 AMZN stock split announced earlier this month, as well as Google parent Alphabet's (GOOGL, $2,833.46) 20-for-1 GOOGL stock split disclosed in early February.
The downside to stock splits is that a company's stock usually goes up even though nothing under the hood has changed.
A stock split is essentially the same thing as making change: swapping, say, a $5 bill for five $1 bills.
That's why some strategists are telling investors they should take any pop from the Tesla stock split as a chance to get out while the getting is good.
