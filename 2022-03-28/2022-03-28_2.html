     Venus Williams Is Fighting To Close The Gender Pay Gap With Her New ‘Privilege Tax’ Initiative
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MadameNoire Featured VideoEven with her stardom in the tennis world, Venus Williams knows what it feels like to be underpaid and undervalued.
The California native secured her first Grand Slam win in 1998 and went on to earn four Olympic gold medals during her historic run on the court.
Now, Williams is working hard to close the gender pay gap with her Privilege Tax organization.
Brands who opt to partner with Privilege Tax can donate $1 in an effort to close the glaring pay gap.
The move comes following the U.S. Women’s National Team’s ( USWNT) landmark agreement with the American governing body to end a toiling six-year legal battle over equal pay.
