     UConn women’s basketball forward Dorka Juhász suffers season-ending left wrist fracture in NCAA Elite Eight win over NC State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juhász, fighting for an offensive rebound in the second quarter, hit the floor hard and crashed into the base of the basket as the Wolfpack’s Camille Hobby was called for the foul.
Juhász rolled over on her back and curled up, her sobbing audible as the crowd grew quiet.
UConn coaches and medical staff rushed out to helped her up.
Her left wrist bent awkwardly during the collision, and she was holding it as she walked off to a standing ovation.

     For UConn, a Rougher Path Than Usual Still Leads to the Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By many measures, that the Huskies made it to Bridgeport at all, much less its regional final, was a testament to their depth and talent.
The Huskies have employed 11 different setups this season, and their longest streak with a consistent lineup was six games.
Fudd, a freshman who has been a star for UConn behind the 3-point arc, missed 11 games because of a foot injury.
The season’s first loss came in November, a pummeling in the Bahamas by South Carolina, the national tournament’s top overall seed.
Coronavirus issues at UConn led to the cancellations of Big East matchups against Georgetown and Villanova.

     Summary: The University of Connecticut women's basketball team is playing for a spot in the Final Four on Monday night.
Over the weekend, UConn played Indiana University.
Our defense, we have to be aware of what's going on at all times," said UConn senior guard Christyn Williams.
We're at our best when we're going up and down the floor," said UConn Women's Basketball head coach Geno Auriemma.
The UConn women have played in the Final Four for the last 13 years.

     Connecticut and Louisville clinch spots in women’s Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 Louisville stayed very much on-brand with an aggressive, opportunistic defensive effort it rode to a 62-50 win over No.
The Cardinals, making their fourth straight appearance in the Elite Eight, are going to their fourth Final Four and first since 2018.
After entering the game leading the women’s NCAA tournament in steals and forced turnovers, Louisville got Michigan to cough up the ball 22 times and notched a total of 15 steals.
Senior guard Chelsie Hall had four steals and 15 points.
The Big Ten team also had an 36-30 advantage in rebounding but it hit just 3 of 14 shots from beyond the arc, compared to 5 of 15 for Louisville.

     UConn women’s basketball aims for 14th straight trip to Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — No one on North Carolina State’s roster was born the last time the Wolfpack reached their last Final Four 24 years ago.
Raina Perez was the closest to being alive back in 1998 — being born a few months after that run by legendary N.C State coach Kay Yow’s team.
“It’s huge for this program and it will take a lot of hard work and grit, especially since it’s UConn,” Perez said of reaching the Final Four.
UConn had a little easier time with Indiana, using a 16-0 run to start the third quarter to pull away from the Hoosiers.
“I agreed to a series with UConn starting next year,” Moore said.

     Summary: BRIDGEPORT — Minutes after the UConn women’s basketball team completed an exhausting double-overtime victory over NC State in the regional final, the players circled Dorka Juhász as they celebrated at midcourt.
UConn was leading NC State 25-18 when Juhász went down with 6:19 left in the first half.
After playing just three minutes in a Sweet 16 win over Indiana Saturday, Juhász was active and producing when she entered the game Monday.
“But you know, Coach got us together and basically just told us the biggest thing we could do for her was win the game and win it for her.
After losing to Arizona in the national semifinal last year, Auriemma viewed Juhász as perhaps the missing piece.

You know you’re going to be playing a really, really good team and you know you’re going to have to play your best.
It just goes to show you their resolve and their ability to just play and play the whole 40 minutes.
Who that is, I don’t know, because again, we haven’t had our team together except for the last three or four weeks.
