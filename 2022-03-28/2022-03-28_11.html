     Julia Fox Goes For Full-Length Leather—and a ‘Human Hair’ Clutch—at the Oscars After-Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Traditionally, the Oscars and its after-parties are rife with Old Hollywood glamour-inspired looks that range from breathtaking embellished gowns to more understated off-the-runway numbers.
But when it comes to Julia Fox, red carpet rules are made to be broken.
Fox dialled up the drama with an avant garde cat-eye.
Arturo HolmesOf course, it wouldn’t be a Fox look if the eye makeup wasn’t dramatic.
This time, the actor opted for a major cat eye moment with brow details reminiscent of her Paris Fashion Week debut in denim Schiaparelli.

     Julia Fox Wore a Clawed Hand Around Her Neck to the Oscars After-Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Uncut Gems star and former Kanye West muse attended last night's Vanity Fair Oscars after-party wearing yet another avant-garde look.
This time around, Fox's head-to-toe black monochrome look consisted of a leather gown with a halter neckline featuring a clawed hand around her neck.
Besides her handsy Oscars after-party gown, Fox has been showing off her personal style with a streak of clingy, midriff-baring outfits as of late.
While sitting front row at the Versace show during Milan Fashion Week, for instance, she wore a latex set with exposed straps and cutouts.
And before that, while making matching appearances with West during Paris Fashion Week, Fox opted for various conical-breast looks from Schiaparelli.
