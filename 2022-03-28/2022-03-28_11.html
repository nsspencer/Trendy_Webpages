     Snow Squall Leads to 50-Car Pileup on Pennsylvania Highway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A blinding snow squall led to a fiery pileup on a Pennsylvania interstate on Monday morning that involved at least 50 vehicles, including several tractor-trailers, the authorities said.
About 20 people were taken to hospitals, John Blickley, a spokesman for the Schuylkill County Office of Emergency Management, said on Monday.
He did not know of any fatalities and did not have information about the severity of the injuries.
“The road conditions when the squall came through contributed to the accident,” Mr. Blickley said.
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation referred questions about the crash to the Pennsylvania State Police, which wrote on Twitter on Monday afternoon that 50 to 60 vehicles were involved in the pileup and that a fire continued to burn at the scene.

Forty people were injured and three killed during a pileup caused by a snow squall on Interstate 75 in Detroit in 2013.
Snow squalls are so dangerous that, in 2017, the National Weather Service decided to debut a “snow squall warning” that would be targeted at drivers who might find themselves in the path of a snow squall.
Aside from snow squall warnings, the NWS alerts that lead to WEA activation are:Tornado warnings.
