     The Big Question Twitter Had For Tracee Ellis Ross' Stylist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Big Question Twitter Had For Tracee Ellis Ross' StylistWith red being the "it" color of choice for Hollywood's most glamorous women at the 94th Annual Academy Awards, Tracee Ellis Ross did not disappoint.
When Ross walked out to present the award for Best Adapted Screenplay with co-presenter Shawn Mendes, she stunned in a ruby red Carolina Herrera gown with a mermaid hemline and matching shawl wrap over her shoulders.
She even wore a stunning Niwaka necklace to complement the old-time Hollywood ensemble with a very modern kick, according to Town &amp; Country.
However, all eyes couldn't help but go to her neckline, which some might say was way beyond plunging.
In fact, it looked as if Ross could have had a wardrobe malfunction reminiscent of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl and social media couldn't stop talking about it (via Women's Health).
