     UConn women’s basketball forward Dorka Juhász suffers season-ending left wrist fracture in NCAA Elite Eight win over NC State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juhász, fighting for an offensive rebound in the second quarter, hit the floor hard and crashed into the base of the basket as the Wolfpack’s Camille Hobby was called for the foul.
Juhász rolled over on her back and curled up, her sobbing audible as the crowd grew quiet.
UConn coaches and medical staff rushed out to helped her up.
Her left wrist bent awkwardly during the collision, and she was holding it as she walked off to a standing ovation.

     For UConn, a Rougher Path Than Usual Still Leads to the Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By many measures, that the Huskies made it to Bridgeport at all, much less its regional final, was a testament to their depth and talent.
The Huskies have employed 11 different setups this season, and their longest streak with a consistent lineup was six games.
Fudd, a freshman who has been a star for UConn behind the 3-point arc, missed 11 games because of a foot injury.
The season’s first loss came in November, a pummeling in the Bahamas by South Carolina, the national tournament’s top overall seed.
Coronavirus issues at UConn led to the cancellations of Big East matchups against Georgetown and Villanova.

     UConn women’s basketball team regroups after Dorka Juhász injured: ‘Get this win for her’

     Summary: BRIDGEPORT — Minutes after the UConn women’s basketball team completed an exhausting double-overtime victory over NC State in the regional final, the players circled Dorka Juhász as they celebrated at midcourt.
UConn was leading NC State 25-18 when Juhász went down with 6:19 left in the first half.
After playing just three minutes in a Sweet 16 win over Indiana Saturday, Juhász was active and producing when she entered the game Monday.
“But you know, Coach got us together and basically just told us the biggest thing we could do for her was win the game and win it for her.
After losing to Arizona in the national semifinal last year, Auriemma viewed Juhász as perhaps the missing piece.
