     Miami Heat: Recent Skid Doesn’t Impact Title Contending Ability
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s no running around it, as the Miami Heat have walked through an alley of trouble after suffering four straight losses to Philadelphia, Golden State, New York, and Brooklyn Saturday night.
Despite holding the advantage on paper, Miami continued to be outperformed and even outclassed by teams who were without their first, second, or even third option, other than Brooklyn, of course.
To encapsulate it all, a lackluster defensive effort didn’t help the Heat’s chances.
For a team that was starting to gain some positive media attention in recent weeks, Miami’s outlook of being in title contention has now become a fallacy to many.
Now, before the rest of their schedule stands a team that is accused to be a shadow of themselves.

     ASK IRA: Are the Heat getting cut down to size?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you play two big men in today’s NBA, it is because one of them has the type of 3-point range that retains the respect of the defense.
That Heat had that with Kelly Olynyk, and, to a degree, with Meyers Leonard.
Even with Dewayne Dedmon converting his occasional threes or Omer Yurtseven showing such range in limited minutes, it’s not as if that would definitively open the lane for Bam Adebayo or Jimmy Butler.
The problem is that the power forwards are decidedly undersized, when counting P.J.
Ultimately, Bam Adebayo simply has to come up big on the boards on a nightly basis.

     NBA Power Rankings: Celtics climb, Lakers crater as regular season winds down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A team that looked completely dead after 50 games is now leading the Eastern conference with seven games left in the season.
The Celtics are 22-3 since they were 25-25, led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
On the flip side of the country, the Los Angeles Lakers continue to crater.
San Antonio has been playing with young guys all season, but that roster has managed to get into play-in contention.
The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat remain at the top of the rankings, despite the Heat losing out on the top seed in the East for now.
