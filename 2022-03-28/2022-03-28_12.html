     Julia Fox Wore a Clawed Hand Around Her Neck to the Oscars After-Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Uncut Gems star and former Kanye West muse attended last night's Vanity Fair Oscars after-party wearing yet another avant-garde look.
This time around, Fox's head-to-toe black monochrome look consisted of a leather gown with a halter neckline featuring a clawed hand around her neck.
Besides her handsy Oscars after-party gown, Fox has been showing off her personal style with a streak of clingy, midriff-baring outfits as of late.
While sitting front row at the Versace show during Milan Fashion Week, for instance, she wore a latex set with exposed straps and cutouts.
And before that, while making matching appearances with West during Paris Fashion Week, Fox opted for various conical-breast looks from Schiaparelli.
