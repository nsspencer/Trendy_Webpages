     ‘Don’t Say Gay' bill signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Monday that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, a policy that has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ people.
DeSantis and Republicans have repeatedly said the measure is reasonable and that parents, not teachers, should be broaching subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children.
“We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination,” DeSantis said before he signed the bill into law.
Critics say the bill is so vaguely worded that speech could be muzzled throughout public schools.
DeSantis signed the bill after a news conference held at the Classical Preparatory School in Spring Hill, about 46 miles (74 kilometers) north of Tampa.

     Summary: Florida's governor signs controversial law opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay'Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesPublic school teachers in Florida are banned from holding classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity after Florida's Gov.
The bill, which some opponents have called "Don't Say Gay," was signed by DeSantis on Monday.
The "Don't Say Gay" moniker comes from critics of the measure who blast this idea and insist this policy will hurt LGBTQ children.
The Trevor Project condemned the signing of the bill saying the bill erases "LGBTQ identity, history, and culture — as well as LGBTQ students themselves."
"Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law," the statement read.

     Summary: Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law on Monday that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, a policy that has drawn intense national scrutiny fromcritics who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ people.
The legislation has pushed Florida and DeSantis, an ascending Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, to the forefront of the country's culture wars.
LGBTQ advocates, students, Democrats, the entertainment industry, and the White House have dubbed the measure the “Don't Say Gay” law.
The law went into effect just days after DeSantis signed a separate bill that potentially restricts what books elementary schools can keep in their libraries or use for instruction.
DeSantis signed the bill after a news conference held at the Classical Preparatory School in Spring Hill, about 46 miles (74 kilometers) north of Tampa.

     DeSantis signs "Don't Say Gay" bill into law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron DeSantis (R) on Monday signed into law the controversial Parental Rights in Education Bill — dubbed by critics the "Don't Say Gay" bill — to ban classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through 3rd grade.
For higher grade levels, the bill says that instruction should be "age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate" by state academic standards.
DeSantis and Republicans claim that parents should be the ones to bring up topics of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children, but critics say the bill amounts to censorship.
"I don't care what corporate media outlets say, what Hollywood says, what big corporations say.
Disney released a statement moments after DeSantis signed the bill, lambasting it by saying it "should never have passed and should never have been signed into law."

     Summary: The bill would also allow parents to sue schools or teachers who violate the legislation.
DeSantis' signature comes after nationwide pushback from top LGBTQ+ organizations, Democrats, LGBTQ+ youth, corporations, and the White House.
LGBTQ+ youth across the state vehemently protested the bill, with thousands of students staging a walkout at the beginning of the month.
This bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, effectively erasing LGBTQ identity, history, and culture — as well as LGBTQ students themselves.
"Governor Ron DeSantis signed the 'Don't Say Gay' bill in the most cowardly way possible today.

     DeSantis signs bill dubbed ‘don’t say gay,’ says that it’s about parents’ rights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, surrounded by Republican legislators, the governor signed House Bill 1557, called the “Parental Rights in Education” bill.
Support parents.”DeSantis signed the bill at Classical Preparatory School, a charter school started in 2014 by the wife of Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran.
Some LGBTQ advocates worry that provision could lead to schools outing gay or transgender kids to their parents.
The bill requires schools to inform parents every year about health services offered and to give them the opportunity to accept or reject those services.
Defiant DeSantis doubles downAs lawmakers debated the bill earlier this year, hundreds of Florida students took to the halls of the Capitol in Tallahassee to voice their opposition.
