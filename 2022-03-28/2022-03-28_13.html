     Summary: Ron DeSantis (R) on Monday signed into law the controversial Parental Rights in Education Bill — dubbed by critics the "Don't Say Gay" bill — to ban classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through 3rd grade.
For higher grade levels, the bill says that instruction should be "age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate" by state academic standards.
DeSantis and Republicans claim that parents should be the ones to bring up topics of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children, but critics say the bill amounts to censorship.
"I don't care what corporate media outlets say, what Hollywood says, what big corporations say.
Disney released a statement moments after DeSantis signed the bill, lambasting it by saying it "should never have passed and should never have been signed into law."

     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by opponents, has garnered nationwide attention and has been mocked during a “Saturday Night Live” sketch and in the opening monologue at Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony along with strong condemnation from federal officials.
Still, proponents of the legislation have repeatedly touted it as a parental rights bill, despite claims from those in opposition saying it targets LGBTQ individuals.
DeSantis added to the parental rights rhetoric on Monday, claiming that a “national trend” exists to “cut parents out” of their child’s education.
I have your back, and my Administration will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve," Biden tweeted last month as the bill advanced.
“I don't care what corporate media outlets say, I don’t care what Hollywood says, I don’t care what big corporations say – here I stand.
