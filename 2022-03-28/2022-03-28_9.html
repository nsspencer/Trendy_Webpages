     Celtics center Robert Williams feared to have meniscus tear in left knee: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Celtics center Robert Williams is feared to have a meniscus tear in his left knee, sources told The Athletic.
The injury would sideline Williams indefinitely and hurt the postseason chances of the Celtics, who have surged to the top spot in the Eastern Conference.
Williams left Sunday's game against Minnesota in the third quarter with the injury.
He's been key in Boston's defense and is likely to receive consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.
The Celtics have won six in a row and are 24-4 since Jan. 23.

     Summary: Kendrick Perkins breaks down how big a loss Robert Williams III's injury absence is for the Celtics.
(1:13)Boston Celtics center Robert Williams III -- an anchor of the league's best defense -- suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee, the team announced Monday.
Boston moved into first place in the Eastern Conference on Sunday, and Williams, 24, has been an immense part of a dominant league-best defense.
He was injured in the 134-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday -- the Celtics' 24th victory in 28 games.
Williams -- who signed a new four-year, $54 million extension in the offseason -- has averaged 10 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks.

     Summary: The news that Robert Williams has a torn meniscus and will be sidelined indefinitely hit like a gut punch just hours after the Boston Celtics ascended to the top spot in the Eastern Conference.
The Celtics’ starting five, of course, had been an absolute juggernaut this season, owning a plus-24.6 net rating in 443 minutes together.
That group owns a minus-8.2 net rating, with Boston’s defensive rating spiking from 97.0 with the entire quintet to 114.9 without him.

     Robert Williams Has Torn Meniscus: Where Do the Celtics Go from Here?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest update on Robert Williams raises concern for his ability to contribute to the Celtics' title run this postseason.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Williams suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee, sidelining him indefinitely.
According to Healthline, the recovery for a meniscus tear takes about six to eight weeks if it's treated conservatively, without surgery.
The Celtics may have to advance past the first two rounds again for Williams to rejoin the fold.
It's a concerning injury that may spell the end of Robert Williams' season, but don't rule out him or the Celtics just yet.

     Celtics' Robert Williams III suffers torn meniscus in left knee, out indefinitely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Celtics center Robert Williams III has suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee and, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, will be out at least several weeks.
Given the nature of meniscus tears, Williams could potentially be out a good deal longer, though the exact timeline is unclear at this stage.
The team released a statement Monday:Following imaging this morning, Celtics center Robert Williams III was diagnosed with a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee.
But Boston's defense had been perhaps the most dangerous overall weapon any team in the NBA had over the past few months and it just took a serious hit.
Williams was essential to the Celtics, and his recovery will be a key to Boston potentially making a run to the Finals.
