    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Biden to ask Congress to fund the police with $32 billion in new spending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Details: The budget proposal to be released Monday will include $20.6 billion for the next fiscal year for Department of Justice discretionary spending on federal law enforcement, crime prevention and intervention.
That's $2 billion more than the $18.6 billion enacted for the current fiscal year.
The proposal also would mandate $30 billion in new spending over the next decade on a variety of programs to expand law enforcement and crime prevention.
The expanded discretionary spending would increase resources for federal prosecutors and give additional resources to state and local law enforcement to put more police on the beat.
It would significantly increase funds for law enforcement agencies to trace firearms found at crime scenes.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Biden stands by Putin removal comment but insists he's not changing policyPresident Joe Biden refused to back down from comments he made at the weekend saying Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power, but insisted that he was not advocating for a change in policy.
He returned home on Sunday fighting off criticism from world leaders and experts for the unscripted shot the president took at Vladimir Putin over the weekend.
“I’m not walking anything back,” he told NBC News reporter Kelly O’Donnell on Monday at the White House.
“The fact of the matter is, I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the actions of this man.”The president returned home to an administration struggling to earn back the electorate’s goodwill.
Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to bottom out on issues that matter most to voters, such as the economy, the ongoing pandemic and an increasingly complicated foreign policy crisis.

     Biden budget plan would levy minimum tax on billionaires, boost national security
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden sent a new $5.8 trillion budget request to Congress on Monday that calls on lawmakers to institute a minimum tax on billionaires and boost spending on national security.
“This minimum tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households — those with more than $100 million — and over half the revenue would come from billionaires alone,” the budget proposal states.
“Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017,” Biden’s budget states, referring to a major tax cut law signed by then-President Donald Trump.
In addition to the funding boost for defense, Biden also asks Congress to raise spending on domestic safety initiatives, including policing.
Biden originally asked Congress to create the program in last year’s budget request, with lawmakers setting aside $1 billion.

AdvertisementThe budget says the increase funds efforts like countering global threats, modernizing U.S. nuclear forces and improving cybersecurity.
It's no coincidence that Biden's budget calls for an increase in defense spending amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
Last year, Biden's budget sought to increase the deficit over 10 years by almost $1.4 trillion.
Biden's budget also proposes to increase the corporate tax rate -- taxes that corporations pay on their profits -- to 28%.

     Biden’s budget plan: Higher taxes on rich, lower deficits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing.
The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households.
The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020.
They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden’s speech Saturday in Warsaw at the conclusion of his European trip was the most significant of this war and probably of his presidency.
It was surprisingly bellicose and hostile, especially in his stunning call for Putin’s overthrow.
"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," Biden said.
Many presidents have privately wanted the ouster of a foreign power but I can’t remember one who has openly called for it.
In the short term, Biden has sent a message of toughness that will be widely welcomed by Ukrainians as well as many Americans and Europeans.

The White House and friendly Democrats leapt to explain that the president was not endorsing regime change as a policy matter.
Polls have shown growing frustration with Biden's handling of Ukraine, even while most Americans favor specific steps the president has taken.
Now the White House is left emphasizing that it doesn't favor Putin being thrown out of power.

     Summary: Rather, they argue that Biden was saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over neighboring nations.
The improvised comment about Putin wasn't planned and surprised aides who were watching Biden's speech on television or at the event site.
In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West's confrontation with Russia.
Biden said Monday that he doesn't care what Putin thinks about the comment, saying, "He's going to do what he's going to do."
"I wouldn't use terms like that because I'm still in talks with President Putin," Macron said during an interview on Sunday with French Channel France 3.

Biden on Monday rejected the idea that his comment could escalate tensions over the war in Ukraine or that it would fuel Russian propaganda about Western aggression.
“The fact they do doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage about it.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stalled in many areas.
French President Emanuel Macron said Sunday he “wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what do we want to do collectively?
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said then that Biden was “speaking from the heart” rather than articulating a legal conclusion.
