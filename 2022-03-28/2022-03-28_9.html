     Summary: Lupita Nyong'o, you never let us down.
This time, we have Prada to thank.
A vision in gold sequins that morphed into what we can only describe as floaty streamers from the waist down, dotted with a few pale pink spring flowers that shouldn't work against such a bold backdrop - but totally do.

     The best jewellery from the 2022 Oscars red carpet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While it's the fashion and all those custom-made couture gowns that often make headlines, the Oscars red-carpet is also used to showcase a dazzling array of jewels, with many of the pieces on display worth millions of pounds (per guest!).
As it's the most important event in the Hollywood film calendar, the jewellery houses will unlock their vaults and give celebrity stylists access to their most prized and precious gems - meaning that the Academy Awards is often a chance to spot one-of-a-kind pieces that you wouldn't ordinarily get to see.
From Zendaya's statement-making Bulgari bangles to Zoë Kravitz's timeless Kwiat set, Nicole Kidman's glittering Harry Winston diamonds, and Olivia Colman's sparkling Chopard jewels, here are the 10 most eye-catching jewellery moments from the Oscars 2022 red carpet.

     And the Red Carpet Oscar goes to ... the white shirt (or no shirt)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Long live the simple white shirt.
The look that will go down in history from this year’s Oscar ceremony is a crisp white shirt.
Stewart’s fiancee, the actor and screenwriter Dylan Meyer, also wore a white shirt on the red carpet, pintucked and untucked.
Arrive bedecked in sequins or feathers and no one bats an eyelid; wear a plain white shirt, and hear the gasps.
The hottest look on the red carpet is one that most people watching have hanging in their wardrobes already.

     Summary: Chalamet, who starred in the six-Oscar winning sci-fi film ‘Dune’, took to the Oscars red carpet on 27 March sporting a sequinned Louis Vuitton suit, beneath which he was bare-chested.
Adam Rippon, 2018Adam Rippon certainly tore up the red carpet at the 2018 Oscars Jordan Strauss/2018 InvisionRemember when Timothee Chalamet kind of wore a harness?
Olympic figure skater and ‘Dancing with the Stars’ winner Adam Rippon graced the red carpet of the 90th Academy Awards wearing a deconstructed suit with a leather harness underneath.
Billy Porter, 2019Billy Porters Tux/ball gown was a hit with fans and fellow celebrities alike Richard Shotwell/2019 InvisionOur final pick for reinventing the tux on the red carpet has to go to legend of screen and stage, Billy Porter.
True to form, Porter, famous for his eccentric fashions, wore the item with the grace of an iconic red carpet look whilst simultaneously being as nonchalant as if he were walking to the shop.
