     Boston Celtics' Robert Williams has torn meniscus; sources say center out at least several weeks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Perkins breaks down how big a loss Robert Williams III's injury absence is for the Celtics.
(1:13)Boston Celtics center Robert Williams III -- an anchor of the league's best defense -- suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee, the team announced Monday.
Boston moved into first place in the Eastern Conference on Sunday, and Williams, 24, has been an immense part of a dominant league-best defense.
He was injured in the 134-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday -- the Celtics' 24th victory in 28 games.
Williams -- who signed a new four-year, $54 million extension in the offseason -- has averaged 10 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks.

     Robert Williams injury: Celtics big man has torn meniscus, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics got some deflating news on the Robert Williams injury front Monday morning.
Williams has torn the meniscus in his left knee and will miss "several weeks" at minimum, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday.
The Athletic's Shams Charania first reported that Boston feared Williams had a meniscus tear, which could lead to an "indefinite absence."
ET): The Celtics confirmed Williams' injury as a "torn lateral meniscus."
It's unclear what exactly caused Williams' injury, but the 24-year-old exited Sunday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the third quarter and was in "quite a bit of pain," head coach Ime Udoka said.

     Summary: Boston Celtics center Robert Williams is feared to have a meniscus tear in his left knee, sources told The Athletic.
The injury would sideline Williams indefinitely and hurt the postseason chances of the Celtics, who have surged to the top spot in the Eastern Conference.
Williams left Sunday's game against Minnesota in the third quarter with the injury.
He's been key in Boston's defense and is likely to receive consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.
The Celtics have won six in a row and are 24-4 since Jan. 23.

     Robert Williams Has Torn Meniscus: Where Do the Celtics Go from Here?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest update on Robert Williams raises concern for his ability to contribute to the Celtics' title run this postseason.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Williams suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee, sidelining him indefinitely.
According to Healthline, the recovery for a meniscus tear takes about six to eight weeks if it's treated conservatively, without surgery.
The Celtics may have to advance past the first two rounds again for Williams to rejoin the fold.
It's a concerning injury that may spell the end of Robert Williams' season, but don't rule out him or the Celtics just yet.

Theis and Grant Williams aren’t as impactful as Robert Williams, but they can pitch in behind Horford.
The defense overall continues to get betterTake Robert Williams off the floor, and the Celtics’ defense unquestionably gets worse.
