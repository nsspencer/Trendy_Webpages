     GameStop Wallet trademark registered under GME Entertainment, LLC

     Summary: GameStop Wallet trademark registered under GME Entertainment, LLC The registered trademark presents more proof that GameStop might be announcing a first-party crypto wallet to go with its NFT Marketplace.
GameStop further solidified this with a recent trademark filing for “GameStop Wallet,” under GME Entertainment, LLC, which is a subsidiary of the main GameStop company.
GameStop’s GME Entertainment LLC recently filed the trademark for GameStop Wallet on March 28, 2022, as seen on the US Patent and Trademark Office website.
GME Entertainment, LLC's trademark for GameStop Wallet seems to cover its bases for software, applications, and services related to crypto transactions and storage.
Underneath its crypto wallet connection page, users could link a couple standard options such as WalletConnect and Metamask.

     Why GameStop Stock Jumped Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There wasn't any new official news out of the company, but the meme stock appeared to benefit from a bounce in activity on Reddit stock trading boards.
GameStop also benefited from increased chatter on Reddit boards over the weekend, with excitement building about a potential profit rebound ahead following a tough holiday season for earnings.
GameStop booked a loss for late fiscal 2021 despite soaring demand for video game consoles and other gaming hardware.
Now whatGameStop's stock is extremely risky and could easily see declines on par with the 70% spike investors have seen over the past few trading days.
Without a clear sight toward how these initiatives will help GameStop return to steady sales growth and sustainable profitability, investors should be extremely careful when considering owning the stock in hopes of making quick profits.
