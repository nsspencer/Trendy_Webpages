     Biden Pitches $5.8 Trillion Plan With Record Tax Hike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden unveiled a $5.8 trillion budget request designed to appease moderate Democrats on Monday, with a proposal that emphasized deficit reduction, additional funding for police and veterans, and flexibility to negotiate new social spending programs.
Congress historically sets presidential budgets aside, and razor-thin Democratic majorities mean most proposals stand a slim chance of passing -- but they do form a key messaging device.
The White House included measures that would add up to the biggest tax increase in history in dollar terms, helping stabilize deficits relative to the size of the economy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Biden news latest: President not walking back Putin comment, says ‘ridiculous’ to think US would take him down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Biden stands by Putin removal comment but insists he's not changing policyPresident Joe Biden returned home on Sunday fighting off criticism from world leaders and experts for the unscripted shot the president took at Vladimir Putin over the weekend in which he remarked that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”.
The comments, which many critics say could inflame tensions and harden Mr Putin’s resolve, seemed to distract from what would otherwise be considered a successful four-day trip to Europe.
The president’s remarks were made as he toured Poland, where he warned Russia not to tread one inch on a Nato ally’s soil.
The president returned home to an administration struggling to earn back the electorate’s goodwill.
Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to bottom out on issues that matter most to voters, such as the economy, the ongoing pandemic and an increasingly complicated foreign policy crisis.

The White House and friendly Democrats leapt to explain that the president was not endorsing regime change as a policy matter.
Polls have shown growing frustration with Biden's handling of Ukraine, even while most Americans favor specific steps the president has taken.
Now the White House is left emphasizing that it doesn't favor Putin being thrown out of power.

President Joe Biden says 'brutality will never grind down the will to be free' and "Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
Richard Haass, an American diplomat who heads the Council on Foreign Relations, said Biden had “made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous”.
“Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.”The comments by @potus made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous.
The US president has already personalised the conflict by calling Putin a thug, a murderous dictator, war criminal and now a butcher.

     Summary: Biden's 2023 budget calls for $5.8 trillion -- about $813 billion of which is for national security spending.
AdvertisementThe budget says the increase funds efforts like countering global threats, modernizing U.S. nuclear forces and improving cybersecurity.
It's no coincidence that Biden's budget calls for an increase in defense spending amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
Last year, Biden's budget sought to increase the deficit over 10 years by almost $1.4 trillion.
Biden's budget also proposes to increase the corporate tax rate -- taxes that corporations pay on their profits -- to 28%.

     Biden’s budget plan: Higher taxes on rich, lower deficits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing.
The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households.
The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020.
They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation.

     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden said Monday that he was not announcing a change in US policy when he said during a speech over the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power."
The administration and allies say Biden wasn't calling for regime change to remove Putin from power.
Rather, they argue that Biden was saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over neighboring nations.
In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West's confrontation with Russia.
"I wouldn't use terms like that because I'm still in talks with President Putin," Macron said during an interview on Sunday with French Channel France 3.

     Summary: "After my ... predecessor's fiscal mismanagement, we're reducing the Trump deficits and returning our fiscal house to order," the President said.
As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, the proposed budget includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and NATO and "countering Russian aggression to support Ukraine."
The President claimed his budget proposal "will be among the largest investments in our national security in history."
"Federal funding for the equipment, systems, and personnel that comprise the Nation's critical election infrastructure has been episodic or crisis-driven," the White House budget proposal said.
One notable plank of the proposal includes "making (mail-in) ballots postage-free," which is a priority for left-leaning voting rights groups.

Asked about Biden’s remarks during an appearance on ARD television, Scholz also said Biden had not made a dangerous mistake.
Biden has enjoyed some rare bipartisan support for his handling of the Ukraine crisis.
Just 26% of Americans have faith that Biden can manage a crisis or the military, according to last week’s AP-NORC poll.
Only 36% said his approach has been “about right,” while 56% said Biden has not been tough enough on Russia.
