     Three Things to Know: Irving makes home debut but loss to Hornets drops Nets to 9th
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1) Kyrie Irving makes home debut but loss to Hornets drops Nets to 9th in EastKyrie Irving is playing in Barclays Center again.
Irving missed home games up until this point because he refused to get vaccinated.
Irving happily jumped through that loophole and after the game said he stood for “freedom” called for an end to all mandates.
The Nets are unquestionably more dangerous with Irving back, and they have five of their remaining seven games at home.
Most likely, however, it is Mavericks vs. Jazz in the first round, which is a tough matchup for Utah.
