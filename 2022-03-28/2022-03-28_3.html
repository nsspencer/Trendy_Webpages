     Why is AMC stock surging? Here’s what to know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The cinema chain AMC Entertainment’s (AMC) stock surged Monday afternoon after it announced it bought a stake in struggling gold and silver miner Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (HYMC).
AMC stock went up 44.91% on Monday, closing at 29.33.
Meme stocks such as AMC and Gamestop (GME) have once again soared recently, mirroring to an extent what took place last year when internet users on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets invested in the stocks.
Case in point, Gamestop shares opened 11% higher than average last Wednesday after chairman Ryan Cohen bought 100,000 shares of the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.
Over the last five days, GME is up approximately 78% and AMC is up about 50%.

     Summary: What happenedIs this the mother of all short squeezes that AMC Entertainment ( AMC 44.91% ) investors have been waiting for?
After another week of a rapidly rising stock price, shares of AMC were soaring 22.2% at 11:30 a.m. EST on Monday.
So whatAMC remains a highly shorted stock, with more than 20% of its shares outstanding sold short.
What many of those traders didn't expect was for the movie theater operator to zig when they anticipated a zag.
That was where AMC found itself when hedge funds were betting against it, and small retail investors rallied around the stock and have helped keep shares afloat.

     AMC Stock: Up 50% In A Month, Is There More Upside? (NYSE:AMC)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A month ago, I wrote a bearish article arguing that AMC was not a good investment; since then it's, up 50%.
Many would have argued that with movie theaters, after all, shut down, they had no choice.
AMC, Aron insisted, would not "meekly accept" Universal abandoning the 90-day industry window standard.
AMC, Aron insisted, had to draw a line in the sand.
Well before AMC theaters had widely reopened, AMC and Universal cut a new deal … with a minimum theater exclusive of 17 days.
