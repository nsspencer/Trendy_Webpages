     That Nicole Kidman Viral Oscars Gasp Was Not About Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nicole Kidman is no stranger to memes, but the context of her latest viral moment needs to be corrected for the record.
On March 22, the 2022 Academy Awards supplied the good people of the internet with many memorable moments, including a new photo of the best actress nominee looking completely shocked.
Frankly, it may be even more meme-able than that AMC commercial.
According to The Huffington Post, a Reuters photographer also took a photo of Kidman’s gasp and confirmed it happened before the ceremony had even started.
By the time the altercation had occurred, Kidman was wearing her husband Keith Urban’s jacket draped around her shoulders.

     Keith Urban + Nicole Kidman Were Adorably Glam at the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keith Urban is a frequent attendee at the Academy Awards, as his wife, actor Nicole Kidman, has been nominated five times over the course of her career.
On Sunday night (March 27), Kidman walked into the Oscars a Best Actress nominee for her role in Being the Ricardos, and her adoring country star husband was right by her side on the red carpet.
In late February, Urban walked the red carpet with Kidman ahead of the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where Being the Ricardos had also earned her a nomination.
Urban made the trip to Los Angeles for the Oscars from Las Vegas, where he just wrapped up a weekend of shows on his Keith Urban: Live Las Vegas residency.
This summer, Urban will also embark on a lengthy headlining The Speed of Now Tour, with more than 50 shows scheduled.

     Nicole Kidman's viral Oscars reaction wasn't in response to Will Smith's slap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The viral photo of Nicole Kidman's shocked expression at the Oscars wasn't taken when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage — it was actually taken hours before, when she saw Jessica Chastain.
Los Angeles Times photographer Myung Chun told Vulture that he snapped the photo, which was posted to Getty Images, hours before the slap occurred.
Some Twitter users used the image, which began circulating on Twitter before the broadcast even started, to react to the confrontation between Smith and Rock.
He apologized to his fellow nominees and to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but he did not address Rock.
The academy condemned Smith in a statement Monday, saying it is reviewing the matter.

     That Nicole Kidman Oscars Reaction Image Was Not About Will Smith &amp; Chris Rock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The photographer behind the Nicole Kidman Oscars reaction image says the moment had a very different context than what it was first believed to be.
After recent confirmation from the image's photographer, it has been revealed that the now-infamous image of Nicole Kidman appearing surprised at the Oscars actually had nothing to do with the Will Smith and Chris Rock fiasco.
In an exclusive interview with Los Angeles Times (via Vulture), photographer Myung Chun, who took the original photo of Kidman, revealed the image's true context.
As previously mentioned, the feedback for the 2022 Oscars has been immensely different from the varying audiences on social media.
The 2022 Oscars will certainly be talked about for many more years to come.

     Summary: One such meme that’s been floating around the discourse stew is a picture of Nicole Kidman sitting in the audience, eyes agog and arms out, displaying more emotion on her face than we knew was still medically possible.
It’s been shared thousands of times with captions saying that it’s a shot of her reaction to the now capital-S Slap.
Nicole Kidman reacting to Will Smith punching Chris Rock is more Lucy than Being the Ricardos.
