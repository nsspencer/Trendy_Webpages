     Statement by President Joe Biden on the FY 2023 Budget
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Biden budget plan would levy minimum tax on billionaires, boost national security
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden sent a new $5.8 trillion budget request to Congress on Monday that calls on lawmakers to institute a minimum tax on billionaires and boost spending on national security.
“This minimum tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households — those with more than $100 million — and over half the revenue would come from billionaires alone,” the budget proposal states.
“Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017,” Biden’s budget states, referring to a major tax cut law signed by then-President Donald Trump.
In addition to the funding boost for defense, Biden also asks Congress to raise spending on domestic safety initiatives, including policing.
Biden originally asked Congress to create the program in last year’s budget request, with lawmakers setting aside $1 billion.

     WATCH: Biden says no one believes U.S. wants to ‘take down Putin’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man,” Biden said.
Biden on Monday rejected the idea that his comment could escalate tensions over the war in Ukraine or that it would fuel Russian propaganda about Western aggression.
“Nobody believes … I was talking about taking down Putin,” Biden said, adding that “the last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia.”He said he was expressing an “aspiration” rather than a goal of American foreign policy.
French President Emanuel Macron said Sunday he “wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what do we want to do collectively?
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said then that Biden was “speaking from the heart” rather than articulating a legal conclusion.

     Summary: President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power."
The first question to Biden was: "Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that?
"Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin," Biden added.
His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a "butcher" and saying he "cannot remain in power."
"I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin," Macron said in an interview with France 3.

Ukrainian officials have also played down the major breakthrough after Turkey’s president spoke with Putin on Sunday.

Speaking to independent Russian media, Zelensky says any such deal made with Russia will need to first be put to a referendum.

     Summary: CNN —President Joe Biden unveiled his fiscal year 2023 budget proposal on Monday, and while it includes increased funding for security and reduces the deficit, officials admit inflation could continue to cause problems for the overall economy.
“After my … predecessor’s fiscal mismanagement, we’re reducing the Trump deficits and returning our fiscal house to order,” the President said.
“Federal funding for the equipment, systems, and personnel that comprise the Nation’s critical election infrastructure has been episodic or crisis-driven,” the White House budget proposal said.
Biden also wants to increase the Justice Department’s civil rights budget by $101 million, for a new total of $367 million.
He has asked for legislation that reduces costs for Americans and reduces the deficit,” she said.

     Summary: The administration and allies say Biden wasn't calling for regime change to remove Putin from power.
The improvised comment about Putin wasn't planned and surprised aides who were watching Biden's speech on television or at the event site.
In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West's confrontation with Russia.
Biden said Monday that he doesn't care what Putin thinks about the comment, saying, "He's going to do what he's going to do."
"I wouldn't use terms like that because I'm still in talks with President Putin," Macron said during an interview on Sunday with French Channel France 3.
