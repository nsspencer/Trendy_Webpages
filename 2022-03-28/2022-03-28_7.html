     Paige Bueckers went off for UConn in the second half and the internet loved it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In potentially the college basketball game of the month, the UConn women’s team earned a spot in their 14th straight Final Four with a dramatic double overtime win over 1-seed NC State.
The Huskies — which had essentially a home game in Bridgeport, CT — pulled away in the second extra period for the four-point victory, but it was a back-and-forth affair throughout.
Although several UConn players stood out in the win, it was sophomore guard Paige Bueckers that made the difference.
Twenty-three of Buecker’s 27 points came in the second half as she shot a nearly-perfect 8-for-9 from the field after halftime.
The internet was overwhelmed with praise for the Minnesota native’s performance as she led her team to the Final Four in Minneapolis next weekend.
