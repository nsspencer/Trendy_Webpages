Biden emphasized that his comments reflected his “personal feelings” and had not complicated diplomacy efforts.
Never.”When pressed on whether his comments would effect diplomacy with Russia, Biden pushed the blame on Putin, noting that the Russian leader’s “escalatory efforts” are what “complicates things.” The president brushed off assumptions that his comments could be taken by Putin as an escalatory step.
“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” an official said in a statement.
On Monday, Biden emphasized that his unscripted comments were directed toward Russians.

     Biden news latest: President not walking back Putin comment, says ‘ridiculous’ to think US would take him down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Biden stands by Putin removal comment but insists he's not changing policyPresident Joe Biden refused to back down from comments he made at the weekend saying Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power, but insisted that he was not advocating for a change in policy.
He returned home on Sunday fighting off criticism from world leaders and experts for the unscripted shot the president took at Vladimir Putin over the weekend.
“I’m not walking anything back,” he told NBC News reporter Kelly O’Donnell on Monday at the White House.
“The fact of the matter is, I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the actions of this man.”The president returned home to an administration struggling to earn back the electorate’s goodwill.
Mr Biden’s approval ratings have continued to bottom out on issues that matter most to voters, such as the economy, the ongoing pandemic and an increasingly complicated foreign policy crisis.

     WATCH: Biden says no one believes U.S. wants to ‘take down Putin’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man,” Biden said.
Biden on Monday rejected the idea that his comment could escalate tensions over the war in Ukraine or that it would fuel Russian propaganda about Western aggression.
“Nobody believes … I was talking about taking down Putin,” Biden said, adding that “the last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia.”He said he was expressing an “aspiration” rather than a goal of American foreign policy.
French President Emanuel Macron said Sunday he “wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what do we want to do collectively?
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said then that Biden was “speaking from the heart” rather than articulating a legal conclusion.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power."
The first question to Biden was: "Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that?
"Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin," Biden added.
His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a "butcher" and saying he "cannot remain in power."
"I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin," Macron said in an interview with France 3.

     Summary: US President Joe Biden has clarified his own ad-lib remarks made in Poland, saying he was speaking directly to the Russian peopleDuring a speech in Warsaw, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” with White House aids jumping in to clear up the incident.
When asked why he made the comment, Biden says he’s “not walking anything back”As Ukraine and Russia peace talks get set to resume this week in Turkey, it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin is unwilling to compromise.
Ukrainian officials have also played down the major breakthrough after Turkey’s president spoke with Putin on Sunday.
However, Ukraine’s president Zelensky says his government is still willing to adopt a neutral status as part of a peace deal.
Speaking to independent Russian media, Zelensky says any such deal made with Russia will need to first be put to a referendum.

     Summary: The administration and allies say Biden wasn’t calling for regime change to remove Putin from power.
Rather, they argue that Biden was saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over neighboring nations.
The improvised comment about Putin wasn’t planned and surprised aides who were watching Biden’s speech on television or at the event site.
In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West’s confrontation with Russia.
“I wouldn’t use terms like that because I’m still in talks with President Putin,” Macron said during an interview on Sunday with French Channel France 3.
