     Summary: At the Oscars, they said gay.
“We’re going to have a great night tonight,” said the openly gay Sykes.
The bill, which passed earlier this month and has been staunchly defended by Gov.
The shot at the Florida bill wasn’t the only political jab the hosts took in their opening monologue.
“This year we saw a frightening display of how toxic masculinity turns into cruelty towards women and children,” Hall said.

     Summary: Florida's governor signs controversial law opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay'Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesPublic school teachers in Florida are banned from holding classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity after Florida's Gov.
The bill, which some opponents have called "Don't Say Gay," was signed by DeSantis on Monday.
The "Don't Say Gay" moniker comes from critics of the measure who blast this idea and insist this policy will hurt LGBTQ children.
The Trevor Project condemned the signing of the bill saying the bill erases "LGBTQ identity, history, and culture — as well as LGBTQ students themselves."
"Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law," the statement read.

LGBTQ+ youth across the state vehemently protested the bill, with thousands of students staging a walkout at the beginning of the month.
This bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, effectively erasing LGBTQ identity, history, and culture — as well as LGBTQ students themselves.

     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law on Monday that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, a policy that has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ people.
The legislation has pushed Florida and DeSantis, an ascending Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, to the forefront of the country’s culture wars.
LGBTQ advocates, students, Democrats, the entertainment industry and the White House have dubbed the measure the “Don’t Say Gay” law.
The law went into effect just days after DeSantis signed a separate bill that potentially restricts what books elementary schools can keep in their libraries or use for instruction.
DeSantis signed the bill after a news conference held at the Classical Preparatory School in Spring Hill, about 46 miles (74 kilometers) north of Tampa.
