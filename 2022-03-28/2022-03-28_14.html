     Bay Area Reporter :: DeSantis signs Florida 'Don't Say Gay' bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bill would also allow parents to sue schools or teachers who violate the legislation.
DeSantis' signature comes after nationwide pushback from top LGBTQ+ organizations, Democrats, LGBTQ+ youth, corporations, and the White House.
LGBTQ+ youth across the state vehemently protested the bill, with thousands of students staging a walkout at the beginning of the month.
This bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, effectively erasing LGBTQ identity, history, and culture — as well as LGBTQ students themselves.
"Governor Ron DeSantis signed the 'Don't Say Gay' bill in the most cowardly way possible today.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law on Monday that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, a policy that has drawn intense national scrutiny fromcritics who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ people.

     DeSantis Signs ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by opponents, has garnered nationwide attention and has been mocked during a “Saturday Night Live” sketch and in the opening monologue at Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony along with strong condemnation from federal officials.
Still, proponents of the legislation have repeatedly touted it as a parental rights bill, despite claims from those in opposition saying it targets LGBTQ individuals.
DeSantis added to the parental rights rhetoric on Monday, claiming that a “national trend” exists to “cut parents out” of their child’s education.
I have your back, and my Administration will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve," Biden tweeted last month as the bill advanced.
“I don't care what corporate media outlets say, I don’t care what Hollywood says, I don’t care what big corporations say – here I stand.
