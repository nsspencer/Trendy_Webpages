    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending.
My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America.
In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.

     Summary: President Joe Biden on Monday clarified that his statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power" made over the weekend doesn't reflect a policy shift by the United States.
What followed was a flurry of headlines saying Biden was calling for a regime change in Russia.
"I was not then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change," Biden added.
Putin "shouldn't remain in power, just like, you know, bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things," he continued.
Biden had previously hurled invectives at Putin throughout the crisis in Ukraine, labeling him a "murderous dictator" and a "war criminal."

     Biden budget plan would levy minimum tax on billionaires, boost national security
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden sent a new $5.8 trillion budget request to Congress on Monday that calls on lawmakers to institute a minimum tax on billionaires and boost spending on national security.
“This minimum tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households — those with more than $100 million — and over half the revenue would come from billionaires alone,” the budget proposal states.
“Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017,” Biden’s budget states, referring to a major tax cut law signed by then-President Donald Trump.
In addition to the funding boost for defense, Biden also asks Congress to raise spending on domestic safety initiatives, including policing.
Biden originally asked Congress to create the program in last year’s budget request, with lawmakers setting aside $1 billion.

     Summary: President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power."
The first question to Biden was: "Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that?
"Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin," Biden added.
His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a "butcher" and saying he "cannot remain in power."
"I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin," Macron said in an interview with France 3.

When asked why he made the comment, Biden says he’s “not walking anything back”As Ukraine and Russia peace talks get set to resume this week in Turkey, it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin is unwilling to compromise.
Ukrainian officials have also played down the major breakthrough after Turkey’s president spoke with Putin on Sunday.
However, Ukraine’s president Zelensky says his government is still willing to adopt a neutral status as part of a peace deal.
Speaking to independent Russian media, Zelensky says any such deal made with Russia will need to first be put to a referendum.

     Summary: "After my ... predecessor's fiscal mismanagement, we're reducing the Trump deficits and returning our fiscal house to order," the President said.
As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, the proposed budget includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and NATO and "countering Russian aggression to support Ukraine."
The President claimed his budget proposal "will be among the largest investments in our national security in history."
The national security spending proposal has already sparked criticism on both sides of the aisle.
One notable plank of the proposal includes "making (mail-in) ballots postage-free," which is a priority for left-leaning voting rights groups.

“The fact they do doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage about it.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stalled in many areas.
French President Emanuel Macron said Sunday he “wouldn’t use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin, because what do we want to do collectively?
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said then that Biden was “speaking from the heart” rather than articulating a legal conclusion.
Republicans questioned why Biden decided to go off-script in Warsaw when dealing with a combustible conflict.

     Biden’s budget plan: Higher taxes on rich, lower deficits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing.
The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households.
The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020.
They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation.
