Currently in Season 10, "Chicago Fire" is part of the "One Chicago" franchise, and interconnects with its sister shows, "Chicago Med" and "Chicago P.D.
These are squad, engine, and truck, and each one has a specialized role to fulfill.
Squad is focused on specialized equipment for heavy and dangerous rescue, engine is the stereotypical truck that releases pressurized water, and truck is the vehicle loaded with ladders (via Chicago.gov).
Now knowing the differences in jobs when it comes to firefighting, which characters on "Chicago Fire" are a part of the engine subdivision?
