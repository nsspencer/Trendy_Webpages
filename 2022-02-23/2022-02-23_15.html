     The Wife Of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Is In The Spotlight Over The Company She KeepsUnlike other spouses and partners of Supreme Court justices, Ginni Thomas, who has been married to Justice Clarence Thomas for over three decades, has been incredibly vocal about her political affiliations.
"Ginni Thomas' activities are different from any other spouse in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court," Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix The Court, a nonpartisan ethics group, told ABC News.
"She is more activist in political causes than any other spouse.
She has more relationships with organizations that have cases that come before the justices than any spouse before."
Despite this very personal link, the Supreme Court Justice has not recused himself from hearing these cases, according to CNN.

     Virginia 'Ginni" Thomas Has Ties To Organizers of Jan. 6 Capitol Riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, had ties to the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot organizers and efforts to undermine the 2020 election results.
A New York Times Magazine report revealed details about Thomas’ role in the effort, and The Washington Post reported Thomas shared a Facebook post on Jan. 6 before the violence broke out stating, “LOVE MAGA people!!!!
The Times added Thomas also served on the advisory board of the group that sponsored the rally, Turning Point USA.
Thomas’ wife also founded a group called groundswell with the help of Steve Bannon, who Trump pardoned for his role in the “Build The Wall” fundraising scheme.
The Times and The Post reports have led to an outcry calling for the Supreme Court Justice to resign.

     “The View” attempted Tuesday to sell the narrative that Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was instrumental in encouraging the January 6th riot on Capitol Hill.
pic.twitter.com/zLtiXlDnf9 — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) February 22, 2022“So, New York Times Magazine looks at concerns over the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who’s been a vocal supporter of the 2020 election fraud lie and the January 6 protesters,” Goldberg began.
“Now, Justice Thomas was the lone dissenter on the court who supported you-know-who’s request to keep his records from the January 6th Committee.
“The thing about the Supreme Court is that it’s just not bound by the same rules that other federal judges are bound by.
“Why not this time, when his wife was intimately involved in politics?” she asked.

In general, Ginni Thomas acted as an extension of Trump’s delusions.
Thomas is also connected with people who sought to undo the 2020 election results.
Steve Bannon, a onetime White House chief strategist for Trump, also endorsed efforts to challenge the election results.
Ginni Thomas founded a group called Groundswell with Bannon’s support, The Times reported.

     New York Times story about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, sparks social-media outcry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the wake of a newly published New York Times story looking at the political connections between Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, the conservative activist Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, some commentators on social media are calling for an investigation of the court’s longest-serving justice.
The Times story points to how Ginni Thomas gained access to Trump in part through her husband.
“That Clarence Thomas has made no effort to recuse himself from cases in which his wife has an interest is profoundly unethical,” wrote Jill Filipovic on CNN.com.
The Times story noted that Ginni Thomas has said she and her husband operate in “separate professional lanes.” Neither Ginni nor Clarence Thomas spoke with the Times for the piece.
The Times reported that Ginni Thomas commented on a private Facebook group for her high-school classmates in response to the fact some may have been contacted for the story.

     ReutersSoftbank Group-backed Ola Electric plans to build a battery cell manufacturing plant in India with a capacity of up to 50 gigawatt hours (GWh), a source told Reuters, as part of its broader electrification push.
Ola will need 40Gwh of battery capacity to meet its annual target to produce 10 million electric scooters and the remainder will be for electric cars, which it plans to manufacture in the future, said the person who has knowledge of the plans.
The initial plan is to set up 1Gwh of battery capacity by 2023 and expand it to 20GWh over the next 3-4 years, said another source aware of the plans, adding that this alone will need an investment of up to $1 billion.
