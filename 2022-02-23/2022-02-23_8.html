     New book details explosive combination of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron on ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’ set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Warner Bros. Pictures(NOTE LANGUAGE) While there were plenty of explosions in George Miller‘s Oscar-winning action epic Mad Max: Fury Road, a new book details some of the major fireworks were between stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.
The pair played, respectively, Max and Furiosa, who came to blows onscreen before ultimately teaming up to escape across the wasteland.
However, their real-life relationship was no less volatile, according to New York Times columnist Kyle Buchanan‘s new book Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road.
“It got to a place where it was kind of out of hand…I didn’t feel safe,” Theron says in the book.
Hardy seems to take the blame: “In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways,” he admitted.

     Tom Hardy Accused Of Threatening A Costar While Making Mad Max: Fury Road
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By James Brizuela | 5 seconds agoA new book about the filming of Mad Max: Fury Road, called Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome, has just hit shelves, and one of the main stories in the said book is about a heated fight between costars Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy.
The book details what it took to make the magnanimous film, and there had apparently been a great deal of pressure placed on both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy.
Despite Tom Hardy and Theron nearly tearing each other head’s off, Mad Max: Fury Road was a massive critical success.
Mad Max: Fury Road became one of the most talked-about films of 2015, and both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were praised for their performances.
Besides the Furiosa prequel, two other Mad Max sequels are reportedly in the works, with one having a working title of Mad Max: The Wasteland.

     However, the book also details some of the tense relationships between members of the cast—including the strained relationship between Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.
In particular, the book pinpoints one confrontation between Mad Max stars which made for an ugly day on set.
“A lot of what I felt was coming my way from Doug (Mitchell, a producer) was... I’ll just say it.
Seven years later, Hardy now reflects on the ways he could have helped made the set a better environment.
“In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways,” Hardy said about the confrontation.

     Further details of the animosity between Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy have been detailed in a new book about the making of George Miller’s 2015 action blockbuster Mad Max: Fury Road.
Hardy starred as the title character in the film, played by Mel Gibson in the original trilogy.
In one instance, Hardy was due on set at 8am, along with the rest of the cast and crew required that day.
“She was really going to make a point,” recalled camera operator Mark Goellnicht.
Assistant cameraman Ricky Schamburg called Hardy “very provocative” and Theron the opposite, while key second assistant director Samantha McGrady called Theron “the easiest person to deal with”.

     The post-apocalyptic desert wasn't big enough for Theron and Hardy: "It was clear these two people hated each other."

George Miller‘s 2015 prequel film was years in the making before landing co-leads Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron to portray young Mad Max and Furiosa, respectively.
Voeten told New York Times writer Kyle Buchanan for his new book, “Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of ‘Mad Max: Fury Road,'” excerpted in Vanity Fair.
“If you ask me, he kind of knew that it was really pissing Charlize off, because she’s professional and she turns up really early,” Schamburg said.
