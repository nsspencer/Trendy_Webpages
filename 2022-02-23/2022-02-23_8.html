     Russia Invades Ukraine in Worst European Crisis of Postwar Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin vowed to “demilitarize” the country and replace its leaders, triggering the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II and prompting the West to threaten further punishing sanctions in response.
Russia launched a barrage of missile, artillery and air attacks early on Thursday, with Ukraine reporting dozens of casualties.
Ukraine’s border guard said that it was being shelled from five regions, including from Crimea in the south and Belarus to the north, and that Russian tank columns were moving into the country.
The Interior Ministry said the capital, Kyiv, was under attack and urged citizens to go to shelters.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     State of play: Russian troops moved into eastern Ukraine and large explosions were reported immediately after Putin's speech, including near Kyiv.
What he's saying: Putin said the military operation would be intended to "demilitarize" Ukraine, but not to occupy it.
, who helped secure an "in principle" agreement for Biden and Putin before Russian troops moving into eastern Ukraine put an end to the deal, tweeted: "France strongly condemns the decision of Russia to start a war with Ukraine.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who met with Putin in Moscow in an attempt to stave off a Russian invasion, denounced the attacks on Ukraine as "a blatant violation of international law” that was unjustifiable."
In a bizarre split-screen, several countries then made urgent appeals to prevent a war that Putin had already declared.

     Battles flare across Ukraine after Putin declares war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday launched an all-out assault on Ukraine with missiles, warplanes and tanks that threatens to push Europe into its biggest conflict since World War II.
Ukraine warned that Moscow was turning to propaganda tricks by suggesting that Russian troops were not meeting resistance and by exhorting Ukrainians to lay down their weapons.
“Fierce battles will be waiting for them there, we will stop them,” he was quoted as saying by local media.
In a sign of the desperate straits Ukraine is facing against a stronger adversary, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for a general mobilization.
“ President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” he said in a statement.

     UNITED NATIONS — Ukraine’s ambassador at the United Nations has told the Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin has “declared war on Ukraine.” He also pressed his Russian counterpart to state that Russia will not shell and bomb Ukrainian cities.
Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Wednesday night that if Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia was not in a position to give a positive answer, he should relinquish the presidency of the Security Council, which Russia holds this month.
READ MORE: Putin announces military operation in Ukraine; explosions heard in KyivThe Ukrainian then asked for another emergency meeting of the Security Council, calling on the U.N. body “to stop the war because it’s too late to talk about de-escalation.”Kyslytsya then asked if he should play the video of Putin announcing military operations being launched in Ukraine.
Nebenzia replied: “This isn’t called a war.
This is called a special military operation in Donbas.”

The latest Russian military moves sent markets reeling around the world.

“Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia.
When you attack, you will see our faces, not our backs,” Zelenskyy said in his speech hours before Russian troops attacked.

All signs now point to an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, and there are media reports of explosions in the capital of Kyiv.
In under half an hour, Bitcoin plummeted from its perch of $37,000 to below $35,500.
U.S. stock markets continued further into correction territory today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1.38%.
Although Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and economic certainties, it's introduction to traditional finance means that its price movements are increasingly correlated to stock markets.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” said Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.

The Russian military claimed that all of Ukraine’s aviation bases were disabled in the barrage of missiles that began the Russian invasion.

Zelensky convened a Ukraine security council meeting in the early hours of Thursday to impose martial law, according to news reports.
A pathway out of this crisis may still come with incalculable and unpredictable costs for Ukraine, and for Russia.
