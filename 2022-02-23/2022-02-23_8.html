     Governor Abbott Issues Statement In Support Of Austin Police Department Officers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement of support for the officers of the Austin Police Department:"Last year, Austin set an all-time record for the number of murders.
It comes as no surprise that murders increased after Austin decreased funding for law enforcement.
In Texas, we do not defund and denigrate our law enforcement officers.
In Austin, law enforcement officers defended the state Capitol from criminal assault, protected the Austin Police Department headquarters from being overrun, cleared the interstate from being shut down, and disrupted criminal activity in areas across the city.
Time will tell whether the accusations against the courageous Austin police officers is a political sham.

     Texas Governor Greg Abbott orders state agencies to investigate gender-transitioning procedures as child abuse

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate any reported instances of children undergoing "abusive" gender-transitioning procedures.
The announcement comes days after the state's attorney general said that state law characterizes the procedures as child abuse.
"To protect Texas children from abuse, DFPS and all other state agencies must follow the law," Abbott said in a letter sent to DFPS on Tuesday.
The governor directed the DFPS and other state agencies to investigate parents of transgender children, as well as licensed facilities where kids receive gender-transitioning procedures.
"There is no doubt that these procedures are 'abuse' under Texas law, and thus must be halted," Paxton said.

     Abbott orders state agency to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Responding to conservative Republican opposition to gender-affirming care for young transgender Texans, Gov.
Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of "gender-transitioning procedures" as child abuse.
The move came one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws — and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year.
Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate.
Texas law also requires the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who allow gender-affirming care for their children, Abbott told the agency.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     FacebookTwitterPinterestGovernor Greg Abbott, who has served as the 48th governor of Texas since 2015, was warmly greeted by an enthusiastic crowd upon returning to his home town of Duncanville last Tuesday.
Abbott met with Tarrant County law enforcement officials to discuss the fentanyl epidemic that’s destroyed the lives of so many young people.
Abbott said he recently sent 10,000 Texas National Guard troops to fortify the border because the federal government had been reducing the forces there.
As a student at Duncanville HS (class of 1976), Abbott said he worked part time at the original Ben Franklin’s.
He reminded them they could leave there and go vote just down the street at the Duncanville public library.

     Order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott treats gender-confirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN, Texas — Republican Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott has ordered the state’s child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse, a directive that opponents say is a first by any governor over GOP efforts to restrict transgender rights.
It comes months after Texas Republican legislators— who filed more anti-LGBTQ proposals last year than in any other statehouse — proposed laws banning such treatments but failed to pass them.
Arkansas became the first state to pass a law prohibiting gender confirming treatments for minors, and Tennessee approved a similar measure.
“I’m also thinking about the kids who are relying on that care and how frightened the are.”

     Texas Gov. Greg Abbott disputes blockbuster testimony on electricity prices from former ERCOT chief
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Greg Abbott’s campaign is disputing accounts that he ordered Texas’ power grid operator to set electricity prices at a sky high cap during 2021′s deadly winter storm.
Abbott’s critics and his presumptive Democratic opponent in November’s election pounced on reports of testimony in federal court from former ERCOT CEO Bill Magness Wednesday.
The implication was that Abbott essentially ordered the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to artificially inflate electricity prices, which remained in place long after they were necessary.
Georgetown Republican state Sen. Charles Schwertner, the chairman of the Senate’s Business and Commerce Committee, said Magness’ testimony contradicted testimony he gave to the committee following the winter storm.
“I plan to look into this issue further.”Today’s trial testimony by former ERCOT CEO Magness appears to contradict his testimony before the B&amp;C committee last session.
