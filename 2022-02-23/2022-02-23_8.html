     A Groundbreaking Cartoon Family Returns, ‘Louder and Prouder’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When “The Proud Family” debuted on the Disney Channel on Sept. 15, 2001, it introduced one of TV’s first animated African American families.
Over 52 episodes and a TV movie, the series offered a lighthearted depiction of a Black suburban family going about their everyday lives.
They bickered, supported one another, threw shade and showed love — all of the things that typical on-screen families do.
But before The Prouds, TV audiences rarely got to see a Black cartoon family doing those run-of-the-mill things, too.
Now the groundbreaking brood is back with “The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,” a 10-episode revival scheduled to air weekly on Disney+ starting Wednesday.

     But this time, Penny Proud and her friends aren't kids anymore in .
In the original series, Al guest starred in two episodes but his character deviates away from his cheery personality on the NBC morning show.
He told his costars that his role in The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder will "have some college high jinks."
Unsurprisingly, his Today family were nothing but supportive of his latest venture on TV.
It followed main character Penny Proud (Kyla Pratt) and her struggles associated with adolescence.

     It’s hard to come up with a better end to Black history month than the return of The Proud Family.
Over 15 years after the Disney animated series came to an end, a reboot — The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder — will hit Disney+ on Feb. 23.
Like the original, the new show will follow the antics of titular Proud Family, including teenager Penny Proud, her parents Trudy and Oscar, and her beloved grandma Sugar Mama.
Johnson voices Michael CollinsOne of the new voices joining the Proud Family cast is E.J.
The rest of the Proud Family: Louder and Prouder cast list reads more like the attendees of an awards show than the voice cast of a children’s cartoon.
