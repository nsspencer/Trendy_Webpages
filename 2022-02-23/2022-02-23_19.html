     Al Durham: Status of Providence guard for game against Xavier on Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Providence Friars guard Al Durham is questionable for the second straight game as PC hosts the Xavier Musketeers on Wednesday night at The Dunk in Rhode Island.
Durham missed PC’s 71-70 win at Butler on Sunday with a sports hernia injury, and his status for tonight’s matchup is questionable.
Durham averages 13.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 3.2 assists for the Friars, including 22 points against the Musketeers in the first meeting of the teams this season on January 26th.
The loss of Durham would be a big blow to a team that’s 22-3 this season, including 12-2 in Big East play, but is also considered one of the luckier teams this century by KenPom.com’s advanced metrics.
4 seed in the NCAA Tournament on Saturday in the selection committee’s reveal of the Top 16 teams.

     Providence vs. Xavier score: Friars win 3OT thriller after water on court from leaky roof put game in jeopardy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     11 Providence vs. Xavier game at the Dunkin' Donuts Center because of water on the court might've been a sign from above that a marathon match was on tap and a respite in play was warranted.
The water delay was the early headline of the bout as play was stopped with 2:43 remaining for more than 15 minutes while arena officials worked to find a solution for the drip in The Dunk's roof.
The rain delay inside the arena certainly created some chaos but once play resumed, the game turned out to be one of the Big East's best bouts of the season.
He went 5-of-10 from deep and the Friars finished 14-of-30 as a team from distance.
The win for Providence moves it to 23-3 on the season and it can clinch a regular season Big East title -- which would be the first in program history -- at home on Saturday against Creighton.

     College Basketball Odds: Xavier vs. Providence prediction, odds, pick and more – 2/23/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s time to continue our college basketball odds series with a Xavier-Providence prediction and pick.
If Providence beats Xavier tonight, then they should enter the top-10 rankings and jump Villanova.
This team has three players who average double digits in scoring and will need all three to be on their game tonight.
Xavier seems to be a little stronger defensively so Providence will need to make sure they aren’t slacking on offense tonight.
Final Xavier-Providence Prediction &amp; PickI would assume Providence is the right call at home here tonight.

     Bynum's 27 points lift No. 11 Providence over Xavier in 3 OT

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jared Bynum scored 27 points, including a key 3-pointer to help Providence hold off Xavier 99-92 in triple overtime Wednesday night.
He hit two free throws and, after another Musketeers miss, Providence was able to run out the clock.
Alyn Breed, who hadn’t attempted a shot to that point, sank two free throws to make it 84-81.
Scruggs got it back to a point with his basket on the other end before two more free throws by Breed.
Two more free throws by Scruggs cut it to 86-85, but Xavier fouled Watson before the next inbounds — a flagrant foul.
