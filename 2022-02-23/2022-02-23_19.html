     Taiwan, eyeing parallels to Ukraine, condemns Russian invasion.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Many people within and outside the island are drawing parallels between Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing, and Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses as part of an effort to reassure the public.
While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an invasion of the island is imminent.
Though the comparison is not perfect, Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor.
Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands.

     No comparison between Ukraine and Taiwan: China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dismissing comparison between the ongoing Ukraine crisis and its own claims over self-ruled Taiwan, China on Wednesday said the island is “not Ukraine” and it has always been an “inalienable” part of the mainland.
“Taiwan is not Ukraine.
In response, Hua said any comparison between Ukraine and Taiwan showed a lack of the most basic understanding of the history of the Taiwan issue.
Tsai said Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in terms of geostrategy, geography and international supply chains.
Separately, speaking on the tension over Ukraine, Hua said those accusing China of contradicting its stance on respecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity in relation to Russia’s moves towards Ukraine were “either driven by ulterior motives or deliberately distorting or misinterpreting China”.

     Beijing says Taiwan is 'not Ukraine,' has always been part of China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     China's foreign ministry on Wednesday said Taiwan is "not Ukraine" and has always been a part of China amid Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's calls to ramp up vigilance on military activities in response to the crisis in Ukraine.
"Taiwan is not Ukraine," Hua said while speaking in Beijing.
In 1949, the government of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan to escape communist forces, who formed the People's Republic of China the same year.
However, Taiwan has vehemently opposed China's claims over the island, with Tsai noting that it is still the self-governing Republic of China, according to Reuters.
Tsai noted that Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in various ways, including geography and internal supply chains.

     Taiwan is “not Ukraine” and has always been an inalienable part of China, China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday (23 February), as Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called for the island to beef up vigilance on military activities in response to the crisis.
Speaking in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying dismissed any link between the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan.
The statement did not mention China by name, but the country is the most significant military threat that Taiwan faces.
Tsai has expressed “empathy” for Ukraine’s situation because of the military threat the island faces from China.
In comments to a meeting of Taiwan’s National Security Council, Tsai said the Ukraine situation needed close attention.

For all the debate in Washington, the differences between the situations with Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan are significant, with everything from history to geography standing apart.
There is one concept that unites Putin on Ukraine and Xi on Taiwan, however: The idea that history and geography can trump self-determination and democracy, no matter what.

     (Photo/Xinhua)Foreign ministry says comparisons by DPP authorities lack understandingBoth the Foreign Ministry and the Chinese mainland's Taiwan affairs authorities sternly warned Taiwan politicians on Wednesday not to use the Ukraine crisis to hype up the Taiwan question and make provocations for "independence".
"I think it's unwise for some people with the Taiwan administration to take advantage of the Ukraine situation," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.
"What they've said shows they lack very basic understanding of the history of the Taiwan question."
"This is the status quo of the Taiwan question," she said.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Wednesday that the "empathy" is pure pretense and the Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair.
