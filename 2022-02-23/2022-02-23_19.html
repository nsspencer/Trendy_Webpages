    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Wednesday night, the Wisconsin Badgers will head on the road to face off against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the second border battle of the season.
The Badgers are trying to complete the season sweep of the Golden Gophers, after beating them at the Kohl Center 66-60 in January.
Wisconsin will look to current Big Ten Player of the Week, Jonathan Davis for scoring after he averaged 27.5 points in last week’s victories over Michigan and Indiana.
It should be a great game to watch, as the Badgers will battle for position on top of the Big Ten conference.
Where: Williams Arena in Minneapolis, Minn.

     Wisconsin men’s basketball: UW outlasts Minnesota to earn a Border Battle sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Border Battle Season Sweep pic.twitter.com/v9EGwiXgCz — Wisconsin Basketball (@BadgerMBB) February 24, 2022The early part of this game was defined by how little defense both teams were interested in playing.
UW started off a bit more slowly, but still ended up shooting 56% in the first half, compared to Minnesota’s 52%.
Jamison Battle for the Gophers was cooking all first half, scoring from every level and making Wahl, a stout defender, look foolish at points.
After a missed layup by Chucky Hepburn with around 20 seconds left, Wahl tapped the ball back out to Davison who called timeout with 18.1 seconds left.
The Maple Grove, Minn. native then made two free throws after the timeout to give Wisconsin a four point lead.
