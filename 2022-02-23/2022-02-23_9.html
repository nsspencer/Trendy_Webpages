     Report: Atletico Madrid 1 Man Utd 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Spaniards were celebrating in the seventh minute when Renan Lodi recycled the ball after United had cleared a corner, with Joao Felix nodding the delivery in off the post – leaving David De Gea no chance of saving it.
With around a quarter of an hour gone, Bruno Fernandes teed up a strike after a move involving smart work from Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo, but Bruno's effort was blocked by a defender.
After Atletico’s early flourish, the Reds began to dominate the ball but were finding a breakthrough hard to come by against the rigid organisation of Diego Simeone’s team.
The Portuguese forward had another chance shortly after, hitting one from range, but dragged the shot wide.
Against the run of play, Marcos Llorente almost doubled Atletico’s lead shortly before half-time when a cross bounced off Lindelof and into Llorente's path, but thankfully his instant header at the back post flew back off the bar and away from danger.

     Atletico Madrid vs Manchester United live score and result updates: Champions League latest as Elanga scores late equaliser
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United salvaged a 1-1 draw against Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano despite being second best for large parts.
The Red Devils will certainly be counting themselves lucky after Anthony Elanga once again made a telling difference from the bench.
He netted an 80th-minute equaliser for the visitors after Joao Felix had given Atletico a deserved lead inside seven minutes.
Rangnick might be slightly worried about his side’s performance but the result will be more than satisfactory.

     'Nothing changes' for Simeone after Man Utd draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Diego Simeone insisted nothing has changed in his approach to the Champions League tie with Manchester United, despite Atletico Madrid conceding a late equaliser.
Anthony Elanga came off the bench to net United's leveller in the 80th minute in Madrid on Wednesday, meaning the last-16 clash is all square heading into the second leg at Old Trafford on March 15.
However, Simeone believes going to Old Trafford with everything on the line is the perfect litmus test for his stuttering side.
Asked if Atleti's poor home form in the competition could be their downfall, Simeone added: "No, because it's football.
You can't continue in the Champions League without winning a game, but from the round of 16 onwards it can be done [at home]."

     Man Utd escape with a draw after Elanga pegs back Atletico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United were spared a damaging and deserved defeat by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as Anthony Elanga's late goal rescued them a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the Champions League last 16.
But rather than extend their advantage, Atletico squandered it, Elanga racing onto a Bruno Fernandes through ball and applying a cool finish with 10 minutes left to earn United a draw that felt like a victory.
United boss Ralf Rangnick was asked in his press conference what he told the United players at half-time.
There were precious few chances though and when Ronaldo curled a free-kick harmlessly over, Atletico looked close to victory.
Griezmann, on as a substitute, curled against the crossbar with four minutes left but a deflated Atletico were unable to restore their advantage.
