     Russia attacks Ukraine: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ukrainian-controlled part of Luhansk announced a general evacuation on Thursday morning as Russia attacked Ukraine.
“We recommend residents of Luhansk region to leave the region immediately,” the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haiday, said on Facebook.
“During the evacuation, please remain calm and listen to the instructions of the authorities, the National Police and the State Emergency Service of Ukraine,” he said.
Luhansk is one of two separatist regions backed by Russia, along with Donetsk.
Both regions, known as oblasts in Ukrainian, are split between parts controlled by Ukraine and by pro-Moscow separatists.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an impassioned address on Wednesday night that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an invasion of his country but that if Russia attacks, "you will see our faces, not our backs."
The latest: Hours later, Putin announced a "special military operation" in Ukraine in a speech that appeared to serve as a declaration of war.
After Putin's speech, explosions were heard in cities including Kyiv.
He addressed the Russian people in Russian to make an appeal for peace, while acknowledging the need to prepare for war.
Zelensky spent weeks downplaying the risk of an imminent invasion in order to avoid panic, but has now adopted the tone of a president preparing his country for war.

     Explosions were heard in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv Thursday morning shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his nation will conduct military operations in eastern Ukraine.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.”“Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.
Putin announced the military plans as the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting and urged Russia not to attack Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military this week warned that Russian-backed mercenaries had been sent to the area to stage "provocations."
A senior U.S. defense official earlier said that Russian troops range from about 3 miles to 30 miles from the border.

     He urged them to disregard Russian propaganda and do all they could to stop a war that could kill tens of thousands.
“Do Russians want war?” Mr. Zelensky asked at the end of his speech.
But many Russians still subscribe to the Kremlin narrative of a Russia forced to fight back against Western powers determined to destroy it.
“I’ve seen many examples of states pursuing various imperial ambitions and forgetting about the very goal of the state: the welfare of the people who live in it,” Mr. Khachaturyan said.
That became even clearer after Monday’s Security Council meeting at which Mr. Putin at times browbeat and humiliated his most powerful and senior officials into telling him that he should recognize the separatist territories.

     As Ukraine braces for an escalating invasion, the United States and allies have launched sanctions against Russia in the hope of convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces.
Safi spoke Wednesday with News@Northeastern about the crisis in Ukraine and its threat to Europe, the NATO alliance, and the global refugee crisis.
This is a significant increase and a harbinger of what this region might face as Russian forces move into the area.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Editor’s note, Wednesday, February 23, 11:50 pm: In a Wednesday night speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a “special military operation” would begin in Ukraine.
Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.
