     MARQUETTE, MI – It’s been a record-breaking couple days in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.
According to the National Weather Service in Marquette, several snowfall and precipitation records were broken on Monday and Tuesday.
The snowfall broke a record 19.4 inches the area received on Feb. 26, 2002.
The previous record for snowfall on Feb. 22 was just 7.5 inches in 1974.
“While the previous records were on the lower end, we did set new precipitation and snow records the last two days.

     When it premiered in 2017, “Snowfall” didn’t necessarily look like it would become a hit.
The series told the grim story of how the ‘80s crack epidemic in Los Angeles grew.
And the best-known name associated with the show was co-creator John Singleton, the Oscar-nominated writer and director.
You can live stream “Snowfall” on fubo TV, which offers a free trial.
As John Landgraf, chairman of FX, recently told journalists during the virtual Television Critics Association press tour, “Snowfall” averages “about nine million viewers per episode.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The winter storm warning issued by the National Weather Service for Baraga and Marquette counties on Tuesday was expected to expire at 7 a.m. today.
The storm was a bit unusual, Zika said, because it came in two major parts, first on Monday and then on Tuesday.
The brunt of the second surge of the storm on Tuesday was expected in the evening, and was to last overnight into today.
The winter storm warning issued at around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday called for heavy snow, with snow accumulations of 6 to 14 inches, greatest in the higher terrain from Herman to the Dead River Storage Basin, to Ishpeming and Negaunee.
Schools that were closed Tuesday due to the storm included Northern Michigan University, North Star Montessori Academy, NICE Community Schools, Powell Township School, Marquette Area Public Schools, Negaunee Public Schools, Ishpeming Public Schools, as well as Republic-Michigamme Schools.

     Why You Should Be Watching FX’s Snowfall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since its debut in 2017, Snowfall, a show set during the crack epidemic of the 80s, has quickly become one of the hottest must-watch shows on television.
Living up to the reputation that FX has created for itself with its culture-defining shows and characters, Snowfall has managed to take the “drug drama” sub-genre to new heights through layered, intense storytelling, award-worthy acting, and awe-inducing cinematography.
Here are three reasons you should be watching Snowfall.
Did we mention that FX’s Snowfall is based on a true story?
So, not only is the show a thrilling crime drama, but Snowfall also carries a bit of unknown facets of American history in its DNA.

     ‘Snowfall’ Season 5 Addresses Drug War and Mass Incarceration in Black Communities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s a game Andron says is complicated with the historical backdrop of 1986, a critical year in the trajectory of federal drug sentencing laws that led to decades of mass incarceration for Black communities – and a year remembered for the death of a rising sports superstar.
“We are definitely dealing with how all of a sudden the official crackdown, no pun intended, on crack, is with Black people.
Ultimately, medical experts determined that, from a pharmacological standpoint, the drug is equally harmful in powder and rock form.
“There should have been no difference between sentencing for powder cocaine or rock cocaine,” Andron said.
The racial disparities in mass incarceration were exacerbated even further by the passing of the 1994 Crime Bill, which imposed even tougher prison sentences for federal drug trafficking charges.
