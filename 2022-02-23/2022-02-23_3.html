     Even though Leon (Isaiah John) is happy to be back, he isn't thrilled about taking orders from Louie, which creates friction with him and Franklin.
Plus, Leon holds Oso and his partner Lucia (Emily Rios) responsible for the death of his friend.
Aside from his business, Franklin also has trouble looming with journalist Irene Abe (Suzy Nakamura), who is out to unravel the truth about the crack epidemic and shed light on Melody’s father, Andre Wright’s (Marcus Henderson) death.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When it premiered in 2017, “Snowfall” didn’t necessarily look like it would become a hit.
The series told the grim story of how the ‘80s crack epidemic in Los Angeles grew.

You can live stream “Snowfall” on fubo TV, which offers a free trial.
As John Landgraf, chairman of FX, recently told journalists during the virtual Television Critics Association press tour, “Snowfall” averages “about nine million viewers per episode.
