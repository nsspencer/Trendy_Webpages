     New book details explosive combination of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron on ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’ set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Warner Bros. Pictures(NOTE LANGUAGE) While there were plenty of explosions in George Miller‘s Oscar-winning action epic Mad Max: Fury Road, a new book details some of the major fireworks were between stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.
The pair played, respectively, Max and Furiosa, who came to blows onscreen before ultimately teaming up to escape across the wasteland.
However, their real-life relationship was no less volatile, according to New York Times columnist Kyle Buchanan‘s new book Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road.
“It got to a place where it was kind of out of hand…I didn’t feel safe,” Theron says in the book.
Hardy seems to take the blame: “In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways,” he admitted.

     However, the book also details some of the tense relationships between members of the cast—including the strained relationship between Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.
In particular, the book pinpoints one confrontation between Mad Max stars which made for an ugly day on set.
“A lot of what I felt was coming my way from Doug (Mitchell, a producer) was... I’ll just say it.
Seven years later, Hardy now reflects on the ways he could have helped made the set a better environment.
“In hindsight, I was in over my head in many ways,” Hardy said about the confrontation.
