     The Real Reason Free Guy 2 Isn't Happening Any Time Soon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Real Reason Free Guy 2 Isn't Happening Any Time SoonThe Ryan Reynolds-led action comedy film "Free Guy" was released in August 2021 to fairly positive reviews; at this time of writing, the film holds an 80% Tomatometer score and a 93% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Directed by Shawn Levy, "Free Guy" follows Guy (Reynolds), a bank teller who discovers that he is actually an NPC in a multiplayer online video game.
The Boston Globe wrote in their review that "Reynolds is his usual two steps away from absolute insincerity.
To further cement just how well the 20th Century Studios release went over with audiences, the film was successful financially, making $331.5 million at the worldwide box office (via Box Office Mojo).
With all that in mind, it came as no surprise when Reynolds tweeted a confirmation that Disney was definitely interested in a "Free Guy" sequel.
