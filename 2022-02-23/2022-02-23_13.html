     He urged them to disregard Russian propaganda and do all they could to stop a war that could kill tens of thousands.
“Do Russians want war?” Mr. Zelensky asked at the end of his speech.
But many Russians still subscribe to the Kremlin narrative of a Russia forced to fight back against Western powers determined to destroy it.
“I’ve seen many examples of states pursuing various imperial ambitions and forgetting about the very goal of the state: the welfare of the people who live in it,” Mr. Khachaturyan said.
That became even clearer after Monday’s Security Council meeting at which Mr. Putin at times browbeat and humiliated his most powerful and senior officials into telling him that he should recognize the separatist territories.

     The latest on the Ukraine-Russia crisis: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya (UNTV via AP)Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, warned it was "too late" for de-escalation at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council Wednesday night, as he urged other countries to help stop the conflict.
“Because it’s too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation, too late,” he said.
“The Russian president declared war."
Kyslytsya cited the UN charter and the stipulation that only peace-loving states would be admitted into the Security Council, and then asked the Russian ambassador to relinquish his role as council president.
Earlier Wednesday night, the Russian ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, defended Russia's military operation and denied that it was a "war," blaming the current tensions on Ukraine.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates Russia launches attacks on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A previously unknown strain of malicious software appeared on hundreds of computers in Ukraine on Wednesday and began destroying data, security experts said.
Jean-Ian Boutin, head threat researcher at the Slovakia-based security firm ESET, which first reported the detections, said that the malware was “very effective” and had been used against large organizations.
Another security firm, Broadcom’s Symantec, confirmed that the malware hit at least three organizations, including a bank and two government contractors.
ESET did not attribute the software to any specific actor, but Boutin said he assumed it was related to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which has used similar malware against Ukrainian targets in past years.
“There will likely be a long campaign of cyberattacks against Ukrainian targets,” said John Hultquist, vice president of security firm Mandiant.

The twentieth century brought modernization and urbanization, and the integration of former peasants into the urban culture through the Russian language.
So there has been a tendency to switch languages, or associate yourself with Ukrainian language, and to send children to Ukrainian-language schools.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
This combination — an anti-Russian regime in what Putin views as rightfully Russian territory populated by rightfully Russian people — is unacceptable to him.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.
