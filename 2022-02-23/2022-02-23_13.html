     Antonio Conte reacts on the sidelines during a Premier League loss to Burnley.
Getty ImagesTottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte appeared to question his own future at the club after his side slumped to a fourth loss in five Premier League games with a 1-0 defeat in pouring rain at Burnley on Wednesday.
Tottenham huffed and puffed, but a Harry Kane header against the woodwork was the closest they came to scoring.
"Maybe there is something wrong; I want to take responsibility, if I have that, I'm open for every decision," Conte said.
"I want to try to improve the situation and also to make an assessment with the club.

     Antonio Conte says he does not deserve his salary after Tottenham fell to a 1-0 defeat to Burnley on Wednesday night and admits he is thinking about resigning.
Premier League Conte offers bizarre analogy to explain Kane, Lloris importance YESTERDAY AT 16:28He said: “We lost four of the last five, nobody deserves this situation, this is the reality.
I came in to try to improve the situation but maybe in this moment, I don’t know.
Working hard, working a lot and trying to get out the best of players.
Conte was very downbeat after the game and admits he wonders if he is the right man to take Tottenham forward.

     Burnley 1-0 Tottenham: Mee header dents Spurs' top-four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tottenham missed the chance to close the gap on the Premier League’s top four after they were beaten 1-0 by relegation-threatened Burnley.
Ben Mee headed the only goal 19 minutes from time at Turf Moor to boost the hosts' survival hopes, moving them to within two points of safety.
For Spurs, it was a case of being brought back down to earth with a bump following Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win over champions Manchester City.
Burnley had only won one of their 12 previous Premier League meetings with Tottenham; a 2-1 success here in February 2019.
Dejan Kulusevski then curled just wide after Lloris did brilliantly to keep out Jay Rodriguez's header at the other end.

READ MORE: Antonio Conte Hints At Imminent Tottenham Exit After Defeat At BurnleyBut airing grievances with the Tottenham board in public is not a good look.
So this is the group of players Conte has.
But Tottenham will not want to sack Conte for two reasons.
The bar has been set so high that Spurs fans will demand another mega name to replace Conte if he departs.
