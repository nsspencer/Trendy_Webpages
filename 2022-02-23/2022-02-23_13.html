     Texas Governor Greg Abbott Just Declared Open Season on Trans Youths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest in a long line of attacks on the existence, freedom, and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals in the U.S. was waged on Wednesday, when Texas governor Greg Abbott officially directed state agencies to investigate gender-affirming care for trans youths as “child abuse.” In a letter to the state’s department of family and protective services, Abbott defined gender-affirming treatments for transgender children—including gender-reassignment surgery and puberty-blocking medications—as “abusive procedures.”A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services said it “will follow Texas law as explained.” Given Abbott’s decree, Texas doctors, nurses, teachers, and members of the public will now be obliged to report instances of what the governor referred to as “so-called ‘sex change’ procedures.”Texas is one of several states that have ramped up efforts to criminalize trans identity, with Arkansas, South Dakota, and Florida all recently considering or passing legislation that would ban gender-affirming treatment for minors, forbid trans girls and women from participating in female organized sports, and otherwise make living openly as a trans person as difficult and dangerous a proposition as possible.
It’s difficult to overstate just how deleterious an effect Texas’s new policy could have on the mental health and physical safety of trans youth.
Moreover, empowering state agencies to investigate the parents of those youths is likely to have an outsized impact on families of color (who are already disproportionately criminalized and overrepresented in an overtaxed child-welfare system).
Yet the state—which has the second-biggest trans population in the U.S.—may serve as an example of how trans individuals will be targeted across the country if Greg Abbott’s GOP has its way.

     Texas Governor Greg Abbott orders state agencies to investigate gender-transitioning procedures as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate any reported instances of children undergoing "abusive" gender-transitioning procedures.
The announcement comes days after the state's attorney general said that state law characterizes the procedures as child abuse.
"To protect Texas children from abuse, DFPS and all other state agencies must follow the law," Abbott said in a letter sent to DFPS on Tuesday.
The governor directed the DFPS and other state agencies to investigate parents of transgender children, as well as licensed facilities where kids receive gender-transitioning procedures.
"There is no doubt that these procedures are 'abuse' under Texas law, and thus must be halted," Paxton said.

     A spokesperson for the agency told the Dallas Morning News that it “will follow Texas law as explained [by Paxton’s opinion],” adding that it had no pending investigations.
Abbott said Texas doctors, nurses and teachers have an obligation to report instances of child abuse and that existing law “provides criminal penalties for failure to report such child abuse.” Members of the public have similar requirements, Abbott wrote.
(Monica Rodman, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)The directive is the state’s latest attempt to limit gender-affirming care for transgender youths.

In April, Arkansas legislators passed the country’s first law banning gender-affirming treatments for minors.

     Abbott orders state agency to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Responding to conservative Republican opposition to gender-affirming care for young transgender Texans, Gov.
Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of "gender-transitioning procedures" as child abuse.
The move came one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws — and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year.
Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate.
Texas law also requires the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who allow gender-affirming care for their children, Abbott told the agency.

     Governor Greg Abbott Returns to Duncanville, Tackles Hot Topics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     FacebookTwitterPinterestGovernor Greg Abbott, who has served as the 48th governor of Texas since 2015, was warmly greeted by an enthusiastic crowd upon returning to his home town of Duncanville last Tuesday.
Abbott met with Tarrant County law enforcement officials to discuss the fentanyl epidemic that’s destroyed the lives of so many young people.
Abbott said he recently sent 10,000 Texas National Guard troops to fortify the border because the federal government had been reducing the forces there.
As a student at Duncanville HS (class of 1976), Abbott said he worked part time at the original Ben Franklin’s.
He reminded them they could leave there and go vote just down the street at the Duncanville public library.

     EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) – Many El Pasoans crowded into the Riviera Restaurant in the Upper Valley to catch a glimpse of Greg Abbott during Tuesday night’s campaign event.
Last year, Abbott ordered billions be spent to fund Operation Lone Star, an initiative to put more law enforcement on Texas’ border with Mexico.
“We are implementing $3 billion of funding to secure the border,” Abbott said.

“The Governor always seems to come to El Paso like a thief in the night,” Abeytia said.
