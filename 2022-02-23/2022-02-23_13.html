     For Many Russians, a Deep Unease Over Gathering Specter of War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But many Russians still subscribe to the Kremlin narrative of a Russia forced to fight back against Western powers determined to destroy it.
“I’ve seen many examples of states pursuing various imperial ambitions and forgetting about the very goal of the state: the welfare of the people who live in it,” Mr. Khachaturyan said.
“I don’t support this policy and view it negatively.”And yet there is desperately little that Russians can do to change their country’s trajectory.
That became even clearer after Monday’s Security Council meeting at which Mr. Putin at times browbeat and humiliated his most powerful and senior officials into telling him that he should recognize the separatist territories.
The central message of this extraordinary spectacle of fealty, which the Kremlin taped, edited and aired on television, appeared to be that it was Mr. Putin alone who had the power to chart Russia’s course.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A previously unknown strain of malicious software appeared on hundreds of computers in Ukraine on Wednesday and began destroying data, security experts said.
Jean-Ian Boutin, head threat researcher at the Slovakia-based security firm ESET, which first reported the detections, said that the malware was “very effective” and had been used against large organizations.
It had probably been used against many more companies that had not reported it, he added.
Another security firm, Broadcom’s Symantec, confirmed that the malware hit at least three organizations, including a bank and two government contractors.
“There will likely be a long campaign of cyberattacks against Ukrainian targets,” said John Hultquist, vice president of security firm Mandiant.

     The Ukrainian military warned earlier this week that Russian-backed mercenaries had been sent to the area to stage “provocations” as just such a possible pretext.
"Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine."
A senior U.S. defense official earlier said that Russian troops range from about 3 miles to 30 miles from the border.
The Biden administration had warned this week that an invasion was imminent and could include the capital, Kyiv.
The Ukrainian government, which had been previously cooler about the likelihood of war, declared a state of emergency starting Thursday.

     European and U.S. officials scrambled to penalize Russia on Wednesday, responding to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine with a cascade of economic sanctions.
But U.S. officials said that Moscow appeared more prepared than ever to launch a full-scale invasion of its neighbor.
As concerns grew that Russian aggression would escalate, Ukraine warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and to leave the country immediately if they are already there.
The European Union was set to hold an emergency emergency meeting on Thursday, and was reportedly considering another round of sanctions on Russian individuals.
Officials from the United Kingdom and United States also announced or threatened more retaliatory measures after they unveiled initial tranches this week.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
This combination — an anti-Russian regime in what Putin views as rightfully Russian territory populated by rightfully Russian people — is unacceptable to him.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.
