     Sen. Rick Scott's GOP manifesto denies existence of transgender people

     "Facts are facts, the earth is round, the sun is hot, there are two genders, and abortion stops a beating heart.
The majority of the bills target transgender minors' ability to receive gender-affirming health care or participate in sports.
Brandon Wolf, the press secretary for advocacy group Equality Florida, said that Scott's manifesto was "affirmation of what we've been trying to warn folks about."
Last month, former President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender women from participating in women’s sports nationwide if he were re-elected.
“We will ban men from participating in women’s sports,” Trump said during a rally in Conroe, Texas.

     Senate Democrats rip Rick Scott's GOP agenda in new ad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) ripped Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) recently released 11-point GOP agenda in a new ad released on Wednesday.
The DSCC is rolling out a five-figure radio and podcast buy criticizing Scott's agenda, particularly hitting Scott over his call for all Americans to pay income taxes.
"This just in, Republicans have released their plan if they win the Senate," the radio spot says.
“We’re making sure voters know the facts about Senate Republicans’ agenda: a tax hike on millions of seniors and over half of all Americans,” said the DSCC's communications director, David Bergstein, in the statement.
"[Scott] and and Senate Republicans just released an economic plan that doesn’t include a single proposal to lower prices for the middle class.

     But fear not: Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., has a plan — and Democrats are likely very glad that he does.

There’s no appeal to moderates or independents or even conservative Democrats in his proposals.

If I’m Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who’s Scott’s counterpart for Senate Democrats this election cycle, I’m overjoyed that he has so clearly laid out his party’s plans.

     26 things Rick Scott's 'rescue' plan for America would do
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Florida Sen. Rick Scott kicked off the 2024 2022 campaign on Tuesday by releasing an 11-point plan "to rescue America."
(The Contract with America was the Republican agenda unveiled during the 1994 midterms, when the GOP won control of the House.)
Scott, the former governor of Florida who was elected to the Senate in 2018, has his eye on bigger prizes.
He's currently serving as the chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm and has done very little to knock down talk that he would be interested in a presidential bid down the line.
It's a promise of all the things you liked about Trump without some of the bombast and unpredictability.

     GOP Sen. Rick Scott claimed he doesn't want to impose new income taxes on most Americans. It's on page 35 of his new plan.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sen. Rick Scott said his plan didn't include a new income tax requirement for most Americans.
But the plan itself includes in very clear language a proposal to newly extend income taxes to millions of Americans.
"All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount," the Scott plan read.
Last year, 57% of Americans didn't pay federal income taxes, per the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
The group projects that the share of households who won't pay income taxes in 2022 will fall to roughly 43%, amounting to roughly 75 million households.

     New tax plan from leading GOP senator would require all Americans to pay federal income taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Story continues below advertisementRoughly 50 percent of Americans on the bottom half of the income distribution do not pay federal income taxes because they do not earn enough to have income tax liability and because many receive tax credits.
Millions of these Americans do pay federal and state government taxes in the form of payroll taxes, sales taxes and other levies.
“All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” Scott’s proposal states.
Some experts pointed out that Scott’s push for a nominal federal income tax runs counter to the GOP attempt to tie higher taxes to the Democratic Party.
Roughly 100 million Americans paid no income tax in 2021, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
