     Has Russia already invaded Ukraine?
An expert clarifies 'invasion'As the world watches Russia's movements on the border with Ukraine, it can be hard to know when an invasion has officially begun.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)JOE BIDEN: This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he indicated and asked permission to be able to do from his Duma.
O'CONNELL: Part of the complication is that Russia has already invaded Ukraine.
CHANG: And although Russia has always denied it, its forces have also been in eastern Ukraine, so Russia has already violated the border.

     US senators have said the unfolding attack in Ukraine is in line with intelligence briefings they received about what to expect from a Russian invasion.
He added that Russian airborne forces are also working to “take control of the airport in Kyiv (so) they can fly in forces to occupy the (capital) city."
A source familiar with the matter said the tweets were based on US intelligence being shared with Intelligence Committee members.
Congress briefed on attack: As the Russian attack escalated late Wednesday, Sen. Mark Warner, the Senate Intelligence chairman, and Rep. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with CIA Director William Burns, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Sen. Ben Cardin, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that senators would be briefed on the invasion by the White House Thursday.

     Russia Begins Invasion of Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia is proceeding with an invasion of Ukraine – and months of threats and fears appear to be culminating in the worst case scenario for Ukrainians and likely countless others in Eastern Europe.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in a televised address that his country will commence a military operation in eastern Ukraine, warning that the interference of any countries will lead to “consequences they have never seen,” according to The Associated Press .
Soon after, there were social media reports of blasts and explosions in cities across Ukraine, including the capital of Kyiv, in what was described by President Joe Biden as an apparent “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement released late on Wednesday.
“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.
The world will hold Russia accountable.”The president added that he will address Americans sometime on Thursday to announce “the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.”

     Why is Putin attacking Ukraine? He told us.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Editor’s note, Wednesday, February 23, 11:50 pm: In a Wednesday night speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a “special military operation” would begin in Ukraine.
Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.

     Ukraine Live Updates: Russia Begins Invasion From Land and Sea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Addressing his nation in a televised speech broadcast just before 6 a.m. Thursday, Mr. Putin said his goal was to “demilitarize” but not occupy the country.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Twitter that Mr. Putin had “started a full-scale war against Ukraine” and had begun shelling civilian cities.
“This is that red line that I talked about multiple times,” Mr. Putin said.
In bellicose language, Mr. Putin also issued what appeared to be a warning to other countries.
In Russia itself, celebrating Defenders of the Fatherland Day, a national holiday marking the founding of the Red Army, Mr. Putin reiterated his combative message.
