     Rick Scott Defends Plan After His Republican Agenda Sparks Ridicule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Senator Rick Scott has defended his agenda for the Republican Party after his 11-point plan sparked widespread criticism and ridicule.
Hannity suggested that Scott would "come under fire" for the plan, because it includes children saluting the flag and saying the pledge of allegiance.
Schumer shared a Washington Post article about Scott's agenda on Tuesday, adding the comment: "Senator Rick Scott explains the Republican plan to raise taxes on more than half of Americans.
The senator's spokesman, Chris Hartline, told Newsweek on Wednesday: "We're glad to see that so many people are reading and engaging with Senator Scott's plan.
ET: This article was updated to add a statement from Senator Rick Scott's office.

     Senate Democrats rip Rick Scott's GOP agenda in new ad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) ripped Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) recently released 11-point GOP agenda in a new ad released on Wednesday.
The DSCC is rolling out a five-figure radio and podcast buy criticizing Scott's agenda, particularly hitting Scott over his call for all Americans to pay income taxes.
"This just in, Republicans have released their plan if they win the Senate," the radio spot says.
“We’re making sure voters know the facts about Senate Republicans’ agenda: a tax hike on millions of seniors and over half of all Americans,” said the DSCC's communications director, David Bergstein, in the statement.
"[Scott] and and Senate Republicans just released an economic plan that doesn’t include a single proposal to lower prices for the middle class.

There’s no appeal to moderates or independents or even conservative Democrats in his proposals.

     Rick Scott’s ‘Plan to Rescue America’ includes promise to name border wall after Trump
    </h2>

     Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released what he called a plan to “rescue America,” which includes a promise to finish a wall along the Southwest border with Mexico and name is after former President Trump.
President Trump’s plan to build a wall was right.
He’s committed to Republicans taking back a majority in the U.S. Senate.”Scott’s plan was widely praised by Republican allies and mocked by Democrats on Twitter.
“Raise taxes on half of Americans, including seniors and working families,” White House Rapid Response Director Mike Gwin said in a tweet.
From lowering costs and creating jobs, to supporting police and securing the border, Republicans are offering a clear plan to protect and reinvigorate the America we know and love.”

     Florida Sen. Rick Scott released a GOP 2022 agenda, and Democrats seem quite pleased
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Asked about the GOP's 2022 midterms agenda in January, McConnell told reporters, "I'll let you know when we take it back."
"McConnell may be irked, then, that a member of his leadership team released an agenda of his own on Tuesday morning," Jim Newell suggests at Slate.
Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) published his 31-page, 11-point GOP governing blueprint because, he told Politico, it's "important to tell people what we're gonna do."
Scott chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm, but he said this is his own plan, not the NRSC's.
"The document is largely a compilation of culture war grievances," Newell writes.

     New tax plan from leading GOP senator would require all Americans to pay federal income taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Roughly 50 percent of Americans on the bottom half of the income distribution do not pay federal income taxes because they do not earn enough to have income tax liability and because many receive tax credits.
Millions of these Americans do pay federal and state government taxes in the form of payroll taxes, sales taxes and other levies.
“All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” Scott’s proposal states.
