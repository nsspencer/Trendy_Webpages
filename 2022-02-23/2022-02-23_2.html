     Should the Eagles go after Browns’ Jarvis Landry to pair with DeVonta Smith?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry is a five-time Pro Bowl player who has routinely made tough catches and big plays.
In 12 games last season, Landry caught 52 passes (30 of which were first downs) for 570 yards and two touchdowns.
Landry said he wanted to stay with the Browns but would help another team if he is released.
The Eagles need another wide receiver to line up opposite of 2021 first-round pick DeVonta Smith.
On a recent podcast, Smith said that he would like to have a veteran wide receiver on the team.

     Dec 12, 2021; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry (80) gets congratulated by quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) for his touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens during the first quarter at FirstEnergy Stadium.
Mandatory Credit: Scott Galvin-USA TODAY SportsThe Daily Dawg Tags bring you all the Cleveland Browns news you need to know including several looks at the Jarvis Landry fiascoThings went from all quiet, to all-out messy in a heartbeat.
Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry stayed ultra-quiet all season, even when his friend Odell Beckham was released, but that changed on Tuesday.
A look at this fallout and more can be found in today’s Daily Dawg Tags.
Firstly, Landry is saying all the right things; but he’s not doing all the right things.

     Cleveland Browns would be reckless not to redo contract of Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Browns would be fools to release Austin Hooper by Chad PortoThe Cleveland Browns won’t carry the $16.3 million cap number carried by Jarvis Landry.
Either way, there’s no way you’ll convince me the Browns’ analytically driven front office is looking at Landry, 29, eager to pay him all that money in 2022.
He’s coming off his worst season–a 52-grab campaign that resulted in a career low 570 yards and two scores.
Cleveland Browns: Landry’s tailspin is two seasons deepIf you want to look back a tad further, 2020 wasn’t exactly worth the $14.7 million he made.
If Landry doesn’t re-do his deal, my guess is Andrew Berry and Paul DePodesta will cut him and absorb the $1.5 million in dead money.

     Is WR Jarvis Landry's Future with the Detroit Lions?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry endured arguably his toughest season as a professional in 2021.
Should he not return to Cleveland in 2022, he could fill an important void out wide for the Detroit Lions.
Last season, he took six handoffs for 40 yards and two scores, including one against the Lions.
From the Lions' perspective, the addition of Landry would be among the biggest moves they could make in the offseason.
The Lions have a clear need at the position, and adding Landry would be an absolute benefit.

     Should the Chicago Bears target Jarvis Landry next free agency?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With the recent outbreak of Jarvis Landry on Twitter and Instagram, it’s obvious that free agent rumors and trade talks will be tossed around.
And because of that, of course, the Chicago Bears are brought up.
Could Jarvis Landry aid the Chicago Bears’ lack of wide receiver depth?
As of right now, the Chicago Bears, don’t have the most explosive wide receiver corps.
To me, that makes far more sense than waiting a year for Jarvis Landry.

     Cleveland Browns' Jarvis Landry Decision Should Be An Easy One
    </h2>

     CLEVELAND, OH - JANUARY 09: Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry (80) leaves the field ... [+] following the National Football League game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns on January 9, 2022, at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, OH.
(Photo by Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesJarvis Landry said on Tuesday that the ball was in the court of the Cleveland Browns regarding his future with the team.
Landry, as he pointed out, has otherwise been a durable wide receiver during his career.
Yet the reality is that, for the Browns, having Landry account for a $16.37 million cap hit, according to Over The Cap, is difficult to justify.
He has had only one 1,000-yard season in his time in Cleveland and last season saw him average 11 yards per reception.
