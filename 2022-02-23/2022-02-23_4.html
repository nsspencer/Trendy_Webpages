     Liverpool Break Premier League Penalty Record As Mo Salah Makes Leeds Pay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool have now been awarded more penalties than any other team in Premier League history.
The Reds were given two spot-kicks in Wednesday night's 6-0 win over Leeds United and Mo Salah converted them both.
Salah's two conversions from 12 yards moved him to four penalty goals in the Premier League this season - two behind Chelsea midfielder Jorginho, who has the most.
In his Premier League career, over 14% of Salah's goals have been penalties - 17 of 116.
After Liverpool and United, Chelsea are third in the all-time Premier League penalty table with 157, one ahead of Arsenal on 156, while Man City are fifth with 137.

     Liverpool vs Leeds live score and result updates: Premier League latest as Salah and Mane score braces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool piled the pressure on at the top of the table with a resounding 6-0 victory over Leeds United.
The night was comfortable from the outset for Liverpool, with Salah opening the scoring from the spot just 15 minutes in.
When it looked like the visitors had begun to close the floodgates, Mane got his first after a flowing Liverpool move.
The result closes the gap to just three points at the summit of the table, with the two heavyweights still set to meet at the Etihad.
It also puts the Reds in the perfect mindset before the League Cup final on Sunday.

     Mohamed Salah breaks staggering Didier Drogba record in 72 fewer Premier League games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Salah scored twice against Leeds and assisted Joel Matip during a 6-0 thrashing at Anfield on Wednesday night, and in doing so he has broken yet another Premier League record.
Salah has already surpassed many others to claim multiple Premier League records, but his latest achievement may be one of his proudest stats.
Salah has been Liverpool's top scorer in each of the last four seasons, and it's no coincidence that the Premier League and Champions League followed shortly after his arrival.
Can Liverpool go on to win the Premier League and Champions League this season?
Liverpool's long-awaited Premier League title then followed, and at the rate that the Reds are going, they may feel confident about catching Manchester City and doubling up on their recent success.
