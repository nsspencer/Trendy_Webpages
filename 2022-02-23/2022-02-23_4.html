     Rick Scott Defends Plan After His Republican Agenda Sparks Ridicule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Senator Rick Scott has defended his agenda for the Republican Party after his 11-point plan sparked widespread criticism and ridicule.
Hannity suggested that Scott would "come under fire" for the plan, because it includes children saluting the flag and saying the pledge of allegiance.
Schumer shared a Washington Post article about Scott's agenda on Tuesday, adding the comment: "Senator Rick Scott explains the Republican plan to raise taxes on more than half of Americans.
The senator's spokesman, Chris Hartline, told Newsweek on Wednesday: "We're glad to see that so many people are reading and engaging with Senator Scott's plan.
ET: This article was updated to add a statement from Senator Rick Scott's office.

     Senate Democrats rip Rick Scott's GOP agenda in new ad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) ripped Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) recently released 11-point GOP agenda in a new ad released on Wednesday.
The DSCC is rolling out a five-figure radio and podcast buy criticizing Scott's agenda, particularly hitting Scott over his call for all Americans to pay income taxes.
"This just in, Republicans have released their plan if they win the Senate," the radio spot says.
“We’re making sure voters know the facts about Senate Republicans’ agenda: a tax hike on millions of seniors and over half of all Americans,” said the DSCC's communications director, David Bergstein, in the statement.
"[Scott] and and Senate Republicans just released an economic plan that doesn’t include a single proposal to lower prices for the middle class.

     But fear not: Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., has a plan — and Democrats are likely very glad that he does.
I think it’s fair to the voter.”To the surprise of nobody, the plan that Scott lays out is truly bonkers.
There’s no appeal to moderates or independents or even conservative Democrats in his proposals.

If I’m Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who’s Scott’s counterpart for Senate Democrats this election cycle, I’m overjoyed that he has so clearly laid out his party’s plans.

     GOP Sen. Rick Scott claimed he doesn't want to impose new income taxes on most Americans. It's on page 35 of his new plan.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sen. Rick Scott said his plan didn't include a new income tax requirement for most Americans.
But the plan itself includes in very clear language a proposal to newly extend income taxes to millions of Americans.
"All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount," the Scott plan read.
Last year, 57% of Americans didn't pay federal income taxes, per the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
The group projects that the share of households who won't pay income taxes in 2022 will fall to roughly 43%, amounting to roughly 75 million households.

     Rick Scott's 11-Point Plan Is a Haunted-House Version of Newt Gingrich's 'Contract With America'

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, what’s left is a kind of haunted-house version of Newt Gingrich’s old Contract With America.
Public schools will focus on the 3 R’s, not indoctrinate children with critical race theory or any other political ideology.
To say otherwise is to deny science...Men are men, women are women, and unborn babies are babies.
It is an endless tilting against imaginary windmills, a tender-footed stroll through the vast minefield of the American conservative mind.

     New tax plan from leading GOP senator would require all Americans to pay federal income taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Story continues below advertisementRoughly 50 percent of Americans on the bottom half of the income distribution do not pay federal income taxes because they do not earn enough to have income tax liability and because many receive tax credits.
Millions of these Americans do pay federal and state government taxes in the form of payroll taxes, sales taxes and other levies.
“All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” Scott’s proposal states.
Some experts pointed out that Scott’s push for a nominal federal income tax runs counter to the GOP attempt to tie higher taxes to the Democratic Party.
Roughly 100 million Americans paid no income tax in 2021, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
