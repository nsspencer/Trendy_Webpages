     Liverpool Break Premier League Penalty Record As Mo Salah Makes Leeds Pay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool have now been awarded more penalties than any other team in Premier League history.
The Reds were given two spot-kicks in Wednesday night's 6-0 win over Leeds United and Mo Salah converted them both.
Salah's two conversions from 12 yards moved him to four penalty goals in the Premier League this season - two behind Chelsea midfielder Jorginho, who has the most.
In his Premier League career, over 14% of Salah's goals have been penalties - 17 of 116.
After Liverpool and United, Chelsea are third in the all-time Premier League penalty table with 157, one ahead of Arsenal on 156, while Man City are fifth with 137.

     Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Jurgen Klopp is trying not to get carried away by Liverpool being in a full-on Premier League title battle with Manchester City.
[ MORE: How to watch Premier League in USA ]The only thing is, Jurgen Klopp and staying calm don’t go together well.
Liverpool face Man City at the Etihad in early April and many see that game as a straight battle for the Premier League trophy.
We have to win our football games and if we do that we will be around and if we don’t there is no title race.
Then, the attention switches to Premier League (and Champions League) glory.

     Liverpool vs Leeds live score and result updates: Premier League latest as Salah and Mane score braces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool piled the pressure on at the top of the table with a resounding 6-0 victory over Leeds United.
The night was comfortable from the outset for Liverpool, with Salah opening the scoring from the spot just 15 minutes in.
When it looked like the visitors had begun to close the floodgates, Mane got his first after a flowing Liverpool move.
The result closes the gap to just three points at the summit of the table, with the two heavyweights still set to meet at the Etihad.
It also puts the Reds in the perfect mindset before the League Cup final on Sunday.
