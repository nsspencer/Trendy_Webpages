     Should the Eagles go after Browns’ Jarvis Landry to pair with DeVonta Smith?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry is a five-time Pro Bowl player who has routinely made tough catches and big plays.
In 12 games last season, Landry caught 52 passes (30 of which were first downs) for 570 yards and two touchdowns.
Landry said he wanted to stay with the Browns but would help another team if he is released.
The Eagles need another wide receiver to line up opposite of 2021 first-round pick DeVonta Smith.
On a recent podcast, Smith said that he would like to have a veteran wide receiver on the team.

     Should the Chicago Bears target Jarvis Landry next free agency?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With the recent outbreak of Jarvis Landry on Twitter and Instagram, it’s obvious that free agent rumors and trade talks will be tossed around.
And because of that, of course, the Chicago Bears are brought up.
Could Jarvis Landry aid the Chicago Bears’ lack of wide receiver depth?
As of right now, the Chicago Bears, don’t have the most explosive wide receiver corps.
To me, that makes far more sense than waiting a year for Jarvis Landry.

     Is WR Jarvis Landry's Future with the Detroit Lions?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry endured arguably his toughest season as a professional in 2021.
Should he not return to Cleveland in 2022, he could fill an important void out wide for the Detroit Lions.
Last season, he took six handoffs for 40 yards and two scores, including one against the Lions.
From the Lions' perspective, the addition of Landry would be among the biggest moves they could make in the offseason.
The Lions have a clear need at the position, and adding Landry would be an absolute benefit.

     Cleveland Browns' Jarvis Landry Decision Should Be An Easy One
    </h2>

     CLEVELAND, OH - JANUARY 09: Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry (80) leaves the field ... [+] following the National Football League game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns on January 9, 2022, at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, OH.
(Photo by Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesJarvis Landry said on Tuesday that the ball was in the court of the Cleveland Browns regarding his future with the team.
Landry, as he pointed out, has otherwise been a durable wide receiver during his career.
Yet the reality is that, for the Browns, having Landry account for a $16.37 million cap hit, according to Over The Cap, is difficult to justify.
He has had only one 1,000-yard season in his time in Cleveland and last season saw him average 11 yards per reception.

     Did Jarvis Landry actually change the culture for the Browns?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jarvis Landry has done a lot of good since joining the Cleveland Browns in 2018, but did he actually change the culture as many have claimed?
Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry set Twitter and the NFL world ablaze on Tuesday morning with a trio of tweets seemingly indicating he wants out of Cleveland.
Did Jarvis Landry change the culture?
So let’s get to the question at hand; did Landry actually change the culture in Cleveland?
The Browns went 32-32 over the past four seasons, which is a massive improvement from 1-31, but a true culture change isn’t one playoff berth in four seasons.

     3 Reasons The Browns Should Re-Sign Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, the 29-year-old experienced career lows in receptions — and receptions per game — as well as yards, touchdowns, and first downs.
— Jarvis Juice Landry (@God_Son80) February 22, 2022Landry would like to re-sign with Cleveland, so what will the Browns organization do?
Jumping forward to 2021, Landry led the Browns in targets and receptions.
However, no other Browns receiver will make it in the Top 100 either.
The Browns are in need of a turnaround in 2022 and having to rebuild the offense will be tougher without Landry.
