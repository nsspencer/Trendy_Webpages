     The Queen's Recent Death Rumors Fully ExplainedQueen Elizabeth II has had a tumultuous 2021.
Concerns for the queen's health skyrocketed further when she tested positive for COVID-19, as reported by Time Magazine.
With Queen Elizabeth II's 96th birthday right around the corner, concern is at an all-time high that people may be hearing a death announcement instead.
Slate explained how Internet sleuths were convinced that the queen's annual Christmas broadcast was entirely faked.
Back in 2019, people were so convinced Queen Elizabeth II was dead that Editor-In-Chief of the blog Royal Central, Charlie Proctor, had to confirm otherwise, per Town &amp; Country.

     Panic, frenzy unfolds over news of Queen Elizabeth II's death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amid news of the Queen fighting her Covid-19 symptoms, a US gossip website falsely claimed that the monarch succumbed to the virus.
Hollywood Unlocked shocked the internet when it released an "exclusive" story claiming that the Queen is dead, raising questions and causing panic as there was no official statement by Buckingham Palace.
He claimed that a reliable source informed him of the Queen’s death in a tweet which read: "We don’t post lies and I always stand by my sources.
Waiting for an official statement from the palace."
It is pertinent to mention that the Queen recently tested positive for Covid-19 and is suffering flu-like symptoms while in self-isolation.
