     Kentucky basketball lands comeback win over LSU media reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Playing without its starting point guard and shooting guard once again, Kentucky overcame a halftime deficit, then white-knuckled through a closer-than-expected end to avenge its earlier season loss to LSU with a 71-66 victory.
Kentucky All-America candidate Oscar Tshiebwe was his usual terrific self, pacing the Wildcats with 17 points and 16 rebounds.
But the headliner was freshman Bryce Hopkins, who hadn't scored since Kentucky's Jan. 25 win over Mississippi State.
His energy level allowed Kentucky to overcome a tough LSU defense on a night where the Wildcats — without Sahvir Wheeler and TyTy Washington — shot just 2-for-12 from behind the 3-point arc.
Here's what media members said about the Kentucky win over LSU.
