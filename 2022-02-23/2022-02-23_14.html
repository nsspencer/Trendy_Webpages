     2 Black Hawk helicopters crash near Utah ski resort
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two Black Hawk helicopters belonging to the Utah National Guard crashed Tuesday morning during a training exercise, officials said.
The choppers went down near Mineral Basin at the popular Snowbird ski resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, about 30 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
Jared Jones, chief warrant officer 5 with the Utah National Guard, said at a press conference that the helicopters were attempting to land during routine survivability and mobility mountain training.
Mineral Basin is the southeast face of Snowbird resort, featuring multiple double black diamond-level slopes for advanced skiers and snowboarders.
The Utah National Guard canceled training flights after the Tuesday crash pending a safety review, NBC affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City reported.

     Video captures Black Hawk helicopter crash near Utah ski slopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two Black Hawk helicopters were involved in a training accident on Tuesday near a Utah ski resort, officials said — and multiple witnesses to the incident captured the scene on video.
The accident, involving two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, was reported around 9:30 a.m. MST near Mineral Basin at Snowbird ski resort, located just outside of Salt Lake City.
A rotor blade separated from the helicopter and struck the second Black Hawk, which was able to make a quick landing, Jones said.
The two UH-60 helicopters crashed in a normally windy canyon on the backside of the resort known for its expert terrain.
The following month, a similar Black Hawk crash killed three in Boise, Idaho.

     Authorities did not immediately state any possible causes for the crashes, which left no crew members hurt, according to the Utah National Guard.
They were the third and fourth Black Hawk helicopters or variants to incur mishaps this year, according to the Aviation Safety Network maintained by the Flight Safety Foundation.
It was the first crash in a year of a Black Hawk helicopter operated by any state’s National Guard, according to ASN records.
Crashes early last year by National Guard units in Idaho and New York resulted in the deaths of three National Guard personnel in each incident.
The Black Hawk is the workhorse of the U.S. Army, with the Navy using Seahawk and Knighthawk variants and the U.S. Air Force Pave Hawk helicopters.
