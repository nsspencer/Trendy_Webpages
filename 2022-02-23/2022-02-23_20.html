     How to watch: Wisconsin basketball vs. Minnesota
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Wednesday night, the Wisconsin Badgers will head on the road to face off against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the second border battle of the season.
The Badgers are trying to complete the season sweep of the Golden Gophers, after beating them at the Kohl Center 66-60 in January.
Wisconsin will look to current Big Ten Player of the Week, Jonathan Davis for scoring after he averaged 27.5 points in last week’s victories over Michigan and Indiana.
It should be a great game to watch, as the Badgers will battle for position on top of the Big Ten conference.
Where: Williams Arena in Minneapolis, Minn.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MINNEAPOLIS — For 76 minutes across two rivalry games, the Minnesota Gophers men’s basketball team have given the Wisconsin Badgers everything they could handle.
In the final two minutes of each game — Wednesday at Williams Arena and Jan. 30 at Madison — Wisconsin closed out Minnesota.
ADVERTISEMENTIn Wednesday’s first half, the Gophers and Badgers went blow-for-blow.
Minnesota started hot from the field and Wisconsin matched them, but both teams cooled with five minutes left in the half.
The Badgers fed them in the paint, and they each had 10 points on a combined 9-of-14 shooting in the first half.
