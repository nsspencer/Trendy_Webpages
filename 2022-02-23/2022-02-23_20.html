     Jerry Lewis Accused of Sexual Assault by 2 Co-Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two actresses who appeared on screen with movie icon and comedian Jerry Lewis have accused him of sexual harassment and assault, including claims that he fondled one of the women and began masturbating in front of the other.
The interviews with both women were conducted by Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, the directors of “Allen v. Farrow,” in conjunction with Vanity Fair.
Holiday says Lewis complimented her appearance, including her “great boobs” and “lovely legs,” and then began to masturbate in front of her.
And in the documentary she also details a violent rape by a different, unnamed actor in her own home.
The article in Vanity Fair also includes accounts from other writers and producers who came into contact with Lewis throughout the years and described other inappropriate behavior.

     Actresses &amp; Co-Stars Allege Jerry Lewis Sexually Harrassed, Assaulted Them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a feature — and accompanying short film — for Vanity Fair‘s annual “Hollywood Issue,” a number of Jerry Lewis’ leading ladies, female co-stars and many other aspiring, talented women allege that the so-called King of Comedy sexually harassed and, in at least one case, sexually assaulted them.
They found that some of the most severe accusations involved Lewis.
Sharpe asserted that, after a costume fitting in his office, Lewis dismissed the others present and physically assaulted her.
Lewis never spoke to Sharpe unless it was during a scene, she says.
“I was frightened,” she told Vanity Fair.

     Jerry Lewis’ Co-Stars Accuse Comic Legend of Sexual Harassment: ‘He Began to Fondle Me’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A new short documentary and exposé published by Vanity Fair accuses Jerry Lewis of sexual harassment and assault.
Lewis allegedly “started moving in on me,” Sharpe said.
I don’t know if this is a requirement for your leading ladies, but this is something I don’t do,’” Sharpe added.
The comedian did not interact with her or acknowledge her unless they were on camera together for a scene.
“Then he starts to talk to me: ‘Y’know, you could be very attractive but you wear pants all the time.

     Comedy icon Jerry Lewis 'fondled' women and 'unzipped,' his female co-stars allege
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Comedy icon Jerry Lewis, who died in 2017 at age 91, is accused of sexual harassment and punitive behavior by several of his female former co-stars in an investigation published Wednesday by Vanity Fair.
USA TODAY has reached out to Lewis' former manager and his onetime publicist for comment.
There has been no comment from any representatives of Lewis’ estate, nor its benefactor, Lewis' widow SanDee Pitnick.
A shocked and rattled Holiday was too afraid to report Lewis to the Screen Actors Guild: “He was very big at Paramount.
"He started pushing me back, trying to lay me down on the stage," Schumer told GQ after the incident.

     All three women are now telling their stories about how Lewis allegedly mistreated them.
“He had complete autonomy over his movies,” critic Leonard Maltin told the Los Angeles Times in Lewis’ obituary.
Throughout filming, Lewis didn’t interact with her unless the cameras were rolling, she said.
After some dirty talk, Lewis opened his pants, “the ugly thing came out” and he started to masturbate, Holiday said.
“They thought it was very funny and were boasting,” Taylor told the magazine.

The explosive allegations against Lewis emerged as Dick and Ziering investigated the long history of sexual abuse in Old Hollywood, Vanity Fair reported.
According to Vanity Fair, Lewis seemed to think he was entitled to get sex from his female co-stars.
That’s when Lewis “started moving in on me,” Sharpe told Vanity Fair.
Consequently, I was the only actress at his funeral.”Jill St. John, 81, was more circumspect in her statement to Vanity Fair.
