     With some seeing parallels to Ukraine, Taiwan steps up its defenses.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, on Wednesday ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses as she sought to reassure those who see, in the Ukraine conflict, echoes of the self-governed territory’s own existential crisis.
Ms. Tsai’s instructions were delivered as a growing number of people within and outside the island are drawing parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, a democratically ruled territory that Beijing claims as its own.
Though the comparison is not perfect, Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor.
Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands.
“We empathize with Ukraine’s situation,” Ms. Tsai said late last month in announcing the creation of a task force to study the tensions in Ukraine.

     How can US deter China's aggression towards Taiwan?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former CIA and Army Case Officer Kevin Carroll discusses the Russia-Ukraine conflict as China's aggression towards Taiwan rises, arguing the "best thing" the U.S. can do to deter President Xi Jinping from invading Taiwan is by making life uncomfortable for Putin in Ukraine.
KEVIN CARROLL: It's no secret that the communist regime in Beijing as a matter of state policy wants Taiwan back, so I mean, that's just a statement of fact.
One of the best things we can do to try to deter President Xi from invading Taiwan is by making life as uncomfortable as possible for Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.
And again, to deter the Iranians from going nuclear, we should support Ukraine so that we demonstrate we'd be willing to do the same to Israel.

     Taiwan moves to raise readiness due to Russia-Ukraine standoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     1/4Taiwan military vehicles are seen during Taiwan National Day celebrations in Taipei, Taiwan, on October 10, 2021.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen ordered that the island's combat readiness be strengthened, and Taiwan's armed forces to heighten surveillance and awareness of military activity in the region.
During Wednesday's meeting, the Taiwanese president issued four directives -- condemning Russia's "infringement on Ukrainian sovereignty," strengthening readiness in the Taiwan Strait, strengthening Taiwan's response to "cognitive warfare" and continuing to respond to related economic developments.
Although Tsai didn't mention China by name, Taiwan has long been watchful of Beijing -- as China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province.
Tsai said that Taiwan's situation is fundamentally different from Ukraine's situation, but the island must make efforts to stabilize its internal situation as the crisis in Eastern Europe unfolds.

Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's official name.
The statement did not mention China by name, but the country is the most significant military threat that Taiwan faces.
Tsai has expressed "empathy" for Ukraine's situation because of the military threat the island faces from China.

For all the debate in Washington, the differences between the situations with Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan are significant, with everything from history to geography standing apart.
There is one concept that unites Putin on Ukraine and Xi on Taiwan, however: The idea that history and geography can trump self-determination and democracy, no matter what.

     But as Putin condemned Ukraine's acquisition of U.S. and allied military assistance, China too has repeatedly condemned Washington's aid to Taipei.
But Hua too rejected any comparisons with China's own territorial dispute, saying that "Taiwan for sure is not Ukraine."
"However, China's sovereignty and territory have never been divided and cannot be divided.
Taiwan and Ukraine were also both on the agenda during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's call Tuesday with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
On Ukraine, Wang said that "the legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter should be upheld."

     On the surface, there may be parallels: both Taiwan and Ukraine are Western-friendly democracies whose status quo could be upended by powerful autocracies.
World leaders themselves have implied connections between the fates of Ukraine and Taiwan in recent weeks.
Chinese leaders understand that to the United States the stakes are different and its response would likely be very different," he said.
"I would like to stress that there is but one China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.
This tells us that China is not going to match Russia's level of aggression (in Taiwan) -- at least right now."
