     Antonio Conte Hints At Imminent Tottenham Exit After Defeat At Burnley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Antonio Conte sounded like a manager on the edge after watching his Tottenham Hotspur team lose 1-0 at Burnley on Wednesday night.
The result came just four days after Tottenham's brilliant 3-2 win at Manchester City, but it was their fourth defeat in five Premier League matches.
Conte appeared to criticize the Spurs hierarchy in an interview with the Italian media last week, expressing his frustration at an underwhelming January transfer window.
After being asked to clarify whether he wanted to hold a meeting with his players or his employers, Conte continued: "The players are always the same.
Conte is under contract at Spurs until June 2023 but it seems likely that he may be gone much sooner.

     Burnley 1-0 Tottenham: Mee header dents Spurs' top-four hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tottenham missed the chance to close the gap on the Premier League‚Äôs top four after they were beaten 1-0 by relegation-threatened Burnley.
Ben Mee headed the only goal 19 minutes from time at Turf Moor to boost the hosts' survival hopes, moving them to within two points of safety.
For Spurs, it was a case of being brought back down to earth with a bump following Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win over champions Manchester City.
Burnley had only won one of their 12 previous Premier League meetings with Tottenham; a 2-1 success here in February 2019.
Dejan Kulusevski then curled just wide after Lloris did brilliantly to keep out Jay Rodriguez's header at the other end.

     On Saturday, Spurs strengthened their Top 4 challenge in the Premier League with a thrilling victory over Manchester City at the top of the table.

     Franck Kessie (re-)linked with summer move to Tottenham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The last time we wrote about Franck Kessie was late in January, and it wasn‚Äôt good news.
In that report from January 24, Kessie had decided to turn down an accepted January agreement between Tottenham Hotspur and AC Milan because he wanted to move on a free transfer to Barcelona when his contract expires this summer.
According to a short write-up in Sport‚Äôs print edition, Barca are backing away from a summer transfer to Tottenham due to the ‚Äúbulky economic conditions‚Äù that would accompany his potential transfer.
In short, Kessie wants the whole bag, and Barca are just screwed up enough financially to make that difficult.
It mostly means that we‚Äôre probably going to continue to be talking about Franck Kessie again throughout the spring and possibly into the summer transfer window.

     Tottenham boss Antonio Conte changes mind about star and won't block summer transfer exit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     More infoAntonio Conte has reportedly altered his stance on Steven Bergwijn and would be willing to listen to offers for the Dutch forward in the summer transfer window.
The 24-year-old forward joined Spurs on a five-year contract from PSV Eindhoven in a ¬£27million transfer back in January 2020.
He made an instant impact, scoring on his debut against Manchester City, but has since failed to find any consistency.
There are no offers on the table yet, but Milan directors Paolo Maldini and Frederic Massara both like the idea of a transfer.
"In the past when someone asks me about Steven Bergwijn, I was very clear,‚Äù Conte said after the Leicester win in January.

Son whips in a free-kick delivery, Kane makes an untracked run and makes a connection - with his shoulder - and the ball crashes off the top of the far with Pope seemingly beaten.

     Antonio Conte on Tottenham's 'unacceptable' run: 'Club will have to assess me'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Antonio Conte said Tottenham will have to make "an assessment" on his position at the club in a stunning interview after a run of four defeats in five Premier League games.
"In this situation the players are always the same in this club, the club change coaches, but the players are the same, but the result doesn't change.
"Maybe the people have to make an assessment, and I am available for every decision for the club, and to help the club.
For this reason, I think now is the right moment to make an evaluation for the club."
