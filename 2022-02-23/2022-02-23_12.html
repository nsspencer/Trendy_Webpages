     Then and now: How has Duke men's basketball changed since its last game against Virginia?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ball controlTurnovers yet again plagued the Blue Devils in their first Virginia matchup.
Though Duke shot better from beyond the arc and made more than three times the free throws, those extra chances were too much to overcome.
Blocks galoreIn a lone bright spot for the Blue Devils, the team came up with multiple clutch blocks in big moments.
The fatal flaw of the Blue Devils has been their inability to execute for an entire 40-minute game.
Their production seems to come in waves, as it did in the first Virginia game.

     After a strong 74-71 road win against Miami on Saturday, Virginia basketball will look to recreate its best moment of the season as No.
In the first matchup against Duke, the junior guard also showed his prowess defensively, leading the team with four steals.
Duke freshman forward Paolo BancheroBy all accounts, the first-year player from Washington has had a great season for the Blue Devils.
The Cavaliers aren’t a particularly large team, especially on the perimeter, while Duke boasts one of the tallest lineups in all of college basketball.
Tip-off for the game is set for 7 p.m. on Wednesday, and the game will be televised on ESPN.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Virginia hasn’t won two regular-season games in the same season against Duke since Duke’s lost 1995 season.
Of course we all knew Duke and Virginia would come down to final seconds.
Virginia got a career performance from senior guard Kihei Clark, who torched Duke for 25 points.
Virginia simply outworked Duke on a couple of early possessions, leading Mike Krzyzewski to call an early time out at 30-29.
Duke took the game’s biggest lead at 52-44 but got stuck on 52 for three minutes, four empty possessions, while Virginia closed the gap.

7 Blue Devils to outlast Virginia, 65-61, in ACC basketball.
The Blue Devils’ lead was 52-51 when he scored the Blue Devils’ next eight points.
Virginia, though, took advantage as the Blue Devils offense lagged for the next three minutes.
But the Blue Devils dominated the rest of play until halftime.

     Could Coach K go out with another national title, and what's at stake for Virginia basketball against Duke?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And his Duke Blue Devils could just deliver it to him.
It sounds obvious, but I think the Blue Devils' title hopes hinge on Banchero.
That's a solid national title contender, but not necessarily one in the very top tier.
Lunardi: It's impossible to ignore the storyline of a swan song NCAA title for Coach K and the Blue Devils.
And I think most would agree only a conference tournament title would give the Cavaliers a shot at the NCAA tournament.
