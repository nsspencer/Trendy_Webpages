     Potential NFL Landing Spots for Cleveland Browns WR Jarvis Landry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     0 of 4Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesJarvis Landry may soon be joining the list of wide receivers looking for new homes in free agency.
The Cleveland Browns wideout took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to shed light on his situation with the team and his health.
Given Landry's $16.4 million cap hit—approximately 7.9 percent of the projected cap next season—and poor production last year, the Browns may opt to forge ahead without him on their roster.
They can save nearly $15 million in cap space by waiving him, as he'd leave only a $1.5 million dead cap hit.
If Landry does hit the open market, the following teams might be interested in his services.

     Houston Texans should pursue Jarvis Landry in trade talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Houston Texans can upgrade their offensive arsenal with a Jarvis Landry trade.
As Jarvis Landry continues to distance himself from the Cleveland Browns, the Houston Texans can offer him a great spot to be one of the main contributors in an offense.
While Houston isn’t a Super Bowl contender, Landry would most likely get a significant contract extension and a prominent role on Sundays.
Houston Texans could have another win-win trade with Cleveland BrownsJust like with the potential Laremy Tunsil trade, the Texans wouldn’t need to give up the farm to get Landry.
With what happened with Odell Beckham Jr., who got himself out of Cleveland and won Super Bowl LVI, Landry could want the same.

     Browns' Jarvis Landry: Hopes to stay in Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Landry voiced his preference to remain in Cleveland for the 2022 season during a series of posts Tuesday on his personal Twitter account, Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal reports.
Landry has one year remaining on a contract and is scheduled to make $15.1 million in salary and bonuses while absorbing $16.38 million of cap space in 2022, per OverTheCap.com.
If he's cut before June 1, Landry's cap hit would fall to $1.5 million.
The Browns are in need of quality wideouts, and Landry qualifies as one, but injuries and an unproductive 2021 season make him a candidate to be released this offseason.
The wideout, who will turn 30 years old in November, caught 52 of 87 targets for 570 yards and two touchdowns over 12 games last season.

     Should the Chicago Bears target Jarvis Landry next free agency?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With the recent outbreak of Jarvis Landry on Twitter and Instagram, it’s obvious that free agent rumors and trade talks will be tossed around.
And because of that, of course, the Chicago Bears are brought up.
Could Jarvis Landry aid the Chicago Bears’ lack of wide receiver depth?
As of right now, the Chicago Bears, don’t have the most explosive wide receiver corps.
To me, that makes far more sense than waiting a year for Jarvis Landry.

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry stayed ultra-quiet all season, even when his friend Odell Beckham was released, but that changed on Tuesday.
A look at this fallout and more can be found in today’s Daily Dawg Tags.
Firstly, Landry is saying all the right things; but he’s not doing all the right things.

     Is WR Jarvis Landry's Future with the Detroit Lions?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry endured arguably his toughest season as a professional in 2021.
Should he not return to Cleveland in 2022, he could fill an important void out wide for the Detroit Lions.
Last season, he took six handoffs for 40 yards and two scores, including one against the Lions.
From the Lions' perspective, the addition of Landry would be among the biggest moves they could make in the offseason.
The Lions have a clear need at the position, and adding Landry would be an absolute benefit.
