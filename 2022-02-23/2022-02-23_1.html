     Elden Ring Review: Game of Thrones’ George RR Martin Enters Gaming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fans of the Game of Thrones books routinely express dismay at the author George R.R.
Martin spending so much of his time on side projects rather than finishing the long-awaited next entry in the series.
After playing Elden Ring, the new video game that Martin helped write, those fans are advised to reconsider.
Elden Ring, made by the Japanese developer From Software Inc., is one of the best video games I’ve ever played.
I’ve spent around 35 hours playing Elden Ring over the past week and a half, and during every hour that I wasn’t playing, I wished that I was.

     ‘Elden Ring’: Wonder and terror abound in 2022’s most-anticipated game – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     How to talk about Elden Ring, probably the most anticipated title of the year in a big year for gaming, without spoiling its innumerable surprises and qualities?
Announced in 2019, Elden Ring was billed as the next “big” game by the creators of the Dark Souls series, From Software.
When gameplay was finally shown and described, it was clear what we were looking at was “Open World Dark Souls.” And this gave many pause.
Second, I’m only on the second “major” boss, partly because I’ve been enjoying exploring so much, but also because she’s super hard.
Well, if you’ve played Dark Souls at all you’ll feel right at home here.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     None have gotten as close to that feeling as Elden Ring.
It’s an ambitious premise, but it’s also one Elden Ring more than lives up to.
There are a few roadblocks to progression, but for me, the best part of Elden Ring is how open it feels.
What’s particularly great about a more open structure is that it doesn’t get rid of what makes FromSoftware games so beloved.
Elden Ring isn’t a game you pop on for an hour a night.

Elden Ring is another Hidetaka Miyazaki work through and through.
If you want Dark Souls, you will adore Elden Ring.
I find the worlds vacant of personality, desolate, and creating cheap illusions of exactly what Elden Ring has done so capably.
This review has been challenging to write, simply because it’s taking time away from Elden Ring.

Unlike most open world games, you earn your ride almost immediately, making it much faster to travel around the vast world around you.
I went into Elden Ring expecting to compare it to previous Dark Souls games.

     Elden Ring (PS5) Review: Here Be Dragons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Our review of Elden Ring, developed by FromSoftware.
In Elden Ring, you play as a “Tarnished”, a warrior summoned to the “Lands Between” to track down the “Great Runes” and restore the “Elden Ring.” Who are the Tarnished?
I was also heartened to discover that, like Sekiro before it, Elden Ring somewhat departs from the horror-infused aspects of the Souls/Bloodborne titles.
By definition, this is not possible in Elden Ring: when you travel to the north of the Lands Between, it’s very, very far north.
There’s a decent argument that Elden Ring does not actually want you to overcome it.
