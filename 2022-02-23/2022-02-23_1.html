     2 Blackhawk helicopters crash near Utah ski resort
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two Blackhawk helicopters belonging to the Utah National Guard crashed Tuesday morning during a training exercise, officials said.
The choppers went down near the popular Snowbird ski resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, about 30 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
Jared Jones, chief warrant officer 5 with the Utah National Guard, said at a press conference that the helicopters were attempting to land during routine survivability and mobility mountain training.
Mineral Basin is the southeast face of Snowbird resort, featuring multiple double black diamond-level slopes for advanced skiers and snowboarders.
The Utah National Guard canceled training flights after the Tuesday crash pending a safety review, NBC affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City reported.

     Black Hawk helicopters crash near Snowbird
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (@LifterMike93 via Twitter) Two Black Hawk helicopters crashed near Snowbird ski resort Tuesday morning, officials said.
Two Black Hawk helicopters crashed between Little Cottonwood Canyon and American Fork Canyon on Tuesday morning.
According to the Utah National Guard, the two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters crashed during a “training accident” near the Mineral Basin area, southeast of Snowbird ski resort.
Witness videos reviewed by crash investigators show a rotor blade separating from the first Black Hawk and striking the second Black Hawk, Jones said.
Two Black Hawk helicopters crashed just outside the resort boundaries as they attempted to land during a training exercise in American Fork Canyon on Tuesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities did not immediately state any possible causes for the crashes, which left no crew members hurt, according to the Utah National Guard.
They were the third and fourth Black Hawk helicopters or variants to incur mishaps this year, according to the Aviation Safety Network maintained by the Flight Safety Foundation.
It was the first crash in a year of a Black Hawk helicopter operated by any state’s National Guard, according to ASN records.
Crashes early last year by National Guard units in Idaho and New York resulted in the deaths of three National Guard personnel in each incident.
The Black Hawk is the workhorse of the U.S. Army, with the Navy using Seahawk and Knighthawk variants and the U.S. Air Force Pave Hawk helicopters.

     2 National Guard Helicopters Crash near Utah Ski Resort in Training Accident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Utah National Guard spokesman Jared Jones said that the crash occurred during a standard training exercise on U.S. Forest Service land just outside the boundaries of Snowbird Ski Resort, about 28 miles (47 kilometers) from Salt Lake City.
He was thankful nobody was seriously hurt, but said skiers like him were sad when the resort closed lifts and trams near the crash site.
The two UH-60 helicopters crashed near Mineral Basin, a normally windy canyon on the backside of the resort known for its expert terrain.
The crash comes about a year after two similar helicopter crashes.
The following month, a similar crash killed three in Boise, Idaho.
