     ‘Free Guy’ is now streaming on Disney Plus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Free Guy is now available to stream on Disney Plus in the United States.
That means that everyone with a Disney Plus account can watch it from the comfort of their own home at no extra cost from today (Wednesday, Feb. 23).
After multiple delays, Free Guy — which had originally started out life at Fox before being released under the rebooted 20th Century Studios banner — finally came out in theaters last August.
'Free Guy' Disney Plus Poster 1 of 2Click to skipClick to zoomIf you’ve not seen it, or you need your memory jogged, Free Guy stars Reynolds as Guy, a good-natured bank teller living in Free City who discovers he’s really an NPC in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game.
In the meantime, the Deadpool star is reteaming with Shawn Levy for time-traveling action/adventure The Adam Project, which is ironically due to land on Disney’s rival streaming service Netflix on March 11.
