     Governor Abbott Issues Statement In Support Of Austin Police Department Officers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statement of support for the officers of the Austin Police Department:"Last year, Austin set an all-time record for the number of murders.
It comes as no surprise that murders increased after Austin decreased funding for law enforcement.
In Texas, we do not defund and denigrate our law enforcement officers.
In Austin, law enforcement officers defended the state Capitol from criminal assault, protected the Austin Police Department headquarters from being overrun, cleared the interstate from being shut down, and disrupted criminal activity in areas across the city.
Time will tell whether the accusations against the courageous Austin police officers is a political sham.

     Texas Governor Pushes to Investigate Medical Treatments for Trans Youth as ‘Child Abuse’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Our nation’s leading pediatricians support evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender young people.”A growing number of transgender adolescents have sought medical treatments in recent years.
Transgender teenagers are at high risk for attempting suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Preliminary research has suggested that adolescents who receive such medical treatments have improved mental health.
Whether children can be taken from their parents for allowing them to receive such medical care will ultimately be at the discretion of the courts.
“It’s designed to make doctors scared for even facilitating gender-affirming health care.”Some treatments used in gender-related care carry medical risks.

     Abbott orders state agency to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Responding to conservative Republican opposition to gender-affirming care for young transgender Texans, Gov.
Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of "gender-transitioning procedures" as child abuse.
The move came one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws — and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year.
Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate.
Texas law also requires the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who allow gender-affirming care for their children, Abbott told the agency.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate any reported instances of children undergoing "abusive" gender-transitioning procedures.
The announcement comes days after the state's attorney general said that state law characterizes the procedures as child abuse.
"To protect Texas children from abuse, DFPS and all other state agencies must follow the law," Abbott said in a letter sent to DFPS on Tuesday.
The governor directed the DFPS and other state agencies to investigate parents of transgender children, as well as licensed facilities where kids receive gender-transitioning procedures.
"There is no doubt that these procedures are 'abuse' under Texas law, and thus must be halted," Paxton said.

     Governor Greg Abbott Returns to Duncanville, Tackles Hot Topics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     FacebookTwitterPinterestGovernor Greg Abbott, who has served as the 48th governor of Texas since 2015, was warmly greeted by an enthusiastic crowd upon returning to his home town of Duncanville last Tuesday.
Abbott met with Tarrant County law enforcement officials to discuss the fentanyl epidemic that’s destroyed the lives of so many young people.
Abbott said he recently sent 10,000 Texas National Guard troops to fortify the border because the federal government had been reducing the forces there.
As a student at Duncanville HS (class of 1976), Abbott said he worked part time at the original Ben Franklin’s.
He reminded them they could leave there and go vote just down the street at the Duncanville public library.

     Order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott treats gender-confirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN, Texas — Republican Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott has ordered the state’s child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse, a directive that opponents say is a first by any governor over GOP efforts to restrict transgender rights.
It comes months after Texas Republican legislators— who filed more anti-LGBTQ proposals last year than in any other statehouse — proposed laws banning such treatments but failed to pass them.
Arkansas became the first state to pass a law prohibiting gender confirming treatments for minors, and Tennessee approved a similar measure.
“I’m also thinking about the kids who are relying on that care and how frightened the are.”
