     A Groundbreaking Cartoon Family Returns, ‘Louder and Prouder’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When “The Proud Family” debuted on the Disney Channel on Sept. 15, 2001, it introduced one of TV’s first animated African American families.
Over 52 episodes and a TV movie, the series offered a lighthearted depiction of a Black suburban family going about their everyday lives.
They bickered, supported one another, threw shade and showed love — all of the things that typical on-screen families do.
But before The Prouds, TV audiences rarely got to see a Black cartoon family doing those run-of-the-mill things, too.
Now the groundbreaking brood is back with “The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,” a 10-episode revival scheduled to air weekly on Disney+ starting Wednesday.

     “Bruce and I always thought, we should still be on the air,” Farquhar said.
“It was a couple of things that made us persist.
When we first did the show, social media wasn’t what it is today.
I’ve done a lot of live action shows that are very popular hit shows but this one is where I get a lot of comments from people.
That told us there’s still room for the show, a need for the show ... and no one’s providing that.
