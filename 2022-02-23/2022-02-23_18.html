     The Duchess of Cambridge has met with Denmark’s Princess Mary on her second and final day in Copenhagen.
After visiting Forest Kindergarten, the Duchess received an official welcome from Denmark’s Queen Margrethe, alongside her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Mary, at Christian IX’s Palace in Copenhagen.
The pair first met during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s visit to Denmark in 2011, and Crown Princess Mary and her husband, Crown Prince Frederik, also joined William and Kate at Royal Ascot in 2016.
The Queen and Queen Margrethe are third cousins, and both descendants from Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark.

And sifting through our archives, we spied Kate's late mother-in-law, Princess Diana wearing a very similar style back in 1984.
Her dress coat was of the Herringbone variety, with a similar contrasting black velvet collar, just like Kate's.
