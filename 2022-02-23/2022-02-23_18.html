     Emmy Rossum's Latest Role Is Causing A Stir Because Of Her Age
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The difference nowadays is that social media has given everybody a voice, and evidently we're all using that voice to complain about movies.
Actor Emmy Rossum has been working consistently since her debut, in a 1997 episode of "Law &amp; Order," with the star's recurring role as Fiona Gallagher on the American reboot of "Shameless" standing out as arguably her most high-profile gig to date.
Rossum appeared on the hit show for the majority of its run, from 2011 until 2019.
Rossum chose to leave when she did because, as the actor told Entertainment Weekly, "It was time for the character to spread her wings and... there was less need for her."
Maybe the fact Rossum has been an onscreen mainstay for so long explains why she's been cast in a role that, by all accounts, makes little sense.

     Emmy Rossum, 35, to Play the Mother of Tom Holland, 25, in a New Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Have yourself a LOL at Hollywood’s latest confusing casting decision: Emmy Rossum as Tom Holland’s mom.
I’ll save you a google: Holland is 25, and Rossum is 35.
Not as bad as Angelina Jolie playing Colin Farrell’s mother in 2004’s Alexander (Jolie is literally one year older than Farrell)—but still, goofy.
This pairing is for the first season of an upcoming Apple anthology series called The Crowded Room.
Maybe part of the series takes place when Rossum’s character is in her 30s, and they cast her with those scenes in mind.

One person wrote: “35-year-old Emmy Rossum to play 25-year old Tom Holland‘s mom?
*sigh*”“Emmy Rossum playing Tom Holland’s mother on television because she is 10 years older than him and that’s how math works OBSESSED HOLLYWOOD IS PERFECT!!!!!!!!
“I’m supposed to believe Emmy Rossum is Tom Holland‘s mom?
Okay, carry on.”“Nothing here says that Emmy Rossum is going to be playing Tom Holland‘s mother in a present-day capacity,” wrote another.

     Emmy Rossum Cast As Tom Holland's Mom In New Apple TV Plus Series The Crowded Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Apple TV is doing everything in its power to bring in a sustainable audience with each new series they greenlight.
Rossum, whose role as Fiona Gallagher on the Showtime hit Shameless from 2011 to 2019 put her on the map as a star, was recently announced as the latest casting for Apple TV Plus' upcoming series.
Rossum will be joining Tom Holland, who will also serve as executive producer, and Amanda Seyfried as the leads for the upcoming series.
Crowded Room will hopefully help those who struggle with mental illness daily open up about what their struggle has been like for them.
Crowded Room will be streamed on Apple TV Plus on a yet-to-be-announced date.

     Shameless' Emmy Rossum to star as Spider-Man Tom Holland's mum in new series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shameless star Emmy Rossum is joining Spider-Man's Tom Holland in his new Apple TV+ anthology series The Crowded Room – playing his mum!
Entertainment Weekly reports that the actress, who is less than 10 years older than Holland, will play Candy, the mother of Holland's character Danny.
Her character details read: "Through their struggles in life, she dreams of salvation in the form of someone else," with EW noting that it's unclear whether or not Rossum's scenes are opposite Holland or flashbacks.
I think superhero movies are wonderful, and you can be transported to this incredible world that doesn't exist.
And it's really good for kids, I think, as they're getting older," she told Associated Press last year.
