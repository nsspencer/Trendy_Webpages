     Antonio Conte says Tottenham should ‚Äòassess‚Äô his future after Burnley defeat

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Antonio Conte has said that Tottenham should have an ‚Äúassessment‚Äù of his future as Tottenham head coach after a 1-0 loss to Burnley on Wednesday night.
It is Spurs‚Äô fourth loss in five games, although they won 3-2 at league leaders Manchester City on Saturday.
Speaking after Ben Mee‚Äôs winner consigned Tottenham to another defeat, an emotional Conte told Sky Sports News: ‚ÄúIt was difficult tonight and not only tonight ‚Äî in the last five games we lost four games.
‚ÄúIt means there will be assessment, assessment about the club, about me.
The club has to make an assessment, also to speak together, to understand which is the best solution.

     If there were ever fears of Burnley‚Äôs clash with Spurs being an example of ‚ÄúAfter the Lord‚Äôs Mayor Show‚Äù for the Clarets, their own leader Ben Mee ensured the procession continued.
The Burnley captain spent the game flinging himself around to stop Spurs scoring before heading the winning goal to earn his side a second successive victory to boost their survival hopes.
Prior to his goal, Mee had dived across his own goal to head away a Dejan Kulusevski shot targeting the bottom corner.

     Marcos Llorente hit the bar shortly before the interval when it seemed easier to score at the back post.
In the second half, we had more possession in areas that mattered; had we played another 10 minutes, we might have won the game.
We didn't take any risks with the ball; just played the ball in our own half, without any deep runs, verticality.
It is only [the] first half; we have to be ready for the second half at Old Trafford.
