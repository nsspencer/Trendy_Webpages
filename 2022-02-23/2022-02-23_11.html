     Rapper Megan Thee Stallion sues record label for third time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Megan Thee Stallion is going toe to toe with her record label again over her contract.
The “Thot Shit” rapper is suing 1501 Entertainment for third time, this time over the legal definition of an album.
AdvertisementIn October 2021, Megan released Something For The Hotties, a compilation album comprising of her freestyles and loose singles.
Megan first sued 1501 Entertainment in 2020, seeking to terminate the contract entirely after negotiations around it failed.
She sued the label a second time over the release of the BTS song “Butter,” which featured the rapper.

     Megan Thee Stallion Sues 1501 Certified Entertainment Once More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In new court documents filed on February 18, Megan alleges 1501 is impeding her ability to fulfill the terms of her contract.
Per Billboard’s source, if Something For Thee Hotties is in fact recognized as an album, Megan would only be legally required to release one more album with 1501 to fulfill her contractual obligations.
“It doesn’t, and the contract is pretty clear about that.”Megan signed with 1501 Certified Entertainment back in 2018.
“When I signed, I didn’t really know what was in my contract,” Megan said at the time.
Shortly after her Instagram Live broadcast, Megan officially filed a lawsuit to terminate her contract with 1501.

     Megan Thee Stallion Shares Texts Tory Lanez Sent After Shooting

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Megan Thee Stallion has responded to Tory Lanez after the rapper implied that she was lying about the July 2020 incident where Lanez allegedly shot Megan in the foot.
In a since-deleted Instagram post, Megan shared a text message from Lanez where he appeared to apologize “from the bottom of my heart,” adding, “I was just too drunk.
I just feel horrible.”This comes after Lanez was scheduled to be in court today for a hearing in the felony assault case, though court was ultimately adjourned until April.
“Lie yo way out of this,” she wrote.
“If you ain’t do s— what you was apologizing for?”On Twitter, Lanez responded without mentioning Megan directly: “Good D*ick had me fucking 2 best friends ….

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A pre-trial hearing in Tory Lanez’s felony assault case involving the July 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion was postponed to April 5.
The postponement came as Megan responded to false online rumors regarding Lanez’s alleged culpability, which were posted to social media before today’s hearing had even begun.
“Court ain’t even started so why yall ready to start lying?” wrote Megan Thee Stallion (real name Megan Pete) after a YouTuber claimed that “Tory Lanez’ DNA was NOT found” on the weapon allegedly used to shoot Megan in the feet.
Yall tryna win a social media campaign this is MY REAL LIFE!” Pete wrote on Instagram Stories.
In December, LAPD Detective Ryan Stogner testified that Pete said Lanez allegedly shouted, “Dance, bitch!” at her before shooting.

     Megan Thee Stallion Blasts ‘False Narratives’ Involving DNA and Gun in Tory Lanez Assault Case
    </h2>

     Megan Thee Stallion has addressed a claim about a court hearing involving Tory Lanez, directly asking DJ Akademiks what he gained from “lying” and “spreading false narratives” about the case.
Tory Lanez, as was public knowledge, had a pre-trial hearing set for Feb. 23.
(I saw this doc myself.. it literally says it was inconclusive in finding TORY DNA on the gun or magazine).
Despite the statement indicating that a DNA expert still needs to verify the results, Akademiks claimed a victory and asked for an apology in an all-caps tweet.
“Fuck Tory Lanez, and I don’t care if this go viral or none of this shit,” Bun said at the time.
