     John Szeles, Who Mixed Jokes With Gore as the Amazing Johnathan, Dies at 63
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     John Edward Szeles, the comedian and magician who combined jokes with ersatz gore in his stage persona as the Amazing Johnathan, died on Tuesday at his home in Henderson, Nev., outside Las Vegas.
His death was confirmed by Michael Peters, a funeral arranger at Palm Cheyenne Mortuary in Las Vegas, who said that Mr. Szeles’s hospice care report showed he had end-stage heart failure.
Mr. Szeles’s wife, Anastasia Synn, a magician and performer, had said on Twitter that he had been under hospice care.
In 2014, Mr. Szeles said that he consulted doctors after he began feeling dizzy and out of breath.
He learned he had heart disease, with doctors telling him he had 12 to 15 months to live, according to his website.
