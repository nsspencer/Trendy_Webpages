     Texas Governor Greg Abbott Just Declared Open Season on Trans Youths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest in a long line of attacks on the existence, freedom, and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals in the U.S. was waged on Wednesday, when Texas governor Greg Abbott officially directed state agencies to investigate gender-affirming care for trans youths as “child abuse.” In a letter to the state’s department of family and protective services, Abbott defined gender-affirming treatments for transgender children—including gender-reassignment surgery and puberty-blocking medications—as “abusive procedures.”A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services said it “will follow Texas law as explained.” Given Abbott’s decree, Texas doctors, nurses, teachers, and members of the public will now be obliged to report instances of what the governor referred to as “so-called ‘sex change’ procedures.”Texas is one of several states that have ramped up efforts to criminalize trans identity, with Arkansas, South Dakota, and Florida all recently considering or passing legislation that would ban gender-affirming treatment for minors, forbid trans girls and women from participating in female organized sports, and otherwise make living openly as a trans person as difficult and dangerous a proposition as possible.
It’s difficult to overstate just how deleterious an effect Texas’s new policy could have on the mental health and physical safety of trans youth.
Moreover, empowering state agencies to investigate the parents of those youths is likely to have an outsized impact on families of color (who are already disproportionately criminalized and overrepresented in an overtaxed child-welfare system).
Yet the state—which has the second-biggest trans population in the U.S.—may serve as an example of how trans individuals will be targeted across the country if Greg Abbott’s GOP has its way.

     Abbott orders state agency to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Responding to conservative Republican opposition to gender-affirming care for young transgender Texans, Gov.
Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of "gender-transitioning procedures" as child abuse.
The move came one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws — and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year.
Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate.
Texas law also requires the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who allow gender-affirming care for their children, Abbott told the agency.

     Greg Abbott have outlawed gender-affirming health care for trans minors, ordering everyone to report this care to the state or face criminal prosecution.
More importantly, his condemnation of gender-affirming care as a physical or emotional “injury” defies the scientific and medical consensus.
Extensive research shows that such health care dramatically improves minors’ mental health and overall well-being.
Physicians specializing in trans health care could have their practices shut down.
All this to outlaw health care that can literally save a child’s life.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered his state's child welfare agency to investigate reports of 'gender-transitioning procedures' among the Lone Star State's children as potential child abuse.
Abbott issued the order in a letter on Tuesday to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, saying that procedures for transgender youth such as hormone therapy constitute child abuse.
The directive came just one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who like Abbott, is also a Republican, issued an opinion finding that such procedures are child abuse under existing Texas law.
Supporters say that some children are being encouraged to undergo serious medial procedures while still too young to know for sure that they are transgender.
In recent months, The Texas Pediatric Society and Texas Medical Association urged Paxton not to target procedures for transgender children as potential crimes.
