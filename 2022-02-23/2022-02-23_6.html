     A Groundbreaking Cartoon Family Returns, ‘Louder and Prouder’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When “The Proud Family” debuted on the Disney Channel on Sept. 15, 2001, it introduced one of TV’s first animated African American families.
Over 52 episodes and a TV movie, the series offered a lighthearted depiction of a Black suburban family going about their everyday lives.
They bickered, supported one another, threw shade and showed love — all of the things that typical on-screen families do.
But before The Prouds, TV audiences rarely got to see a Black cartoon family doing those run-of-the-mill things, too.
Now the groundbreaking brood is back with “The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,” a 10-episode revival scheduled to air weekly on Disney+ starting Wednesday.

     “Bruce and I always thought, we should still be on the air,” Farquhar said.
“It was a couple of things that made us persist.
When we first did the show, social media wasn’t what it is today.
I’ve done a lot of live action shows that are very popular hit shows but this one is where I get a lot of comments from people.
That told us there’s still room for the show, a need for the show ... and no one’s providing that.

     It’s hard to come up with a better end to Black history month than the return of The Proud Family.
Over 15 years after the Disney animated series came to an end, a reboot — The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder — will hit Disney+ on Feb. 23.
Like the original, the new show will follow the antics of titular Proud Family, including teenager Penny Proud, her parents Trudy and Oscar, and her beloved grandma Sugar Mama.
Johnson voices Michael CollinsOne of the new voices joining the Proud Family cast is E.J.
The rest of the Proud Family: Louder and Prouder cast list reads more like the attendees of an awards show than the voice cast of a children’s cartoon.
