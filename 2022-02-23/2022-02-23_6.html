     Even though Leon (Isaiah John) is happy to be back, he isn't thrilled about taking orders from Louie, which creates friction with him and Franklin.
Plus, Leon holds Oso and his partner Lucia (Emily Rios) responsible for the death of his friend.
Aside from his business, Franklin also has trouble looming with journalist Irene Abe (Suzy Nakamura), who is out to unravel the truth about the crack epidemic and shed light on Melody’s father, Andre Wright’s (Marcus Henderson) death.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When it premiered in 2017, “Snowfall” didn’t necessarily look like it would become a hit.
The series told the grim story of how the ‘80s crack epidemic in Los Angeles grew.
And the best-known name associated with the show was co-creator John Singleton, the Oscar-nominated writer and director.
You can live stream “Snowfall” on fubo TV, which offers a free trial.
As John Landgraf, chairman of FX, recently told journalists during the virtual Television Critics Association press tour, “Snowfall” averages “about nine million viewers per episode.

     FX's 'Snowfall' Season 6: Plot, Cast, Renewal Status &amp; Potential Premiere Date

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The series is yet to be officially picked up for another season, but here’s everything you need to know about a potential Snowfall Season 6, including its plot, cast, and release date.
Snowfall Season 6 CastWith Season 5 currently airing and the characters of Snowfall consistently finding themselves in dangerous situations that could lead to violence or incarceration, it’s unclear which characters will make it through to Season 6.
Snowfall Season 6 Renewal Status &amp; Potential Release DateFX announced Snowfall was renewed for Season 5 on March 23, 2021, about a month after Season 4 premiered.
Considering Season 4 became FX’s most-watched series of 2021, per Deadline, the likelihood of Snowfall Season 6 getting greenlit seems high.
This article will be updated as more information on Snowfall Season 6 becomes available.
