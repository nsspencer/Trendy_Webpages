     Free Guy is now available to stream on Disney Plus in the United States.
That means that everyone with a Disney Plus account can watch it from the comfort of their own home at no extra cost from today (Wednesday, Feb. 23).
After multiple delays, Free Guy — which had originally started out life at Fox before being released under the rebooted 20th Century Studios banner — finally came out in theaters last August.

In the meantime, the Deadpool star is reteaming with Shawn Levy for time-traveling action/adventure The Adam Project, which is ironically due to land on Disney’s rival streaming service Netflix on March 11.

     Who Plays Dude In Free Guy? Ryan Reynolds Body Double Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Free Guy actor Ryan Reynolds provides the face and voice for Dude, the film's clone of Guy, but the giant character is really played by a body double.
While Free Guy’s Dude has the face of Ryan Reynolds, the video game character is actually played by an accomplished body double.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYToward the end of Free Guy, Free City’s creator Antwan (Taika Waititi) tries using both his coders and new programs to try to kill Guy, who is intent on retrieving the source code that proves Antwan stole the game from Millie and Keys.
In reality, Dude was played by Reynolds’ body double Aaron W. Reed, a bodybuilder and former WWE professional wrestler.
