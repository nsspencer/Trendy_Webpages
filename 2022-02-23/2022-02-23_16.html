     Two top prosecutors in probe of Trump Org resign from Manhattan DA's office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two of the top prosecutors leading the Manhattan district attorney's investigation into former President Donald Trump and his business have resigned, a spokeswoman for the DA's office confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.
"We are grateful for their service," said Danielle Filson, communications director for the DA's office, in a statement to CNBC.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks to supporters in New York, Nov. 2, 2021.
New York Attorney General Letitia James' office is conducting a related criminal investigation into the Trump Organization, as well as a civil probe.

     Trump Is Walking Between the Raindrops in a Hurricane
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Without Mr. Bragg’s commitment to move forward, the prosecutors late last month postponed a plan to question at least one witness before the grand jury, one of the people said.
The precise reasons for Mr. Bragg’s pullback are unknown, and he has made few public statements about the status of the inquiry since taking office.
Mr. Bragg’s office must meet a higher bar to bring a criminal case and has encountered a number of challenges in pursuing Mr. Trump, including its inability thus far to persuade any Trump Organization executives to cooperate.
I can’t imagine what effect this will have on the people doing the grunt-level investigating in James’ office, or in Atlanta, or at the January 6 commission.
It’s got to be a gut-punch to them, a further demonstration of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago’s ability to walk between the raindrops in a hurricane.

     Top prosecutors in Manhattan DA's inquiry into Trump resign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg confirmed to The Hill that Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne had resigned.
The New York Times, which first reported the news, said the prosecutors resigned after Bragg signaled doubts about moving ahead with the Trump probe.
Last fall, a grand jury was convened by Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance.
However, over the last month, the grand jury has not heard any witnesses being questioned.
The Times noted that prosecutors avoid enrolling a new grand jury when testimony has already been heard from a previous one, given that conflicting statements can be made by witnesses.

     2 Prosecutors Leading N.Y. Trump Inquiry Resign, Clouding Case’s Future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Because the investigation is civil, the attorney general cannot file criminal charges and would have to sue Mr. Trump.
In December Mr. Trump sued Letitia James, the New York attorney general, seeking to halt the inquiry.
Lawyers for the Trump family had sought to prevent Ms. James from obtaining documents as part of the inquiry and interviewing Mr. Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump under oath.
The lenders, which made millions of dollars in interest from Mr. Trump, conducted their own assessments of his assets.
Late last year, the grand jury heard testimony from Mr. Trump’s accountant at Mazars about Mr. Trump’s annual financial statements, The Times previously reported.

     New York investigation into Trump’s business looks imperiled after prosecutors quit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A long-running investigation into Trump’s business practices from the Manhattan district attorney’s office appears to have been derailed, as the two lead prosecutors, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, resigned Wednesday.
Did Bragg legitimately conclude that the case against Trump, which he inherited from former district attorney Cyrus Vance, was weak?
The Manhattan district attorney office’s investigation into Trump, briefly explainedThis investigation dates back to 2019, and it has already resulted in some charges.
But prosecutors were trying to make a broader case against Trump himself, on a different matter: his company’s real estate valuation practices.
It’s impossible to say without getting a clearer idea of the evidence prosecutors amassed, but there are two main possibilities.

     Two Manhattan prosecutors leading criminal tax fraud investigation into Trump RESIGN over 'doubts'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two prosecutors leading the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal tax fraud investigation into Donald Trump and his family business have abruptly resigned, it was reported on Wednesday.
The two top prosecutors stepping down raising serious questions over the future of the case Trump has referred to as a 'witch hunt'.
The case has so far produced criminal charges against both the Trump Organization and its longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.
Both Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty.
In another blow, top accounting firm Mazars USA, which has long handled the ex-president's corporate and private tax returns, severed its ties with the Trump Organization in early February.
