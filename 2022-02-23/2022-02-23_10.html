     British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK would use "every lever at our disposal" to stop Russia's threats against Ukraine.
Responding to criticism from some MPs that the UK government had not gone far enough Ms Truss wrote in The Times that G7 allies had agreed on further sanctions and "nothing is off the table".

     The latest on the Ukraine-Russia crisis: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) says its mission in eastern Ukraine was threatened and harassed on Wednesday by militia of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic.
The OSCE said its team of monitors "was approached by two armed members of the armed formations," some 6 miles from the line of contact which divides separatist and Ukrainian forces as it was about to launch a surveillance drone (UAV).
"Armed formations" is the term the OSCE uses to describe the separatist militia in Donetsk and Luhansk.
"The patrol members also saw a third individual, wearing a uniform with a Russian Federation flag patch on his shoulder," the OSCE said.
At a second location, "patrol members saw a green Lada approaching at speed with two armed members of the armed formations who were shouting at the patrol and threatening to destroy the UAV."

     Word by Word and Between the Lines: A Close Look at Putin’s Speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And, in an escalation drawing concern across Europe, Mr. Putin suggests that this applies to all former Soviet republics.
This is the beginning of Mr. Putin’s explicit case for war to seize parts of eastern Ukraine and his implied case for possible war against all of Ukraine.
In reality, Ukraine’s ethnic and linguistic groups have coexisted far more peacefully than Mr. Putin claims.
Here Mr. Putin extends his historical revisionism into an indictment of modern Ukraine.
By couching his case in the supposed illegitimacy of the Ukrainian state itself, Mr. Putin is suggesting that no policy change or diplomatic concession could alleviate this threat.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates Ukraine imposes state of emergency as Pentagon says Russian forces ‘could go at any hour’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A senior defense official said Wednesday that 80 percent of the Russian forces arrayed around Ukraine have moved into forward operating positions, suggesting that an invasion could take place if and when Russian President Vladimir Putin gives an order to strike.
“It is our assessment that he is fully prepared to conduct a large-scale invasion,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of a developing situation.
But the official would not specify the number or type of Russian assets they were seeing coalesce, although such troops have not yet moved westward past the territories controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
The official nonetheless warned that Putin “is as ready as he can be” and that the troops “could go at any hour now.”“Whether they actually go or not is up to Mr. Putin,” the official added.
At the State Department, spokesman Ned Price was asked about reports that the U.S. issued warnings to the Ukrainian government that intelligence points to a wider invasion of Russia imminently, particularly, the northeastern city of Kharkiv.

     Why is Putin attacking Ukraine? He told us.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
This combination — an anti-Russian regime in what Putin views as rightfully Russian territory populated by rightfully Russian people — is unacceptable to him.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.
