     For Many Russians, a Deep Unease Over Gathering Specter of War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MOSCOW — Waiting for her friends on Moscow’s primly landscaped Boulevard Ring, Svetlana Kozakova admitted that she’d had a sleepless night.
She kept checking the news on her phone after President Vladimir V. Putin’s aggrieved speech to the nation that all but threatened Ukraine with war.
But this week, after several television appearances by Mr. Putin stunned and scared some longtime observers, that sense of casual disregard has turned to a deep unease.
Pollsters say that most Russians probably support Mr. Putin’s formal recognition of the Russian-backed territories in eastern Ukraine this week, especially because they had no choice in the matter and because no significant political force inside the country has advocated against it.
The gathering specter of war is a different matter altogether, though; in recent days, Russia has not seen any of the jubilation that accompanied the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

The trigger can appear any minute,” he said, addressing Russians in Russian.
Zelensky went on to reject accusations that Ukrainians were neo-Nazis and hated Russian culture.
“You are being told we hate the Russian culture?
Neighbors always enrich one another culturally, but that does not make them one, does not dissolve us in you,” the Ukrainian president went on to say.

     Zelenskiy Urges Russia to Hold Off on Escalation: Ukraine Update

     The Kremlin said separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have called on President Vladimir Putin to come to their aid against Ukraine.
Russia faces further sanctions following its recognition of two breakaway regions.
Earlier, Putin said he remains open to “diplomatic solutions” but insisted Russia’s interests and security must be guaranteed.
The European Union applied sanctions to 23 high-ranking Russians while U.S. President Joe Biden targeted the builder of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates Ukrainian leader directs emotional plea to Russian citizens amid fears of imminent assault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A senior defense official said Wednesday that 80 percent of the Russian forces arrayed around Ukraine have moved into forward operating positions, suggesting that an invasion could take place if and when Russian President Vladimir Putin gives an order to strike.
“It is our assessment that he is fully prepared to conduct a large-scale invasion,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of a developing situation.
But the official would not specify the number or type of Russian assets they were seeing coalesce, although such troops have not yet moved westward past the territories controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
The official nonetheless warned that Putin “is as ready as he can be” and that the troops “could go at any hour now.”“Whether they actually go or not is up to Mr. Putin,” the official added.
At the State Department, spokesman Ned Price was asked about reports that the U.S. issued warnings to the Ukrainian government that intelligence points to a wider invasion of Russia imminently, particularly, the northeastern city of Kharkiv.

     U.S. official warns Putin ready to invade Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ukrainian military warned earlier this week that Russian-backed mercenaries had been sent to the area to stage “provocations” as just such a possible pretext.
“The purpose of these provocations will, of course, be to accuse Ukraine of further escalation,” it said.
Around the time of the Tass report, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. believes Russia is poised to launch an assault on Ukraine.
A senior U.S. defense official earlier said that Russian troops range from about 3 miles to 30 miles from the border.
The Biden administration had warned this week that an invasion was imminent and could include the capital, Kyiv.

     Why is Putin attacking Ukraine? He told us.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Perhaps the biggest question behind the current crisis in Ukraine is this: What is Vladimir Putin thinking?
He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.
This combination — an anti-Russian regime in what Putin views as rightfully Russian territory populated by rightfully Russian people — is unacceptable to him.
History, according to PutinThe central contention of Putin’s speech on Monday is that Ukraine and Russia are, in historical terms, essentially inseparable.
It is illegitimate because Putin views Ukraine as a rightful part of Russia separated purely by an accident of history.

Trump continued to champion Putin on Wednesday morning at the expense of Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election.

After claiming that Americans “now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin,” Carlson framed the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as not being consequential to Americans, despite possible higher gas prices and potential cyberattacks on U.S. businesses.
