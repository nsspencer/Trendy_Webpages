     Senator Rick Scott says the quiet part out loud in new GOP manifesto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is why Sen. Rick Scott’s (R-FL) decision to put out an 11 point manifesto, complete with a running anti-LGBTQ theme, is so surprising.
What exactly are the policies that Scott wants?
“Men are men, women are women, and unborn babies are babies,” Scott writes.
Similarly, Scott wants the Republican party to stop medical treatments for trans youth: “No doctor will be allowed to perform irreversible surgical or gender-altering procedures on any minor child.
Scott wants all laws to expire five years after passage.

     Democrats seize on GOP Senator Rick Scott's plan to tax more Americans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount," the plan states.
"Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax."
One day after the plan was unveiled, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced it would start running new radio ads highlighting the Scott tax plan.
The study also noted, nearly everyone paid some other taxes, including state and local sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, or state income taxes.
Scott's plan to have all Americans pay some income tax brings to mind Mitt Romney's 47% comments, made when he was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.

     GOP Sen. Rick Scott claimed he doesn't want to impose new income taxes on most Americans. It's on page 35 of his new plan.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sen. Rick Scott said his plan didn't include a new income tax requirement for most Americans.
But the plan itself includes in very clear language a proposal to newly extend income taxes to millions of Americans.
"All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount," the Scott plan read.
Last year, 57% of Americans didn't pay federal income taxes, per the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
The group projects that the share of households who won't pay income taxes in 2022 will fall to roughly 43%, amounting to roughly 75 million households.

I think it’s fair to the voter.”To the surprise of nobody, the plan that Scott lays out is truly bonkers.
There’s no appeal to moderates or independents or even conservative Democrats in his proposals.

If I’m Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who’s Scott’s counterpart for Senate Democrats this election cycle, I’m overjoyed that he has so clearly laid out his party’s plans.

     'Shadow box': Rick Scott’s agenda seen as challenge to McConnell by some in GOP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In ignoring McConnell, Scott's team anticipated and hoped for the outcry from Democrats that the plan received.
“Don’t shadow box.”Fabrizio’s comment came in reply to a post from Scott’s top political adviser, Curt Anderson, who criticized journalists for quoting anonymous Republican critics of Scott’s plan.
The release of his own agenda for the party is "clearly an ambition thing," said one aide to a Senate Republican leader.
Asked if he was angling to be the Senate GOP leader, Scott issued a one-word response: "No."
Thank God someone is owning the libs.”'Said a senior Senate Republican aide: "A lot of this is what Republican voters want, what donors want."

     New tax plan from leading GOP senator would require all Americans to pay federal income taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Millions of these Americans do pay federal and state government taxes in the form of payroll taxes, sales taxes and other levies.
“All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” Scott’s proposal states.
Some experts pointed out that Scott’s push for a nominal federal income tax runs counter to the GOP attempt to tie higher taxes to the Democratic Party.
Roughly 100 million Americans paid no income tax in 2021, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
“I’ve said for 30 years everybody should pay some income tax, if you’re going to vote and have government benefits.
