     Sen. Rick Scott in Republican agenda says there are only two genders, pledges to keep 'biological males' out of women's sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R) this week published an 11-point plan for Republicans should they retake control of Congress this year.
Scott, who served as Florida’s governor from 2011 to 2019, in his plan also pledges to “protect women’s sports” by banning transgender women and girls from competing.
Speaking at a rally in Texas last month, Trump said he would ban transgender women from participating in women’s sports if he were re-elected president in 2024.
“We will ban men from participating in women’s sports,” he said.
“No doctor will be allowed to perform irreversible surgical or gender-altering procedures on any minor child,” he writes.

     "Facts are facts, the earth is round, the sun is hot, there are two genders, and abortion stops a beating heart.
The majority of the bills target transgender minors' ability to receive gender-affirming health care or participate in sports.
Brandon Wolf, the press secretary for advocacy group Equality Florida, said that Scott's manifesto was "affirmation of what we've been trying to warn folks about."
Last month, former President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender women from participating in women’s sports nationwide if he were re-elected.
“We will ban men from participating in women’s sports,” Trump said during a rally in Conroe, Texas.

     Democrats seize on GOP Senator Rick Scott's plan to tax more Americans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount," the plan states.
"Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax."
One day after the plan was unveiled, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced it would start running new radio ads highlighting the Scott tax plan.
The study also noted, nearly everyone paid some other taxes, including state and local sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, or state income taxes.
Scott's plan to have all Americans pay some income tax brings to mind Mitt Romney's 47% comments, made when he was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.

     26 things Rick Scott's 'rescue' plan for America would do
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Florida Sen. Rick Scott kicked off the 2024 2022 campaign on Tuesday by releasing an 11-point plan "to rescue America."
(The Contract with America was the Republican agenda unveiled during the 1994 midterms, when the GOP won control of the House.)
Scott, the former governor of Florida who was elected to the Senate in 2018, has his eye on bigger prizes.
He's currently serving as the chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm and has done very little to knock down talk that he would be interested in a presidential bid down the line.
It's a promise of all the things you liked about Trump without some of the bombast and unpredictability.

     Fellow Republicans skewer Sen. Rick Scott's rescue America plan as 'polarizing' and 'grist for the Trump mill'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sen. Rick Scott's 11-point, midterm victory plan leans very Trumpy.
Scott said his plan would "strike fear in the heart of some Republicans."
The Florida senator and chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm released the plan on February 22 days ahead of his appearance at the conservative conference CPAC in Florida on February 26.
Rick Scott's plan declares that there are only "two genders."
"The Senate Republican leader sets the tone for the entire conference," Bonjean said.

     New tax plan from leading GOP senator would require all Americans to pay federal income taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Millions of these Americans do pay federal and state government taxes in the form of payroll taxes, sales taxes and other levies.
“All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” Scott’s proposal states.
Some experts pointed out that Scott’s push for a nominal federal income tax runs counter to the GOP attempt to tie higher taxes to the Democratic Party.
Roughly 100 million Americans paid no income tax in 2021, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
“I’ve said for 30 years everybody should pay some income tax, if you’re going to vote and have government benefits.
