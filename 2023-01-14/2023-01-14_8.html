"FUR FUROREIn 1987, the Miss Universe competition was set to be led by game show host Bob Barker.
Shortly after, the Miss Universe Organization announced that Federova would be stripped of her title.
The move came as a surprise for many who believed that the Miss Universe competition should promote more wholesome, intellect-based values over body image.
Summers was still allowed to continue in the Miss Universe pageant, however, she did not win.
