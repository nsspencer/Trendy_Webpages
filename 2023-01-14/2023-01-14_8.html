     Report: Alabama Football Hires Noteworthy Defensive Assistant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Alabama Crimson Tide needs a defensive coordinator after Friday's surprising news that Pete Golding has left Nick Saban's staff for the same position with Ole Miss.
Well, Saturday, Saban hired a defensive coordinator — although it doesn't look like he'll hold that title for Alabama.
According to Brandon Marcello of 247Sports, Alabama has hired Southern Miss defensive coordinator Austin Armstrong.
"Souther Miss defensive coordinator Austin Armstrong has been hired at Alabama, where he is expected to coach linebackers, a source tells @247Sports," Marcello tweeted.
Not only does Alabama still have a vacancy for its defensive coordinator, the Crimson Tide need someone to coach in the secondary, as well, after safeties coach Charles Kelly left to become the defensive coordinator for Deion Sanders at Colorado.

     Summary: Former Alabama football defensive coordinator Pete Golding has been with the Crimson Tide as the program’s defensive coordinator since 2018.

     Summary: When Miece Loureiro left Husson University after a strong sophomore season as the football team’s leading rusher in 2018, he did so for a good reason.
“I’ve always wanted to get paid to play football, regardless of whether it was in the NFL or something else,” Loureiro said.
The ELF was formed in 2020, had its inaugural season in 2021, and has quickly established itself as the highest level of football in Europe.
When he returned home, living in Windham with his mother, Gloria LaGrange, Loureiro worked “a lot of random jobs.” But he still had the itch to play football.
