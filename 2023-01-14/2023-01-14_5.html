     UFC 285 fight card: Jon Jones vs. Ciryl Gane set for heavyweight title clash in Las Vegas in March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After years of talk and nearly a decade of speculation, Jon Jones' heavyweight debut is finally set.
Jones will face former interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane for the heavyweight championship in the main event of UFC 285 on March 4 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
The win over Reyes was Jones' second consecutive controversial decision victory, following a split decision win over Thiago Santos.
It was also the third successful title defense of Jones' second stint as UFC light heavyweight champion.
After rattling off seven straight wins in the Octagon and winning the interim title, Gane got a shot at Francis Ngannou for the full world championship.

     MMA: Jon Jones to fight for UFC heavyweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Albuquerque resident and longtime former UFC light heavyweight champion Jon “Bones” Jones will face France’s Cyril Gane for that organization’s heavyweight title on March 24.
Later, he renounced the light heavyweight belt and declared his intention to campaign as a heavyweight.
The heavyweight title was vacated when champion Frances N’Gannou, long at odds with White, was released by the UFC.
Since defeating Reyes in Houston, Jones was banned from training at Albuquerque’s Jackson-Wink MMA by J-W co-owner Mike Winkeljohn after Jones’ September 2021 arrest in Las Vegas on domestic-violence charges.
Albuquerque MMA featherweight Dan Argueta (9-1) defeated Nick Aguirre (7-1) by unanimous decision on a UFC Fight Night card at UFC Apex.
