     Nick Bosa delivers pressure, comes up with key fumble recovery for San Francisco 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick Bosa delivered a big-time season for the San Francisco 49ers this year.
With the 49ers clinging to a 23-17 lead, Seattle was deep in the red zone and facing a long 3rd-down play.
Though Bosa’s pressure did not get home for the sack, he did flush Smith up in the pocket.
After a fumble was forced, it was Bosa diving back on top of the ball for a key takeaway.
The 49ers used that takeaway to go down the field and score, giving San Francisco a 31-17 lead early in the fourth quarter with a shot to advance.

     Summary: Defensive end Charles Omenihu caused a fumble and Bosa fell on the ball.
Seattle was on the verge of cutting into a 23-17 San Francisco lead before the sack fumble.
Bosa had 5 tackles in Saturday's game to go along with his huge play.
It was his first since his rookie season in a game against Green Bay on Nov. 24, 2019.
San Francisco might be a stronger threat to win it all this season, and that's with rookie Brock Purdy at QB.
