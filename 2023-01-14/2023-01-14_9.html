     Francis Ngannou to be released from UFC and lose heavyweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ngannou will depart the UFC after being embroiled in a contract feud with the promotion, which will see him vacate his heavyweight titleFrancis Ngannou is set to be released from the UFC and will vacate his title after failing to agree a new deal.
Ngannou last defended his UFC heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane last January but tore his knee ligaments which left his UFC future uncertain.
However a poster yesterday was leaked which matched up American Jones in a heavyweight title clash with previous contender Gane, sparking rumours that Ngannou had elected to depart and vacate his title.
"He doesn’t know what’s going to happen with his knee, he’s not getting younger,” White said.
I don't know what's going to come in, that's a risk every time, but I can know what's going out.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After news leaked earlier Saturday regarding a Jon Jones vs. Ciryl Gane heavyweight title fight at UFC 285 in March, the writing was on the wall.
Now, Francis Ngannou is out of the promotion, period.
UFC President Dana White confirmed the news to media outlets including Cageside Press at the UFC Apex on Saturday.
“The first question’s got to be about the heavyweight fight, so I guess I’ll jump right into that,” White announced.
That’s a good question,” White answered when asked whether Ngannou would have signed off on a deal if Jon Jones wasn’t involved.

     UFC bombshell: Dana White confirms Francis Ngannou released from contract after turning down deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC boss Dana White has announced Francis Ngannou will be released from his contract after turning down an offer that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight of all time.
White spoke to the media following UFC Vegas 67 and announced Jon Jones will face Ciryl Gane for the heavyweight title on March 4, and that Ngannou has been released from the organisation and stripped of his belt.
He finished his career with the UFC with a 12-2 record - winning his last six fights.
Ciryl Gane (pictured kicking Ngannou in their title bout) is the No.1-ranked heavyweight and should be a big test for JonesGane is the UFC's No.1 ranked heavyweight and is widely considered one of the best strikers in the world.
He has only ever been knocked down once, by Aussie Tai Tuivasa, and has a record of 9-1 - his only loss coming to Ngannou last January.

     Francis Ngannou released; Jon Jones returns, meets Ciryl Gane for newly vacated heavyweight title at UFC 285
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Jones will make his return to the octagon in March after more than three years away when he meets Ciryl Gane for the now vacant heavyweight title at UFC 285.
He’ll meet Gane (11-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC) for the belt the UFC has stripped from Francis Ngannou (17-3 MMA, 12-2 UFC) after a contract dispute with the promotion.
UFC president Dana White confirmed the matchup Saturday following UFC Fight Night 217 after photos of a digital billboard attached to T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas surfaced on social media.
White said Ngannou has been released from his UFC contract and is free to fight elsewhere.
He edged out a narrow and controversial decision over Dominick Reyes in that fight for his 13th career title fight win at 205 pounds.
