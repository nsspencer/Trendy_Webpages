    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATHENS — Nolan Smith came out of his Georgia football pads for the final time in the 42-20 win over Florida.
Brian Kemp singled out Smith, who is from Savannah, for praise at the team’s CFP Championship celebration on Saturday.
“It was a tremendous defense at every level, with some incredible leadership from Nolan Smith,” Kemp said.
“Nolan is one of those rare guys that saw the value in being from Georgia, committing to Georgia, never wavering from Georgia, and leading the class,” Smart said of Smith, who came to the Bulldogs as the No.
It’s little things like that that make a difference in a team.” Smith’s farewell video came out on Saturday after the team’s CFP Championship celebration at Sanford Stadium.

     Summary: Based on Jeremy Pruitt's track record as an assistant coach, he would be a strong hire for Nick Saban’s next Alabama football defensive coordinator with Pete Golding heading to Ole Miss.

     Summary: When Miece Loureiro left Husson University after a strong sophomore season as the football team’s leading rusher in 2018, he did so for a good reason.
“I’ve always wanted to get paid to play football, regardless of whether it was in the NFL or something else,” Loureiro said.
The ELF was formed in 2020, had its inaugural season in 2021, and has quickly established itself as the highest level of football in Europe.
When he returned home, living in Windham with his mother, Gloria LaGrange, Loureiro worked “a lot of random jobs.” But he still had the itch to play football.
