     Dana White: Francis Ngannou Will Be Released by UFC After Rejecting Contract Offer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesUFC President Dana White announced on Saturday that the promotion has released heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou after the two sides could not reach a contract agreement.
White had more comments on Ngannou, including thoughts on negotiations regarding the heavyweight fight that never happened between the now ex-champ and Jones.
Eric Nicksick, Ngannou's head coach, ballparked the probability of a Jones-Ngannou fight happening then.
A Jones-Ngannou fight won't be happening now, but numerous MMA analysts sided with Ngannou upon his departure.
Ngannou won by unanimous decision over Gane in Jan. 2022 at UFC 270.

     Francis Ngannou released; Jon Jones returns, meets Ciryl Gane for newly vacated heavyweight title at UFC 285
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Jones will make his return to the octagon in March after more than three years away when he meets Ciryl Gane for the now vacant heavyweight title at UFC 285.
He’ll meet Gane (11-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC) for the belt the UFC has stripped from Francis Ngannou (17-3 MMA, 12-2 UFC) after a contract dispute with the promotion.
UFC president Dana White confirmed the matchup Saturday following UFC Fight Night 217 after photos of a digital billboard attached to T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas surfaced on social media.
White said Ngannou has been released from his UFC contract and is free to fight elsewhere.
He edged out a narrow and controversial decision over Dominick Reyes in that fight for his 13th career title fight win at 205 pounds.

     Summary: Francis Ngannou is no longer the UFC heavyweight champion, and in fact is no longer in the UFC.
As a result, White said, Ngannou is officially a free agent with the UFC waiving all rights to match any other offers.
“I think Francis is in a place right now where he doesn’t want to take a lot of risk.
I think [UFC COO] Hunter [Campbell] went to 350 dinners with him.
“I think he doesn’t want to take the risk,” White said of Ngannou.

     Summary: After news leaked earlier Saturday regarding a Jon Jones vs. Ciryl Gane heavyweight title fight at UFC 285 in March, the writing was on the wall.
Now, Francis Ngannou is out of the promotion, period.
UFC President Dana White confirmed the news to media outlets including Cageside Press at the UFC Apex on Saturday.
“The first question’s got to be about the heavyweight fight, so I guess I’ll jump right into that,” White announced.
That’s a good question,” White answered when asked whether Ngannou would have signed off on a deal if Jon Jones wasn’t involved.

     UFC releases Francis Ngannou; Jon Jones to fight Ciryl Gane for vacant heavyweight title at UFC 285
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Jones, who hasn't fought since February 2020, will face former UFC interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane on March 4 in Las Vegas.
White said after the UFC Vegas 67 card the UFC had offered Ngannou a contract that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight in UFC history, but that Ngannou had turned it down.
Ngannou last fought when he scored a decision over Gane on Jan. 22, 2022, in Anaheim, California, at the Honda Center for the undisputed heavyweight title.
Jones, who first won the light heavyweight title in 2011, has spoken of his desire to win a heavyweight title as long ago as 2013.
Story continues"Absolutely, I'd love to have Henry coaching me for this Ciryl Gane fight," Jones said.
