     Dana White: Francis Ngannou Will Be Released by UFC After Rejecting Contract Offer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesUFC President Dana White announced on Saturday that the promotion has released heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou after the two sides could not reach a contract agreement.
White had more comments on Ngannou, including thoughts on negotiations regarding the heavyweight fight that never happened between the now ex-champ and Jones.
Eric Nicksick, Ngannou's head coach, ballparked the probability of a Jones-Ngannou fight happening then.
A Jones-Ngannou fight won't be happening now, but numerous MMA analysts sided with Ngannou upon his departure.
Ngannou won by unanimous decision over Gane in Jan. 2022 at UFC 270.

Now, Francis Ngannou is out of the promotion, period.
UFC President Dana White confirmed the news to media outlets including Cageside Press at the UFC Apex on Saturday.

     UFC bombshell: Dana White confirms Francis Ngannou released from contract after turning down deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC boss Dana White has announced Francis Ngannou will be released from his contract after turning down an offer that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight of all time.
White spoke to the media following UFC Vegas 67 and announced Jon Jones will face Ciryl Gane for the heavyweight title on March 4, and that Ngannou has been released from the organisation and stripped of his belt.
He finished his career with the UFC with a 12-2 record - winning his last six fights.
Ciryl Gane (pictured kicking Ngannou in their title bout) is the No.1-ranked heavyweight and should be a big test for JonesGane is the UFC's No.1 ranked heavyweight and is widely considered one of the best strikers in the world.
He has only ever been knocked down once, by Aussie Tai Tuivasa, and has a record of 9-1 - his only loss coming to Ngannou last January.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Jones will make his return to the octagon in March after more than three years away when he meets Ciryl Gane for the now vacant heavyweight title at UFC 285.
He’ll meet Gane (11-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC) for the belt the UFC has stripped from Francis Ngannou (17-3 MMA, 12-2 UFC) after a contract dispute with the promotion.
UFC president Dana White confirmed the matchup Saturday following UFC Fight Night 217 after photos of a digital billboard attached to T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas surfaced on social media.
White said Ngannou has been released from his UFC contract and is free to fight elsewhere.
He edged out a narrow and controversial decision over Dominick Reyes in that fight for his 13th career title fight win at 205 pounds.
