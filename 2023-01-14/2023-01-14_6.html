     NFL rumors: Brock Purdy still 49ers' playoff QB even if Jimmy Garoppolo back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Faithful needed reassurance that their team belongs to rookie quarterback Brock Purdy, FOX Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer gave it to them before kickoff Saturday.
Right before the NFC wild-card playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Glazer reported that while Jimmy Garoppolo is nearing a return from his broken foot, Purdy will not come out as the 49ers' starting QB.
If he returns, it is to be a backup, to back up Brock Purdy, not to be the starter.
Jimmy Garoppolo is eager to get back but Brock Purdy will remain as the starter.
The 49ers will ride the hot hand, and that's Purdy, whom they hope they will take them to Glendale, Ariz.Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast

     Where is Jimmy Garoppolo? How Week 13 injury paved way for Brock Purdy's improbable 49ers playoff run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Jimmy Garoppolo is certainly a better QB2 than most of the other options across the league, losing two quality starters would put most organizations into the hole.
MORE: NFL playoff QB power rankings, from Joe Burrow to Skylar ThompsonBut as Purdy takes the field for the 49ers' matchup against the Seahawks on Saturday, a question remains: Where is Jimmy Garoppolo?
Here's the answer:Where is Jimmy Garoppolo?
In Week 13, Jimmy Garoppolo suffered a foot injury that was, supposedly, going to keep him out the remainder of the year.
Garoppolo suffered broken bones in multiple spots in his left foot in San Francisco's Week 13 matchup with the Dolphins.

     Can Jimmy Garoppolo play for 49ers in divisional round of 2023 NFL Playoffs?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers have passed their first test of the 2023 NFL Playoffs, taking down their division rivals Seattle Seahawks at home 41-23.
The 49ers now advance to the divisional round of the playoffs where they will meet either the Minnesota Vikings, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or Dallas Cowboys.
The 49ers have been winning behind quarterback Brock Purdy, who has taken the NFL world by storm since he stepped in for Jimmy Garoppolo.
Next week’s matchup would be the seventh week in this timeline, which means technically the 49ers could get Garoppolo back.
The 49ers are likely trying to move on from Garoppolo and probably won’t risk him unless he absolutely has to play.

     49ers' Brock Purdy to remain starting QB rest of playoffs even if Jimmy Garoppolo cleared to play, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The transition has been seamless, as the 49ers finished the regular season on a 10-game winning streak, with the first five coming with Garoppolo as the starter and the last five with Purdy inserted into the lineup.
If Garoppolo, the quarterback who started Super Bowl LIV for the 49ers when they lost to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, can return, it will be as Purdy's backup.
He became the first rookie in NFL history with multiple passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in his first playoff game.
He also became the fourth 49ers quarterback with three or more passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in a playoff game, joining Hall of Famer Joe Montana (1984), Jeff Garcia (2002), and Alex Smith (2011).
Safe to say Purdy has the quarterback job in San Francisco locked down for as long as they're alive this postseason.
