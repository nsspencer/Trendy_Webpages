     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCThe long-awaited heavyweight debut of UFC star Jon Jones is on the horizon, and it will come in the form of a title fight against Ciryl Gane at UFC 285 on March 4.
Jones had previously confirmed the fight to MMA content creator Michael Wonsover on Saturday:Rumors of a title fight between Jones and Gane began to swirl when a photo of the matchup was advertised on T-Mobile Arena.

The fight against Gane was the last one remaining on his UFC deal.
However, UFC president Dana White said Jones' desire to earn "Deontay Wilder money" for a fight against Ngannou had hindered negotiations.

     Summary: Jon Jones, who hasn't fought since February 2020, will face former UFC interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane on March 4 in Las Vegas.
