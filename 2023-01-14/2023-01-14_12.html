     Why Al Michaels is back on NBC calling Chargers-Jaguars wild card playoff game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’ve flipped on the Los Angeles Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars wild card playoff game on Saturday and heard the legendary Al Michaels on the play-by-play call with NBC, no, you’re not just hearing things.
Michaels is indeed calling a playoff game for the network he was a part of for so long, even though he left NBC for Amazon to do Prime Video's "Thursday Night Football" games this past season.
Back when he left, Michaels became a “broadcaster emeritus” and NBC announced he would work an NFL playoff game for them.
That’s easy: Collinsworth will call Sunday’s Ravens-Bengals game with his usual partner, Mike Tirico.

     Why Is Al Michaels Calling the Jaguars-Chargers Game For NBC?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Michaels disappointed some NFL fans when he left NBC to become the play-by-play announcer alongside Kirk Herbstreit for Prime Video’s exclusive coverage of Thursday Night Football.

Via the New York Post, Michaels recently spoke with Richard Deitsch of TheAthletic.com regarding the first year of Al’s Amazon adventure.
Although the headline to the Post article paints with too broad of a brush (“Al Michaels rips ‘dreadful’ Thursday night Amazon games: ‘I can’t sell a used car'”), Michaels did indeed offer pointed remarks regarding one specific Thursday night game that prompted him to make pointed remarks in real time.
Maybe not to that degree, but I try to echo the feelings of what the fan feels because I’m a fan.”Millions continue to be fans of Al Michaels.
