     Jaguars come back from 27-point deficit to stun Chargers, advance to AFC Divisional Round

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars defeated the Los Angeles Chargers, 31-30, to advance to the AFC Divisional Round for the first time since the 2017 season.
Jacksonville had an improbable run to the playoffs after picking No.
1 overall in the past two drafts, and they built on that story Saturday night with a seemingly impossible 27-point comeback to vanquish L.A.
The Jaguars will await the results of Sunday's AFC wild-card slate to find out who they face next weekend.

     Chargers' Mike Williams won't Play Saturday vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.

     Chargers Lead Jaguars 27-7 at Halftime in Wild Card Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The wild card matchup between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Los Angeles Chargers marked the playoff debuts for two of the top young quarterbacks in the league.
Lawrence threw four interceptions in the first half - three by Asante Samuel Jr. - to give Herbert a short field to work with while helping the Chargers build a 27-7 halftime lead.
Lawrence was intercepted by Samuel again on the Jaguars' next drive, putting the Chargers back in the red zone at the 16-yard line.
Herbert later added his first postseason touchdown pass, connecting with Everett for a nine-yard score to give the Chargers a 24-0 lead with 7:12 left in the half.
The Jaguars are hosting just the fifth playoff game in franchise history, and first in 23 seasons.

     Summary: Trevor Lawrence saw his first NFL playoff action on Saturday night against the Los Angeles Chargers.
The second-year passer threw four interceptions in the first half, as the Jacksonville Jaguars eventually fell behind the visiting Chargers by a score of 27-0.
Cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. had other ideas:In fairness to both Lawrence and Jones, Samuel Jr. was, well, a little physical at the top of this route from the receiver.
However, the Chargers drop into a two-high zone, with Samuel Jr. in the flat.
But this first half of playoff football will be one that Lawrence will love to forget.
