     Fox highlights PG-13 sign about 49ers' Brock Purdy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesThe San Francisco 49ers (and their fans) have enjoyed giving backup quarterbacks nether-related nicknames over the last few years.
Nick Mullens and Brock Purdy have allowed for not-particularly-sophisticated first-name wordplay opportunities that rhyme with a synonym for "penis."
Mullens was often called "Big Dick Nick" during his tenuous 49ers tenure, and now, Purdy has followed in his footsteps.
The Niners have reportedly tabbed Purdy as "Big Cock Brock" and keep talking about the size of his testicles after he snagged the starting job this season.
(Or the producer didn't know what they just showed on TV.)

     Brock Purdy balled out in the NFL playoffs, and the 49ers might have a real answer at QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers rookie quarterback Brock Purdy has had a lot on his shoulders in his young career, but in every step of the way, he’s met—and surpassed—every possible expectation.
His legend just got even bigger after leading San Francisco to a 41-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks in the opening round of the 2023 NFL playoffs.
Most importantly, though, the 49ers are now 6-0 with Purdy as their starting quarterback.
When the reigns were handed to Purdy, many questioned whether San Francisco could realistically make a deep run in the playoffs.
If there a ceiling that Purdy will eventually hit, we haven’t seen it yet, and that makes the San Francisco 49ers a dangerous team throughout the rest of this tournament.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Purdy passed another test after helping guide the 49ers through a more competitive wild-card playoff game than expected against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday afternoon.
Purdy is the first rookie quarterback to start in a playoff win since Russell Wilson did it 10 years ago.
Story continuesThe 49ers' rookie quarterback, who was the last pick of the draft and barely won a roster spot as the 49ers' third quarterback, now finds himself two wins from the Super Bowl.
Defensive back Jimmie Ward blasted Smith when the Seahawks' quarterback was well into his slide, drawing a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty.
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy (13) had a big game in a win over the Seahawks.
