     Chargers lead Jaguars 27-7 at halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw four interceptions, Austin Ekeler scored two touchdowns and the Chargers are blowing the Jaguars out in Jacksonville.
It’s 27-7 at halftime with a trip to the divisional round waiting for the winning side.
Lawrence finished the half 10-of-24 for 77 yards while Justin Herbert is 15-of-24 for 139 yards and a touchdown in his postseason debut.
The Chargers saw left tackle Jemaree Salyer and wide receiver DeAndre Carter leave with injuries.
Barring a major turnaround by the Jaguars, however, the Chargers aren’t going to need him.

     Chargers stretch lead to 24-0 on Gerald Everett touchdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Jaguars’ first home playoff game since 2018 has been a crashing disappointment.
Quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw three interceptions in the first quarter to help the Chargers open up a three-score lead and the deficit kept growing in the third quarter.
Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert hit tight end Gerald Everett for a nine-yard touchdown with just over seven minutes left to play in the first half to stretch Los Angeles’ lead to 24-0 in Jacksonville.
It was Herbert’s first touchdown pass of the game as the Chargers’ first two trips to the end zone came on Austin Ekeler runs.
There’s still a lot of time left on the clock, but it’s going to take one of the biggest comebacks in NFL history for the Jaguars to pull this one out.

     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.
