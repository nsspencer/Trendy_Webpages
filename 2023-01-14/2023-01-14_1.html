     Everyone is already buzzing about Sean Payton maybe going to the Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Sean Payton be the next head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers?
That’s the question seemingly on everyone’s mind as the Jacksonville Jaguars eliminated the Chargers from the playoffs on Saturday night, erasing a 27-point lead and putting L.A. coach Brandon Staley’s job status in jeopardy.
Jacksonville’s game-winning field goal kick hadn’t even finished sailing through the uprights before hundreds of messages erupted on social media congratulating Payton on being hired by the Chargers.
Now, just to be clear, the Chargers have not fired Staley nor have they so much as requested an interview with Payton.
In the meantime, here are some of the immediate reactions and takeaways from Twitter on what this means for the Chargers, the Saints, and Sean Payton:

     Chargers Collapse in Wild Card Round vs. Jaguars, Blow 27-Point Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers' second half flaws against the Jaguars bring their 2022 season to an end.
The Chargers had built a commanding 27-0 lead in the first half, backed by four interceptions off Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence.
Staley explained after the game that he felt the Jaguars offense didn’t do anything differently in the second half.
The Chargers possessed the ball four times in the second half and only picked up one field goal to show for.
As an offense, we need to do more in the second half," Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert said.

The Jaguars now advance to the AFC divisional round after their first playoff win since 2017.
Largest Comebacks in NFL Postseason The Chargers jumped out to a 27-0 lead in the first half Saturday.
In the second half, Herbert -- without Williams and then also DeAndre Carter, who left the game because of an ankle injury -- was unable to develop a consistent rhythm.
Stat that matters: The Chargers held a lead on every offensive play in the second half and lost.

     Summary: “You couldn’t write a crazier script,” said Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who followed four interceptions with four touchdown passes.
The Chargers’ last six drives ended: punt, end of half, punt, field goal, missed field goal, punt.
Late in the first half, Lawrence had a Blutarsky-like passer rating of 0.0, and Chargers cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. had three interceptions.
That set up the clinching 36-yard field goal.
Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. (1) sprints past the Chargers defense on fourth down to set up the deciding score.

The Jaguars held the Chargers to a field goal on the ensuing drive, but it was still 10-0 a few minutes into the game.
They scored near the end of the second quarter and again early in the third quarter to cut the Chargers' lead to 27-14.
For all of the early interceptions, Lawrence had a chance to lead one drive and complete one of the biggest comeback wins in NFL history.

     Inside Chargers' historic playoff meltdown vs. Jaguars: Brandon Staley's suspect decisions, woeful offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday night against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Los Angeles Chargers suffered the third-largest postseason collapse in NFL history.
After taking their 27-0 lead, for example, the Chargers actually had a higher dropback rate (75%) than did the Jaguars (70%).
Staley opted for a 40-yard field goal, which Cameron Dicker pulled wide to the left.
By losing this game, the Chargers became the first team ever to lose a playoff game in which they won the turnover battle by five or more.
Naturally, the Chargers managed to find a way to break that streak, in a way only the Chargers could.
