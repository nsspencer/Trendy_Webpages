     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Sean Payton be the next head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers?
That’s the question seemingly on everyone’s mind as the Jacksonville Jaguars eliminated the Chargers from the playoffs on Saturday night, erasing a 27-point lead and putting L.A. coach Brandon Staley’s job status in jeopardy.
Jacksonville’s game-winning field goal kick hadn’t even finished sailing through the uprights before hundreds of messages erupted on social media congratulating Payton on being hired by the Chargers.
Now, just to be clear, the Chargers have not fired Staley nor have they so much as requested an interview with Payton.
In the meantime, here are some of the immediate reactions and takeaways from Twitter on what this means for the Chargers, the Saints, and Sean Payton:

     Summary: 5 Los Angeles Chargers 31-30 in the AFC wild card game on Saturday, winning on a 36-yard field goal as time expired.
After Chargers kicker Cameron Dicker hit a 50-yard field goal to push the lead to 30-14, Zay Jones caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from Lawrence to make it 30-20.
Facing fourth-and-1 from the Chargers' 41-yard line with 1:27 left, Travis Etienne rushed for 16 yards to put the Jaguars comfortably in field goal range.
@Jaguars pic.twitter.com/KuYTp9xEea — NFL (@NFL) January 15, 2023"I'm kind of speechless, honestly, just to see what belief can do and to see when a team believes in each other, what you can accomplish," Lawrence said.
This after going 10-for-24 with 77 yards in the first half as the Jaguars mustered just 107 yards of total offense.

     Joey Bosa’s Unsportsmanlike Penalty Costs Chargers Dearly in Stunning Loss to Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everything went right for the Chargers in the first half of their wild-card game against the Jaguars on Saturday.
When the penalty was not called, Bosa went to the sideline and slammed his helmet to the ground in frustration, picking up the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
Bosa’s infraction allowed the Jaguars to take advantage of a two-point conversion attempt from the one-yard line.
As a result, Lawrence snuck the ball into the end zone, cutting the Jaguars’ deficit to 30–28.
The season comes to an end for the Chargers and a wave of uncertainty looms around the future of Chargers head coach Brandon Staley following the loss.

The Chargers had built a commanding 27-0 lead in the first half, backed by four interceptions off Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence.
Staley explained after the game that he felt the Jaguars offense didn’t do anything differently in the second half.
The Chargers possessed the ball four times in the second half and only picked up one field goal to show for.
As an offense, we need to do more in the second half," Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert said.

The Chargers’ last six drives ended: punt, end of half, punt, field goal, missed field goal, punt.
Late in the first half, Lawrence had a Blutarsky-like passer rating of 0.0, and Chargers cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. had three interceptions.
That set up the clinching 36-yard field goal.
Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. (1) sprints past the Chargers defense on fourth down to set up the deciding score.
