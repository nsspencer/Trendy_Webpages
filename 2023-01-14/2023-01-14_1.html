     Everyone is already buzzing about Sean Payton maybe going to the Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Sean Payton be the next head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers?
That’s the question seemingly on everyone’s mind as the Jacksonville Jaguars eliminated the Chargers from the playoffs on Saturday night, erasing a 27-point lead and putting L.A. coach Brandon Staley’s job status in jeopardy.
Jacksonville’s game-winning field goal kick hadn’t even finished sailing through the uprights before hundreds of messages erupted on social media congratulating Payton on being hired by the Chargers.
Now, just to be clear, the Chargers have not fired Staley nor have they so much as requested an interview with Payton.
In the meantime, here are some of the immediate reactions and takeaways from Twitter on what this means for the Chargers, the Saints, and Sean Payton:

     Chargers' Mike Williams won't Play Saturday vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.

Payton and Justin Herbert?
The Chargers would take over L.A., and they would never look back, at least not while Payton and Herbert were together.
Will ownership move on from Staley, and will they cough up the cash necessary to bring Payton to town?
If the Chargers won’t, maybe the Broncos will.

I know that Staley had the support of a lot of Chargers fans going into the game.
Without those fans, what will the front office decide to do with Staley on Saturday night and Sunday morning?
LA had 18 first downs (Jacksonville had 24), 320 total yards (Jacksonville: 390), 5.5 yards per pass attempt, and 67 rushing yards (Jacksonville: 117).
Ekeler had 35 yards on 13 carries for 2.7 yards per carry with two catches for eight yards.

     Summary: The Jaguars turn around a 27-point deficit to pull off an astonishing 31-30 win over the Chargers.
The Jaguars (10-8) won their sixth consecutive game and fifth straight at home — all five in come-from-behind fashion.
Lawrence was downright dreadful to begin Jacksonville’s first playoff game since losing in the 2017 AFC title game.
He became the third quarterback in the Super Bowl era to throw four interceptions in the first half of a playoff game, joining Detroit’s Gary Danielson and Denver’s Craig Morton.
“If we’re going to win that game, digging ourselves a hole like that, you’ve got to score a lot of points.
