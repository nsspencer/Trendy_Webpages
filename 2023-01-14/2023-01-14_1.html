     Chargers Collapse in Wild Card Round vs. Jaguars, Blow 27-Point Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers' second half flaws against the Jaguars bring their 2022 season to an end.
The Chargers had built a commanding 27-0 lead in the first half, backed by four interceptions off Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence.
Staley explained after the game that he felt the Jaguars offense didn’t do anything differently in the second half.
The Chargers possessed the ball four times in the second half and only picked up one field goal to show for.
As an offense, we need to do more in the second half," Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers took over deep in Jaguars territory and Austin Ekeler scored on the Chargers' second offensive play, getting in the end zone on a 13-yard run.
On the Jaguars' next drive, they went for it on fourth-and-7 instead of trying a 51-yard field goal.
The Jaguars held the Chargers to a field goal on the ensuing drive, but it was still 10-0 a few minutes into the game.
They scored near the end of the second quarter and again early in the third quarter to cut the Chargers' lead to 27-14.
For all of the early interceptions, Lawrence had a chance to lead one drive and complete one of the biggest comeback wins in NFL history.
