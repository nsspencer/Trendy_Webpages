     Everyone is already buzzing about Sean Payton maybe going to the Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Sean Payton be the next head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers?
That’s the question seemingly on everyone’s mind as the Jacksonville Jaguars eliminated the Chargers from the playoffs on Saturday night, erasing a 27-point lead and putting L.A. coach Brandon Staley’s job status in jeopardy.
Jacksonville’s game-winning field goal kick hadn’t even finished sailing through the uprights before hundreds of messages erupted on social media congratulating Payton on being hired by the Chargers.
Now, just to be clear, the Chargers have not fired Staley nor have they so much as requested an interview with Payton.
In the meantime, here are some of the immediate reactions and takeaways from Twitter on what this means for the Chargers, the Saints, and Sean Payton:

     Chargers' Mike Williams won't Play Saturday vs. Jaguars
    </h2>

     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.

     Summary: The Jaguars turn around a 27-point deficit to pull off an astonishing 31-30 win over the Chargers.
The Jaguars now advance to the AFC divisional round after their first playoff win since 2017.
Largest Comebacks in NFL Postseason The Chargers jumped out to a 27-0 lead in the first half Saturday.
In the second half, Herbert -- without Williams and then also DeAndre Carter, who left the game because of an ankle injury -- was unable to develop a consistent rhythm.
Stat that matters: The Chargers held a lead on every offensive play in the second half and lost.

     Joey Bosa’s Unsportsmanlike Penalty Costs Chargers Dearly in Stunning Loss to Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everything went right for the Chargers in the first half of their wild-card game against the Jaguars on Saturday.
When the penalty was not called, Bosa went to the sideline and slammed his helmet to the ground in frustration, picking up the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
Bosa’s infraction allowed the Jaguars to take advantage of a two-point conversion attempt from the one-yard line.
As a result, Lawrence snuck the ball into the end zone, cutting the Jaguars’ deficit to 30–28.
The season comes to an end for the Chargers and a wave of uncertainty looms around the future of Chargers head coach Brandon Staley following the loss.
