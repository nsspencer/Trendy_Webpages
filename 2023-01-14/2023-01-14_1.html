    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesWeather will be an issue today in Santa Clara, where the 49ers host the Seahawks in the first game of the wild-card round.
Now, based on the forecast available at Weather.com, a new wrinkle has trickled into the mix.
Thunderstorms become a potential factor at 4:00 p.m. local time.
With the game starting at 1:30 p.m. PT, that puts a potential stoppage for lightning on the table in the fourth quarter of the game.
Regardless, the conditions will be anything but pristine for the third game of the year between division rivals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers and Seahawks will square off for the third time this season on Saturday for Super Wild Card Weekend's first showdown.
But their final and most important matchup will have a different dynamic, thanks to inclement weather that could drastically impact field conditions.
Below, you'll find an updated look at the weather, as well as how it may influence the game:Game-day weatherKickoff for Saturday's 49ers-Seahawks game is 4:30 p.m.
Excessive runoff may result in rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas flooding, per The Weather Channel, with extensive street flooding also possible.
Running the ball tends to be the go-to formula for rain-soaked contests, and fortunately, both the 49ers and Seahawks like to establish the ground game anyway.

     Summary: For professional basketball players — both in the NBA and across the world — the name immediately conjures 100-degree days and double workouts in Sacramento.
He’s beloved among pro ballers, not just for his elite training skills but for creating a true support network.
I first met Guss on a hot Sacramento spring day more than 15 years ago, when I walked into “Basketball Town,” Armstead’s longtime headquarters.
There were three full-size courts populated by NBA players like Matt Barnes, Bobby Jackson, Andre Miller and Brad Miller.
I wasn’t just experiencing the world of offseason basketball training for the first time; I was experiencing a community that had been building for decades.
