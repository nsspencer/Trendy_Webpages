     Jones to face Gane for heavyweight title as Ngannou exits UFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 15 (Reuters) - Jon Jones will face France's Cyril Gane for the UFC heavyweight title at the T-Mobile Arena on March 8 after champion Francis Ngannou vacated the belt to enter free agency, UFC president Dana White told a news conference.
Speaking after an event at the UFC's Apex venue, White said on Saturday that despite two years of negotiations with the 36-year-old Ngannou an agreement could not be reached and that the heavyweight was leaving the company.
"We offered Francis a deal that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight in the history of the company, more than (former champion Brock) Lesnar, more than anybody, and he turned the deal down," White said.
His replacement as champion will be crowned when American Jones, a former light heavyweight champion who has previously been banned for doping, meets Gane, who held the interim heavyweight championship until he was beaten by Ngannou for the undisputed title in January 2022.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement came after the UFC was unable to come to terms with its now former heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou.
It will mark Jones' first appearance in the Octagon since February 2020, when he defended his light heavyweight title against Dominick Reyes.
He became the youngest UFC champion of all time in 2011 at age 23.
In addition to booking the heavyweight title fight, Jones signed a new eight-fight deal with the UFC, according to White.
In his most recent appearance, he knocked out Tai Tuivasa in the main event of a UFC Fight Night in September.

     Summary: Jon Jones, who hasn't fought since February 2020, will face former UFC interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane on March 4 in Las Vegas.
White said after the UFC Vegas 67 card the UFC had offered Ngannou a contract that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight in UFC history, but that Ngannou had turned it down.
Ngannou last fought when he scored a decision over Gane on Jan. 22, 2022, in Anaheim, California, at the Honda Center for the undisputed heavyweight title.
Jones, who first won the light heavyweight title in 2011, has spoken of his desire to win a heavyweight title as long ago as 2013.
Story continues"Absolutely, I'd love to have Henry coaching me for this Ciryl Gane fight," Jones said.

     Summary: Another year of UFC action is upon us, as fans anticipate Conor McGregor’s long-awaited return to the Octagon as well as some major title fights.
Furthermore, former pound-for-pound No 1 Kamaru Usman is expected to try to regain the welterweight title from Leon Edwards, who dethroned the Nigerian-American with a stunning knockout in August 2022.
The pair’s rematch – their third clash, in fact – may even headline March’s London card, after Edwards’ title triumph made him just the second British UFC champion ever.
Will we finally see light-heavyweight ‘GOAT’ Jon Jones move up to heavyweight?
And if so, will injured champion Francis Ngannou return in time to face him?
