     Christian McCaffreyâ€™s Big Run Sets Up Brock Purdyâ€™s First Playoff Touchdown Pass

     Summary: Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel have combined for 97 rushing yards for three carries (which is 33.2 yards per carry!)
McCaffreyâ€™s first carry of the game was a 66-yard scamper â€” the second-longest run of his career â€” that set the 49ers up at the Seattle 17.

If San Francisco continues to run the ball like they have, itâ€™s going to be a long afternoon for Seattle.

     49ers' Christian McCaffrey: Breaks century mark in win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McCaffrey rushed 15 times for 119 yards and caught both of his targets for 17 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 41-23 playoff win over Seattle.
McCaffrey got San Francisco's offense kickstarted when he broke his first carry of the game for 68 yards, eventually leading to a short receiving touchdown for the dual-threat back.
The 26-year-old remained heavily involved on offense even with the 49ers getting back to full strength at the playmaker positions for the start of the playoffs.
McCaffrey figures to remain a key cog on offense heading into the divisional round, so expect a minimum of 15-20 productive touches and a high DFS price tag next week.
