     Report: Alabama Football Hires Noteworthy Defensive Assistant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Alabama Crimson Tide needs a defensive coordinator after Friday's surprising news that Pete Golding has left Nick Saban's staff for the same position with Ole Miss.
Well, Saturday, Saban hired a defensive coordinator — although it doesn't look like he'll hold that title for Alabama.
According to Brandon Marcello of 247Sports, Alabama has hired Southern Miss defensive coordinator Austin Armstrong.
"Souther Miss defensive coordinator Austin Armstrong has been hired at Alabama, where he is expected to coach linebackers, a source tells @247Sports," Marcello tweeted.
Not only does Alabama still have a vacancy for its defensive coordinator, the Crimson Tide need someone to coach in the secondary, as well, after safeties coach Charles Kelly left to become the defensive coordinator for Deion Sanders at Colorado.

     Summary: Former Alabama football defensive coordinator Pete Golding has been with the Crimson Tide as the program’s defensive coordinator since 2018.
He fielded some quality defenses, but he never seemingly won over the fans.
After four seasons under Nick Saban, Golding is making a move.
he is staying in the SEC West and will retain the defensive coordinator position, just moving one state over to Mississippi to work under Lane Kiffin at Ole Miss.
The reason for the move is not clear, though some believe it was a mutual parting of ways.
