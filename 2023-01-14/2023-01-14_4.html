He became the youngest UFC champion of all time in 2011 at age 23.

In his most recent appearance, he knocked out Tai Tuivasa in the main event of a UFC Fight Night in September.

     MMA: Jon Jones to fight for UFC heavyweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Albuquerque resident and longtime former UFC light heavyweight champion Jon “Bones” Jones will face France’s Cyril Gane for that organization’s heavyweight title on March 24.
Later, he renounced the light heavyweight belt and declared his intention to campaign as a heavyweight.
The heavyweight title was vacated when champion Frances N’Gannou, long at odds with White, was released by the UFC.
Since defeating Reyes in Houston, Jones was banned from training at Albuquerque’s Jackson-Wink MMA by J-W co-owner Mike Winkeljohn after Jones’ September 2021 arrest in Las Vegas on domestic-violence charges.
Albuquerque MMA featherweight Dan Argueta (9-1) defeated Nick Aguirre (7-1) by unanimous decision on a UFC Fight Night card at UFC Apex.

     Summary: Jon Jones, who hasn't fought since February 2020, will face former UFC interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane on March 4 in Las Vegas.

Ngannou last fought when he scored a decision over Gane on Jan. 22, 2022, in Anaheim, California, at the Honda Center for the undisputed heavyweight title.
Jones, who first won the light heavyweight title in 2011, has spoken of his desire to win a heavyweight title as long ago as 2013.
