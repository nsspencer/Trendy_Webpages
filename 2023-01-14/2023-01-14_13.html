     Dana White: Francis Ngannou Will Be Released by UFC After Rejecting Contract Offer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesUFC President Dana White announced on Saturday that the promotion has released heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou after the two sides could not reach a contract agreement.
White had more comments on Ngannou, including thoughts on negotiations regarding the heavyweight fight that never happened between the now ex-champ and Jones.
Eric Nicksick, Ngannou's head coach, ballparked the probability of a Jones-Ngannou fight happening then.
A Jones-Ngannou fight won't be happening now, but numerous MMA analysts sided with Ngannou upon his departure.
Ngannou won by unanimous decision over Gane in Jan. 2022 at UFC 270.

     Jon Jones vs. Ciryl Gane Bout Set as UFC Releases Francis Ngannou
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the reigning champion departing, the organization has now booked former UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones and former interim heavyweight titleholder Ciryl Gane for the main event of UFC 285 with the UFC heavyweight title on the line.
"Jon Jones has been willing and ready and able to fight anybody.
Gane (11-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC) claimed the UFC's interim heavyweight title with an August 2021 win over Derrick Lewis, though he would suffer a decision loss to Ngannou five months later in a unification bout.
Gane, 32, has since rebounded with a September 2022 win in his native France over Tai Tuivasa and will now challenge for the undisputed heavyweight title.
Meanwhile, Jones (26-1 MMA, 20-1 UFC) is one of the most decorated champions in UFC history with 11 successful title defenses of the promotion's light heavyweight title across two title reigns.
