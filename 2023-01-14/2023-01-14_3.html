     Misfits Boxing 4 LIVE results and highlights from KSI vs Faze Temperrr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: YouTube boxer KSI returned to the ring with a devastating KO of FaZe Temperrr to inch closer to a showdown with Jake Paul.
'The Nightmare' is looking to be more active in the ring this year having taken three years away from the sport following his win against Logan Paul in 2019.
KSI won two fights in one night last August and was originally scheduled to fight Bellator MMA star Dillon Danis last night, but the American pulled out of the fight on just 10 days' notice.
Temperrr, whose real name is Thomas Oliveira, was already booked on the Misfits Boxing card as he was scheduled to face a 'mystery opponent', but got the call-up to face KSI when Danis withdrew.
Here is how the night unfolded...
