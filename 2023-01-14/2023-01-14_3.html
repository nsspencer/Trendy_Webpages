Jones confirmed to MMA content creator Michael Wonsover that he will be fighting Ciryl Gane at UFC 285 on March 4 for the vacant UFC heavyweight championship:The fight was officially announced Saturday night:Rumors of a title fight between Jones and Gane began to swirl when a photo of the matchup was advertised on T-Mobile Arena.

     UFC releases Francis Ngannou; Jon Jones to fight Ciryl Gane for vacant heavyweight title at UFC 285
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Jones, who hasn't fought since February 2020, will face former UFC interim heavyweight champion Ciryl Gane on March 4 in Las Vegas.
White said after the UFC Vegas 67 card the UFC had offered Ngannou a contract that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight in UFC history, but that Ngannou had turned it down.
Ngannou last fought when he scored a decision over Gane on Jan. 22, 2022, in Anaheim, California, at the Honda Center for the undisputed heavyweight title.
Jones, who first won the light heavyweight title in 2011, has spoken of his desire to win a heavyweight title as long ago as 2013.
Story continues"Absolutely, I'd love to have Henry coaching me for this Ciryl Gane fight," Jones said.
