     LeBron James Praises San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Brock Purdy, Who Broke A Dan Marino Playoff Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his postseason debut, Purdy threw for 332 yards and became the first rookie quarterback to account for four total touchdowns in a playoff game.
The rookie quarterback also passed Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino as the youngest to throw for 300 yards and three touchdowns in a playoff game.
James, who played for the Miami Heat from 2010-14 and won two championships, was the exact opposite when he became a professional.
During weeks 14-18, he led the league in passing touchdowns, yards per attempt and passer rating.

     Brock Purdy leads San Francisco 49ers to win over Seattle Seahawks in NFL Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy continued his fine form to lead the San Francisco 49ers past the plucky Seattle Seahawks in the first game of Wild Card weekend, the first round of the NFL playoffsThe San Francisco 49ers rallied behind rookie quarterback Brock Purdy once again as they secured a 41-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs.
Purdy threw for 332 yards and three touchdowns to lead the 49ers past their NFC West rivals.
In the third quarter, Purdy scored on a quarterback sneak to reclaim the lead before Seattle quarterback Geno Smith began to lead his team downfield, threatening to score on the vaunted San Francisco defence.
Late in the third, San Francisco star defensive end Bosa - who led the NFL with 18.5 sacks this season - jumped on a loose ball after Charles Omenihu stripped the ball from Smith’s clutches.
The incredible play on third down brought a promising Seahawks drive to an end with the 49ers retaining their 23-17 lead.
