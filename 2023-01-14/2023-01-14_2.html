     Terrible decision could haunt Chargers against Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers will be without a key playmaker in Saturday’s AFC Wild Card game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, thanks to a terrible decision.
5 seed, having already clinched a better AFC record and thus the tiebreaker over the Ravens for the top Wild Card spot.
Heading into the Broncos game, the Chargers knew that their AFC Wild Card opponent would be the Jacksonville Jaguars.
4 seed and a home Wild Card playoff game.
The Jaguars and Chargers met back in Week 3 at SoFi Stadium, with the Jaguars earning a dominant 38-10 road victory.

     Chargers' Mike Williams won't Play Saturday vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Williams won’t play Saturday for the Los Angeles Chargers, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN.com reports.
Chargers WR Mike Williams suffered a small non-surgical fracture in his back that was not found in initial X-ray and MRI.
After Williams did not progress this week, further tests were ran that revealed the fracture, sources told ESPN.
— Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) January 13, 2023Williams suffered a fracture in his back during the meaningless game versus the Denver Broncos in Week 18.
This means the Chargers would have to advance to at least the AFC Championship game to get Williams back in the lineup.
