     Sean McVay Makes Decision on His Future With Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay has informed the team of his plans to return for the 2023 season, the Rams announced on their official Twitter account Friday (January 13).
The confirmation comes after McVay said he planned to take the "appropriate time" to make a decision on his future during his end-of-season press conference earlier this week, noting that he had to figure out "the best way to continue to move forward in the right way to be the best coach that you can possibly be" at the time via ESPN.
The Rams are coming off a 5-12 record in 2022 -- the worst season during McVay's tenure -- just months removed after defeating the Cincinnati Bengals, 23-20, in Super Bowl LVI last February.

     Rams to make key Matthew Stafford $62 million move after Sean McVay return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have made an important contract move with Super Bowl-winning quarterback Matthew Stafford after head coach Sean McVay opted to return for the 2023 season.
The Rams are expected to pick up Stafford’s 2023 option bonus and his 2024 salary, contract numbers that will pay the star quarterback a combined $62 million in guaranteed money, sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Had the Rams opted not to pick up this bonus option, Stafford would have eventually been a post-cap casualty, counting $13.5 million against their 2023 cap and another $36 million in 2024, as Schefter notes.
Yet Stafford had said multiple times that he would be returning in 2023- and that his Rams future would not be directly tied to McVay’s.
It appears the Rams are on the same wavelength, as they are committing to Stafford through his contract for at least the 2023 campaign.

     Sean McVay decides to keep coaching, stays with LA Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The youngest head coach in NFL history to win the Super Bowl has decided not to take a break from coaching after his Rams finished 5-12 in the worst season ever by a defending champion.
ADVERTISINGMcVay, who turns 37 later this month, became the youngest head coach in modern NFL history six years ago Thursday.
McVay is sticking with the Rams at their lowest point in his tenure after a year of what he described as heavy mental fatigue and stress.
McVay openly acknowledged a near-constant feeling of burnout near the end of the past few seasons, even while his coaching fortunes soared.
McVay’s success riveted the rest of the NFL, particularly after he led the Rams to a Super Bowl loss against New England in just his second season in charge.

     Letters to Sports: Sean McVay will return, but should he?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In my opinion, Sean McVay, who has decided to return as coach of the Rams, rather than being touted as such an elite coach, should be seen as closer to the bottom of the coaching pile.
A bunch of aging vets, no picks from now until forever, and a coach who doesn’t seem to have a clue how to sign and develop young players.
Let McVay go on his merry way, leaving the Rams in ruins.
Jack WishardLos Angeles::A lot of people thought that at age 30, McVay was too young to be a head coach in the NFL.
Golf fans are basically being ignored.

McVay is not going to become a cultural icon on TV like Madden,” Russo said on SXM.
