     San Francisco 49ers Triumph Over Seattle Seahawks in Saturday Playoff Game and Advance to Next Round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco beat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23 Saturday afternoon in an exciting win at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, advancing to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs.
Twenty-three-year-old rookie quarterback Brock Purdy, in his first career playoff start, took the team one step closer to a Super Bowl ring by winning the NFC Wild Card game.
If the Giants upset and win, San Francisco will play the winner of the Tampa Bay Buccanneers (8-9) and Dallas Cowboys (12-5) on Monday night.
Overall, Purdy’s strong game took the Niners ahead as he completed 18 out of 30 passes, for 332 yards, including for three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and a fun two-point conversion.

     LeBron James Praises San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Brock Purdy, Who Broke A Dan Marino Playoff Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his postseason debut, Purdy threw for 332 yards and became the first rookie quarterback to account for four total touchdowns in a playoff game.
The rookie quarterback also passed Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino as the youngest to throw for 300 yards and three touchdowns in a playoff game.
James, who played for the Miami Heat from 2010-14 and won two championships, was the exact opposite when he became a professional.
During weeks 14-18, he led the league in passing touchdowns, yards per attempt and passer rating.
