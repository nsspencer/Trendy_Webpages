     San Francisco 49ers Triumph Over Seattle Seahawks in Saturday Playoff Game and Advance to Next Round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco beat the Seattle Seahawks 41-23 Saturday afternoon in an exciting win at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, advancing to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs.
Twenty-three-year-old rookie quarterback Brock Purdy, in his first career playoff start, took the team one step closer to a Super Bowl ring by winning the NFC Wild Card game.
If the Giants upset and win, San Francisco will play the winner of the Tampa Bay Buccanneers (8-9) and Dallas Cowboys (12-5) on Monday night.
Overall, Purdy’s strong game took the Niners ahead as he completed 18 out of 30 passes, for 332 yards, including for three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and a fun two-point conversion.

    </h2>

     Summary: In his postseason debut, Purdy threw for 332 yards and became the first rookie quarterback to account for four total touchdowns in a playoff game.
The rookie quarterback also passed Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino as the youngest to throw for 300 yards and three touchdowns in a playoff game.
James, who played for the Miami Heat from 2010-14 and won two championships, was the exact opposite when he became a professional.
During weeks 14-18, he led the league in passing touchdowns, yards per attempt and passer rating.

     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy continued his fine form to lead the San Francisco 49ers past the plucky Seattle Seahawks in the first game of Wild Card weekend, the first round of the NFL playoffsThe San Francisco 49ers rallied behind rookie quarterback Brock Purdy once again as they secured a 41-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs.
Purdy threw for 332 yards and three touchdowns to lead the 49ers past their NFC West rivals.
In the third quarter, Purdy scored on a quarterback sneak to reclaim the lead before Seattle quarterback Geno Smith began to lead his team downfield, threatening to score on the vaunted San Francisco defence.
Late in the third, San Francisco star defensive end Bosa - who led the NFL with 18.5 sacks this season - jumped on a loose ball after Charles Omenihu stripped the ball from Smith’s clutches.
The incredible play on third down brought a promising Seahawks drive to an end with the 49ers retaining their 23-17 lead.
