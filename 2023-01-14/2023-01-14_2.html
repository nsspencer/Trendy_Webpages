    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesWeather will be an issue today in Santa Clara, where the 49ers host the Seahawks in the first game of the wild-card round.
Now, based on the forecast available at Weather.com, a new wrinkle has trickled into the mix.
Thunderstorms become a potential factor at 4:00 p.m. local time.
With the game starting at 1:30 p.m. PT, that puts a potential stoppage for lightning on the table in the fourth quarter of the game.
Regardless, the conditions will be anything but pristine for the third game of the year between division rivals.

     Report: Multiple Coaches, Execs Unhappy With Seahawks-Rams Officiating; Want Changes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesMany across the NFL were reportedly unhappy with the officiating in last weekend's game between the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams, which resulted in Seattle earning a playoff berth.
According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, multiple NFL executives and coaches felt calls favored Seattle in the game and ultimately cost Detroit a chance to make the playoffs.
Regarding Seattle's victory knocking Detroit out of playoff contention, another source told Schefter: "The Lions should be livid.
After the Rams seemingly forced a three-and-out, defensive end Jonah Williams was called for running into Seahawks punter Michael Dickson.
7 seed in the NFC, and it will kick off the 2022-23 NFL playoff slate Saturday when it faces the second-seeded San Francisco 49ers on the road at 4:30 p.m.

     Summary: The first playoff game of the weekend features two teams that Arizona Cardinals fans know well.
The Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers play in the Saturday afternoon game.
However, despite being two very familiar teams, there aren’t really any Cardinals connections.
In fact, between the two rosters, only one former Cardinals player can be found.
The 49ers do not have any former Cardinals and the only one on the Seahawks’ roster is receiver Laquon Treadwell, who was on the Cardinals’ practice squad briefly this year.

     Summary: January 14, 2023 at 12:58 PM ESTIs it harder to beat an opponent three times in a season?
After dispatching the Rams twice during the 2021 regular season, the 49ers found their opponent feistier and more determined to stop the run when they met in the NFC Championship Game.
San Francisco averaged 146 rushing yards in the two regular-season games.
It mustered just 50 rushing yards in the playoffs with Eric Weddle, the safety the Rams successfully snuck into the box, finishing with a team-high nine tackles.
The 49ers on Tuesday acknowledged Seattle could throw a wrinkle into their game plan the way the Rams did last January.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams had nothing to play for in Week 18 when they visited the Seattle Seahawks, but their rivals did.
The Seahawks edged out the Rams in overtime and made the playoffs thanks to a Lions win, but it wasn’t without controversy.
Rams and Lions fans were frustrated by the officiating, and it turns out they weren’t alone.
Jonah Williams was called for running into the kicker, giving the Seahawks a free first down in the fourth quarter, which led to a game-tying field goal.
Jalen Ramsey was also called for unnecessary roughness when Geno Smith ran into him along the sideline after a long run in the fourth quarter, despite Ramsey simply standing his ground.

     Summary: NFL officiating under scrutiny after Seahawks-Rams controversyAfter multiple controversial officiating decisions in Sunday's playoff-shaping game between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks, multiple executives and coaches said the NFL needs to reevaluate how it chooses and trains its officiating staff for future seasons.
Multiple sources told ESPN that the Rams were upset by the officiating, the Lions were bothered by it and the competition committee was frustrated by it.
Officiating is an imperfect science, but the source said to ESPN that there should be ways to mitigate those types of mistakes.
A league official told ESPN that the official who threw the flag did not have an angle that allowed him to see Williams being blocked into Dickson.
The league official told ESPN that the decision to not flag Diggs for taunting was a judgment call.

     Summary: Next up is a trilogy with the San Francisco 49ers (13-4), winners of the NFC West and winners on both occasions over the Seahawks in the regular season.
Neither game was ever a problem for the 49ers, who held leads in every quarter and never relinquished them.
This will be third-string quarterback and rookie sensation Brock Purdy’s playoff debut (obviously), as he looks to become the first rookie QB to win a playoff game since Russell Wilson in the 2012 season vs. Washington.
If the Seahawks win, they face the Philadelphia Eagles next weekend.
If the 49ers win, they will get another home playoff game in the Divisional Round.
