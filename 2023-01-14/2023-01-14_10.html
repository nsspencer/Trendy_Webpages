     March double helps Brighton to 3-0 win over sorry Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRIGHTON, England, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Brighton &amp; Hove Albion winger Solly March netted twice early in the second half and set up another goal in a 3-0 home win over a sluggish Liverpool on Saturday that lifts them above the Reds to seventh in the Premier League standings.
The victory was Brighton's first over Liverpool in the top flight and they deserved to take all three points once March helped them convert their dominance in possession into goals.
Undeterred, March gave his side the lead in the 47th minute as teenaged striker Evan Ferguson pressured the Liverpool defence into a mistake and Brighton won the ball high up the pitch.
The win means Brighton have 30 points from 18 games, two ahead of Liverpool who have struggled with form and injuries, with Reds boss Juergen Klopp blaming a lack of organisation for the result.
