     Summary: ✖Bianca Belair finally got her revenge on Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 38, defeating "Big Time Becks" for the Raw Women's Championship in an excellent match.
Lynch then turned heel, nailed Belair with a cheap shot and pinned Belair to win the title in less than 30 seconds.
Prior to WrestleMania, Lynch also addressed Charlotte Flair vs. Ronda Rousey getting placed higher on the card.
It was originally listed as the show's main event, though the KO Show segment with Steve Austin will reportedly close Saturday's show.
"If we're the main event, sure," she later added when asked if she felt her match with Belair deserved that spot.

     Why are Becky Lynch and Bianca Belair fighting at Wrestlemania 38?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Night 1 of Wrestlemania 38 will bring us a title clash of two of the best female performers the company has to offer as Raw Women’s Champion Becky Lynch will defend her title against Bianca Belair.
This feud began at SummerSlam last August when then-Smackdown Women’s Champion Bianca Belair suddenly found herself without an opponent after it was announced that Sasha Banks wasn’t performing.
What resulted was a shocker as Lynch caught Belair off guard and defeated her in 26 second to win the belt.
Both Lynch and Belair would be drafted to Raw the following month, making the Raw Women’s Championship the priority.
At the Elimination Chamber PPV in February, Belair won the women’s chamber match, earning herself this long anticipated title opportunity at Wrestlemania.
