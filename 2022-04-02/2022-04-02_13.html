     Why are Becky Lynch and Bianca Belair fighting at Wrestlemania 38?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Night 1 of Wrestlemania 38 will bring us a title clash of two of the best female performers the company has to offer as Raw Women’s Champion Becky Lynch will defend her title against Bianca Belair.
This feud began at SummerSlam last August when then-Smackdown Women’s Champion Bianca Belair suddenly found herself without an opponent after it was announced that Sasha Banks wasn’t performing.
What resulted was a shocker as Lynch caught Belair off guard and defeated her in 26 second to win the belt.
Both Lynch and Belair would be drafted to Raw the following month, making the Raw Women’s Championship the priority.
At the Elimination Chamber PPV in February, Belair won the women’s chamber match, earning herself this long anticipated title opportunity at Wrestlemania.
