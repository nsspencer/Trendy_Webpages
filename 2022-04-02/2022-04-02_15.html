    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I'll admit - there may be some recency bias in that headline - but as of this very moment I truly believe The Undertaker gave the greatest WWE Hall of Fame speech of all time last night.
He coulda went on for another hour and I'd still be on the edge of my seat!
There's very few who have EVER been more deserving of that ovation in the WWE, if any.
Like Vince noted, WCW never even thought to call Taker back in the day because they knew he'd never pick up.
If you've got Peacock for The Office or Parks and Rec or something, pop on over to the WWE tab and give this speech a watch/listen.
