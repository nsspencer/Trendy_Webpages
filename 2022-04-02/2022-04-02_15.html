     Saturday morning session: Summaries from Latter-day Saint general conference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Henry B. Eyring, second counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opened by explaining that God's prophets have seen our time and warned that forces of wickedness will continue to increase.
"And so it will become more difficult, not easier, to honor the covenants we must make and keep to live the gospel of Jesus Christ," he said.
"It will become more difficult, not easier, to honor the covenants we must make and keep to live the gospel of Jesus Christ."
But, he explained, if we change our natures and become as a little child and build on the foundation of Christ, we can stand firm.
He said being like a little child means being loving and obedient, leaning on God for guidance, help and support.

     Mormons stress unity amid polarization at General Conference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nearly 17 million-member faith, which is widely known as the Mormon church, hosted about 10,000 people at its 21,000-seat conference center in Utah.
Though its signature conference regularly reached full capacity pre-pandemic, for two years, it’s been held mostly remotely, with the majority of viewers watching livestreams from afar.
He and other leaders mostly eschewed political issues, focused their remarks on spiritual matters and stressed unity and faith amid worldwide struggles.
Andersen encouraged tolerance and acceptance, highlighting the church’s support for non-discrimination legislation in Arizona designed to protect LGBTQ individuals.
Unlike prior conferences, he and other church leaders did not explicitly address the nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

     Summary: The Saturday morning session of the General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The format of General Conference feels like a relic from a bygone era, and I too wonder “why .
At first, the program required that the adult curriculum devote one Sunday each month to using a recent General Conference talk as the basis for the lesson.
As the Church’s schedule changed, that grew to two Sundays a month, so that conference talks now form the entire curriculum used for priesthood and Relief Society.
General Conference has seen some short-lived efforts in recent years to improve the experience, like allowing international leaders to give talks in their native languages or presenting part of Conference from a location other than Salt Lake City.

     Summary: Women have told Aburto they were concerned they were not active in Relief Society because they were serving in Primary or Young Women, she said they were still active in Relief Society.
“Relief Society is not limited to a room in a building, a Sunday lesson, an activity, or a presidency at the local or general level.
Developing faith in Christ is like a ladder, according to Elder Larry S. Kacher, General Authority Seventy.
“The simple faith we have in Jesus Christ as we first begin to learn about Him can remain in our hearts as we confront life’s challenges.
“When the storms in life come, you can be steady because you are standing on the rock of your faith in Jesus Christ,” Eyring concluded.

     Summary: ‘The profound doctrine taught in the “Young Women Theme” is important for young women, but it is applicable to all, including those of us who are not young women,” Elder Renlund said.
“The key to lasting happiness is living the gospel of Jesus Christ and keeping our covenants,” she said.
Sister Rebecca L. Craven, second counselor in the Young Women General Presidency, told about a friend who felt prompted to visit a sister she hardly knew.
Being a disciple of Jesus Christ involves more than just hoping or believing, it means giving effort and commitment to taking action.
“The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of action and a gospel of joy,” she said.
