     Summary: Ukrainian troops have reclaimed control of Pripyat, the ghost town near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Sunday.
"Today, April 3, units of paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took control of the area of the city of Pripyat and the area along the State Border of Ukraine with the Republic of Belarus," it said on a Facebook post.
Some background: Pripyat was evacuated in 1986 following the explosion and fire at Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear disaster.
In late February, during the first week of the war, Chernobyl plant and its surrounding territory fell into the hands of Russian troops.
But on Thursday, Russian troops announced their intention to leave and hand over control to Ukrainian personnel, according to the state enterprise overseeing Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

     Summary: Ukrainian troops have retaken the entire Kyiv region, but they have discovered widespread evidence of what the Kyiv government says are war crimes committed by Russian forces.
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and a number of other authorities have accused Russian troops of leaving behind mines and other explosives in their retreat of the Kyiv region.
Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russian troops want to capture the Donbas and the south of Ukraine.
Ukraine’s peace negotiator reportedly said that Russia ‘“verbally” accepts the Ukrainian position on peace talks, AFP reported, except for the issue of Crimea.
The UK said authorities were working to collect evidence of Russian war crimes.

     Summary: The conflict cast a pall over Ramadan, when large gatherings over meals and family celebrations are a tradition.
Muslims follow a lunar calendar and a moon-sighting methodology can lead to different countries declaring the start of Ramadan a day or two apart.
With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however, millions of people in the Middle East are now wondering where their next meals will come from.
Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, has received most of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine in recent years.
Merchants said Russia's war on Ukraine has sent prices skyrocketing, alongside the usual challenges, putting a damper on the festive atmosphere that Ramadan usually creates.
