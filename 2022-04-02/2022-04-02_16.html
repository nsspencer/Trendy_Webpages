Dmitry Rogozin, director of Russian space agency Roscosmos, said he considers the current state of affairs unacceptable.

     Summary: Ukrainian troops have retaken the entire Kyiv region, but they have discovered widespread evidence of what the Kyiv government says are war crimes committed by Russian forces.
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and a number of other authorities have accused Russian troops of leaving behind mines and other explosives in their retreat of the Kyiv region.
Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russian troops want to capture the Donbas and the south of Ukraine.
Ukraine’s peace negotiator reportedly said that Russia ‘“verbally” accepts the Ukrainian position on peace talks, AFP reported, except for the issue of Crimea.
The UK said authorities were working to collect evidence of Russian war crimes.

     Summary: The Russian withdrawal comes as Moscow attempts to shift its focus to eastern Ukraine and away from the areas around Kyiv, where Russian forces have faced fierce Ukrainian resistance.
Ukraine's deputy defense minister said Saturday that the Kyiv region had been "liberated" from Russian forces.
The Mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, told Reuters Saturday the civilians had been executed by retreating Russian forces.
Tank transfer: The US is expected to help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era tanks "within days" to Ukraine, according to a source familiar with the plan.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak earlier on Saturday called on the US and its allies to deliver heavier weaponry to Ukraine.

     Summary: The conflict cast a pall over Ramadan, when large gatherings over meals and family celebrations are a tradition.
Muslims follow a lunar calendar and a moon-sighting methodology can lead to different countries declaring the start of Ramadan a day or two apart.
With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however, millions of people in the Middle East are now wondering where their next meals will come from.
Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, has received most of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine in recent years.
Merchants said Russia's war on Ukraine has sent prices skyrocketing, alongside the usual challenges, putting a damper on the festive atmosphere that Ramadan usually creates.
