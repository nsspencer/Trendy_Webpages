    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖Logan Paul will be wearing one of the rarest Pokemon cards in existence when he wrestles at Wrestlemania tonight.
The Pikachu Illustrator card is a vintage promotional card given out to winners of an early Pokemon card contest.
We will note that Paul has an...interesting history with the Pikachu Illustrator card.
He purchased a Pikachu Illustrator card in October for $200,000, but then discovered it was a counterfeit card.
While recording the video about the fake card, Paul punched a window (he claims as a joke) and ended up going to the hospital for nine stitches.

     Logan Paul Crushes WrestleMania, Wins Tag Team Match With The Miz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Logan Paul looked like a total natural in the squared-circle at WrestleMania 38 just now ... dominating his tag team match with The Miz -- and coming away with the win.
Logan and Miz were in control throughout the match against Rey Mysterio and his son, Dominik at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington ... and the whole thing was filled with action.
Logan, however, flipped the script -- not only did he hit Mysterio with a "Three Amigos" of his own, he then hit Rey with a "Frog Splash" ... which was also one of Guerrero's moves.
Logan -- who came out wearing a $1 million super-rare Pokémon card around his neck -- and Miz rocked matching yellow and black 'fits for the match ... and they looked damn good.
But, in true Heel form, Miz hit Logan with his finisher move -- the Skull-Crushing finale -- after being declared winners ... much to the delight of the crowd, who booed Paul throughout the match.
