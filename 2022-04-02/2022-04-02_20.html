Jokic finished with 38 points and 19 rebounds, Towns had 32 points and nine boards.
Minnesota got the win 136-130, and with the win moved within two games of the Nuggets for the No.

     Summary: The Denver Nuggets come up short against the Minnesota Timberwolves 136-130.
Despite Monte Morris scoring 23 points and shooting 4-5 from three in the 4th quarter, the T-Wolves just proved to be too much.
Don't jump with JMyke pic.twitter.com/6hYo05oUNR — Denver Nuggets (@nuggets) April 2, 2022The Nuggets struggled from 3 in the first quarter and the Wolves did not, Denver shot 2-8 while Minnesota shot 6-11.
The Nuggets close the Wolves lead down from 11 to 2 on the back of Nikola Jokic’s perfect 8-8 shooting.
The Nuggets could not stop the Wolves down the stretch, mix that with struggling to score too and you have a 15 point T-Wolves lead.

     Summary: Towns scored 32 points and the Timberwolves overcame Nikola Jokic's 38-point, 19-rebound performance in a 136-130 win over the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.
"I think we've shown multiple times we're a playoff team and I think we also shown that we're not a joke," Towns said.
But what did in the Nuggets were the 36 free throws they allowed and the 30 points they gave up off 18 turnovers.
Before tip-off, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was blunt about how his team has been pulling out games in which they played poorly.
Nuggets: F JaMychal Green returned to action after missing two games with a wrist injury.

     Denver Nuggets: Best first-round matchups in 2022 NBA Playoffs, ranked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For a team that has reached the Western Conference Finals and Semifinals over the past two seasons, it seems unusual for the Denver Nuggets to cling to a top-six berth this season.
Most favorable Nuggets opponents in the first round, rankedGolden State Warriors (3rd)Despite the injuries ravaging the continuity and chemistry of the Golden State Warriors, they still have the foundation and culture they rely on at the biggest stage.
Conversely, there are just five guys with massive playoff experience for Golden State, so Denver could pounce on that weakness.
Dallas Mavericks (2nd)Similar to Golden State, the Dallas Mavericks have a depleted big man rotation with the recent departure of Kristaps Porzingis.
The glaring difference between Dallas and Golden State is the repetitions and games played together in this current iteration of their respective lineups.

     The Denver Nuggets have become their own worst enemy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Karl Anthony-Towns is an All-Star, All-NBA type players,” Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said pregame.
At one point, it was a downpour 3-pointers and at others, Denver was dealing with an avalanche of paint points from the Timberwolves.
Denver had the win in their grasp so long as they could get some defensive urgency into the game.
Denver finished with 18 turnovers which led to an atrocious 30 points for the Timberwolves that the Nuggets just gave away, but the issues did not end there.
Denver still has a two-game lead after the loss on Friday night, but they do not own the tiebreaker over Minnesota which means Denver essentially only has a one-game lead.
