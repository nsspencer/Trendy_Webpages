     How Two Best Friends Beat Amazon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: claiming that Amazon violated workers’ rights to organize.
Amazon has denied their allegations, but the labor board found many to be credible and pursued them in administrative court.
“What you do is you create a community that Amazon never really had for workers,” said Seth Goldstein, a lawyer who represented the organizers free of charge.
One day this February, Mr. Smalls was bringing lunch to the break room when Amazon called the police, saying he had trespassed.
“The humanity at Amazon is gone,” she said in an interview.

     Summary: A demonstrator during the vote count to unionize Amazon workers outside the National Labor Relations Board offices in New York, U.S., on Friday, April 1, 2022.
The fulfillment center doesn't flip to becoming a union shop overnight, and there's potentially a long road ahead.
Here's what happens next:Delays, challenges and negotiationsThe Amazon Labor Union didn't even exist until last year.
Jason Anthony, a member of Amazon Labor Union, speaks to members of the media during the vote count to unionize Amazon workers outside the National Labor Relations Board offices in New York, U.S., on Friday, April 1, 2022.
The company has already expressed its disappointment with the outcome and said it's considering its options, including "filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence" of the National Labor Relations Board.

     Amazon Workers’ Union Victory Bolsters Revitalized Labor Movement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The union victory at an Amazon .com Inc. warehouse in New York City is the latest example of renewed interest in labor activism among U.S. workers.
It could prompt workers at other Amazon facilities and elsewhere to follow suit, efforts that organizers hope will reverse a long decline in union membership.
The Covid-19 pandemic brought attention to the critical role that workers such as warehouse employees, cashiers and drivers play in the functioning of the U.S. economy, often for relatively low pay.
At the same time, labor shortages have meant that many workers are in a better position to bargain for increased pay and benefits.

     Who is Chris Smalls? What to know about the Amazon labor union organizer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon workers in Staten Island, New York, voted to unionize this week, the first successful U.S. organizing effort among workers of the retail giant.
One of the most high-profile leaders of the effort is Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee who started the union.
Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, began speaking out in March 2020, when he was an Amazon employee.
After he was fired, Smalls formed the Amazon Labor Union, which is not backed by any national union organization.
In addition to firing Smalls, Amazon also had a strategy to smear him, according to leaked notes from an Amazon company meeting acquired by Vice News.

     Amazon Workers On Staten Island Successfully Voted To Form A Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Union organizer Christian Smalls (C) celebrates as he speaks following the April 1, 2022, vote for ... [+] the unionization of the Amazon Staten Island warehouse in New York.
- Amazon workers in New York voted Friday to establish the first US union at the e-commerce giant, a milestone for a company that has steadfastly opposed organized labor in its massive workforce.
Staring down the might and wealth of Amazon, the workers overwhelmingly cast 2,654 votes to be represented by a labor union.
Employees at a Starbucks in Phoenix voted 25 to 3 to form a union.
Since it's contended that workers become disengaged and less enthusiastic as time goes on, Amazon encourages workers to leave.
