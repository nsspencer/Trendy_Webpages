     Summary: The idea of The Undertaker returning to the ring seems very unlikely but he wasn‚Äôt joking because he also said ‚Äúnever say never‚Äù just a couple of days ago when he was interviewed by Orlando TV station WESH.
Taker said, ‚ÄúDo I have one more match in me?
In my mind and heart, I could go forever, but trying to get the body to deliver what my mind and heart see is the difficult point after all these years.
I never want to tarnish the legacy I created and be less than what people expect.
If he wrestles one more time, one can argue that he deserves to have that last match in front of fans.
