     Estelle Harris Dead at 93: ‘Seinfeld,’ ‘Toy Story’ Actress Dies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Estelle Harris, best known for playing Estelle Costanza on Seinfeld, died of natural causes on Saturday at the age of 93, days shy of her 94th birthday.
“It is with the greatest remorse and sadness to announce that Estelle Harris has passed on this evening at 6:25 pm,” Harris’ son Glenn said in a statement to our sister site Deadline.
Harris guest-starred on shows like Mad About You, Law &amp; Order, Married… With Children, Living Single and Moesha, but also held other recurring roles throughout her career.
Her comically shrill voice led to a healthy voice-acting career, securing her the role of Mrs.
Harris’ film credits included This Is My Life, CBGB and Playing Mona Lisa, among others.

     Estelle Harris, the Nagging Mrs. Costanza on ‘Seinfeld,’ Dies at 93
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Estelle Harris, the New York actress with the unforgettable shriek who hilariously nagged her son (played by Jason Alexander) and husband (Jerry Stiller) on Seinfeld, has died.
