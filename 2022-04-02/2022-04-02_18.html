     Barcelona set to receive €15 million sponsorship boost
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having tied down a big-money deal with Spotify as the main shirt sponsors from next season, Barcelona are on the lookout for a new sleeve sponsor.
And, they are now keen on renewing the partnership with the La Liga heavyweights and are in talks over a deal to become the sleeve sponsors.
They are the main sponsors of the men’s basketball Euroleague and have a partnership with the Turkish national football and basketball teams.
They are also the official travel partners of Turkish clubs like Galatasaray, Trabzonspor and Bursaspor, among others, while also being the main shirt sponsors for Argentine giants River Plate.
Barcelona are looking for a sum of around €15 million for the sleeve sponsorship deal and Turkish Airlines seem willing to meet those demands, which could prove to be a financial boost for the Blaugrana.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona boss Xavi Hernandez has said he wants to take inspiration from the club's record-breaking women's side when they host Sevilla on Sunday with the chance to move second in LaLiga.
While Barca's men have won just one Copa del Rey trophy during the last two seasons, the women's side have enjoyed unprecedented success.
Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images"I have a good relationship with Alexia [Putellas] and Aitana [Bonmati]," Xavi added.
"[Coach] Jonatan Giraldez's approach is really good.
Under Xavi, Barca's men are finally taking steps towards mirroring the women's team.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A win at Camp Nou will take Xavi’s side to 57 points and within nine points of Real Madrid.
With a comfortable lead of 12 points over Barcelona, Real Madrid are the clear favourites to walk away with the La Liga title.
The past week has revolved around calculating scenarios in which Barcelona can overtake Real Madrid on the league standings.
Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Real Betis and Villarreal are the four big names on their schedule.
To have any shot at challenging Real Madrid for the title, Barcelona will have to win all of their games from now as a non-negotiable.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finishing second should be the goal, and winning on Sunday will give them the inside track to accomplish that objective.
Barça’s remaining league schedule is tough but manageable, with Sevilla at home and Real Betis and Real Sociedad away the only true big hurdles on the road ahead.
The game in hand is a huge advantage, and if Barça can stay ahead of Sevilla until they finally catch up with the rest of the league they will be in great shape.
Julen Lopetegui’s team has been very consistent throughout the season, and there is a very good case to be made for them as the best defense in Europe right now.
Every game presents a different challenge, and Sevilla are a very unique, tricky puzzle to solve.

Real Madrid is still massively ahead, but other teams might be able to use the lack of confidence shown by Real Madrid to capitalize and possibly join the title fight.
In line with that, we will witness a truly huge game at the iconic Camp Nou, where Barcelona will host Sevilla this Sunday.
