    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool (AFP) – Liverpool moved top of the Premier League for the first time this year as Diogo Jota's header and a late Fabinho penalty saw off Watford 2-0.
However, the hosts did not have the easy afternoon Klopp would have hoped for with tougher tests to come.
Liverpool needed the Brazilian goalkeeper to be at this best for a few seconds that decided the game midway through the first half.
Liverpool had to wait until a minute from time to get the two-goal cushion they desired when Kucka wrestled Jota to the ground from a corner.
Salah had already been subbed by Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool welcomed the intensity of their title race with Manchester City after recording a 10th consecutive Premier League win in a hard-fought contest against Watford.
To keep in the title race we have to win our football games, otherwise it will be really tricky.
The next Premier League game is a big one [against City next Sunday], we can’t hide from that, but before then we have an important Champions League game to prepare for at Benfica.
“The only better situation would be to be 20 points ahead of City but that’s not possible.
“Nobody saw it – the referee, Jürgen or me – not one Liverpool player complained, but the game is stopped and Liverpool are given the chance to win 2-0.

The Liverpool midfielder was at his imperious best in the 2-0 win against Watford.
Thiago is unique among the Liverpool squad for the qualities he brings to Jürgen Klopp’s team.
Thiago also finished the game with three key passes, more than anyone else on the pitch (joint-top with Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota).
Thiago was back to his sumptuous best, and Liverpool are going to need him as we enter the business end of the season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Reds welcomed Watford to the fortress of Anfield and sent them home empty-handed after taking a 2-0 victory over their visitors.
A level of quietness fell over Anfield in the middle of the second half as Watford were keeping Liverpool attacks at bay and thwarting any attempt at a second goal for the Reds.
For most of the second half, it looked like the second goal would never come as the Reds progressively began playing sloppier and sloppier.
Then, Watford gifted Liverpool with a penalty kick via a rugby-style tackle in the box to Diogo Jota during a corner kick.
Manchester City face Burnley later on Saturday with a chance to retake the lead in the league, but, for now, Liverpool are at the top of the league.

     Liverpool can rely on Diogo Jota as Mo Salah struggles to get over World Cup disappointment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four days earlier, Salah had watched his Anfield strike partner score the decisive spot kick as Senegal beat Egypt on penalties to win their World Cup playoff and qualify for Qatar.
Get instant accessKlopp confirmed before the Watford game that Mane asked Liverpool to cancel their traditional ceremony of congratulating players on qualifying for the World Cup out of respect for Salah.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesFor the second successive Premier League game, Salah failed to register a single shot on target and he did little to test Watford's defence.
Like Salah, Jota has also scored five goals in his past 11 games for Liverpool, but he is not playing with the same previous record as Salah.
But while Salah deals with the angst of missing out on AFCON glory and World Cup qualification, Liverpool can rely on Jota.

     Liverpool could gain millions from £25m transfer or find heir for key departing Jürgen Klopp ace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Looking back, Awoniyi has enjoyed a spectacular campaign which has seen him hit 17 goals and register four assists in 36 games for Union Berlin.
Blessed with enviable physique, pace and an extremely voracious appetite for the ball, Awoniyi's explosive style and strong work-ethic make him an ideal player for Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool.
The report states that Union Berlin value him at roughly £25m, which is a steep increase from the fee the club paid to Liverpool.
However, Liverpool have negotiated a 10 per cent sell on clause, which means Liverpool could gain £2.5m from any potential deal.
The £25m price tag, even with the £2.5m discount, would feel a little steep — but mistakes have been rare under Klopp, so Liverpool may be prepared to take the hit.
