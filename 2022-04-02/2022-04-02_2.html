     Summary: WWE Hall of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin made his return to the wrestling ring after 19 years and looked like he had so much more left in the tank.
Seth Rollins' opponent was revealed to be former-AEW star Cody Rhodes, whose career skyrocketed since he left WWE in 2016.
Bianca Belair had a repeat performance of WrestleMania 37, winning the WWE Raw Women's Championship by defeating Becky Lynch in spectacular fashion.
Stone Cold Steve Austin had the crowd buzzing as he entered the stadium for Kevin Owens' "The KO Show."
After the realization of Rhodes' return sunk in, the match between him and Rollins showed how Rhodes had made a name for himself.

Let's take a closer look at who our CBS Sports experts predict will come out on top at Night 1 of WWE WrestleMania 38, which begins at 8 p.m. and streams live on Peacock following a kickoff show one hour earlier.
2022 WWE WrestleMania 38 Night 1 predictionsDrew McIntyre vs.
Pick: Drew McIntyre wins -- Brent BrookhouseThe entire build to McIntyre vs. Corbin revolves around Corbin's sneak attacks and unwillingness to meet McIntyre head-on.
Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- BrookhouseFans will be deeply disappointed if WWE pulls a bait-and-switch, failing to produce former AEW executive vice president Cody Rhodes.

     Summary: Ronda Rousey has lost at WrestleMania for the second time.
After an intense match, Charlotte hit a Big Boot on Ronda Rousey to get the win.
The story is that Rousey technically beat Charlotte twice beforehand.
The issue was the crowd didn't seem to know how to react.
This obviously sets up a rematch, with Rousey "beating Flair twice" before losing, so hopefully the crowd clicks more next time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pairing Austin and Owens one-on-one for a tense conversation is similar to Austin vs.
Owens, who berated Austin and exchanged barbs with the Hall of Famer, challenged Austin to a no-holds barred contest.
Austin and Owens would take advantage of the "no-holds barred" rules, as easels and tables were used to inflict damage.
Fueled by multiple more beers, Austin sent Owens running to the ramp and KO tried to hop on the four-wheeler to escape.
Charlotte Flair hit Ronda Rousey with a boot to the face and earned a pinfall victory at WrestleMania 38.
