    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool welcomed the intensity of their title race with Manchester City after recording a 10th consecutive Premier League win in a hard-fought contest against Watford.
To keep in the title race we have to win our football games, otherwise it will be really tricky.
The next Premier League game is a big one [against City next Sunday], we can’t hide from that, but before then we have an important Champions League game to prepare for at Benfica.
“The only better situation would be to be 20 points ahead of City but that’s not possible.
“Nobody saw it – the referee, Jürgen or me – not one Liverpool player complained, but the game is stopped and Liverpool are given the chance to win 2-0.

     Summary: Liverpool went top of the Premier League table for the first time since December after beating Watford 2-0 at Anfield.

Liverpool went up the other end and took the lead just seconds later.
The second half started edgy, with Watford sitting back and looking to catch Liverpool on the counter-attack.
Jordan Henderson delivered a corner into the box and Jota was wrestled to the ground by Kucka.

     Summary: The stage is set for a potentially decisive game in the Premier League title race next week as Manchester City and Liverpool both returned to Premier League action with victories ahead of their meeting at the Etihad Stadium next week.
The top of the Premier League table ended the day as it had began with Pep Guardiola's side a single point clear.
Certainly Liverpool's recent track record suggests no losses are in sight, their victory in the day's early kickoff was their 10th straight in the league.
With Leeds and Brentford to come at Vicarage Road in their next two matches Roy Hodgson will believe he has a chance of keeping his side in the Premier League.
Sterling would get his second assist soon after, driving to the byline to cut back for Ilkay Gundogan to roll in his 51st Premier League goal.

     Liverpool can rely on Diogo Jota as Mo Salah struggles to get over World Cup disappointment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four days earlier, Salah had watched his Anfield strike partner score the decisive spot kick as Senegal beat Egypt on penalties to win their World Cup playoff and qualify for Qatar.
Get instant accessKlopp confirmed before the Watford game that Mane asked Liverpool to cancel their traditional ceremony of congratulating players on qualifying for the World Cup out of respect for Salah.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesFor the second successive Premier League game, Salah failed to register a single shot on target and he did little to test Watford's defence.
Like Salah, Jota has also scored five goals in his past 11 games for Liverpool, but he is not playing with the same previous record as Salah.
But while Salah deals with the angst of missing out on AFCON glory and World Cup qualification, Liverpool can rely on Jota.

It was a microcosm of the whole Liverpool season.
He is in the conversation when it comes to the Player of the Season — although Salah might have something to say about it.
Liverpool nonetheless had enough to see off Watford, but everyone will have to be firing when the team travels to Manchester City.

But the visitors were not ahead for long, as Fred cancelled out Iheanacho's strike just three minutes later.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool (AFP) – Liverpool moved top of the Premier League for the first time this year as Diogo Jota's header and a late Fabinho penalty saw off Watford 2-0.
However, the hosts did not have the easy afternoon Klopp would have hoped for with tougher tests to come.
Liverpool needed the Brazilian goalkeeper to be at this best for a few seconds that decided the game midway through the first half.
Liverpool had to wait until a minute from time to get the two-goal cushion they desired when Kucka wrestled Jota to the ground from a corner.
Salah had already been subbed by Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.

Virgil van Dijk headed over from a corner early in the second half as Liverpool looked for the security of a second goal before Joao Pedro steered a shot wide for Watford to remind the hosts the game was not safe.

     Premier League best bets: Wolverhampton, Crystal Palace provide value
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a brief hiatus for World Cup qualifiers, the Premier League roars back this weekend with a full slate of matches and there are two underdogs at decent odds that value-hunters should circle.
Wolverhampton’s modest success is due in large part to a stingy defense that has the fourth-best defensive record in the Premier League this season.
Under Gerrard, Villa have scored 27 goals, but their expected goals sits at just 20.3, for an average of 1.13 per contest.
Palace ranks inside the top-6 in the Premier League in expected goals allowed, shots allowed and big chances conceded.
Despite a 4-7-4 (W-D-L) record at Selhurst Park, the Eagles have the fourth-most expected points (xPoints) at home in the Premier League this season.

     No change at top of Premier League as Manchester City, Liverpool both win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Manchester City remain on top of the Premier League on Saturday after a 2-0 win away to struggling Burnley.
Liverpool kicked off the weekend with a comfortable but unimpressive 2-0 win at home to Watford in Jurgen Klopp's 250th game in charge.
Christian Eriksen put Brentford ahead in the 54th minute and Janett's second left Chelsea reeling in the 60th minute.
Manchester United dropped more points at home as they were held 1-1 by Leicester City.
Kelechi Iheanacho fired Leicester ahead in the 63rd minute, but Fred leveled for United three minutes later.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Reds welcomed Watford to the fortress of Anfield and sent them home empty-handed after taking a 2-0 victory over their visitors.
A level of quietness fell over Anfield in the middle of the second half as Watford were keeping Liverpool attacks at bay and thwarting any attempt at a second goal for the Reds.
For most of the second half, it looked like the second goal would never come as the Reds progressively began playing sloppier and sloppier.
Then, Watford gifted Liverpool with a penalty kick via a rugby-style tackle in the box to Diogo Jota during a corner kick.
Manchester City face Burnley later on Saturday with a chance to retake the lead in the league, but, for now, Liverpool are at the top of the league.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (AFP) – Manchester City kept their cool under pressure on Saturday, cruising past Burnley 2-0 after Liverpool briefly replaced the long-time Premier League leaders at the top of the table.
Third-placed Chelsea remain on course for next season’s Champions League, but Manchester United’s hopes of a top-four finish are fading fast after a 1-1 draw at home to Leicester.
The two teams also meet in the FA Cup semi-finals later this month and both are involved in the Champions League quarter-finals in the coming week.
“The Premier League is the most important competition,” said Klopp, whose side have already won the League Cup this season.
But two goals from Vitaly Janelt and a first Premier League goal for Eriksen since his return to the English top-flight in a 10-minute spell turned the match on its head.

     Horror mix-up humiliates ‘toothless’ Man Utd as title race heats up — EPL Wrap

     Summary: “In the last 15 minutes we tried to score a goal but in this game we did not score the late goal,” he told Sky Sports.
Club legend Gary Neville called United “toothless” and “pathetically slow” in commentary for Sky Sports.
Pep Guardiola’s men, chasing their fourth league title in five years, were ahead in the fifth minute at Turf Moor through De Bruyne.
The European champions had taken the lead when Toni Rudiger lashed home from long-range at the start of the second half.
But two goals from Vitaly Janelt and a first Premier League goal for Eriksen since his return to the English top-flight in a 10-minute spell turned the match on its head.
