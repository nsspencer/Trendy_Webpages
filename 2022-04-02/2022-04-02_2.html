     Liverpool vs Watford result live updates: Fabinho wraps up win with Diogo Jota scoring as hosts go top of Premier League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool went top of the Premier League table for the first time since December after beating Watford 2-0 at Anfield.
The hosts didn't start the game as well as they would've liked and it was Watford who created the better chances in the early stages.
Liverpool went up the other end and took the lead just seconds later.
The second half started edgy, with Watford sitting back and looking to catch Liverpool on the counter-attack.
Jordan Henderson delivered a corner into the box and Jota was wrestled to the ground by Kucka.

     Jürgen Klopp relishes intensity of Liverpool’s title tussle with City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool welcomed the intensity of their title race with Manchester City after recording a 10th consecutive Premier League win in a hard-fought contest against Watford.
To keep in the title race we have to win our football games, otherwise it will be really tricky.
The next Premier League game is a big one [against City next Sunday], we can’t hide from that, but before then we have an important Champions League game to prepare for at Benfica.
“The only better situation would be to be 20 points ahead of City but that’s not possible.
“Nobody saw it – the referee, Jürgen or me – not one Liverpool player complained, but the game is stopped and Liverpool are given the chance to win 2-0.

     Liverpool can rely on Diogo Jota as Mo Salah struggles to get over World Cup disappointment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four days earlier, Salah had watched his Anfield strike partner score the decisive spot kick as Senegal beat Egypt on penalties to win their World Cup playoff and qualify for Qatar.
Get instant accessKlopp confirmed before the Watford game that Mane asked Liverpool to cancel their traditional ceremony of congratulating players on qualifying for the World Cup out of respect for Salah.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesFor the second successive Premier League game, Salah failed to register a single shot on target and he did little to test Watford's defence.
Like Salah, Jota has also scored five goals in his past 11 games for Liverpool, but he is not playing with the same previous record as Salah.
But while Salah deals with the angst of missing out on AFCON glory and World Cup qualification, Liverpool can rely on Jota.

     Summary: Diogo Jota struck once again and Fabinho converted a late penalty, awarded after VAR’s intervention, as Liverpool recorded a 10th consecutive home league win.
The early kick-off could not dampen the heightened expectation inside Anfield as Liverpool looked to increase the pressure on City.
Diogo Jota gives Liverpool the lead.
Victory was secured in the final seconds when VAR advised Stuart Attwell to check a possible penalty after Samir had cleared a Henderson corner.
Substitute Fabinho swept the penalty into the top corner and Liverpool onwards.

     Summary: With Manchester City up next in the league, a victory is now certain to send the winners top.
Gomez grows into new roleRight-back is generally perceived as one of the last remaining problem areas in the Liverpool squad.
It was a microcosm of the whole Liverpool season.
He is in the conversation when it comes to the Player of the Season — although Salah might have something to say about it.
Liverpool nonetheless had enough to see off Watford, but everyone will have to be firing when the team travels to Manchester City.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool (AFP) – Liverpool moved top of the Premier League for the first time this year as Diogo Jota's header and a late Fabinho penalty saw off Watford 2-0.
However, the hosts did not have the easy afternoon Klopp would have hoped for with tougher tests to come.
Liverpool needed the Brazilian goalkeeper to be at this best for a few seconds that decided the game midway through the first half.
Liverpool had to wait until a minute from time to get the two-goal cushion they desired when Kucka wrestled Jota to the ground from a corner.
Salah had already been subbed by Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.

     Pep Guardiola Admits Keeping One Eye on Liverpool While Travelling to Burnley With Manchester City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has admitted that he and his squad had one eye on events at Anfield earlier on Saturday, ahead of their trip to Burnley.
Pep Guardiola told reporters, "We know they [Liverpool] are winning [against Watford], because we were just on the bus."
The Manchester City manager continued, "I would like to be involved there, but I cannot do it, so I have to be here in Burnley.
Manchester City head into a crunch fixture list in April, that - after the trip to Burnley this weekend- features double-headers against Liverpool and Atletico Madrid respectively across three different competitions.
After that, City head to the Spanish capital for part two of their European quarter-final against Diego Simeone's side, before travelling to Wembley to face Liverpool once again, but this time in the FA Cup semi-final.
