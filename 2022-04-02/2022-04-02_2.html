2022 WWE WrestleMania 38 Night 1 predictionsDrew McIntyre vs.
Pick: Drew McIntyre wins -- Brent BrookhouseThe entire build to McIntyre vs. Corbin revolves around Corbin's sneak attacks and unwillingness to meet McIntyre head-on.
Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- BrookhouseFans will be deeply disappointed if WWE pulls a bait-and-switch, failing to produce former AEW executive vice president Cody Rhodes.
