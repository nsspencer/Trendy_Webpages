     Kansas Runs Past Villanova to Get to the N.C.A.A. Final, Avenging a 2018 Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was hard to imagine a worse start for Villanova.
Kansas scored the first 10 points, Villanova turned the ball over on four consecutive possessions and Agbaji was on fire, making his first four shots, all 3-pointers.
“That can become a problem for us.”That Agbaji would play such a central role was hard to see coming when he arrived in Lawrence five years ago.
“I came in just being a contributor, a guy off the bench, and then I ended up earning my starting role.
Even when he was struggling, his confidence did not waver and he found other ways to contribute.

     Watch: Villanova Seniors Get Emotional After Final Four Loss to Kansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villanova’s season has come to an end after a heartbreaking loss to Kansas in the Final Four.
Trailing 79–65 with 35 seconds left in regulation, Wildcats coach Jay Wright began to sub out his seniors as reality started to set in.
Gillespie, Samuels and the Wildcats entered a tough matchup against Kansas without a key piece in guard Justin Moore, who tore his Achilles in the Elite Eight.
As the team prepares to say goodbye to its four seniors, Villanova will look back fondly on the 2021-22 campaign.
The Wildcats earned the program’s 40th NCAA tournament appearance and eighth Final Four berth after giving Wright his 10th consecutive winning season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS -- Two years later, Bill Self still wonders how his Kansas team might have finished a season that ended without an NCAA tournament due to COVID-19.
Kansas had leads of 10-0, 16-5, 26-11 and 38-19 before a 10-0 Villanova run cut the lead to 10 just before halftime.
And Villanova earned compassion after Moore's injury impacted Jay Wright's pursuit of his third national title in six years.
But Kansas entered the Final Four with arguably the most balanced and efficient team in the field.
"Then we win the Final Four game, and we're saying, 'We don't come to Kansas to win the Final Four, we came to win the national championship.'
