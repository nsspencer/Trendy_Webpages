     Cody Rhodes returns at WrestleMania, speaks on leaving AEW
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cody Rhodes returned to WWE as the mystery opponent for Seth Rollins.
Rhodes won the match after more than twenty-one minutes hitting three Cross Rhodes and utilizing the Bionic Elbow in the final sequence.
But with that said, the opportunity now exists to prove it, and that’s what I’m most excited about.
Rhodes also spoke about the decision to leave AEW:I chose to remain silent about my departure from AEW and I’m going to keep my word on that.
In the interview, Rhodes mentioned that A&amp;E and WWE are producing a documentary on Dusty Rhodes as part of its ongoing relationship.

Rhodes was a two-time intercontinental champion and six-time tag team champion at the time of his original WWE departure.
He returns with more titles on his resume, including AEW's TNT strap (three times), the NWA world heavyweight championship, the IWGP United States championship and the ROH world championship as title reigns under his belt.

     Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 38 Is Exactly What WWE and Wrestling Needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWEAs most internet-savvy fans expected, Cody Rhodes was indeed the mystery opponent for Seth Rollins on Saturday night at WWE WrestleMania 38.
One classic show-stealing match later, it's clear he's back where he belongs and WWE might have a long-sought-after solution to issues assaulting its main event scene.
By most metrics, Rhodes hasn't changed too much since leaving WWE the first time.
Yet cliches about absence and fondness abound and, if nothing else, the proper, megastar presentation sells him as a serious main event threat.
The man who left as a pseudo midcarder who often wore facepaint and didn't use his own name is back and looking like a main event star.

     Cody Rhodes Returns to WWE at WrestleMania 38, Says He Is ‘Completely Different Individual’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cody Rhodes made his return to WWE on Saturday night at WrestleMania 38, coming back to the promotion that he famously exited nearly six years ago.
In that time, Rhodes has wrestled all over the world and was integral to the founding of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), the rival wrestling promotion run by Tony Khan.
He won’t say it out loud for fear of jinxing it, but Rhodes has his eyes on the WWE Championship.
And I’m excited to bring the WWWF championship belt that I acquired a few months ago, the one that Superstar and Dusty fought over.
I’m excited to carry that in my bag.
