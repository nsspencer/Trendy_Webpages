     Summary: Cody Rhodes returned to WWE as the mystery opponent for Seth Rollins.
Rhodes won the match after more than twenty-one minutes hitting three Cross Rhodes and utilizing the Bionic Elbow in the final sequence.
But with that said, the opportunity now exists to prove it, and that’s what I’m most excited about.
Rhodes also spoke about the decision to leave AEW:I chose to remain silent about my departure from AEW and I’m going to keep my word on that.
In the interview, Rhodes mentioned that A&amp;E and WWE are producing a documentary on Dusty Rhodes as part of its ongoing relationship.

     Real Madrid seek recovery against Celta after Barca loss, before Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Real Madrid’s trip to Celta Vigo might once have been seen as a chance to rest and reset but the Clasico capitulation has raised the stakes ahead of next week’s Champions League first leg against Chelsea.
Madrid are nine points clear at the top of La Liga, which should still be more than enough to hold off a resurgent Barca and Sevilla to win the Spanish title.
But Barcelona’s 4-0 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu before the international break has left the door just slightly ajar, with Barca hoping their thumping win can prompt an unexpected collapse from their rivals.

     Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 38 Is Exactly What WWE and Wrestling Needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWEAs most internet-savvy fans expected, Cody Rhodes was indeed the mystery opponent for Seth Rollins on Saturday night at WWE WrestleMania 38.
One classic show-stealing match later, it's clear he's back where he belongs and WWE might have a long-sought-after solution to issues assaulting its main event scene.
By most metrics, Rhodes hasn't changed too much since leaving WWE the first time.
Yet cliches about absence and fondness abound and, if nothing else, the proper, megastar presentation sells him as a serious main event threat.
The man who left as a pseudo midcarder who often wore facepaint and didn't use his own name is back and looking like a main event star.

     LaLiga: Real Madrid eye recovery against Celta after Barcelona loss; Espanyol take on Real Sociedad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LaLiga returns on April 2 with Real Madrid visiting Celta Vigo without coach Carlo Ancelotti after he tested positive for Covid-19.
Madrid has had two weeks to stew over its humbling 4-0 loss at home to Barcelona before the international break.
That was the fourth assist Darder has given the forward this season.
Perhaps the standout performance for this magnificent duo came in El Derbi de Barcelona, against FC Barcelona.
Xavi Hernández’s team went ahead early on, however, Darder scored an equalizer with a shot from outside of the area, with R.D.T.

     Summary: Cody Rhodes made his return to WWE on Saturday night at WrestleMania 38, coming back to the promotion that he famously exited nearly six years ago.
In that time, Rhodes has wrestled all over the world and was integral to the founding of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), the rival wrestling promotion run by Tony Khan.
He won’t say it out loud for fear of jinxing it, but Rhodes has his eyes on the WWE Championship.
And I’m excited to bring the WWWF championship belt that I acquired a few months ago, the one that Superstar and Dusty fought over.
I’m excited to carry that in my bag.
