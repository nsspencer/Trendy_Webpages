    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Unfortunately, he had some 'flu-like symptoms, which he showed yesterday" confirmed interim manager Ralf Rangnick.
"Obviously, he should and would have played in the starting XI but he didn't feel well and couldn't train.
"Then the doctor went to see him at his house this morning to check again but he didn't feel any better and that's why, unfortunately, that's why he hasn't been able to play.
"We will play our normal formation that we always play, with Bruno as a striker at times, but also as a midfielder.
Paul Pogba is one of the two offensive midfield players and this is how I have decided to play," added Rangnick to Sky Sports.
