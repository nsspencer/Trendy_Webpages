     Karim Benzema Becomes Top Penalty Taker In Europe... Only To Lose Title In Same Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karim Benzema Becomes Top Penalty Taker In Europe... Only To Lose Title In Same GameKarim Benzema scored two penalties to help Real Madrid bounce back from their Clasico thrashing with a 2-1 win at Celta Vigo.
By converting that penalty - sending keeper Matias Dituro the wrong way in the process - Benzema became statistically the most deadly penalty taker in Europe's top five leagues over the past five seasons.
Within just 45 minutes, Benzema took another penalty.
Benzema made amends for his miss and, with it, took his conversion rate over the past five seasons up to a round 90%.
That left PSG defender Sergio Ramos with the title of Europe's top penalty taker, narrowly ahead of Tottenham's Harry Kane, Saint-Etienne's Wahbi Khazri and Andrej Kramaric of Hoffenheim in joint second.

     Benzema scores two out of three penalties as Real Madrid defeat Celta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karim Benzema missed one penalty but scored two in Real Madrid's La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Saturday.
Madrid (AFP) – Karim Benzema missed one penalty but scored two as Real Madrid scraped past Celta Vigo on Saturday to get back to winning ways ahead of Wednesday’s crunch Champions League meeting with Chelsea.
Chelsea, who outplayed Real Madrid over two semi-final legs last year, will be a much sterner test than Celta and Carlo Ancelotti’s side will almost certainly not have the benefit of being awarded three penalties at Stamford Bridge.
Benzema stepped up again but this time shot left, Dituro jumping the same way and making the block with his right elbow.
Benzema went left, Dituro right, and Madrid held on for the win.
