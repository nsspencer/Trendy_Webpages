     The Undertaker in tears: Watch his viral emotional speech during WWE Hall of Fame induction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE legend 'The Undertaker' delivered an incredibly sping tingling, teary-eyed speech during his WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Saturday.
Even though the Undertake had announced his retirement back in 2020, his induction into the 'Hall of Fame' was a matter of when and not if.
Recently, before the two-day extravaganza named Wrestlemania 38 kicked off, The Undertake headlined 2022's class of WWE Hall of Fame inductees, and it's fair to say that it was a wholesome moment.
The WWE icon thanked his family, friends, and his fans before even teasing a probable return into the ring.
The WWE legend would go on to talk about many other highlights of his career, before bidding a farewell, which wasn't farewell-ish at all.
