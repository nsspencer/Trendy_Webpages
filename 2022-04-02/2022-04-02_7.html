     Karim Benzema Becomes Top Penalty Taker In Europe... Only To Lose Title In Same Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karim Benzema Becomes Top Penalty Taker In Europe... Only To Lose Title In Same GameKarim Benzema scored two penalties to help Real Madrid bounce back from their Clasico thrashing with a 2-1 win at Celta Vigo.
By converting that penalty - sending keeper Matias Dituro the wrong way in the process - Benzema became statistically the most deadly penalty taker in Europe's top five leagues over the past five seasons.
Within just 45 minutes, Benzema took another penalty.
Benzema made amends for his miss and, with it, took his conversion rate over the past five seasons up to a round 90%.
That left PSG defender Sergio Ramos with the title of Europe's top penalty taker, narrowly ahead of Tottenham's Harry Kane, Saint-Etienne's Wahbi Khazri and Andrej Kramaric of Hoffenheim in joint second.

     Benzema and Felix shine as Real Madrid and Atletico get set for Champions League tests
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karim Benzema missed one penalty but scored two in Real Madrid's La Liga win over Celta Vigo on Saturday.
(AFP/MIGUEL RIOPA)Karim Benzema and Joao Felix ensured Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid claimed morale-boosting victories in La Liga on Saturday before facing the Premier League's heavyweights next week in the Champions League quarter-finals.
Benzema missed one penalty but scored two as Real Madrid defeated Celta Vigo 2-1 to get back to winning ways ahead of Wednesday's crunch meeting with Chelsea.
Madrid were awarded a second penalty after Rodrygo made sure he tumbled over the planted left leg of Jeison Murillo.
If Dituro had dived left for a third time he might have saved but he went right, Benzema left, and Madrid held on for the win.
