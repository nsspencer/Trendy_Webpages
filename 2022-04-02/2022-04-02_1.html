    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, the Nuggets tangled with a solid and probably playoff-bound Hornets team.
Keeping in mind that the NBA, among the four major sports, is the toughest place to win on the road.
The road win percentage in the NBA is less than the NFL, Major League Baseball and the NHL.
That’s the third-best road winning percentage in the Western Conference and fourth in the entire NBA.
Led by The Joker, the Denver Nuggets have become one of the very best road teams in the NBA.

     Summary: Jamal Murray’s injury continues to be one of the Denver Nuggets’ biggest problems.
(via Harrison Wind)“I can’t sit here and say that (Jamal Murray’s) going to play in any of these last four games.
But I also can’t say that he won’t.”Michael Malone: "I can't sit here and say that (Jamal Murray's) going to play in any of these last four games.
The most encouraging update we've had on Jamal Murray yet.
At this point, Murray might make his return to the Nuggets during the playoffs itself, which is incredibly unideal.
