     Cody Rhodes revealed as Seth Rollins’ Wrestlemania 38 opponent [Video]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seth Rollins’ mystery opponent at Wrestemania 38 was revealed as Cody Rhodes, who came out to a roaring ovation in front of the massive crowd at AT&amp;T Stadium.
Through two years with the upstart wrestling organization, he’d become the inaugural TNT Champion and hold the belt three different times.
Murmurs of friction between him and AEW President Tony Khan started to surface late last year and in February, Rhodes let his contract expire and departed from the company.
Word immediately started to spread that he’d be WWE bound and would be working a Wrestlemania match with Seth Rollins.
The question now becomes where he will fit in the WWE landscape moving forward, especially after literally starting a rival promotion from scratch.

     Summary: ✖Cody Rhodes officially returned to the WWE during Night One of WrestleMania 38 on Saturday night, appearing as Vince McMahon's handpicked opponent for Seth Rollins.
I'm working here on a handshake deal.
AEW then confirmed on Feb. 15 that both Cody and Brandi Rhodes were officially leaving AEW.
Meanwhile, Rollins had repeatedly come up short in earning a spot at WrestleMania, failing to beat both Kevin Owens and AJ Styles on episodes of Raw.
Vince McMahon then finally offered him a match but said Rollins wouldn't learn who it was until he was in the ring.

But with that said, the opportunity now exists to prove it, and that’s what I’m most excited about.
Rhodes also spoke about the decision to leave AEW:I chose to remain silent about my departure from AEW and I’m going to keep my word on that.
In the interview, Rhodes mentioned that A&amp;E and WWE are producing a documentary on Dusty Rhodes as part of its ongoing relationship.

     Cody Rhodes Returns to WWE at WrestleMania 38, Says He Is ‘Completely Different Individual’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cody Rhodes made his return to WWE on Saturday night at WrestleMania 38, coming back to the promotion that he famously exited nearly six years ago.
In that time, Rhodes has wrestled all over the world and was integral to the founding of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), the rival wrestling promotion run by Tony Khan.
He won’t say it out loud for fear of jinxing it, but Rhodes has his eyes on the WWE Championship.
And I’m excited to bring the WWWF championship belt that I acquired a few months ago, the one that Superstar and Dusty fought over.
I’m excited to carry that in my bag.
