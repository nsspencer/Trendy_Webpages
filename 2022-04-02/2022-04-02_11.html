    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trae Young led the way with 36 points and 10 assists.
Whereas the Nets relied solely on two players, the Hawks got a total team effort.
However, the two Hawks with the least points were both starters - Kevin Huerter and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot both scored 5 points each.
If the season ended today, the Hawks would play the Cavaliers who they have owned this season.
The Hawks have the next two days off before playing the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night.

     Kevin Durant drops career-high 55 points, but Nets lose crucial game to Trae Young, Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite Durant's best efforts, the Nets' comeback attempt fell short and the Hawks held on, 122-115, to extend their winning streak to five games.
While the Nets didn't win the game, we have to first talk about Durant's incredible performance.
Thirty of those points came in the second half as he tried to drag the Nets back, but even that wasn't enough.
But as brilliant as Durant was, the night ultimately belonged to Young and the Hawks.
With the Hawks clinging to a three-point lead in the final minutes, Young took over.

     Summary: The biggest play of Bogdan Bogdanovic’s night in the Atlanta Hawks (41-37) 122-115 win over the Brooklyn Nets didn’t even count.
At 41-37, the Hawks have won five games in a row and take over sole possession of the eight-seed in the Eastern Conference.
They got a big assist earlier in the day when the Philadelphia 76ers took out the Charlotte Hornets.
The stat sheet won’t fully show how good of a game Bogdan Bogdanovic hadThe Hawks bench ace finished with just eight points, two assists, and one rebound.
From that point on, the Hawks went on an 18-3 run before a Durant jumper stopped it.
