     2022 WWE WrestleMania 38 results: Ronda Rousey loses to Charlotte Flair, snapping undefeated singles streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Flair overcame Ronda Rousey in the penultimate segment presented on Night 1 of WWE WrestleMania 38, taking place inside AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
The extended title match featured plenty of momentum swings as each competitor exerted their will on the other.
The finishing sequence came when Flair accidentally speared WWE referee Charles Robinson (who, conveniently, is closely tied to Ric Flair) with a spear.
Heading into the match, Rousey held an undefeated streak in singles competition dating back to her WWE debut in April 2018.
Rousey nearly added the SmackDown Women's championship to a trophy case that includes the Raw Women's title and the UFC women's bantamweight championship.

That said, Rousey still pulled off a few highlight-reel maneuvers while trading shots back and forth with Flair.
After Flair escaped, she kicked Rousey in the face, which then led to the pinfall as she retained the WWE Smackdown women’s title.
Afterward, Rousey was seen embracing Browne, who was sitting ringside for the event held at AT&amp;T Stadium just outside Dallas.
