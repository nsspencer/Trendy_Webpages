     Logan Paul gets WrestleMania 38 win, but The Miz leaves him laying in the ring, setting up possible WWE run for celebrity YouTuber
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Logan Paul doesn’t just knock people out in the boxing ring.
Turns out he is pretty good in the wrestling ring, too, as he teamed with The Miz Saturday to score a WrestleMania 38 win over Rey and Dominick Mysterio.
But there was a twist in the end as The Miz turned on Paul after the duo had one and landed a “Skull Crushing Finale” — The Miz’s finishing move — on Paul.
That left the celebrity YouTuber turned professional boxer laying in the ring and, perhaps, sets up more work for Paul in the WWE down the road.
Paul and The Miz battled the Mysterios in the third match of WrestleMania 38 which is taking play in Dallas, Texas.

     Logan Paul Wears Pikachu Card Valued at $2.5M as Part of WrestleMania 38 Outfit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noam Galai/Getty ImagesNever one for modesty, Logan Paul showed off his wealth in a unique way during his ring entrance at WrestleMania 38.
There was a controversy last year when Paul purchased an unopened box of sealed first edition Pokemon cards.
He spent $3.5 million on the box set, but he later confirmed it was a fake set.
Per Matt Kim of IGN, Pokemon card experts noted the box of cards Paul purchased didn't resemble previous boxes from a similar set of cards.
Even with some uncertainty about the overall veracity of the card, Paul certainly showed out in his first WrestleMania appearance.

     Logan Paul Crushes WrestleMania, Wins Tag Team Match With The Miz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Logan Paul looked like a total natural in the squared-circle at WrestleMania 38 just now ... dominating his tag team match with The Miz -- and coming away with the win.
Logan and Miz were in control throughout the match against Rey Mysterio and his son, Dominik at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington ... and the whole thing was filled with action.
Logan, however, flipped the script -- not only did he hit Mysterio with a "Three Amigos" of his own, he then hit Rey with a "Frog Splash" ... which was also one of Guerrero's moves.
Logan -- who came out wearing a $1 million super-rare Pokémon card around his neck -- and Miz rocked matching yellow and black 'fits for the match ... and they looked damn good.
But, in true Heel form, Miz hit Logan with his finisher move -- the Skull-Crushing finale -- after being declared winners ... much to the delight of the crowd, who booed Paul throughout the match.

     Logan Paul Is Wearing a Nearly $1 Million Pokemon Card to Wrestlemania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖Logan Paul will be wearing one of the rarest Pokemon cards in existence when he wrestles at Wrestlemania tonight.
The Pikachu Illustrator card is a vintage promotional card given out to winners of an early Pokemon card contest.
We will note that Paul has an...interesting history with the Pikachu Illustrator card.
He purchased a Pikachu Illustrator card in October for $200,000, but then discovered it was a counterfeit card.
While recording the video about the fake card, Paul punched a window (he claims as a joke) and ended up going to the hospital for nine stitches.
