    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: by Benjamin Leier | Clippers Correspondent | Sat, Apr 2nd 9:54am EDTRobert Covington finished with 43 points (15-24 FG, 2-2 FT, 11-18 3-PT), eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks on Friday.
Fantasy Impact:RoCo nearly doubled his previous career-high of 22 points on Friday, as he hit 11 treys, tying the league-high mark in a game for 2022.
Covington scored 33 points in the second-half alone, and had a pair of threes late in the game that just missed for a chance at 50.
Both teams rested several starters on Friday, but the Clippers came away with a convincing 153-119 victory, their highest regular-season scoring total in franchise history.
Los Angeles will finish the regular-season at home, and take on the Pelicans on Sunday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo, who didn't play on Friday night, admired Covington's big performance.
"My teammates, throughout the game, they were telling me out there they were trying to get me 50," Covington said, per ESPN.
I think this is the most 3s I've shot in a game in my career besides the G League."
Covington caught fire and it resulted in a career- best nightPrior to the Bucks game, Covington had never knocked down more than seven three-pointers in a game.
"I mean he made some shots early, but I didn't know it was going to be this kind of night," Clippers coach Lue said.

     Clippers' Robert Covington: Turns in career night against Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Covington erupted for a career-high 43 points (15-24 FG, 11-18 3Pt, 2-2 FT) and added eight rebounds, three blocks, two assists and two steals across 46 minutes Friday in the Clippers' 153-119 win over the Bucks.
With both teams playing on the second leg of a back-to-back set, supporting players for the Clippers and Bucks were thrust into larger roles, and none capitalized on the opportunity as much as Covington.
After combining to produce 23 points across his past three starts, Covington nearly had that total in the third quarter alone, when he notched 17 of his points.
He achieved most of his offensive production thanks to some hot shooting from downtown, with his 11 triples also establishing a career high and matching the best mark from any NBA player in a single game this season.
Though Covington's big performance is sure to attract attention in any shallow leagues where he might be available, his usage will almost certainly plummet in LA's next game Sunday against the Pelicans, when all of Marcus Morris (knee), Paul George (elbow), Reggie Jackson (rest) and Nicolas Batum (ankle) are expected to return to action.

     Clippers get career nights from Robert Covington and Amir Coffey to bounce back at Milwaukee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — The LA Clippers started their final road trip of the regular season in Chicago, playing about 13 miles west of where power forward Robert Covington went to high school at Proviso West and had a 60-point game in his AAU days.
But Thursday night’s game against the Chicago Bulls was a first-unit game, the second for Paul George in his return from a 96-day injury layoff.
By the time Covington stepped to the free-throw line with 7.2 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Clippers’ lead was down to 116-115.
Covington calmly made both free throws, his only attempts of the game, to put the Clippers up by three.But everything went disastrously from there for the Clippers.
Terance Mann fouled DeMar DeRozan prior to an inbound, and DeRozan’s free throw changed how the Clippers could protect the lead.
