     Chelsea manager backs fan protests over Cubs’ Ricketts’ ownership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The opposition towards the Ricketts family and their bid to take over Chelsea continued ahead of the team's match against Brentford.
According to the Daily Mail, more than 20,000 people signed a petition against a potential Ricketts ownership.
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was asked about the protests and showed his support for the fans to have their voices heard.
In an attempt to diffuse the situation, the Ricketts met with Chelsea stakeholders, which included a meeting between Tom Ricketts and Paul Canoville, the club’s first Black footballer.
According to The Guardian, the meeting did not go down well with the other bidders nor with Chelsea supporters, only drawing more ire.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eriksen signed for Brentford in January after saying he would resume his playing career, despite collapsing on the pitch while playing for his country last June.
Some Chelsea fans applauded the Dane during the game, a rare tribute for a visiting player at Stamford Bridge.
“Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, and the world champions, in almost a complete performance, that’s a little bit unreal,” he said.
The feeling was shared by the visiting Brentford fans who celebrated one of the greatest results in the history of their club against their more illustrious west London neighbours.
You’re having a laugh!” the Bees’ fans sang as they taunted the Stamford Bridge faithful after their first win over Chelsea in any competition since 1939.

     Brentford shock Chelsea 4-1 with Eriksen on target
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - A goal for Christian Eriksen, two from Vitaly Janelt and a late addition from Yoane Wissa earned Brentford a shock 4-1 comeback victory over west London neighbours Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.

Substitute Wissa put the icing on the cake in the 87th minute, condemning a lacklustre Chelsea to their first home defeat since September.
It was the first victory for promoted Brentford over Chelsea since 1939.
Chelsea, who had not lost in the Premier League since mid-January, remain third in the table but lost ground on leaders Manchester City and Liverpool who both won on Saturday.

     Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea expectations for Brentford derby weren't high
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas Tuchel has admitted his expectations of his Chelsea side were 'not too high' after they returned to club action following the international break.
Chelsea's return after a perfect March - six wins from six - ended in misery thanks to west London neighbours Brentford on Saturday afternoon.
Last year after the March international break, Chelsea lost 5-2 to West Brom.
"You don't need to lose as a consequence," said Tuchel after Chelsea's defeat following the return from the international break, as quoted by football.london.
It is difficult after an international break to play as the favourite, to dictate the match and break down a difficult and well organised team.

     Summary: A small number of Chelsea fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday to protest the Ricketts family bid.
The announcement comes on the same day a small group of fans staged a protest outside Stamford Bridge against the Ricketts bid ahead of Chelsea's clash with Brentford.
"At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family's bid for the club."
CST said they would survey their members again if the Ricketts family "publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns".
Outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a small number of Chelsea fans held "No to Ricketts" signs to demonstrate against the family's bid.

     New twist in Chelsea bidding war as billionaire joins Ricketts family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race to buy Chelsea has taken another twist after it emerged that the Ricketts family have been joined in their bid by the Rock Entertainment Group, headed by Dan Gilbert who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.5bn).
The Ricketts family had already partnered with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon, Ken Griffin, who is yet to disclose if he would take a controlling stake.
The confusion arose following suggestions in America that the Ricketts family would not have a controlling stake in the club, raising further questions about their controversial bid for Chelsea.
The news emerged in the wake of Chelsea’s shock 4-1 defeat to Brentford, before which supporters protested against the prospect of the Ricketts as owners.
After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, a pressing situation against the goalkeeper and another big chance from Kai Havertz.

Yoane Wissa grabbed a fourth in the dying embers of the game to guide them to their first win since 1939 over their London neighbours -- just 5.5 miles lie between Stamford Bridge and Brentford's ground.
