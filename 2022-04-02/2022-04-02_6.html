     Chelsea manager backs fan protests over Cubs’ Ricketts’ ownership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The opposition towards the Ricketts family and their bid to take over Chelsea continued ahead of the team's match against Brentford.
According to the Daily Mail, more than 20,000 people signed a petition against a potential Ricketts ownership.
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was asked about the protests and showed his support for the fans to have their voices heard.
In an attempt to diffuse the situation, the Ricketts met with Chelsea stakeholders, which included a meeting between Tom Ricketts and Paul Canoville, the club’s first Black footballer.
According to The Guardian, the meeting did not go down well with the other bidders nor with Chelsea supporters, only drawing more ire.

     Soccer-Brentford boss hails Eriksen fairytale after defeat of Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eriksen signed for Brentford in January after saying he would resume his playing career, despite collapsing on the pitch while playing for his country last June.
Some Chelsea fans applauded the Dane during the game, a rare tribute for a visiting player at Stamford Bridge.
“Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, and the world champions, in almost a complete performance, that’s a little bit unreal,” he said.
The feeling was shared by the visiting Brentford fans who celebrated one of the greatest results in the history of their club against their more illustrious west London neighbours.
You’re having a laugh!” the Bees’ fans sang as they taunted the Stamford Bridge faithful after their first win over Chelsea in any competition since 1939.

     Chelsea fans protest against Ricketts bid as backlash continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A small number of Chelsea fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday to protest the Ricketts family bid.
The announcement comes on the same day a small group of fans staged a protest outside Stamford Bridge against the Ricketts bid ahead of Chelsea's clash with Brentford.
"At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family's bid for the club."
CST said they would survey their members again if the Ricketts family "publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns".
Outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a small number of Chelsea fans held "No to Ricketts" signs to demonstrate against the family's bid.

     Why Trevoh Chalobah Was Left Out of Chelsea's 4-1 League Defeat to Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Why Trevoh Chalobah Was Left Out of Chelsea's 4-1 League Defeat to BrentfordChelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has revealed why he decided to leave centre-back Trevoh Chalobah out of their 4-1 Premier League defeat to Brentford on Saturday afternoon.
The Blues hosted their west London rivals at Stamford Bridge having not lost a Premier League game since January, but it was their opponents that had the last laugh.
Fellow centre-back Andreas Christensen was also left on the bench, after he has reportedly finalised a move to Barcelona at the end of the season.
IMAGO / PA ImagesSpeaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Tuchel revealed there was nothing behind his decision to leave Chalobah out of the squad to face Brentford on the weekend.
Again, it's more difficult for us than them to play as the underdog and be well prepared for this match.

     New twist in Chelsea bidding war as billionaire joins Ricketts family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race to buy Chelsea has taken another twist after it emerged that the Ricketts family have been joined in their bid by the Rock Entertainment Group, headed by Dan Gilbert who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.5bn).
The Ricketts family had already partnered with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon, Ken Griffin, who is yet to disclose if he would take a controlling stake.
The confusion arose following suggestions in America that the Ricketts family would not have a controlling stake in the club, raising further questions about their controversial bid for Chelsea.
The news emerged in the wake of Chelsea’s shock 4-1 defeat to Brentford, before which supporters protested against the prospect of the Ricketts as owners.
After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, a pressing situation against the goalkeeper and another big chance from Kai Havertz.

     Towns, Edwards lead Timberwolves to 136-130 win over Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Towns scored 32 points and the Timberwolves overcame Nikola Jokic’s 38-point, 19-rebound performance in a 136-130 win over the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.
”I think we’ve shown multiple times we’re a playoff team and I think we also shown that we’re not a joke,” Towns said.
But what did in the Nuggets were the 36 free throws they allowed and the 30 points they gave up off 18 turnovers.
Before tip-off, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was blunt about how his team has been pulling out games in which they played poorly.

     Chelsea sale: Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert part of Ricketts family bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ricketts family’s bid to buy Chelsea is backed by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, the PA news agency understands.
The 60-year-old numbers among America’s wealthiest men, and adds yet more financial muscle to the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family’s bid to buy Chelsea.
The Ricketts’ offer to buy Chelsea is entirely funded by cash, which will prove compelling given the west London club’s sale could reach £3billion.
The Ricketts’ bid for Chelsea has met with strong fan resistance owing to historic Islamophobic emails from family patriarch Joe Ricketts.
Ricketts senior is not on the Chelsea bid, and Tom Ricketts has apologised repeatedly and called those views “abhorrent”, while also forging strong links with Muslim communities in Chicago.

     Chelsea's season in doubt on and off the field as Brentford find historic win, Christian Eriksen goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What followed was a brutal exposure of the hosts' fragile state as Christian Eriksen, Mads Roerslev and Bryan Mbuemo orchestrated a historic 4-1 win for Brentford.
Yoane Wissa grabbed a fourth in the dying embers of the game to guide them to their first win since 1939 over their London neighbours -- just 5.5 miles lie between Stamford Bridge and Brentford's ground.
Chelsea's stunning loss to Brentford -- their first since 1939 -- left manager Thomas Tuchel at a loss for explanations on Saturday.
Fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday before the Brentford match to protest the potential takeover of the club by the Ricketts family.
Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, that was almost a complete performance.
