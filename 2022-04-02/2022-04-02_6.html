     Summary: There were injuries up and down the roster, including the three-month absence of star guard Paige Bueckers.
“This year, I didn’t think any of that.”UConn led Stanford for most of the game Friday night, but the advantage never felt safe.
Azzi Fudd and Aaliyah Edwards got into foul trouble in the second quarter, forcing Auriemma to dip into his reserves earlier than expected.
Olivia Nelson-Ododa didn’t convert her first field goal until late in the third quarter, the result of a physical battle with Stanford’s Cameron Brink.
And Paige Bueckers, UConn’s de-facto closer, was subbed out with 5:07 remaining in the game and later returned walking gingerly on her leg.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going to 14 straight Final Fours may sound repetitive and, to UConn women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma, there are certainly aspects of that.
“Coming in, I don’t think we’re the best team there.
I don’t think we can win even if we play our A game.
We need help — we need Stanford to not play their best game.
We need them to miss shots they normally make.”Stanford played far from its best game, but that was also a credit to UConn’s defense.

     Paige Bueckers’ UConn Tops Stanford, Advances To NCAA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Originally published on April 1, 2022MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Paige Bueckers scored 14 points and UConn advanced to the national championship game with a 63-58 win over defending champion Stanford on Friday night.
It’s UConn’s first trip to the championship game since 2016, when the Huskies won the last of four straight championships.
UConn (30-5) will be seeking its 12th national championship, and the Huskies have never lost in an NCAA title game.
Leading by 52-44 with 1:26 left, Stanford made a furious rally thanks to a few costly UConn turnovers.
UConn was able to work seven seconds off the clock before Christyn Williams was fouled with 11 seconds left.

     How seniors contributed to UConn women’s basketball Final Four win over Stanford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clinging to a one-point lead at halftime of the national semifinals Friday night, the UConn women’s basketball team needed help from its most seasoned players.
“I thought Liv and Christyn really struggled that whole first half,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said after a 63-58 victory over Stanford.
She converted a layup and hit a free throw early in the fourth quarter as UConn seized control.
She hit two foul shots in the final minutes as UConn sealed the win.
“You really can’t come here as a senior and hope that somebody else wins it for you,” Auriemma said.

     How UConn women’s basketball willed its way to Final Four win over Stanford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 7:35 left in the fourth quarter against Stanford, Olivia Nelson-Ododa stepped up to the line with the chance to give UConn a commanding eight-point lead.
The first free throw took a nearly direct route to the basket — a line drive that somehow went through the cylinder.
When the Huskies went up eight in the fourth quarter on Nelson-Ododa’s free throws, the Cardinal didn’t have the firepower to overcome the deficit in such a short timeframe.
All but nine of the Huskies’ points in the final 10 minutes came courtesy of free throws and it wasn’t all one player, either.
Still, all UConn needed to do was avoid a turnover and make its free throws and it’d be moving onto the championship.
