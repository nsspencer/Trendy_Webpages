    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Ricketts has issued a statement reassuring Chelsea supporters over his family's takeover bid for the club amid fan backlash.
The Ricketts family, along with hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, are heading up a bid for Chelsea and made the Club and Raine's shortlist of four of preferred bidders.
He said: "Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club.
"We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts Family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club.
"We look forward to more meetings - including with the Chelsea Supporters' Trust - over the coming days and to making a public reiteration of our values and commitments."

     Summary: A small number of Chelsea fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday to protest the Ricketts family bid.
The announcement comes on the same day a small group of fans staged a protest outside Stamford Bridge against the Ricketts bid ahead of Chelsea's clash with Brentford.
"At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family's bid for the club."
CST said they would survey their members again if the Ricketts family "publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns".
Outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a small number of Chelsea fans held "No to Ricketts" signs to demonstrate against the family's bid.

     Chelsea vs. Brentford: Christian Eriksen's remarkable comeback continues, powers Bees to blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a glorious day for the Bees and Christian Eriksen as they've seen off Chelsea by a remarkable 4-1 score.
Scoring in three straight for club and country, Eriksen has clawed Brentford back from the fringes of the relegation battle and now dealt Chelsea an embarassing blow.
Defeating Norwich, Burnley, and Chelsea is just what they needed to put daylight between them and a fight for relegation.
Brentford took that goal personally as they bounced back quickly as Bryan Mbeumo assisted both Vitaly Janelt and Eriksen scoring goals within four minutes to put them ahead 2-1.
It was a fully deserved victory for the bees in an open game where they took 17 shots despite Chelsea dominating possession.

     Chelsea vs Brentford: Player ratings, reaction and analysis as Eriksen, Janelt and Wissa stun Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea 1-4 Brentford (Rudiger ’48, Janelt ’50 ’60, Eriksen ’54, Wissa ’87)STAMFORD BRIDGE – Christian Eriksen scored his first goal in domestic football since his cardiac arrest as Brentford stunned Chelsea and took a major step towards Premier League survival with a 4-1 victory at Stamford Bridge.
Brentford netted four times in a remarkable second half after falling behind to a 35-yard strike from Antonio Rudiger, whose speculative efforts have become a running joke among Chelsea fans.
The same trick worked again, Mbuemo finding Eriksen unmarked in the box for his second goal in a week, the other scored on his emotional return to international duty with Denmark.
This was all Thomas Frank’s best-laid plans in action, Brentford no longer reduced to set pieces but doing what they do best.
The Bees survived a Chelsea fightback after conceding the third, Kai Havertz seeing a goal disallowed from close range for a clear handball.

     Eriksen among scorers as Brentford stuns Chelsea in 4-1 win | Charlotte Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brentford's Christian Eriksen scores his side's second goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Chelsea and Brentford, at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London, Saturday, April 2, 2022.
The Denmark international's latest goal was his first for Brentford in a stunning 4-1 win in the English Premier League on Saturday against a Chelsea team beset by unrelenting takeover talk.
Brentford is 11 points clear of the relegation zone after its best win since promotion.
Now, he's off the mark for Brentford, which has won all three games that Eriksen has started for the southwest London club.
Arsenal could trim the deficit to Chelsea to two points with a win at Crystal Palace on Monday.
