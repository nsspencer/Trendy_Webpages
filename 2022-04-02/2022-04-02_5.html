     Analysis of the Dolphins trading DeVante Parker to the Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins continued their active offseason on Saturday, as they traded wide receiver DeVante Parker and a 2022 fifth-round pick to the New England Patriots for a 2023 third-round pick.
At this point, the Dolphins have nine receivers on the roster, including Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Wilson Jr., Preston Williams, Trent Sherfield, River Cracraft, Lynn Bowden Jr., DeVonte Dedmon and Cody Core.
By the time the season starts, Miami will likely opt for five or six at the position.
By moving on from Parker, the Dolphins also get the benefit of saving some cap space, as they clear $3.34 million this season.
Parker ends his tenure with the Dolphins as one of the most productive receivers in team history.

     The DeVante Parker Trade from Different Angles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Evaluating the Miami Dolphins decision to trade wide receiver DeVante Parker to the New England PatriotsDeVante Parker's up-and-down career with the Miami Dolphins ended Saturday when the team agreed to trade him to the New England Patriots in a deal involving draft picks.
Along with Parker, the Dolphins gave New England a 2022 fifth-round selection and in return got a 2023 draft pick.
The first issue to address is the compensation, which immediately strikes us as being very light for a wide receiver of Parker's caliber.
During his seven seasons with the Dolphins, Parker averaged 48 catches and 675 per season — solid, if unspectacular, numbers, and he had 24 total touchdowns, nine of which came in 2019.
Trading within the AFC EastIdeally, teams don't trade within their division because of the risk of helping out their trade partner, and the Patriots conceivably got a big boost for their less-than-overwhelming wide receiver corps with this trade.

     Twitter has strong reactions to Patriots trading for DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots acquired Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker and a 2022 fifth-round pick in exchange for a 2023 third-round pick.
In doing so, the Patriots added another weapon to their wide receiver group.
With New England looking for a top wide receiver option, Parker could fill that void.
He was a key complementary weapon for the Miami Dolphins.
Now that the Dolphins have loaded up wide receiver with the addition of Tyreek Hill, Parker gets a chance to write a new story with New England.
