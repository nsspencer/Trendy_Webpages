What DeVante Parker brings to the table isn’t a plate of nothing, but what he does bring is risky.
However, if the Patriots traded that much for him, there must be something good about DeVante Parker, right?
the Chicago Bears don’t really have much to trade without digging into future commodities; and 2.)

     Analysis of the Dolphins trading DeVante Parker to the Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins continued their active offseason on Saturday, as they traded wide receiver DeVante Parker and a 2022 fifth-round pick to the New England Patriots for a 2023 third-round pick.
At this point, the Dolphins have nine receivers on the roster, including Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Wilson Jr., Preston Williams, Trent Sherfield, River Cracraft, Lynn Bowden Jr., DeVonte Dedmon and Cody Core.
By the time the season starts, Miami will likely opt for five or six at the position.
By moving on from Parker, the Dolphins also get the benefit of saving some cap space, as they clear $3.34 million this season.
Parker ends his tenure with the Dolphins as one of the most productive receivers in team history.

     Chelsea vs. Brentford: Christian Eriksen's remarkable comeback continues, powers Bees to blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a glorious day for the Bees and Christian Eriksen as they've seen off Chelsea by a remarkable 4-1 score.
Scoring in three straight for club and country, Eriksen has clawed Brentford back from the fringes of the relegation battle and now dealt Chelsea an embarassing blow.
Defeating Norwich, Burnley, and Chelsea is just what they needed to put daylight between them and a fight for relegation.
Brentford took that goal personally as they bounced back quickly as Bryan Mbeumo assisted both Vitaly Janelt and Eriksen scoring goals within four minutes to put them ahead 2-1.
It was a fully deserved victory for the bees in an open game where they took 17 shots despite Chelsea dominating possession.

     The DeVante Parker Trade from Different Angles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Evaluating the Miami Dolphins decision to trade wide receiver DeVante Parker to the New England PatriotsDeVante Parker's up-and-down career with the Miami Dolphins ended Saturday when the team agreed to trade him to the New England Patriots in a deal involving draft picks.
Along with Parker, the Dolphins gave New England a 2022 fifth-round selection and in return got a 2023 draft pick.
The first issue to address is the compensation, which immediately strikes us as being very light for a wide receiver of Parker's caliber.
During his seven seasons with the Dolphins, Parker averaged 48 catches and 675 per season — solid, if unspectacular, numbers, and he had 24 total touchdowns, nine of which came in 2019.
Trading within the AFC EastIdeally, teams don't trade within their division because of the risk of helping out their trade partner, and the Patriots conceivably got a big boost for their less-than-overwhelming wide receiver corps with this trade.

     Chelsea vs Brentford: Player ratings, reaction and analysis as Eriksen, Janelt and Wissa stun Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea 1-4 Brentford (Rudiger ’48, Janelt ’50 ’60, Eriksen ’54, Wissa ’87)STAMFORD BRIDGE – Christian Eriksen scored his first goal in domestic football since his cardiac arrest as Brentford stunned Chelsea and took a major step towards Premier League survival with a 4-1 victory at Stamford Bridge.
Brentford netted four times in a remarkable second half after falling behind to a 35-yard strike from Antonio Rudiger, whose speculative efforts have become a running joke among Chelsea fans.
The same trick worked again, Mbuemo finding Eriksen unmarked in the box for his second goal in a week, the other scored on his emotional return to international duty with Denmark.
This was all Thomas Frank’s best-laid plans in action, Brentford no longer reduced to set pieces but doing what they do best.
The Bees survived a Chelsea fightback after conceding the third, Kai Havertz seeing a goal disallowed from close range for a clear handball.

     Twitter has strong reactions to Patriots trading for DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots acquired Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker and a 2022 fifth-round pick in exchange for a 2023 third-round pick.
In doing so, the Patriots added another weapon to their wide receiver group.
With New England looking for a top wide receiver option, Parker could fill that void.
He was a key complementary weapon for the Miami Dolphins.
Now that the Dolphins have loaded up wide receiver with the addition of Tyreek Hill, Parker gets a chance to write a new story with New England.
