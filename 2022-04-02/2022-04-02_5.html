     Soccer-Brentford boss hails Eriksen fairytale after defeat of Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eriksen signed for Brentford in January after saying he would resume his playing career, despite collapsing on the pitch while playing for his country last June.
Some Chelsea fans applauded the Dane during the game, a rare tribute for a visiting player at Stamford Bridge.
“Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, and the world champions, in almost a complete performance, that’s a little bit unreal,” he said.
The feeling was shared by the visiting Brentford fans who celebrated one of the greatest results in the history of their club against their more illustrious west London neighbours.
You’re having a laugh!” the Bees’ fans sang as they taunted the Stamford Bridge faithful after their first win over Chelsea in any competition since 1939.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - A goal for Christian Eriksen, two from Vitaly Janelt and a late addition from Yoane Wissa earned Brentford a shock 4-1 comeback victory over west London neighbours Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.

Substitute Wissa put the icing on the cake in the 87th minute, condemning a lacklustre Chelsea to their first home defeat since September.
It was the first victory for promoted Brentford over Chelsea since 1939.
Chelsea, who had not lost in the Premier League since mid-January, remain third in the table but lost ground on leaders Manchester City and Liverpool who both won on Saturday.

     New twist in Chelsea bidding war as billionaire joins Ricketts family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race to buy Chelsea has taken another twist after it emerged that the Ricketts family have been joined in their bid by the Rock Entertainment Group, headed by Dan Gilbert who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.5bn).
The Ricketts family had already partnered with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon, Ken Griffin, who is yet to disclose if he would take a controlling stake.
The confusion arose following suggestions in America that the Ricketts family would not have a controlling stake in the club, raising further questions about their controversial bid for Chelsea.
The news emerged in the wake of Chelsea’s shock 4-1 defeat to Brentford, before which supporters protested against the prospect of the Ricketts as owners.
After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, a pressing situation against the goalkeeper and another big chance from Kai Havertz.

     Summary: A small number of Chelsea fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday to protest the Ricketts family bid.
The announcement comes on the same day a small group of fans staged a protest outside Stamford Bridge against the Ricketts bid ahead of Chelsea's clash with Brentford.
"At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family's bid for the club."
CST said they would survey their members again if the Ricketts family "publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns".
Outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a small number of Chelsea fans held "No to Ricketts" signs to demonstrate against the family's bid.

IMAGO / ZUMA WireBut now it's been revealed by Sky News that Cleveland Cavalier owners the Rock Entertainment Group have joined forces with the Ricketts and Griffin.
The Ricketts family have come under heavy scrutiny following comments made by family members in the past, as well as their sporting issues with the Chicago Cubs.
IMAGO / SportimageHe said in a statement: "Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club.
"We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts Family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club.

"Again, it's more difficult for us than them to play as the underdog and be well prepared for this match.
"I did not see the distraction there so why should we be distracted and think about Real Madrid when we are one goal ahead.
"Maybe it was the general feeling that now we are ahead and have it, and we got punished for that."

     Sparse Crowd Protests Ricketts Family’s Chelsea Bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Well, it looks like their old panel at Cubs Convention and 2022 Opening Day aren’t the only things the Ricketts family can’t draw big crowds for.
“F— off the Ricketts, you’re not wanted here!” the crowd chanted.
Although I suppose there’s another connection between that fictional football club and the Cubs now that both will be carried by Apple TV+.
The Cubs will only appear twice in the first half of the platform’s exclusive Friday night doubleheader coverage, with both games coming on the road.
This little gathering probably isn’t enough on its own to tank the Ricketts family’s bid, which was strengthened recently by hiring a new investment bank, but it can’t help.

     Summary: What followed was a brutal exposure of the hosts' fragile state as Christian Eriksen, Mads Roerslev and Bryan Mbuemo orchestrated a historic 4-1 win for Brentford.
Yoane Wissa grabbed a fourth in the dying embers of the game to guide them to their first win since 1939 over their London neighbours -- just 5.5 miles lie between Stamford Bridge and Brentford's ground.
Chelsea's stunning loss to Brentford -- their first since 1939 -- left manager Thomas Tuchel at a loss for explanations on Saturday.
Fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday before the Brentford match to protest the potential takeover of the club by the Ricketts family.
Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, that was almost a complete performance.
