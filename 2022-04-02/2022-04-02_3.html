     Who is Chris Smalls? What to know about the Amazon labor union organizer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon workers in Staten Island, New York, voted to unionize this week, the first successful U.S. organizing effort among workers of the retail giant.
One of the most high-profile leaders of the effort is Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee who started the union.
Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, began speaking out in March 2020, when he was an Amazon employee.
After he was fired, Smalls formed the Amazon Labor Union, which is not backed by any national union organization.
In addition to firing Smalls, Amazon also had a strategy to smear him, according to leaked notes from an Amazon company meeting acquired by Vice News.

     Summary: A demonstrator during the vote count to unionize Amazon workers outside the National Labor Relations Board offices in New York, U.S., on Friday, April 1, 2022.
The fulfillment center doesn't flip to becoming a union shop overnight, and there's potentially a long road ahead.
Here's what happens next:Delays, challenges and negotiationsThe Amazon Labor Union didn't even exist until last year.
Jason Anthony, a member of Amazon Labor Union, speaks to members of the media during the vote count to unionize Amazon workers outside the National Labor Relations Board offices in New York, U.S., on Friday, April 1, 2022.
The company has already expressed its disappointment with the outcome and said it's considering its options, including "filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence" of the National Labor Relations Board.

     Lasting effects of Amazon union vote unknown but could point to change in labor movement, Washington experts say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About 55% of warehouse workers voted in favor of the independent Amazon Labor Union.
The vote, Washington experts said, fits into a theme of a labor market that has experienced significant change in the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Amazon union vote is one of the more significant labor events in the U.S. in recent years, as unionization has been relatively quiet the last 30 years.
But Forsyth said it’s too early to tell whether the Amazon vote means there is a resurgence of the labor movement.
Forsyth said there are short-term and long-term effects that could happen from the Amazon vote.

     How Amazon Employees Won Their First Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe effort was led by Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer, both of whom worked at the Staten Island Amazon fulfillment center.
As its reason for firing Smalls, Amazon said he violated social distancing rules.
He was creating a new union, the Amazon Labor Union, from scratch, and was raising money for the campaign through GoFundMe.
Amazon employees in Staten Island and elsewhere felt they were working harder and faster than ever, but weren’t sharing adequately in Amazon’s increased profits.
He wanted to show that he and his team of organizers—current and former Amazon workers—knew Amazon through and through, and that he and the other organizers knew what Amazon workers wanted.
