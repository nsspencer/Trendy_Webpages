     Soccer-Brentford boss hails Eriksen fairytale after defeat of Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eriksen signed for Brentford in January after saying he would resume his playing career, despite collapsing on the pitch while playing for his country last June.
Some Chelsea fans applauded the Dane during the game, a rare tribute for a visiting player at Stamford Bridge.
“Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, and the world champions, in almost a complete performance, that’s a little bit unreal,” he said.
The feeling was shared by the visiting Brentford fans who celebrated one of the greatest results in the history of their club against their more illustrious west London neighbours.
You’re having a laugh!” the Bees’ fans sang as they taunted the Stamford Bridge faithful after their first win over Chelsea in any competition since 1939.

     Brentford shock Chelsea 4-1 with Eriksen on target
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - A goal for Christian Eriksen, two from Vitaly Janelt and a late addition from Yoane Wissa earned Brentford a shock 4-1 comeback victory over west London neighbours Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.

Substitute Wissa put the icing on the cake in the 87th minute, condemning a lacklustre Chelsea to their first home defeat since September.
It was the first victory for promoted Brentford over Chelsea since 1939.
Chelsea, who had not lost in the Premier League since mid-January, remain third in the table but lost ground on leaders Manchester City and Liverpool who both won on Saturday.

     New twist in Chelsea bidding war as billionaire joins Ricketts family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race to buy Chelsea has taken another twist after it emerged that the Ricketts family have been joined in their bid by the Rock Entertainment Group, headed by Dan Gilbert who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.5bn).
The Ricketts family had already partnered with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon, Ken Griffin, who is yet to disclose if he would take a controlling stake.
The confusion arose following suggestions in America that the Ricketts family would not have a controlling stake in the club, raising further questions about their controversial bid for Chelsea.
The news emerged in the wake of Chelsea’s shock 4-1 defeat to Brentford, before which supporters protested against the prospect of the Ricketts as owners.
After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, a pressing situation against the goalkeeper and another big chance from Kai Havertz.

IMAGO / PA ImagesSpeaking in his post-match press conference after the game, Tuchel was asked what went wrong for his side, to which he claimed his team must remain patient when things don't end up going their way.
"We were working hard for the first goal and we know how hard it is against Brentford," he said, as quoted by football.london.
So we have to remain patient.
"We maybe felt a bit leggy but after 20/25 minutes we controlled the match and got better and better.

     Sparse Crowd Protests Ricketts Family’s Chelsea Bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Well, it looks like their old panel at Cubs Convention and 2022 Opening Day aren’t the only things the Ricketts family can’t draw big crowds for.
“F— off the Ricketts, you’re not wanted here!” the crowd chanted.
Although I suppose there’s another connection between that fictional football club and the Cubs now that both will be carried by Apple TV+.
The Cubs will only appear twice in the first half of the platform’s exclusive Friday night doubleheader coverage, with both games coming on the road.
This little gathering probably isn’t enough on its own to tank the Ricketts family’s bid, which was strengthened recently by hiring a new investment bank, but it can’t help.

     Summary: What followed was a brutal exposure of the hosts' fragile state as Christian Eriksen, Mads Roerslev and Bryan Mbuemo orchestrated a historic 4-1 win for Brentford.
Yoane Wissa grabbed a fourth in the dying embers of the game to guide them to their first win since 1939 over their London neighbours -- just 5.5 miles lie between Stamford Bridge and Brentford's ground.
Chelsea's stunning loss to Brentford -- their first since 1939 -- left manager Thomas Tuchel at a loss for explanations on Saturday.
Fans gathered outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday before the Brentford match to protest the potential takeover of the club by the Ricketts family.
Winning here at Stamford Bridge against the European champions, that was almost a complete performance.
