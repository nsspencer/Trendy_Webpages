     Man United vs Leicester live updates: Fred strike cancels out Iheanacho opener in Premier League game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's Champions League aspirations were dealt a huge blow after drawing 1-1 with Leicester at Old Trafford.
The Foxes took the lead in the 63rd minute after Kelechi Iheanacho produced a terrific diving header from James Maddison's perfectly-timed cross.
But the visitors were not ahead for long, as Fred cancelled out Iheanacho's strike just three minutes later.
The Brazilian was the quickest to react to Bruno Fernandes' parried shot and fired the rebound past Kasper Schmeichel.

     Liverpool go top thanks to perfect 10-game Premier League run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool (AFP) – Liverpool moved top of the Premier League for the first time this year as Diogo Jota's header and a late Fabinho penalty saw off Watford 2-0.
However, the hosts did not have the easy afternoon Klopp would have hoped for with tougher tests to come.
Liverpool needed the Brazilian goalkeeper to be at this best for a few seconds that decided the game midway through the first half.
Liverpool had to wait until a minute from time to get the two-goal cushion they desired when Kucka wrestled Jota to the ground from a corner.
Salah had already been subbed by Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.

     English Premier League weekend best bets

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following a two-week international break, the English Premier League is set to return this weekend.
So, before the Final Four tips off Saturday night, consider these two Premier League bets as a means of building the bankroll.
The Saints have conceded the third-most expected goals away from home this season, ahead of only Leeds and cellar-dwellers Norwich City.
Further, it hasn’t held a top-half opponent to fewer than two goals away from home this season.
In its last four fixtures against such sides, it has conceded at least one expected goal in all four.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Reds welcomed Watford to the fortress of Anfield and sent them home empty-handed after taking a 2-0 victory over their visitors.
A level of quietness fell over Anfield in the middle of the second half as Watford were keeping Liverpool attacks at bay and thwarting any attempt at a second goal for the Reds.
For most of the second half, it looked like the second goal would never come as the Reds progressively began playing sloppier and sloppier.
Then, Watford gifted Liverpool with a penalty kick via a rugby-style tackle in the box to Diogo Jota during a corner kick.
Manchester City face Burnley later on Saturday with a chance to retake the lead in the league, but, for now, Liverpool are at the top of the league.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (AFP) – Manchester City kept their cool under pressure on Saturday, cruising past Burnley 2-0 after Liverpool briefly replaced the long-time Premier League leaders at the top of the table.
Third-placed Chelsea remain on course for next season’s Champions League, but Manchester United’s hopes of a top-four finish are fading fast after a 1-1 draw at home to Leicester.
The two teams also meet in the FA Cup semi-finals later this month and both are involved in the Champions League quarter-finals in the coming week.
“The Premier League is the most important competition,” said Klopp, whose side have already won the League Cup this season.
But two goals from Vitaly Janelt and a first Premier League goal for Eriksen since his return to the English top-flight in a 10-minute spell turned the match on its head.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool, United Kingdom: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said winning the Premier League is his priority after the Reds went top of the table for the first time this year thanks to a 2-0 win over Watford.
Diogo Jota and Fabinho got the goals at Anfield as Klopp's men moved two points ahead of Manchester City, who travel to Burnley later on Saturday.
"The Premier League is the most important competition," said Klopp, whose side lifted the League Cup in February.
Mohamed Salah had already been subbed by Sadio Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.
Defeat leaves Watford still in the bottom three, still three points behind Everton, who also have three games in hand.

     Summary: Liverpool completed its 119-day mission to displace Manchester City from atop the English Premier League.
That meant City dropped out of first place for the first time since Dec. 4 — but not for long.
Liverpool and City have games in the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday before what could yet be a decisive meeting at City's Etihad Stadium five days later.
“I really appreciate the situation we are in," said Klopp, who has already led Liverpool to the League Cup title and the latter stages of the FA Cup and Champions League.
