     Summary: Report: Liverpool Could Make Huge Move For Serie A Star As Possible Mohamed Salah ReplacementLiverpool could make a huge move for a Serie A striker if Mohamed Salah leaves the club according to a report.
IMAGO / SportimageJournalist Niccolo Ceccarini has been speaking to Tuttomercatoweb (via Sport Witness) about Inter Milan and Liverpool linked striker Lautaro Martinez.
He believes the Argentine remains pivotal to the Serie A club’s plans but they may consider a sale if a huge offer is made.
“The Argentine striker remains central and fundamental in the Nerazzurri project, but in the face of a big offer, Inter will still make a reflection”.
Liverpool is a possibility, especially if Salah should leave at the end of this season.”Read More Liverpool CoverageFollow LFC Transfer Room: Twitter | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | TikTok

     Liverpool vs Watford result live updates: Fabinho wraps up win with Diogo Jota scoring as hosts go top of Premier League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool went top of the Premier League table for the first time since December after beating Watford 2-0 at Anfield.
The hosts didn't start the game as well as they would've liked and it was Watford who created the better chances in the early stages.
Liverpool went up the other end and took the lead just seconds later.
The second half started edgy, with Watford sitting back and looking to catch Liverpool on the counter-attack.
Jordan Henderson delivered a corner into the box and Jota was wrestled to the ground by Kucka.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool welcomed the intensity of their title race with Manchester City after recording a 10th consecutive Premier League win in a hard-fought contest against Watford.
To keep in the title race we have to win our football games, otherwise it will be really tricky.
The next Premier League game is a big one [against City next Sunday], we can’t hide from that, but before then we have an important Champions League game to prepare for at Benfica.
“The only better situation would be to be 20 points ahead of City but that’s not possible.
“Nobody saw it – the referee, Jürgen or me – not one Liverpool player complained, but the game is stopped and Liverpool are given the chance to win 2-0.

     Liverpool can rely on Diogo Jota as Mo Salah struggles to get over World Cup disappointment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four days earlier, Salah had watched his Anfield strike partner score the decisive spot kick as Senegal beat Egypt on penalties to win their World Cup playoff and qualify for Qatar.
Get instant accessKlopp confirmed before the Watford game that Mane asked Liverpool to cancel their traditional ceremony of congratulating players on qualifying for the World Cup out of respect for Salah.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesFor the second successive Premier League game, Salah failed to register a single shot on target and he did little to test Watford's defence.
Like Salah, Jota has also scored five goals in his past 11 games for Liverpool, but he is not playing with the same previous record as Salah.
But while Salah deals with the angst of missing out on AFCON glory and World Cup qualification, Liverpool can rely on Jota.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As they are for every home game, the Liverpool players were welcomed to Anfield with cheers and applause.
Now, the Daily Mirror report that a new contract for Salah is on the verge of being signed, with Salah having performed a U-turn on his contract demands.
A mural outside Anfield might cement the idea that he is loved at Liverpool, but that has always been true.
If Salah really is set to sign a new deal that could keep him at Liverpool for another four years, then that was always the sensible solution.
After all, it would have been a shame had the Liverpool team bus had to pass that mural every home game with the man it depicted no longer on board.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool (AFP) – Liverpool moved top of the Premier League for the first time this year as Diogo Jota's header and a late Fabinho penalty saw off Watford 2-0.
However, the hosts did not have the easy afternoon Klopp would have hoped for with tougher tests to come.
Liverpool needed the Brazilian goalkeeper to be at this best for a few seconds that decided the game midway through the first half.
Liverpool had to wait until a minute from time to get the two-goal cushion they desired when Kucka wrestled Jota to the ground from a corner.
Salah had already been subbed by Mane at that stage so Fabinho took responsibility from the spot and smashed into the top corner to secure Liverpool's 10th consecutive Premier League win.
