     House Passes Bill to Legalize Marijuana. What That Means for Cannabis Stocks.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House of Representatives voted to decriminalize marijuana on Friday.
Cannabis stocks wavered.
The House bill, called the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or MORE Act, would remove marijuana from the list of scheduled substances and establish a process to expunge prior cannabis convictions.
It also will impose a federal tax on marijuana products—a 5% excise tax for the first two years, increasing by 1% incrementally each year in the next three years.

     House passes landmark marijuana legalization bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The House passed legislation Friday that would legalize marijuana nationwide, eliminating criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, distributes or possesses the substance.
The legislation, dubbed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, passed in the House last year, but did not move forward in the Senate.
In addition to decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level, the bill would establish procedures for expunging previous convictions from people's records and impose a tax on the sale of cannabis products.
It would also provide loans to help small businesses in the cannabis industry that are "owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals," a summary of the bill said.
"This landmark legislation is one of the most important criminal justice reform bills in recent history," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in remarks on the floor Thursday about the measure.

     House Votes to Decriminalize Cannabis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The House passed legislation on Friday to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, as Democrats and three Republicans banded together to capitalize on the political resonance of legalized cannabis as an issue of economic growth, racial justice and states’ rights.
The Democrats’ bill would remove marijuana from the federal government’s list of controlled substances, impose an 8 percent tax on cannabis products, allow some convictions on cannabis charges to be expunged and press for sentencing reviews at the federal and state levels.
It would also make Small Business Administration loans and services available to cannabis businesses while setting standards for them.
The Republicans voting for the measure were Representatives Matt Gaetz and Brian Mast of Florida and Tom McClintock of California.
(Two Democrats, Representatives Henry Cuellar of Texas and Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, voted against the legislation on Friday.)

     Dems advance landmark marijuana legalization bill in House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As regular readers may recall, it was in December 2020 when the Democratic-led House approved legislation to decriminalize cannabis and clear the way to erase nonviolent federal marijuana convictions.
The bill was ignored in the Republican-led Senate, but it was a historic breakthrough: This was the first time either chamber had ever even tried to pass such a bill.
This morning, as NBC News reported, an updated version of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) also passed the House.
The House passed legislation Friday that would legalize marijuana nationwide, eliminating criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, distributes or possesses the substance....
The fact that the House has now passed this bill twice, and Senate Democratic leaders are now championing such legislation, helps change the conversation and lays the groundwork for future progress.

     House passes marijuana legalization bill (again), but with no clear path forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite growing support among GOP lawmakers for legalization and polling that shows two-thirds of Americans back that stance, just three Republicans voted for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act.
“This is a major criminal justice reform bill,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), one of the co-chairs of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus.
The Senate — where Schumer, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), are working on their own comprehensive cannabis bill — is even tougher ground for weed.
Dems come aroundDespite declining GOP support for the MORE Act, Democrats’ nerves on cannabis legislation have calmed.
In fact, six Democrats voted against the bill in 2020, but only two voted against the MORE Act on Friday.

     House Passes Bill To Legalize Marijuana And Remove Penalties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. House of Representative passed a bill today to federally legalize marijuana.
The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, known as the MORE Act, will decriminalize marijuana, remove marijuana from the list of scheduled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, and eliminate criminal penalties for an individual who manufactures, distributes, or possesses marijuana.
The MORE Act said legalizing cannabis is an issue of economic growth, social equity, racial justice, and states’ rights.
The House passed a similar bill in 2020, but did not garner support in a Republican controlled Senate.
"This bill reverses decades of failed federal policies based on the criminalization of marijuana by legalizing marijuana, retroactively expunging previous convictions, and more," said Nadler.
