     Jen Psaki is said to be in talks to join MSNBC.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, is in advanced talks with MSNBC to join the network after she leaves the Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
Ms. Psaki could leave the White House as soon as next month, one of the people said.
Ms. Psaki could also make regular appearances on other MSNBC shows as well as on NBC News, the people said.
But it‚Äôs unusual for a White House press secretary to be linked to a news organization before formally leaving their government post.
And Ms. Psaki, if she joined MSNBC, would be the network‚Äôs second major hire this year from the Biden administration; Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äôs former spokeswoman, Symone D. Sanders, is set to host a show for MSNBC and Peacock.

     Summary: Jen Psaki Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe White House‚Äìto‚ÄìTV-pundit pipeline appears to be in good working order with yet another senior official reportedly leaving her position to become a talking head on MSNBC.
This time around, it‚Äôs press secretary Jen Psaki, according to CNN‚Äôs two unnamed sources.
Still, Axios says that Psaki has informed certain high-level staffers, if not the White House press team, which (it stands to reason) may be finding out in real time.
Again, that‚Äôs not confirmed, though CNN notes that Psaki is currently expected to depart on April 30, after the White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner.
