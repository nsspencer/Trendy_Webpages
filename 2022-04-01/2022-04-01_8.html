     Oscars Producer Did Not Want Will Smith Physically Removed After Slap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “He didn’t tell one of the planned jokes,” he said of Mr. Rock.
Someone close to Mr. Rock who asked to speak anonymously because the Academy’s inquiry into the incident is ongoing said that Mr. Rock was never asked directly if he wanted Mr. Smith removed.
“I just took a punch from Muhammad Ali,” Mr. Packer recalled Mr. Rock telling him.
Mr. Packer said that Mr. Smith reached out and apologized to him the morning after the Oscars.
“I’ve never felt so immediately devastated,” Mr. Packer said of the incident.

     Oscars producer Will Packer: Will Smith thought speech would make slap ‘better’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oscars producer Will Packer defended the standing ovation Will Smith received for his Best Actor win and said the actor aimed to make the tense situation “better” with his acceptance speech.
“I don’t think that they were people applauding anything about that moment.
“All these people saw their friend at his absolute worst moment and were hoping they could encourage him and lift him up and he would somehow make it better,” Packer said.
Despite thinking Smith’s on-stage apology made the situation “truly better,” he admitted that the slap ruined the night.
Rock, 57, declined to press charges against Smith after the incident, which the Academy condemned as part of its review.

     Oscar Producer Will Packer Did Not Want Will Smith Physically Removed From Ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Packer, the lead producer for the 2022 Oscars ceremony, did not want Will Smith removed from the ceremony after he slapped Chris Rock.
“He was like, ‘No, no, no.’”Packer says his associate producer, Shayla Cowan, informed him that there were plans in motion from the Academy to remove Smith from the premises.
According to Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr., “reliable sources” say that Rock was never actually asked if he wanted Smith to be removed from the ceremony.
“We’re told that Packer is conflating this from a conversation that happened after Smith slapped him onstage, where Rock told Packer he did not want to press charges,” writes Fleming.
“Had he chosen to do that, the LAPD would have removed Smith and arrested him.”Fleming continues: “Had Packer asked Rock if he wanted Smith removed from the building, he might have gotten a different answer….

     Summary: Oscars 2022 producer Will Packer is opening up about what happened behind the scenes on Hollywood’s biggest night, after actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage.
But I tell you, if there's anybody that you don't worry about going out in front of a live audience and riffing off the cuff, [it's] Chris Rock.
But when Rock walked off stage, the producer was able to ask Rock directly about what had transpired.
"I was in the room and I know a lot of those people, and so it wasn't like this was somebody they didn't know," Packer said.
Meanwhile, Packer is still praising Rock for handling the moment how he did, especially as the energy in the room died down.

But as Smith – angered by a joke Rock told about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith – yelled obscenities from the audience before he walked on stage to confront Rock, Packer realized it was real.
Packer was told Smith was about to be physically removed, and he went to Academy leaders on site and told them Rock didn’t want that to happen, the producer told “GMA” on Friday.
“And he looked at me, and he goes ‘Yeah.’ He goes, ‘I just took a punch from Muhammad Ali,’ as only Chris Rock can.
