     Summary: It’s a tossup right now between Chicago Bulls analyst Stacey King and Charlotte Hornets play-by-play voice Eric Collins as to which announcer brings more energy to the broadcast.

     Summary: After stringing together by far his best performance of the season, Patrick Williams had a confession.
While speaking with reporters after the team’s 135-130 overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers, Williams said he was late for the team’s morning routine.
“I’m not sure if you guys know, but I was also late to shoot around this morning,” Williams shockingly admitted.
At this point in the season, we can’t afford to have guys late to shoot around, things like that.
I can only speak for myself, but Williams’ tardiness doesn’t change any of my thoughts about his devotion or character.
