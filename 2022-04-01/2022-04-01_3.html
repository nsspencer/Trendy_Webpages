     76ers Players Are Turning On Coach Doc Rivers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia 76ers acquired James Harden at the NBA Trade Deadline with one clear objective in mind: competing for a championship.
Worse yet, head coach Doc Rivers and Harden seem to be on completely different pages.
“The Sixers are in L.A. last week, I’m out and about getting dinner […] and I run into somebody who’s close to the team.
Maybe that’s hyperbole, maybe you’re having a bad week, I’m not even thinking about it.
But should the Sixers come up short this year, don’t be surprised if either Rivers or Harden finds himself on the hot seat come this summer.

     Will Smith Resigns From Academy After Slapping Chris Rock at Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We have received and accepted Mr. Will Smith’s immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,” David Rubin, its president, said in a statement.
“We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy’s Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18.”Now that he has resigned, Mr. Smith will no longer have access to academy screenings and events.
However, he could still be nominated for an award, since being a member is not a requirement for eligibility.
Mr. Smith’s resignation came roughly 12 hours after Will Packer, the lead producer of the Oscars telecast, spoke publicly about the episode for the first time.
In an interview with “Good Morning America” on ABC, the network which also broadcasts the Oscars, Mr. Packer said that after Mr. Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony, he urged the Academy leadership not to “physically remove” him from the theater in the middle of the live broadcast.
