     76ers Players Are Turning On Coach Doc Rivers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia 76ers acquired James Harden at the NBA Trade Deadline with one clear objective in mind: competing for a championship.
Worse yet, head coach Doc Rivers and Harden seem to be on completely different pages.
“The Sixers are in L.A. last week, I’m out and about getting dinner […] and I run into somebody who’s close to the team.
Maybe that’s hyperbole, maybe you’re having a bad week, I’m not even thinking about it.
But should the Sixers come up short this year, don’t be surprised if either Rivers or Harden finds himself on the hot seat come this summer.

     Summary: Did Doc Rivers just throw James Harden under the bus?
The 76ers suffered a brutal 102-94 road loss to the lowly Pistons Thursday, scoring only 15 points in the fourth quarter and blowing a late lead.
Immediately after, many assumed Rivers was ripping Harden, who admittedly struggled in Thursday’s loss.

In comparison, the Detroit bench took 27 shots (hitting an impressive 59 percent).

Against the Pistons, the Sixers’ bench scored 8 points, shooting 3-12 from the field.
In the end, the 76ers’ bench was outscored 39-8 and just added to the embarrassing performance overall as a team.

Cade Cunningham out-duels MVP candidate Joel Embiid in leading the league-worst Pistons to a win over the 76ers.

     Doc Rivers Doesn't Put Much Blame on Sixers' Bench for Struggles vs. Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps the most significant issue of all is the Sixers' bench unit.
With just one shot taken by Danny Green, the bench unit totally failed to make an early impact.
With three more shots taken, the bench unit wrapped up the first half with zero of Philadelphia's 54 points.
In total, the Sixers' bench finished the night with eight points.
Doc Doesn't Blame Them "They didn't struggle," said Rivers after Thursday's game, regarding the bench.

They won all three matchups against Cleveland, and Embiid averaged 32.3 points on 56.4% shooting from the floor.
But if they can stay afloat for these final games, Cleveland is by far the most optimal opponent come the postseason.
