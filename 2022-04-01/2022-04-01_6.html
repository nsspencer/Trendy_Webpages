     Dodgers acquire closer Craig Kimbrel from White Sox, deal outfielder A.J. Pollock to Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a bold move that disrupts the chemistry of a 106-win team while limiting the flexibility of its bullpen, the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired closer Craig Kimbrel on Friday in exchange for outfielder A.J.
Pollock in a deal for two players entering the final years of their contracts.
The deal brought resolution to two of the game's more unsettled scenarios as spring training enters its final days.
Now, with the Dodgers moving on from longtime closer Kenley Jansen, the ninth inning once again figures to be Kimbrel's.
That's almost identical to Pollock, who in 2021 will finish a four-year, $55 million deal.

     Dodgers bolster bullpen by adding Craig Kimbrel from White Sox for A.J. Pollock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the World Series champion Braves landed former Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen last week, a huge hole was left in Los Angeles’ bullpen.
Pollock to the White Sox for Craig Kimbrel, per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
However, once with the White Sox the 33-year-old righty struggled.
The White Sox traded Craig Kimbrel to the Dodgers for A.J.
His acquisition should help the White Sox fill its void in right field after Adam Engel and Leury Garcia shared duties there last season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers pulled off a blockbuster trade Friday, acquiring All-Star reliever Craig Kimbrel from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for outfielder AJ Pollock.
Kimbrel is due $16 million this year, after the White Sox picked up a club option on his contract, and will be a free agent at the end of the season.
But then Kimbrel was traded to the White Sox before the deadline.
And in the Dodgers, the White Sox found a willing trade partner, filling a need of their own in the outfield by getting Pollock.

     Dodgers Trade AJ Pollock To White Sox For Craig Kimbrel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 11:11am: The Dodgers and White Sox are in agreement on a trade sending outfielder AJ Pollock to Chicago in exchange for reliever Craig Kimbrel, reports Mark Feinsand of MLB.com (Twitter link).
The Dodgers will also see their luxury ledger tick upward a bit as a result of the trade.
For much of the 2021 season, Kimbrel looked back to his vintage form.
The trade of Pollock also opens up playing time in the outfield for Chris Taylor, who’d previously been deemed the team’s primary second baseman.
Pollock, who turned 34 this offseason, will come to the White Sox fresh off a .297/.355/.536 showing in 117 games/422 plate appearances with the Dodgers this past season.
