     Summary: DOWNINGTOWN — A dedicated school community and committed Cultural Equity Task Force team are looking forward to the Autism Awareness &amp; Acceptance Month celebrations taking place across Downingtown Area School District (DASD) this April.
International autism awareness &amp; acceptance celebrations began in 2007, when the United Nations designated April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day.
Founded by the Autism Society, National Autism Awareness Month began in 1972.
Organizations world-wide have taken the idea of increased awareness and developed a month of community awareness and acceptance activities.
“Their tireless efforts and dedication to our students is unmatched and DASD is proud of their accomplishments.”While DASD schools continue to celebrate Autism Awareness &amp; Acceptance Month throughout April, there are numerous community activities scheduled within the greater Downingtown Area.

     Autism Awareness Month kicks off this weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April is Autism Awareness Month — and for most people, there’s a lot to learn.
An important element of that is making sure the community surrounding families managing autism is as well informed as possible, starting with understanding what autism is.
“The misconception is that when you say someone’s on the spectrum of autism that it’s all alike.
Reaching outClaros hopes that families beginning their journey with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis will reach out to ACT or join them for one of their many Autism Awareness Month events to begin accessing their network of support.
She hopes that as awareness increases, more business owners will look for ways they can open their doors to employees with autism.
