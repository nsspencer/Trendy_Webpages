     Anthony Davis, LeBron James Have Lofty Goal For Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite having both Anthony Davis and LeBron James at their disposal on Friday night, the Lakers dropped a crucial game at home to the Pelicans.
With five games remaining in the 2021-22 regular season, the Lakers’ postseason hopes are slipping away.
Following the loss to the Pelicans, Davis revealed the Lakers’ mindset heading into the final stretch of the regular season.
The Lakers’ remaining schedule consists of two games against the Nuggets, one against the Suns, one against the Warriors and one against the Thunder.
The Spurs, meanwhile, have upcoming games against the Trail Blazers, Timberwolves, Nuggets, Warriors and Mavericks.

     Lakers News: Anthony Davis Says Loss To Former Team Pelicans Was ‘Just Another Game’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers and the New Orleans Pelicans have developed a kind of rivalry since the Anthony Davis trade in 2019.
Pelicans fans often make it clear they disapproved of the circumstances of Davis’ departure known when he comes to town with the Lakers.
As luck would have it, the Lakers and the Pelicans have been directly involved in the race for Play-In Tournament qualification this season.
However, Davis claims his perception of the 2021-22 campaign won’t change even if his former team contributes to a potential lack of playoff basketball this year.
Davis returned onto the court in the loss to the Pelicans after a six-week break caused by a foot injury.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers finally got both LeBron James and Anthony Davis back on the floor together on Friday night in what many considered to be a must-win game for the squad.
Unfortunately for them, LeBron and AD’s return still wasn’t enough to save a hapless Lakers side as they still lost to the New Orleans Pelicans, 114-111.
— Michael Corvo (@michaelcorvoNBA) April 2, 2022This is barely the first time Davis was forced to sit out games due to injury.
— Michael Corvo (@michaelcorvoNBA) April 2, 2022Unfortunately, even if the Lakers actually win all five of their remaining games, this still won’t guarantee their place in the Play-In tournament.
The season is almost officially over for LeBron, AD, and the rest of the squad.
