     Summary: Predicting the location of a northern lights sighting is difficult on any given night, even in places like Norway where conditions are optimal.
“It is rare for aurora [borealis] to be visible in New York City,” Fried said.
Right now, there is a new moon, which makes conditions for seeing the aurora borealis more favorable.
All the bright city lights are a hindrance for sky gazing, and the weather for Friday evening isn’t completely favorable either.
”Chances are always low to spot the northern lights in our area because of light pollution, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from trying!”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articleA viral social media post left some Angelenos checking outside the window to see if gullible was written in the sky on April Fools.
This comes as a popular social media page, LosAngelesBucketList, put together an April Fools prank showing "northern lights" over the downtown Los Angeles skies.
However, if you paid attention to FOX 11's meteorologists or this week's forecasts on the National Weather Service, there is no such thing as a northern lights display in Southern California.
Elsewhere in the United States, other states were treated to northern lights sightings on Wednesday night.
RELATED: Strong solar storm could trigger Northern Lights as far south as IowaIn the meantime here in Southern California, we've got a weekend forecast highlighted by patchy fogs and highs of upper 60s for Saturday and Sunday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What to Know Social media posts have been circulating saying the northern lights, or the aurora borealis, will be visible in LA.
It's not true -- and in fact, it's an April Fools' Day prank.
You may have seen the stunning photos all over social media about the northern lights this week in parts of North America.
If you were excited to easily fulfill a bucket-list item -- seeing the lights Friday night over the southland -- sorry to burst your bubble, but it’s all but an April Fools' Day joke.
The strength of the coronal mass ejection of solar wind (scale KP 0-9) will determine how far south the northern lights are predicted to be visible.

Tonight, you might have a chance to see the northern lights in the U.S.
The University of Alaska Fairbanks' Geophysical Institute, which issues aurora forecasts, predicts a spectacular show in the night sky.
And for those in the southern half of the country who won't be able to catch the show live, you can tune into the University of Alaska Fairbanks' live stream here.
The predicted nighttime show follows a storm from earlier this week which gave a hint as to what stargazers may see tonight.

     Summary: WATERVILLE, Wash. — A pair of solar flares that combined to strike Earth Wednesday afternoon didn’t disappoint when it came to putting on a show of Northern Lights later that night.
The first solar flare left the sun late Monday morning, and a second flare erupted about 8 hours later.
The second flare overtook the first flare and their combined power made for a level 3 geomagnetic storm on their 5-level scale.
More aurora displays are possible this weekendIf you missed Wednesday’s shows, there may be renewed aurora displays over the next several days, as the sun continues to crackle with activity.
The sunspot that triggered the first two solar flares have sent out two even stronger flares on Wednesday and Thursday.

But, turns out this is actually true and is not an April Fool’s joke.
It’s a good idea to download a mobile app, like Northern Light Aurora Forecast, to get a better idea of the likelihood of seeing the Northern Lights in your area.
Is this an april fools joke or no?
— Peter Steinberg (@PeterSteinberg1) April 1, 2022So despite this being announced on March 31st (which was our first tip-off that it *wasn’t* an April Fool’s joke), it’s become a common Twitter joke that it is an April Fool’s joke because of an untimely NY Bucket List article— and we’re here to tell you, it is, in fact, real.

However, residents in upper Minnesota and Michigan, as well as in Alaska and Canada, could spot the breathtaking illumination Friday night, the planetarium said.
Aurora may be visible over the northern tier states if the conditions are favorable," the National Weather Service wrote on Wednesday.
Here's the southward extent of aurora for a Kp=7 storm, which is possible Wednesday night into Thursday morning.
Astronomy experts at Adler noted that light pollution would make it difficult to see the Northern Lights, even if the weather conditions were considered ideal.

     Summary: By Wendy Corr, Cowboy State DailyA rare sighting of the aurora borealis this week in Wyoming has stirred up some excitement for stargazers.
But if you missed the Northern lights Wednesday night, you may have another chance Friday or Saturday.
If those waves intersect with the earth’s orbit at just the right time, the ethereal waves of color known as aurora borealis appear.
In March 1989, a solar storm caused power failures in Canada.
As recently as February of this year, SpaceX lost more than 40 satellites due to a giant solar storm, impacting customers of the Starlink internet service.
