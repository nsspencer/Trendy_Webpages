     Bills Celebrate April Fools’ Day With Hilarious Fake Alternate Uniforms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bills announced that they were releasing, or rather… not releasing, a new absurd alternate city jersey ahead of the 2022 season.
If the Bills uniforms were real, it would have marked the first time in history that the franchise wore a black alternate jersey and any new wave of color beyond the team’s established colors of red, white and blue.
“Who doesn’t love a good chicken wing logo, it’s a win-win.”For Bills fans who were excited about seeing new uniforms next season, your wish will have to wait a little longer.
In the meantime, it might be worth getting a fresh order of chicken wings to celebrate April Fools’ Day.

     Phoenix Suns’ Mikal Bridges nears top of NBA’s DPOY betting odds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is no secret that Phoenix Suns forward Mikal Bridges is one of the best defenders in the NBA, but the betting odds currently have him with the third-best chance to steal the league’s Defensive Player of the Year title.
FanDuel Sportsbook gives Bridges +390 odds, just behind Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart at +135 and Miami Heat big man Bam Adebayo at +270.
The Suns have the second best defensive rating in the NBA at 106.6, only behind the Golden State Warriors’ mark of 106.1, according to NBA.com.
Bridges is normally assigned to the opposing team’s best player on a nightly basis and currently ranks third on the team in steals with 1.2 per game.
No Phoenix player has ever been given the award since its birth in the 1982-83 season.

     Summary: Funny, Bills.
In spirit of the hallmark holiday on Friday, April 1, better known as April Fools Days, the team teased a new uniform.
In the new look, the Bills uniform is very… chicken wing based.
The logo is a wing with some blue cheese.
Makes one kind of in the mood for wings, at least.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This provided fans with a Grizzlies starting lineup of De’Anthony Melton, Ziaire Williams, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, and Xavier Tillman— not exactly one that invokes fear in a fully healthy, NBA-leading Phoenix Suns team.
The Grizzlies were going up against a Phoenix Suns team that looked like they were at or pretty close to full strength.
So how were the Memphis Grizzlies able to fend off the Phoenix Suns in a game that should have been an easy win for Phoenix?
Here are the five reasons why Memphis upset Phoenix 122-114.

     Phoenix Suns resting Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Jae Crowder for Sunday's OKC game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OKLAHOMA CITY – Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams has racked his brain over and over about managing a team that's already clinched the No.
"I think it's just one of those deals where I've thought about it way too much," Williams said before Friday's loss at Memphis.
Williams revealed a big part of his plan heading into Sunday's game at Oklahoma City as he plans to sit All-Star guard Devin Booker, center Deandre Ayton and Jae Crowder.
The Grizzlies hauled in 16 offensive rebounds and 30 second-chance points while Phoenix managed just two offensive boards and two second-chance points.
"We were giving up a lot," Suns All-Star Chris Paul said after Friday's loss, as Phoenix surrendered 68 points in the paint.

How will the rest of the playoff field shake out and who will the Suns face in their 1st round series?
Fantable Questions of the WeekQ1 - The Suns have the #1 seed locked up but who they’ll play in the 1st round is still up in the air.
We are still the better team but they have Lebron James and he’s good enough where I’d say the Suns win in 6.
That could be a tough first round opponent as we saw in the WCF last season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies hosted the Phoenix Suns on Friday night without five of their top guys and still won their ninth straight home game 122-114.
This Memphis team has been resilient all year, truly embracing the next-man-up mentality.
Friday he was asked to step up once again, this time as a starter against the best team in the NBA.
This win may not mean much but it speaks to the culture in the Memphis Grizzlies organization that takes “next man up,” to a whole new level.
It’s an unbelievable achievement that this depleted roster went head to head with the best team in the league and came out with a convincing win.
