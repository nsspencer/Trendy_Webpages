     NY mobster who killed 3 escapes federal custody in Fla.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — A New York mobster who killed three people and attempted to kill two others has escaped from federal custody.
The Bureau of Prisons website says Dominic Taddeo escaped on March 28.
A federal judge in western New York denied Taddeo’s request for compassionate release last year.
Taddeo had been imprisoned at a medium-security lockup in Florida before being transferred to a residential halfway house in February.
A Bureau of Prisons spokesperson did not immediately return a call seeking information about Taddeo’s escape.

     Mafia hitman escapes from federal custody in Florida
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A New York mobster who killed three people and attempted to kill two others has escaped from federal custody after recently being moved to a halfway house, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
Dominic Taddeo, a hitman from a Rochester-area crime family, pleaded guilty in 1992 to racketeering charges that included the killings of three men during mob wars in the 1980s.
He escaped on 28 March, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.
The 64-year-old had been imprisoned at a medium-security lockup in Florida before being transferred to a residential halfway house, also in Florida, in February.
Taddeo failed to return from an authorized medical appointment and “was placed on escape status” on Monday, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson said.

     New York Mob Hit Man Escapes Custody With His Sentence Nearly Served
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those murders and attempts resulted in racketeering convictions, and a lengthy prison sentence.
In Western New York, that meant Buffalo, where the federal and local authorities battled the Magaddino crime family for decades.
Mr. Taddeo’s arrest was featured in an online history of the F.B.I.
And while Mr. Jenkins said Mr. Taddeo was a relatively small figure in the scope of the national mafia, he still described him as “one of the most vicious hit men of the Rochester family,” and one who may be difficult to find.
“I may be wrong, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gone for a long time.”This week’s escape was not even Mr. Taddeo’s first such unauthorized outing: After being freed on bail for other crimes in 1987, Mr. Taddeo went on the lam for two years, before once again being hauled in.

     New York mob hitman Dominic Taddeo, set to be released next year, escapes federal custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Dominic Taddeo -- a Rochester, New York, mobster who fatally shot three people and attempted to kill two others -- escaped federal custody this week, less than a year before he was set to be released.
Taddeo, 64, was transferred in February from a medium-security prison in Sumter County, Florida, to a halfway house near Orlando, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) spokesperson Scott Taylor.
He was scheduled to be there until his release in February 2023, according to court documents.
On Monday, March 28, Taddeo failed to return from an "authorized appointment" and was placed on escape status, Taylor said.
The United States Marshals Service told CNN it was aware of the escape and "has made the fugitive investigation a top priority," according to a spokesperson.

     Notorious Rochester mob hitman Dominic Taddeo escapes federal custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dominic Taddeo, a notorious local mob hitman who killed three people and failed in two other attempted homicides, has escaped from federal custody, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.
In 2020 Taddeo asked for a compassionate release, citing health issues and the coronavirus pandemic, but was refused by a judge.
"The RICO charges involve the murder of three individuals, attempted murder of two more individuals, and conspiracy to murder a fifth person," Geraci wrote.
Taddeo pleaded guilty in 1992 in federal court in Rochester to RICO crimes, and was sentenced to 54 years by the late U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca.
Oddly, Taddeo is best remembered locally not for his murders but for two failed assassination attempts on mob captain Thomas Marotta.
