     First day of Autism Awareness Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JONES COUNTY, N.C. (WITN) - April first marked the first day of Autism Awareness Month.
In 1972, the Autism Society launched the first national autistic children’s week that eventually turned into what is known as Autism Awareness Month.
People who have autism have different strengths and challenges.
“Sometimes it affects them in their communication, social skills, and sometimes educationally,” said Emma Andrews, a Jones County Exceptional Care teacher.
Autism Awareness Month is a time dedicated to educating the public about the disorder.

     Autism Acceptance Month is underway. Here's why the name is important
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April used to be known as Autism Awareness Month.
But in 2021, the designation changed to Autism Acceptance Month.
The Autism Society of America announced the suggested shift in terminology last year, urging the media to go along, in order to ignite change in the lives of those with autism and their families, said Christopher Banks, president and CEO of The Autism Society of America.
Knowledge about the condition, which about 1 in 44 U.S. children have been identified with, is still important and Saturday, April 2, is known as World Autism Awareness Day.
"Celebrating autism acceptance and inclusion rather than simply awareness can not only improve the well-being of your autistic employees."
