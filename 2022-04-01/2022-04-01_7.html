     Bella Thorne Swimsuit Photos: See the Actress Wearing Bikinis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former Disney Channel star has no problem showing off her toned tummy in a bikini, and we don’t blame her.
When it comes to bathing suits, Bella has some pretty epic ones.
From vibrant colors to high-fashion branded two-pieces — yes, we’re referencing her Dior bikinis — the actress shows off her style while at the beach or pool.
… I’m all about being yourself loving your body yada yada but these photos they make me not love anything about it.”The actress went on to share that she’s “also proud” of how far she’s come.
“And I feel good, but I do feel like I need to get back in the gym so I can be healthier in general.

     The Atlanta Falcons are the perfect team for Colin Kaepernick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan’s spring game was a reminder that one veteran option remains available to the Falcons, Colin Kaepernick.
Colin has 12,271-career passing yards, 71-passing touchdowns, 30 interceptions, 2,300-rushing yards, 13-rushing touchdowns, and a 28-30 career record.
In comparison, Mariota has 13,437-career passing yards, 77-passing touchdowns, 45-interceptions, 1,574-rushing yards, 13-rushing touchdowns, and a 29-32 record.
At worst Kaepernick is a huge upgrade over last year’s backup quarterback (Josh Rosen) and at best Atlanta finds a short-term answer at the position.
There is tape proving that Colin Kaepernick is a better option than any of these names and would give teams a legitimate backup or a bridge starter capable of winning games.
