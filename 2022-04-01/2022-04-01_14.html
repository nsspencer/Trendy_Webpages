     ‘The Bubble’ review: Judd Apatow’s satire of movie star antics and pandemic bubbles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I mean, if we’re talking about celebrities with an overinflated sense of their importance, it’s been an interesting few days in the wake of the now-infamous 94th Oscar Awards, and I’m not only referring to what occurred on stage between Chris Rock and Will Smith — The Joke followed by The Slap — but the many Hollywood types who felt the moment warranted, no demanded, their commentary.
Hilariously, Apatow himself was one of them, speculating in a since-deleted tweet that Smith’s open-palmed slap — one that momentarily saw Rock lose his composure but not his balance — “could have killed him” and … look, no matter where you fall on the events of that night, Apatow’s wild hyperbole is just the kind of absurd response we really should expect from people who are probably more out of touch with reality than we give them credit for.

     Judd Apatow-Directed Movies Ranked, From ‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin’ to ‘The Bubble’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Judd Apatow’s impact on modern comedy is immeasurable.
He began writing, directing and producing several cult TV comedy classics such as “The Ben Stiller Show,” “The Larry Sanders Show,” “Freaks and Geeks” and “Undeclared.” His feature work was more limited until the mid-aughts, when his directorial debut, “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” because a runaway hit and immediately popularized his shaggy, relaxed, improv-heavy and warmhearted film construction.
With that, Apatow became one of the most in-demand names behind the camera in Hollywood, directing eight more features and producing scores more.
He tackled the downsides of fame (“Funny People”), aging (“This Is 40”), parenting (“Knocked Up”), and told the personal stories of two white-hot comedians, Amy Schumer in “Trainwreck” and Pete Davidson in “The King of Staten Island.” Even though those stories were not autobiographical to him, he understood the complexity behind these comedic figures and allowed them to tell their tales in their own way.
Check out Variety‘s ranking of Apatow’s best work, limited to feature directing but including his documentaries.

     The Bubble movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Judd Apatow's "The Bubble," filmed at Shepperton Studios, satirizes this entire well-known event with a light-hearted attitude.
Dustin (David Duchovny) and Lauren (Leslie Mann) are a long-time married couple on their way to a divorce.
We see entire scenes from "Cliff Beasts," both being rehearsed and then filmed, and the movie looks terrible in an unbelievable way, almost like a "Waiting for Guffman" version of "Jurassic Park."
There's a lot of stuff about the murderous security team hired to keep the actors on site, and those sections don't really work.
Where "The Bubble" really shines is in its humorous reflection of that all-too-rare thing nowadays—a collective experience.

     'The Bubble' review: Judd Apatow's COVID comedy is an unfunny waste of time and talent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Somewhere between the hoax teaser for Cliff Beasts 6 and a genuinely enjoyable trailer, I convinced myself that The Bubble would be a good time.
One of them is Cliff Beasts 6, a new installment in a fictional franchise that would be way more fun to watch than this movie.
If The Bubble had centered on just one of these stories, it could have made for a more interesting movie.
Instead of interrogating the entitlement of the Cliff Beasts cast, The Bubble opts to linger on TikTok dances, underdeveloped relationships, and not one but two separate montages of the cast and crew languishing in quarantine.
You'd be better off watching Cliff Beasts 1-5.

     ‘The Bubble’ Netflix Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For a Judd Apatow comedy movie made about making a movie during the pandemic… the comedy seems in poor taste.
The Bubble is a Netflix original movie directed by Judd Apatow starring Karen Gillan and an ensemble of A-list actors, such as Keegan-Michael Key, Leslie Mann, David Duchovny, Pedro Pascal, and Samson Kayo.
In The Bubble, Karen Gillian plays Carol Cobb, an actress returning to the Cliff Beasts franchise that made her career.
The biggest antagonist of the movie seems to be the bubble itself.
Where ‘The Bubble’ then fails as a film then, is that honestly, nobody wanted a pandemic-themed parody as a form of entertainment right now.

     Review: How in the world did Judd Apatow’s ‘The Bubble’ go so horribly wrong?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Almost since the beginning of his big-screen career, there’s been a disconnect between the films that Judd Apatow just produces and those he also directs.
To suffer through this ordeal is not just to not laugh, it’s to wonder if you will ever laugh again.
It’s to find it hard to remember what laughter is, or how it used to feel to do it.
This manifests in “The Bubble” in the film-within-the-film, “Cliff Beasts 6,” which features a motley crew of idiots stumbling around a climate-charred forest atop Mt.
I promise you, there are more jokes in it than there are in “The Bubble.”

     The Bubble review: Judd Apatow and Netflix do embarrassing celeb satire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Judd Apatow’s Netflix action-comedy The Bubble is the film no one wanted about the COVID-19 pandemic: It’s instantly dated, frustratingly oblivious, and painfully unfunny.
The Bubble was reportedly inspired by the production of Jurassic World: Dominion, which filmed last year in the UK under strict COVID protocols.
But for filmmakers who pack this much sex and drugs into their movie, Apatow and Brady treat both with arm’s-length fridigity.
(Brady created Bamford’s critically beloved, short-lived Netflix series Lady Dynamite, which makes this film’s script all the more puzzling.)
Kris’ relatability doesn’t make the three full-length TikTok dance sequences in The Bubble pass by any more quickly, to be clear.

     The Bubble: Karen Gillan on Jurassic World Inspiration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix’s new pandemic comedy “The Bubble” may have been partially inspired by the struggles of filming “Jurassic World: Dominion,” but Karen Gillan didn’t actually ask Chris Pratt for any firsthand accounts from his time on set while they were filming.
At no point are “Jurassic World” or its stars ever directly mentioned, but the parallels are there.
That would have been good.”And though the “Jurassic” undertones are there, “The Bubble” is about the struggles Hollywood faced as a whole during the pandemic.
For Gillan, the hope is just that those who watch it on Netflix just go into it for a good time.
Tell me about a moment that was improvised in the film that made it in that you’re really happy with, or that made you laugh really hard.
