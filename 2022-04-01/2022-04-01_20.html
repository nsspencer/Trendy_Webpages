     Juror’s Error Did Not Affect Ghislaine Maxwell Verdict, Judge Rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “This strong issue, among many other issues, will be presented to the Court of Appeals and we are optimistic about Ms. Maxwell’s success on appeal.”Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, declined to comment.
Todd A. Spodek, the juror’s lawyer, said in a statement: “Juror 50 does not consider himself a victim and does not let his past define him.
But the odyssey continued even after the jury reached its verdict.
Hours before Judge Nathan’s ruling, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers wrote to the judge, asking that she delay her decision in light of what they called new information — yet another media interview with Juror 50, which was to be released on a streaming service.
Prosecutors objected to the request, and the judge denied it.

     Judge upholds Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking conviction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge has declined to throw out Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking conviction, despite a juror’s failure to disclose he’d been a victim of childhood sexual abuseNEW YORK -- A U.S. judge refused to throw out Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking conviction Friday, despite a juror’s failure to disclose before the trial began that he’d been a victim of childhood sexual abuse.
The juror had said he “skimmed way too fast” through the questionnaire and did not intentionally give the wrong answer to a question about sex abuse.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted of sex trafficking and other charges after a monthlong trial that featured testimony from four women who said she played a role in setting them up for abuse by Epstein.
Epstein killed himself in August 2019 as he awaited trial at a federal jail in New York on related sex trafficking charges.
“Only a new trial would.”But Nathan rejected that reasoning, writing that the juror's claims that he remained impartial toward Maxwell rang true.

     Summary: A judge denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a new trial, rejecting her claim of juror bias.
"In sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that Juror 50 was biased," U.S.
Circuit Judge Alison J. Nathan wrote Friday.
"His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate," the judge wrote.
Maxwell's sentencing is scheduled for June 28, the judge wrote Friday.

     Summary: "His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate," Nathan wrote.
"The court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror."
Maxwell's trial represented a reckoning that Epstein, a globetrotting investor who counted elite politicians and business leaders among his social companions, never had.
1/2 Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell sits as the guilty verdict in her sex abuse trial is read in a courtroom sketch in New York City, U.S., December 29, 2021.
Maxwell's lawyers said they would have struck the juror from the panel if he had answered honestly, and contended that his false statement denied Maxwell her right to a fair trial.

     Summary: Ghislaine Maxwell’s bid for a new trial has been denied, the judge in her Manhattan federal court sex-trafficking case said on Friday.
“The court finds Juror 50 testified credibly at the hearing,” Nathan wrote in a 40-page decision.
Following Maxwell’s trial, David gave interviews in which he discussed experiencing sexual abuse as a child.
The judge said that was not pertinent to weighing Maxwell’s push for a new trial.
“In sum, the court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support the finding that Juror 50 was biased.

     Federal judge denies Ghislaine Maxwell's bid for new trial over jury issue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The judge noted the bar for setting aside a guilty verdict is high and occurs "only in the most extraordinary of circumstances."
A copy of Juror 50's jury questionnaire showed he stated on the form that he had not been sexually abused.
Maxwell's lawyers argued she should be granted a new trial because of the juror's answers.
The trial, which took about a month late last year, alternated between disturbing testimony from sexual abuse victims and illuminating testimony about some of Epstein's connections to high-profile celebrities.
The jury of six women and six men deliberated for about 40 hours across parts of six days before the verdict.
