     Bills Celebrate April Fools’ Day With Hilarious Fake Alternate Uniforms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bills announced that they were releasing, or rather… not releasing, a new absurd alternate city jersey ahead of the 2022 season.
If the Bills uniforms were real, it would have marked the first time in history that the franchise wore a black alternate jersey and any new wave of color beyond the team’s established colors of red, white and blue.
“Who doesn’t love a good chicken wing logo, it’s a win-win.”For Bills fans who were excited about seeing new uniforms next season, your wish will have to wait a little longer.
In the meantime, it might be worth getting a fresh order of chicken wings to celebrate April Fools’ Day.

     Evina Westbrook leads UConn women’s basketball to halftime lead over Stanford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UConn senior guard Evina Westbrook was an inconsistent 3-point shooter this season — 29.7%, hitting just 35 of 118 attempts.
But Westbrook came off the bench in the first half of the national semifinals and provided a spark from the 3-point arc.
Westbrook converted 3 of 5 3-point attempts for a team-high nine points as UConn took a 27-26 lead into halftime.
Westbrook, who transferred to UConn from Tennessee, also had five rebounds and one assist in 15 minutes.

     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS — The South Carolina Gamecocks held the top spot in the Associated Press Top 25 women’s basketball poll all season about as tightly as they play defense every night.
TITLE GAME WHO: UConn vs. South Carolina WHEN: 8 p.m. Sunday TELEVISION: ESPNThe last test for the No.
Women’s college basketball gets the greats of the game together on the biggest stage as consistently as any sport, and this South Carolina-UConn matchup will be no different.
UConn has never lost in the NCAA final, sporting a staggering 11-0 record in national championship games.
South Carolina beat UConn in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas in November, pulling away from the Huskies in the fourth quarter with stifling defense.

     How UConn women’s basketball willed its way to Final Four win over Stanford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 7:35 left in the fourth quarter against Stanford, Olivia Nelson-Ododa stepped up to the line with the chance to give UConn a commanding eight-point lead.
The first free throw took a nearly direct route to the basket — a line drive that somehow went through the cylinder.
When the Huskies went up eight in the fourth quarter on Nelson-Ododa’s free throws, the Cardinal didn’t have the firepower to overcome the deficit in such a short timeframe.
All but nine of the Huskies’ points in the final 10 minutes came courtesy of free throws and it wasn’t all one player, either.
Still, all UConn needed to do was avoid a turnover and make its free throws and it’d be moving onto the championship.

I don’t think when we got on the plane to come out here, anybody in America thought we were the best team coming out here.
So that’s probably not the case this year, but you don’t have to be the best team for a long time.
