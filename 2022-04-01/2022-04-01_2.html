TITLE GAME WHO: UConn vs. South Carolina WHEN: 8 p.m. Sunday TELEVISION: ESPNThe last test for the No.
Women’s college basketball gets the greats of the game together on the biggest stage as consistently as any sport, and this South Carolina-UConn matchup will be no different.
UConn has never lost in the NCAA final, sporting a staggering 11-0 record in national championship games.
South Carolina beat UConn in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas in November, pulling away from the Huskies in the fourth quarter with stifling defense.

     How UConn women’s basketball willed its way to Final Four win over Stanford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 7:35 left in the fourth quarter against Stanford, Olivia Nelson-Ododa stepped up to the line with the chance to give UConn a commanding eight-point lead.
The first free throw took a nearly direct route to the basket — a line drive that somehow went through the cylinder.
When the Huskies went up eight in the fourth quarter on Nelson-Ododa’s free throws, the Cardinal didn’t have the firepower to overcome the deficit in such a short timeframe.
All but nine of the Huskies’ points in the final 10 minutes came courtesy of free throws and it wasn’t all one player, either.
Still, all UConn needed to do was avoid a turnover and make its free throws and it’d be moving onto the championship.

So that’s probably not the case this year, but you don’t have to be the best team for a long time.

     Summary: Stanford's Lacie Hull and UConn's Aaliyah Edwards go after a loose ball during the second half of the Women's Final Four NCAA tournament semifinal Friday in Minneapolis.
CNN —UConn will play South Carolina in the NCAA women’s basketball championship game after defeating the defending national champion Stanford on Friday night in the Final Four.
It was the first time in women’s NCAA tournament history a game in the Elite Eight or beyond needed double overtime.
Before Friday night, the team had allowed just 41.2 points per game in this NCAA tournament, according to Gamecocksonline.com.
South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley has led the team to three NCAA Final Fours in the last six tournaments before Friday – and a national championship in 2017.
