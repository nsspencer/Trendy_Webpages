     Doc Rivers criticizes James Harden after loss; is there trouble ahead for 76ers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday night, James Harden got a very public taste of the brutally honest hot takes of his current coach Doc Rivers.
Following Harden’s trade from the Brooklyn Nets to the Philadelphia 76ers, the superstar combo of Joel Embiid and James Harden got off to a pretty fast start.
The setback was the team's third straight loss, and Harden did not have an impressive showing.
While he had a near triple-double with 18 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, he was 4-of-15 from the floor in 38 minutes.

     Summary: Did Doc Rivers just throw James Harden under the bus?
The 76ers suffered a brutal 102-94 road loss to the lowly Pistons Thursday, scoring only 15 points in the fourth quarter and blowing a late lead.
Immediately after, many assumed Rivers was ripping Harden, who admittedly struggled in Thursday’s loss.

In comparison, the Detroit bench took 27 shots (hitting an impressive 59 percent).

     Sixers Fall Apart in Detroit vs. Pistons for Third-Straight Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the rebuilding Detroit Pistons on the schedule for Thursday night, many figured the Sixers should’ve had an easy opportunity to climb out of their mini-slump.
Considering the Pistons are 20-56 on the year, ranking second-to-last in the Eastern Conference, the Sixers were heavily favored.
As the All-Star big man continues to stay healthy, he also continues to dominate night in and night out for the Sixers.
After getting up 17 shots, Detroit knocked down 64-percent of their field goals and went 5-10 from three.
With that loss, the Sixers pick up their 30th defeat of the year and fall into a three-game slump.

2) Chicago BullsAfter being one of the hottest teams in the opening months of the season, the Chicago Bulls have flamed out of late.
They won all three matchups against Cleveland, and Embiid averaged 32.3 points on 56.4% shooting from the floor.
But if they can stay afloat for these final games, Cleveland is by far the most optimal opponent come the postseason.
