     Ramadan 2022: What to know about the month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The evening of April 1 marks the beginning of Ramadan, the ninth month on the Islamic holy calendar, which is observed by Muslims around the world as a month of prayer, fasting and community.
So, what are some traditions observed by Muslims during Ramadan and why, and how long does the holy month last?
The Islamic holy month revolves around the crescent moon, beginning Friday with the "Ramadan" moon, signifying the end of the Islamic month of Shaban and the beginning of the Ramadan month.
Eid al-Fitr will mark the end of the holy month, beginning the evening of May 1 and lasting for three days.
It commemorates the end of the fasting month and is celebrated through prayer, gifts, family visits and acts of charity.

     In New Orleans, the Final Four Is a Reason for a Much-Needed Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Follow our live coverage of the men’s Final Four.
NEW ORLEANS — When he wrote about relying on the kindness of strangers, this city’s most famous playwright probably wasn’t envisioning Carolinians and conventioneers slurping down the dark roux gumbo at Herbsaint.
But then even Tennessee Williams may not have been able to conjure the blows that his adopted New Orleans has suffered over the last two years — and the welcome arrival of this better-than-fiction Final Four and the strangers it’s bringing to town.
Rarely in sports history has there been a convergence of a contest with the hype of the Duke-North Carolina showdown on Saturday, and a host city so desperately in need of the game-of-the-century buzz, and revenue, that comes with it.
Ever since Joe Burrow led Louisiana State to the college football title in the Superdome in January 2020 and Louisianans celebrated Mardi Gras a month later — back-to-back civic high holidays for this state — New Orleans has been plunged into a dark winter.
