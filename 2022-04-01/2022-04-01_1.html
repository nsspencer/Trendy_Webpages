     Air guitar lessons, steak-scented deodorant and a job as a cat herder – all part of April Fools' Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Air guitar lessons?
It's all part of April Fools' Day, when companies and big name brands attempt to outduel each other for the funniest fake product announcements.
Companies pretty much took a pass on April Fools' Day in 2020 with the COVID-19 shutdown sinking in.
“It might be April Fools’ Day, but delivering value and flavor is no laughing matter,” the company said in a statement.
If you visit the Guitar Center website, there's a new laughable learning opportunity: finetuning your air guitar skills.

     Summary: For most people April Fools’ Day is either a bright spot in grim times, or a tedious parade of poor jokes we could all do without, with nothing in between.
Pasta Evangelists claimed to be adding to their delivery range a mash-up featuring the nation’s favourite Sunday meal to produce Sunday roast spaghetti.
A delicious-looking bowl of Sunday roast spaghetti.
Photograph: Pasta EvangelistsThe rising cost of living in the UK has driven some people not to refer to Friday as April Fools’ Day but rather Bleak Friday.
They will no doubt be delighted that Mash Direct has very definitely called its new product an Easter egg.

     Fury As Beer Company's April Fools Prank Backfires Spectacularly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: People took to Twitter to share their anger after receiving April Fools messages from beer subscription site Bier Company that said they were "this month's winner of free beer for life."
Many customers also received text messages from the company informing them that they had won "free beer for life."
The promotional code sent out by Bier Company read "SLOOFLIRPA," which spells April Fools backwards.
Upon discovering they had been signed up to a monthly subscription, people took to the internet to express their upset.
After the backlash, Bier Company released an official statement on Twitter addressing the April Fools joke.
