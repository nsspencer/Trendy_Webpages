When it was good, the Clippers countered by splashing in difficult shots.
And for much of the game, just like in much of their post-All-Star slate, the Bulls couldn‚Äôt sink enough baskets to keep up.After the Clippers took a 9-8 lead, the Bulls trailed for the final 46 minutes of regulation.
They stared down a double-digit deficit for long stretches within.
Seconds before George fouled DeRozan, who made two of three foul shots to force overtime, Clippers guard Terance Mann had fouled DeRozan on an inbounds play before the ball was thrown in.
