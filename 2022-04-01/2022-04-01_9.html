     Summary: From Tom Brady‚Äôs ‚Äúun-retirement‚Äù to Todd Bowles‚Äôs promotion following Bruce Arians‚Äôs move to the front office, Tampa Bay has been a hotbed for jaw-dropping headlines.
The ‚Äúreported signing‚Äù of Julian Edelman, however, does not fall under that category.
The former Patriots receiver, who has been retired since last April, posted a rather believable graphic announcing the move Friday.
Sorry, Bucs fans.
After Friday‚Äôs prank, however, Bucs fans would probably appreciate less fake news in favor of an actual update on Rob Gronkowski, who remains undecided on playing in 2022.

     Summary: by Mckenzie KapsimalisAn ideal Patriots 2022 NFL Draft would look like thisAn ideal Patriots 2022 NFL Draft would look like this by Michael DeVitoNew England Patriots fans have long feared that Tom Brady would recruit former Patriots players to join him on the Tamp Bay Buccaneers.
It remains to be seen if Brady is recruiting other former Patriots to Tampa, but the retired Julian Edelman gave fans a huge scare on April Fools‚Äô Day by announcing he signed with the Buccaneers.

We seriously hope Patriots fans checked Friday‚Äôs date before they overreacted to Edelman‚Äôs tweet.
