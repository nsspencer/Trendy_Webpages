     Jen Psaki plans to depart White House for MSNBC in coming weeks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) White House press secretary Jen Psaki plans on departing the Biden administration in the coming weeks and heading to MSNBC, two people familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.
Psaki has not officially signed a contract with the progressive cable news network, but the talks are in the advanced stages, the people said.
Axios , which first broke the news, reported that Psaki will host a show for NBC's streaming platform Peacock.
A White House official declined to confirm Psaki's future plans.
But the official said, "Jen is here and working hard every day on behalf of the President to get you the answers to the questions that you have, and that's where her focus is."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jen Psaki is reportedly preparing to quit as Joe Biden’s White House press secretary to become a TV host at MSNBC.
Karine Jean-Pierre, the deputy White House press secretary, and Kate Bedingfield, the communications director, were among names touted as possible successors.
After four chaotic years under Trump, Psaki returned White House press briefings to something like normal order.
Trump’s fourth and last White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, now works for Fox News.
Women, certainly, but beyond that.”If she succeeds Psaki in the role, Jean-Pierre would become the first Black person to be White House press secretary.
