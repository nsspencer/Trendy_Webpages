     Jen Psaki plans to leave White House in May
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON: White House press secretary Jen Psaki plans to step down next month, according to media reports.
She will also be part of MSNBC's live programming, but will not replace host Rachel Maddow in the 9 p.m. house slot.
No contracts have been signed yet as Psaki reportedly consults with the White House counsel's office and adheres to government ethics rules about public employees pursuing private sector careers.
Psaki has told some senior officials about her departure, but has yet to formally tell the White House press team, according to sources familiar with the matter.
It had been rumored that Psaki would leave the White House for a gig in television—a common occurrence for White House communications pros—and it was reported in February that she had also been in talks with CNN.

     Jen Psaki leaving the White House for MSNBC this spring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House press secretary Jen Psaki will leave her job this spring and join MSNBC as a pundit and host of her own show on the streaming service Peacock, a person with direct knowledge has confirmed to NPR.
"We don't have anything to confirm about Jen's length of planned service or any consideration about future plans," a White House official said.
Psaki served in the Obama administration as White House communications director and as State Department spokesperson.
It is not unusual for White House communications staff to parlay their White House jobs into lucrative television contracts.
George Stephanopoulos, White House communications director under Bill Clinton, hosts ABC's Good Morning America and This Week.

     White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in Talks to Join MSNBC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki is in advanced talks to leave the Biden administration and join MSNBC, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
Psaki is expected to depart the White House later this spring, perhaps as early as next month.
Axios first reported Psaki’s MSNBC deal, noting that she was working with White House lawyers to make sure the talks with MSNBC didn’t violate ethics rules.
“You can’t get rid of me quite yet,” she quipped when asked in the briefing room at the end of February whether she had plans to leave the White House.
White House press officials have long shuttled between the briefing room and paid roles for TV news channels.
