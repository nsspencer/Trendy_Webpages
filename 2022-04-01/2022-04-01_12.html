     Will Packer: I wasn’t part of conversations asking Will Smith to leave Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oscars producer Will Packer said Friday he had not “been part of” any conversations asking Will Smith to leave the ceremony after the actor slapped Chris Rock.
Smith apologized to Packer the following morning for ruining the producer’s “gigantic moment” and expressed his “embarrassment,” which the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” alum also did in a public apology to Rock.
It was up to the Academy to tell Will to leave, that’s their job.
Chris just wanted to get out of there.”Packer, however, allegedly said Smith could stay, which echoes what he said in his “GMA” interview.
The executive producer also said police were “prepared” to arrest Smith if Rock, 57, decided to press charges, which he did not.

     Oscar Producer Will Packer Did Not Want Will Smith Physically Removed From Ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Packer, the lead producer for the 2022 Oscars ceremony, did not want Will Smith removed from the ceremony after he slapped Chris Rock.
“He was like, ‘No, no, no.’”Packer says his associate producer, Shayla Cowan, informed him that there were plans in motion from the Academy to remove Smith from the premises.
According to Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr., “reliable sources” say that Rock was never actually asked if he wanted Smith to be removed from the ceremony.
“We’re told that Packer is conflating this from a conversation that happened after Smith slapped him onstage, where Rock told Packer he did not want to press charges,” writes Fleming.
“Had he chosen to do that, the LAPD would have removed Smith and arrested him.”Fleming continues: “Had Packer asked Rock if he wanted Smith removed from the building, he might have gotten a different answer….

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Like many people who watched the encounter that ended with Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage Sunday at the Academy Awards ceremony, Oscars lead producer Will Packer thought it was a planned bit.
But as Smith -- angered by a joke Rock told about Smith's wife , Jada Pinkett Smith -- yelled obscenities from the audience before he walked on stage to confront Rock, Packer realized it was real.
Packer was told Smith was about to be physically removed, and he went to Academy leaders on site and told them Rock didn't want that to happen, the producer told "GMA" on Friday.
Stage encounter left producer 'devastated'The first-time Oscars producer had "never felt so immediately devastated like I did in that moment," as he watched Smith slap Rock, Packer said, then rushed to Rock as he exited the stage to confirm Smith indeed had struck him.
He goes, 'I just took a punch from Muhammad Ali,' as only Chris Rock can.
