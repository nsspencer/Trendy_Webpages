     Jerrod Carmichael Comes Out in a Riveting Special That’s About So Much More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As soon as Carmichael starts talking, you realize that he has kept us at one, too — until this reintroduction.
He’s now sitting, encouraging the crowd to talk back, speaking in an intimate tone, leveling with us and himself.
Those old provocative stand-up premises only hinted at this new man, especially when they dug into family matters.
Carmichael is alert to how pervasive they are, showing us the normal ones we don’t think much about.
But what he does in this special is deconstruct this persona, reveal it as a useful mask, even an inherited one.

     ‘Jerrod Carmichael: Rothaniel’ HBO Comedy Special Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jerrod Carmichael in Rothaniel.
Photo: Courtesy of HBOEarly in Jerrod Carmichael’s new special, Rothaniel, he tells his audience that he’s happy they’re here.
He needs them because Rothaniel is a comedy special designed to include multiple voices — Carmichael’s, but also voices from within the audience.
Rothaniel builds this revelation into the special as a turning point for both Carmichael’s performance and for the way this plays for the audience.
For a brief moment, Carmichael looks directly at the camera, and then lands on one fell swoop of a joke, turning himself into a punchline while also reclaiming his performative authority.
