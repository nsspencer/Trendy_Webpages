     Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet.
He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.
Tesla-as-miner has far reaching implications for the EV industry.
Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry?
Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain?

     Elon Musk unveils vision for Twitter after joining board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk has set out his vision for Twitter after buying a 9.2% stake in the company, in a series of posts on the social network described by one commentator as having “chaos energy”.
“Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,” he added.
“What should be done?”In 2021, Musk had declared: “A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” and just last month declared himself “a free speech absolutist”.
Since his appointment to the board, though, Musk has also suggested more prosaic changes to the social network.
Musk expressed concern that many of the most-followed accounts on Twitter “tweet rarely and post very little content”, asking: “Is Twitter dying?
