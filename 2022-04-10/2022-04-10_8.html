     The Top 5 Plays from the Celtics-Grizzlies Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From an alley-oop from Daniel Theis to Jayson Tatum to Marcus Smart stealing and slamming, Tatum's four-point play, Al Horford denying Xavier Tillman at the rim, and Malik Fitts's thunderous throwdown, here are the top five plays from Sunday's Celtics-Grizzlies game.
Daniel Theis Connects with Jayson Tatum for First Quarter Alley-OopThe Celtics run a horns set with Al Horford and Daniel Theis lifted above the elbows.
Horford spins to set a pindown for Jayson Tatum, but with Ziaire Williams top-siding him, Tatum cuts backdoor.
Jayson Tatum's Four-Point PlayFilthy, absolutely filthy.
Malik Fitts took full advantage of that, including on this highlight reel jam as he drives to the rim and delivers a thunderous throwdown.

     Recap: Celtics blow out Grizzlies bench squad in regular season finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Grizzlies enter their regular season finale against the Boston Celtics after throttling the New Orleans Pelicans last night 141-114.
Celtics Head Coach Ime Udoka acknowledged the various different scenarios in pre-game, and was relatively non-commital to the Celtics game plan tonight outside of saying “let’s do what we do”.
The effort was there as the Grizzlies defense made things tough for Boston, but offensively the Grizzlies really struggled to create their own offense.
The Grizzlies offense struggled with consistency against the stout Celtics defense, while Jayson Tatum opened up the Celtics offense with 26 points on 9-11 shooting.
John got his triple double as the Grizzlies fell 139-110 to the Boston Celtics to wrap up the regular season.
