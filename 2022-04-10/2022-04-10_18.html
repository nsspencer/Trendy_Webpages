Kwan hit the mark in style, too.
Cleveland went on to win the matchup, 10–7, to improve to 2–2 on the year.
During the series, Kwan went 9-for-13, got on base in 15 of 19 plate appearances and scored four times.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through the first four days of the 2022 Major League Baseball season, the toughest out in the entire game has been a a 24-year-old rookie outfielder who not too long ago didn't feel like he deserved to be on the same field with his college teammates.
Kwan reached base three times in his major league debut on Opening Day.
On Saturday, he reached base three times again.
Kwan is also the first player since at least 1901 to reach base 12 times in his first three major league games, according to Sarah Langs of mlb.com.
No other player has reached base more than 10 times under those circumstances.

     Summary: Cleveland rookie Steven Kwan hit .469 in spring training after compiling a .301 batting average in three minor league seasons.
Kwan had four singles and a double, was hit by a pitch and scored four runs.
The 24-year-old outfielder made his major league debut on opening day and is 8 for 10 in three games, reaching base in 12 of 14 plate appearances.
“I know it’s three games in, but nobody wants to not get excited,” Guardians manager Terry Francona said.
He’ll face righty Alek Manoah (9-2, 3.22), who won his big league debut in the Bronx last May.

     Summary: Cleveland Guardians rookie outfielder Steven Kwan made history on Sunday against the Kansas City Royals by notching five hits in his third career game.
Kwan also reached base on Sunday by being hit by a pitch.
Kwan came up one last time in the eighth and hit a double to right to cap off his afternoon.
Kwan is on the smaller side (he's listed at 5-foot-9) and until last year he had seldom shown over-the-fence power.
Non-believers think he's probably a fourth or fifth outfielder.

     Summary: (MLB x @XboxGamePass) pic.twitter.com/AQ4VLcFEPM — MLB (@MLB) April 11, 2022When we’re talking sample sizes after one weekend of play, almost all data come from tiny samples.
Strikeout percentage stands out, obviously, but it shouldn’t be surprising that Kwan has not struck out so far in 14 plate appearances.
In 603 college plate appearances, Kwan logged only 50 strikeouts, or a strikeout in 8.3% of plate appearances.
Likewise, in 947 minor league plate appearances he only struck out 87 times, or in 9.2% of plate appearances.
Kwan does not miss, and the Guardians lineup looks great with him in it.

     Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan: Baseball's biggest story of the first week of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Guardians' rookie outfielder is off to one of the best starts to a career — statistically — in baseball history.
Thus far, Kwan has already etched his name into the record books when it comes to a rookie debut.
It's only four games, but Kwan has so far been baseball's toughest out, which is saying something considering the person waiting in the on-deck circle while Kwan bats is Jose Ramirez.
Through four games, a 24-year-old rookie outfielder getting his first taste of the majors has been baseball's most productive hitter.
After drilling a grand slam on Sunday, Mercado hit another home run in Monday's win.

-- Cleveland Guardians rookie Steven Kwan kept up an historic start to his big league career with a bases-loaded triple Monday, becoming the first player to reach base at least three times in each of his first four games while leading Cleveland over the Kansas City Royals 10-7.
Kwan has reached base safely 15 different times in his first four career games.
No other player in the live-ball era -- which dates back to 1920 -- has reached base more than 13 times in their first four career games.
The Guardians then watched the 24-year-old Kwan cap his dazzling debut series with his three-run triple in the eighth.

He’s just one of three qualified batters remaining in the Majors who have yet to whiff at a pitch, along with Eloy Jiménez (18 swings) and Ryan Jeffers (12 swings).
• He hasn’t struck out in a game since Sept. 26, 2021, with Triple-A Columbus, including Cactus League play.
• He became the sixth player since at least 1901 to record a five-hit game within his first three career games, joining Yermín Mercedes (2021), Cecil Travis (1933), Red Massey (1918), Jack Dalton (1910) and Judge McCredie (1903).
But that humor is only sparked because of the unbelievable achievements he’s been able to accomplish in less than a week’s time.
