    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Mackie's CMT Music Award Hosting Has Viewers UndecidedAnthony Mackie may be better known to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the Falcon, but for the 2022 Country Music Television (CMT) Awards, he's also a country fan and joke-cracking co-host.
Moving away from the show's traditional format, the broadcast was aired on CBS this year with two hosts that were finalized as country celeb Kane Brown and country fan Mackie, per the Tennessean.
Then, reflecting on the diversity of the audience for country music the actor says, "Now that it's Kane, we gonna put some salt and pepper in that gumbo.
Some Twitter fans were really feeling this vibe.
Others, however, just weren't feeling Mackie's jokes land.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyone vaguely familiar with comic book history would have been fully aware that the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s long game would eventually see Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson installed as the new Captain America, dating right back to his franchise debut in The Winter Soldier.
With those boxes ticked, the next step is for the actor to headline his own standalone feature-length blockbuster, which is currently in development.
“As a dad of boys, it’s really cool when your kids can see you do something that they can watch.
We do all these movies, most of them our kids can’t watch.
But my kids were actually able to sit down and eat popcorn and watch The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, or Avengers, or all those movies.
