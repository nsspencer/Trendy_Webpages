     Look: Zach Wilson’s Siblings Day Photo Is Going Viral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This past Sunday was National Siblings Day and few players in the NFL have as many siblings as New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson does with five.
But a recent photo that Wilson took with his family and shared on Instagram is going viral – and not because they love seeing him spending time with his family.
One of Wilson’s teammates, offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker, decided to hop in the comments with a pointed question.
Fans quickly did a double-take on the photo and realized that Wilson and his three brothers look almost exactly the same.
Zach Wilson was the second of five quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft.

    </h2>

     Summary: Alijah Vera-Tucker could not resist commenting on Zach Wilson’s siblings photoNew York Jets guard Alijah Vera-Tucker usually exhibits a laid-back, quiet demeanor, but he showed off some of his comedic prowess by taking a light-hearted jab at his fellow 2021 draftee, quarterback Zach Wilson.
In honor of National Siblings Day, Wilson posted a photo to his Instagram account of himself while posing with his five siblings, all wearing similar outfits in varying shades of white and gray.
Wilson captioned the post, “Happy National Siblings Day to this amazing group of mine.
Going after one another in a good-hearted way on social media is nothing new for these New York Jets players.
