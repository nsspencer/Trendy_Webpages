     Summary: Following the performance, Parker told host Ryan Seacrest he didn't realize Allen would be his mentor upon choosing "Best Shot" as his song for this week's episode.
Judge Katy Perry told Parker his take on "Best Shot" and personal tribute to Allen could prove well for him in the competition.
I got to sit back and really watch what we've kind of been telling you start coming all together," said the 45-year-old fellow country singer.
Earlier in the episode, Allen offered some general advice to the current American Idol hopefuls.
He was nominated for best new artist at the awards show, though Olivia Rodrigo ultimately took home the category's trophy.
