     U.S., U.K. working to confirm reports of Russian chemical weapons attack in Mariupol; India's Modi avoids blaming Russia for war

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says that her government is working "urgently" to verify details of an alleged chemical weapons attack Monday on residents of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
"Reports that Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on the people of Mariupol.
We are working urgently with partners to verify details," Truss tweeted.
The Azov message said Russian forces used "a poisonous substance of unknown origin."
"These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine," said Kirby.

     Russia-Ukraine war: What happened today (April 11)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the first face-to-face exchange between Putin and a Western leader since Russia invaded Ukraine.
As a nonaligned European country, Austria has traditionally played a unique role between NATO member states and Russia.
"My most important message to Putin was that this war must finally end, because in a war there are only losers on both sides."
Russia's war could shrink the Ukrainian economy by 45% this year, the World Bank warns.
Marina Ovsyannikova was an editor at Russia's state Channel One when she jumped onto the set holding a sign that denounced the war and Kremlin propaganda promoting it.
