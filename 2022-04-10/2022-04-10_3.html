    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Evidence of a Final Fantasy 9 remake is mounting following the announcement of Kingdom Hearts 4 on Sunday.
A remake of Final Fantasy Tactics is also expected, following the news that Square Enix has trademarked “Tactics Ogre Reborn” in Japan.
Final Fantasy 9 was released in 2000 for the PlayStation.
It’s unclear when a potential Final Fantasy 9 remake could fit into Square Enix’s release schedule.
It’s currently working on Final Fantasy 16, Kingdom Hearts 4, Forspoken, Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 and it seems, a Final Fantasy Tactics remake.

Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is a new iOS/Android game that features 3D action familiar to the mainline entries and a closed beta test is planned for later in 2022.
It was also announced that the final chapter of Kingdom Hearts Dark Road will be released in August 2022 as a free update to the Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road app.

     Summary: Kingdom Hearts IV is officially in the works.
Square Enix announced the upcoming installment during an event in Japan to celebrate the series’ 20th-anniversary.
The trailer doesn’t immediately start with Kingdom Hearts IV — it also includes clips from the newly-announced mobile game, Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, so you’ll have to skip to the 4:09 mark to get a glimpse at Kingdom Hearts IV.
We just announced Kingdom Hearts IV and Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.
Square Enix says Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link will be available as a closed beta on Android and iOS in “specific regions” this August.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As part of the series’ 20th anniversary celebrations, Square Enix just used a Sunday evening presentation in Japan to unveil two new Kingdom Hearts games, one of them being Kingdom Hearts IV.
The big news, though, was the Kingdom Hearts IV announcement, alongside the reveal of another new Kingdom Hearts game, this one for mobile.
Both trailers are included in the video below, viewable after a short sequence for Kingdom Hearts Dark Road’s final story update.
The Kingdom Hearts IV trailer begins right after, and features the expected mix of Square Enix and Disney characters, only this time “set in a gorgeous, realistic world unlike anything ever seen before in the KINGDOM HEARTS series”.
It has Japanese audio, but there are English subtitles baked into this version:There’s no word on platforms or release date for Kingdom Hearts IV.

Square Enix did not announce a release date or platforms for Kingdom Hearts 4.
Grid View Image: Square Enix/DisneyImage: Square Enix/DisneyImage: Square Enix/DisneyImage: Square Enix/DisneyImage: Square Enix/DisneyImage: Square Enix/DisneySquare Enix also announced a separate game, Kingdom Hearts Missing Link, in development for Android and iOS devices.
Kingdom Hearts Missing Link will feature a new, original story, Square Enix says, but will almost assuredly tie into the story of Kingdom Hearts 4.
Kingdom Hearts Missing Link does not have a release date, but a closed beta test for the game is scheduled for 2022.

     Kingdom Hearts 4: Breaking down the new announcement trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Square Enix held its Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Event in Tokyo and during it they announced Kingdom Hearts 4.
We’re going back deep into Kingdom Hearts’ complicated lore for this as The Master of Masters is a Keyblade Master, appearing in Kingdom Hearts X, who wrote the Book of Prophecies and trained six apprentices.
Your options are endless.”This seems to reference the ending of Kingdom Hearts 3 and, again, we get the usual Kingdom Hearts verbiage talking about your heart and soul, and being guided by fate.
This is an ongoing theme in the Kingdom Hearts series so nothing too surprising.
It’s unclear how far off Kingdom Hearts 4 actually is, but I hope we don’t have to wait as long as we did with Kingdom Hearts 3.
