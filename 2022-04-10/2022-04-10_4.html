     Summary: Kingdom Hearts IV is officially in the works.
Square Enix announced the upcoming installment during an event in Japan to celebrate the series’ 20th-anniversary.
The trailer doesn’t immediately start with Kingdom Hearts IV — it also includes clips from the newly-announced mobile game, Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, so you’ll have to skip to the 4:09 mark to get a glimpse at Kingdom Hearts IV.
We just announced Kingdom Hearts IV and Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.
Square Enix says Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link will be available as a closed beta on Android and iOS in “specific regions” this August.

     Kingdom Hearts 4 Will Probably Be PS5 and Xbox Series X Only
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts 4 with a stunning gameplay trailer as part of the celebrations for the Kingdom Hearts franchise's 20th anniversary.
The Kingdom Hearts series is no stranger to visually impressive games.
RELATED: Tetsuya Nomura Teases Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary SketchKingdom Hearts 4's Stunning VisualsThe visuals on display in Kingdom Heart's 4's trailer, seen above around the 4-minute mark, are absolutely breathtaking.
In previous Kingdom Hearts titles, this level of detail would mainly be reserved for the pre-rendered cutscenes, but Kingdom Hearts 4's gameplay seems to take no hit visually.
Even the handheld Kingdom Hearts entries innovated visually, such as Re: Coded or 358/2 Days: Both are full-fledged, 3D Kingdom Hearts titles that run on the Nintendo DS.

Square Enix did not announce a release date or platforms for Kingdom Hearts 4.

Kingdom Hearts Missing Link will feature a new, original story, Square Enix says, but will almost assuredly tie into the story of Kingdom Hearts 4.
Kingdom Hearts Missing Link does not have a release date, but a closed beta test for the game is scheduled for 2022.

     Kingdom Hearts 4: Breaking down the new announcement trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Square Enix held its Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Event in Tokyo and during it they announced Kingdom Hearts 4.
We’re going back deep into Kingdom Hearts’ complicated lore for this as The Master of Masters is a Keyblade Master, appearing in Kingdom Hearts X, who wrote the Book of Prophecies and trained six apprentices.
Your options are endless.”This seems to reference the ending of Kingdom Hearts 3 and, again, we get the usual Kingdom Hearts verbiage talking about your heart and soul, and being guided by fate.
This is an ongoing theme in the Kingdom Hearts series so nothing too surprising.
It’s unclear how far off Kingdom Hearts 4 actually is, but I hope we don’t have to wait as long as we did with Kingdom Hearts 3.
