     'Kingdom Hearts 4': Star Wars and 3 more crossovers teased in new trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kingdom Hearts fans have been waiting for any news on the next game since the end of Kingdom Hearts 3, which left the fate of series protagonist Sora up in the air.
Outside of all the lore details, perhaps most interesting are the potential new worlds players might be visiting in Kingdom Hearts 4.
With a new chapter of the series starting the possibilities are practically limitless, but here are a few hints from the Kingdom Hearts 4 reveal trailer.
DisneyThe biggest and easily most exciting possibility is a potential Star Wars world that may be featured in Kingdom Hearts 4.
It makes sense that now would be the time to introduce Star Wars into Kingdom Hearts, with the start of a brand new arc.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s all the Kingdom Hearts fanbase, and equally obsessive Star Wars fans, needed to fire up the speculation hyper drive.
Disney, of course, has owned the Star Wars franchise since 2012, when the company acquired Lucasfilm for $4 billion.
The Kingdom Hearts franchise has largely played within traditional Disney and Pixar worlds, with Kingdom Hearts 3 exploring the worlds of Toy Story, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Tangled.
But series director Tetsuya Nomura has declined to explore the worlds of Star Wars and Disney-owned Marvel until now.
Kingdom Hearts 4 does not have an announced release date or platforms yet.

     Summary: After a 14-year break following Kingdom Hearts II, the third Kingdom Hearts game came out in 2019 to the joy of fans everywhere.
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original Kingdom Hearts game, the studio released footage from the final story update for the Kingdom Hearts Dark Road mobile game, as well as official reveal announcements for Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link (another mobile game), and Kingdom Hearts IV.
The trailer for Kingdom Hearts IV starts at 4:07:Kingdom Hearts IV could include Star WarsThe reveal of the fourth mainline Kingdom Hearts game is exciting on a few different levels.
It seems a little small compared to the surrounding forest, but it does bring up an interesting question: could this Kingdom Hearts include Star Wars?
In that context, it’s easier to imagine Star Wars appearing in a Kingdom Hearts game.

     Summary: There was a time when news of a new Kingdom Hearts entry would have sent me into paroxysms of joy.
Kingdom Hearts lost me, culminating in me dropping Kingdom Hearts 3 somewhere mid-game disappointed and oh-so-very sad that the franchise so formative to my youth had become utterly unrecognizable to me.
The game needs a clean slate, and Kingdom Hearts 4 could be the jumping-on point me and other lapsed keyblade wielders desperately need.
Imagine if you had to play the first 14 Final Fantasy games in order to understand Final Fantasy XV.
The Kingdom Hearts franchise is like a library with a bunch of overdue books.

     Kingdom Hearts 4: The Full Game Will Be Made With Unreal Engine 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kingdom Hearts 4 was surprise-revealed yesterday during a 20th Anniversary announcement trailer for the series, which is where Square Enix also revealed that it was developing Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new mobile game for the franchise.
Unreal Engine 4 looks great but after last week’s announcement that Unreal Engine 5 is now available to all, fans were wondering if Kingdom Hearts 4 would be developed in this new engine.
The publication also claims that Kingdom Hearts 4 is being developed by Square Enix’s Osaka studio, which is the same team behind Kingdom Hearts 3, under the lead of co-director Yasushi Yasue, as translated by VGC.
During the live 20th Anniversary event, which took place in Japan, Kingdom Hearts franchise director Tetsuya Nomura reportedly revealed that he considered making a real Verum Rex video game, which itself is a video game in the Toy Story world of Kingdom Hearts 3, before he decided to make Kingdom Hearts 4.
While waiting to one day see what Kingdom Hearts 4 looks like in Unreal Engine 5, read Game Informer’s Kingdom Hearts 4 reveal trailer breakdown, and then check out everything we know about Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.

     Predicting Kingdom Hearts IV’s new Disney worlds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kingdom Hearts IV is coming.
As both a big fan of Disney and Kingdom Hearts, I have a better shot than most at guessing which Disney properties will inspire this new entry’s worlds.
I’m also guessing seven worlds, since that’s how many Disney stages we had in Kingdom Hearts III.
(@TableLastname) April 10, 2022Even during the buildup to Kingdom Hearts III, many wondered and hoped that Star Wars and Marvel would make appearances.
Plus, we know Kingdom Hearts loves its minigames, and this gives them an easy route to some racing-based side activities.

     What We Want In Kingdom Hearts 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To the delight of many a fan, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts IV yesterday.
Wesley LeBlancThere are two things I want most out of Kingdom Hearts IV: A new Pirates of the Caribbean world that builds off of the foundation of Kingdom Hearts III’s iteration, and a full (Dream Drop) dive into Quadratum, the world of Verum Rex, and ultimately, Nomura’s Final Fantasy Versus XIII Frankenstein monster by way of Kingdom Hearts.
Kingdom Hearts III gave us a taste of what that looks like, but I hope that in some way, shape, or form, Kingdom Hearts IV features even more of Nomura’s Versus XIII in it.
Playing Kingdom Hearts III made me realize that I’ve outgrown the franchise's cheesy, hamfisted conversations.
I loved being able to sing along during the Frozen world in Kingdom Hearts III, and I was a fan of the rhythm game in the Little Mermaid world from Kingdom Hearts II.
