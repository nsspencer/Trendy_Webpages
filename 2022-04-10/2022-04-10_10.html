     Xavi Hernandez insists Barcelona are not dependent on Pedri
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Xavi Hernandez says Barcelona are not dependent on Pedri after the youngster produced another game-changing performance in Sunday's thrilling 3-2 win over Levante.
"I wouldn't say that," Xavi said in his post-game news conference when asked if Barca suffer from "Pedridependencia," a term previously reserved for Lionel Messi.
He's scored a great goal [against Levante], but I don't think there is [a dependence on him]."
Xavi has asked Pedri to shoot more and his goal in Valencia took his tally to five for the season in 21 appearances, one more than he managed in 53 outings last term.
Barca remain second in the table, 12 points behind leaders Real Madrid with one game in hand but just eight to play.

     European roundup: Barcelona earn late win at Levante, Milan held by Torino
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Levante began the game in 19th place but took a deserved lead against lacklustre opponents in the 52nd minute.
Gonzalo Melero assumed taking duties and made no mistake against Ter Stegen to level in the 83rd minute, before De Jong converted from Jordi Alba’s cross in the second minute of stoppage time.
The dramatic win moves Xavi’s side back up to second in the table, 12 points behind leaders Real Madrid with one game in hand.
Milan were held to their second successive 0-0 draw and the stalemate with Torino means their advantage over second-placed Inter is just two points.
Bamba Dieng and Cengiz Ünder scored in the first half, before visiting keeper Jonas Omlin was sent off late on.

     Levante vs. Barcelona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona comes out on top after thrilling second half (2:59)Barcelona striker Luuk de Jong scored a header in added time to give his side a 3-2 win at struggling Levante after a remarkable, end-to-end game in which his side gave away three penalties.
But they are still a long way behind leaders Real Madrid, who have 72 points from 31 after beating Getafe 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The visitors quickly made Levante pay, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang heading home a cross from Ousmane Dembele in the 59th minute.
Levante then won a third penalty of the second half when Dani Gomez latched on to a through ball and was tripped by Barca defender Clement Lenglet.
But when pressed on whether Barca had a chance of catching runaway leaders Real, the coach added: "It's very difficult because Real Madrid seldom slip up.
