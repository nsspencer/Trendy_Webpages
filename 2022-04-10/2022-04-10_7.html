     ‘S.N.L.’ Star Colin Jost Takes a Spin on Ferryboat He Bought With Pete Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Jost, one of the stars of “Saturday Night Live,” has ridden the Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor many times.
Mr. Jost and his castmate Pete Davidson, both of whom grew up on Staten Island, have been co-owners of a hulking, orange ferryboat since they joined a group of investors who successfully bid on it in January.
The group paid New York City more than $280,000 for the boat, named for John F. Kennedy, after winning a competitive auction.
The partners are still working on their plan to turn it into a floating entertainment venue.
While they do that, they needed to find a place to dock a 277-foot-long boat that weighs 2,100 tons.

During her appearance on the podcast, Kim also set the record straight over her relationship timeline with Pete.
Kim remembered telling Pete how "nervous" she was about the gig, promoting the comic to offer her his phone number for advice.
"I had gloves on and I couldn't get into my phone," said Kim, who wore a full-body look that covered her fingers and face to the Met Gala.
