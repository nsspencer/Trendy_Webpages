     City Ties Liverpool, Well Aware That One Point May Be Plenty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is not every day that he finds a team willing to stand up to him, or capable of doing it.
Both teams stood where they had before.
Manchester City, which now has seven games to play in the Premier League, has one point more than Liverpool, just as it had at the start of the day.
This is a Premier League season of the finest margins, and whichever of these teams wins the title, there will be precious little between them.
John Stones, the City defender, pumped a fist in the air.

     How British Newspapers Reacted To Man City Vs Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City's 2-2 draw with Premier League title rivals Liverpool dominated the back pages of newspapers in the British press on Monday.

That title was based on quotes from City manager Pep Guardiola reacting to several chances his side had missed to win the game.

     Summary: Andy Robertson insists Liverpool have to be “ready to pounce” should Manchester City drop points as the title race enters its closing seven matches.
“We just need to keep winning games,” said Robertson.
It’s obviously out of our hands, if they win all their games then it is their league but if they do drop points we need to be ready to pounce.

     Man City may have just had their Barcelona moment as Liverpool given one major silver lining
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The moment in question is Riyad Mahrez’s chance to win the game for Man City at the tail end of the dramatic 2-2 draw against Liverpool.
Had Mahrez scored, we could be looking at -4 with seven games to go.
It just takes one slip up from Pep Guardiola’s men —and not the several needed had Mahrez scored — combined with a Liverpool win to leapfrog City.
That Mahrez’s failure to secure all three points is what give Liverpool the hope to stay in the fight.
But of course we can’t say for certain at this stage if it will be a Dembélé moment, or just giving Liverpool false hope for another week.

     Summary: In recent seasons, Liverpool and Manchester City have provided fans of English football with some of the most thrilling battles the English Premier League has ever seen.
READ: Security guards in Qatar exposed to conditions ‘amounting to forced labour’Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola speak during Sunday's English Premier League match.
Not only was De Bruyne the orchestra for everything good that City produced, he was also the engine of the team.
In its previous 145 matches, City has amassed 339 points, just one more than Liverpool in that same period.
In the post-match media conference, Guardiola was asked by The Athletic whether he set his team up to play more like Liverpool.
