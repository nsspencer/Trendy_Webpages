     Elizabeth Holmes tried "to flee the country" after conviction, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes allegedly made an "attempt to flee the country" shortly after being convicted of conspiracy and fraud, prosectors alleged in a court filing Friday, per CNN.
"The government became aware on January 23, 2022, that Defendant Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip," the court filing obtained by CNN states.
Zoom in: Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison last November but has appealed her conviction.
In the filing, prosecutors claim Holmes has not shown convincing evidence to indicate that she's not a flight risk, as her attorneys have previously argued, CNN reports.
What's next: Holmes is expected to turn herself into custody on April 27.

     Prosecutors: Convicted CEO Elizabeth Holmes is a flight risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Elizabeth Holmes is a flight risk and shouldn’t be allowed to stay out of prison while she appeals her 11-year prison sentence for defrauding investors, federal prosecutors said in court documents.
Holmes had a one-way plane ticket to Mexico booked for Jan. 26, 2022, three weeks after being convicted by a jury on four counts of fraud and conspiracy, federal prosecutors said in a motion filed Thursday in federal court in Northern California.
Holmes booked the 2022 flight without a scheduled return trip and only canceled it after prosecutors contacted Holmes’ attorneys about the “unauthorized flight,” prosecutors said.
In a Jan. 23, 2022, email responding to prosecutors’ concerns about the planned trip, they said Holmes had booked it before the jury’s verdict to attend a wedding in Mexico.
Prosecutors did not protest Davila’s decision to give Holmes five months of freedom or bring up the fact that they considered her a flight risk.

     Elizabeth Holmes bought one-way ticket to Mexico, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new court filing by the U.S. government opposing Elizabeth Holmes’ motion for release pending appeal shows that Holmes bought a one-way ticket to Mexico set to leave weeks after her fraud conviction.
Holmes was sentenced last November to over 11 years in prison and has appealed that decision.
In response to her motion for release, prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that she purchased an airline ticket to Mexico scheduled to leave shortly after being convicted last January with no scheduled return.
Holmes' partner Billy Evans had flown out on Jan. 26, 2022, and didn't return for six weeks.
The government adds that Holmes failed to meet the burden of proving she was not a flight risk.

Shortly thereafter, federal prosecutors allege in the filing, Holmes bought a flight to Mexico departing Jan. 26, 2022 without a scheduled return trip.
"Only after the government raised this unauthorized flight with defense counsel was the trip canceled," prosecutors say.
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila ordered Holmes to surrender herself into custody by April 27.

     Elizabeth Holmes made an ‘attempt to flee the country’ after her conviction, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Elizabeth Holmes made an “attempt to flee the country” by booking a one-way ticket to Mexico departing in January 2022, shortly after the Theranos founder was convicted of fraud, prosecutors alleged in a new court filing Friday.
Holmes was convicted last January of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos.
The court filing includes an email from one of Holmes’ attorneys to the prosecution, claiming that the travel reservation was made before the verdict.
In an earlier court filing, Holmes’ attorneys argued for her release from custody pending appeal, saying she was not a flight risk or a threat to the community.
“There are not two systems of justice – one for the wealthy and one for the poor – there is one criminal justice system in this country,” prosecutors stated in the filing.
