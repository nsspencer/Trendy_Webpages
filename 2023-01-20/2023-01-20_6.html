     Theranos Scammer Elizabeth Holmes Tried to Flee the Country After Her Conviction: Prosecutors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes tried to leave the country after she was found guilty of fraud last year, according to prosecutors in her case.
In November, a judge sentenced Holmes to 11 years and three months in prison, plus three years of supervised release.
Her case has come to represent the dark side of Silicon Valley’s hustle culture and “fake it till you make it” ethos.
In the latest court documents, prosecutors also alleged that the estate Holmes is currently living on costs more than $13,000 to maintain each month and has continued to push to have her travel restrictions relaxed.
“There are not two systems of justice — one for the wealthy and one for the poor — there is one criminal justice system in this country,” the prosecutors wrote in the filing.

Lance, Recently, the government became aware that Ms. Holmes has a reservation for international air travel, scheduled to depart in the next few days.
Ms. Holmes did not provide the government notice of this travel, nor obtain approval from the Court.
We assume Ms. Holmes remains aware of her release conditions.
The hope was that the verdict would be different and Ms. Holmes would be able to make this trip to attend the wedding of close friends in Mexico.

     Elizabeth Holmes 'attempted to flee' the U.S. after conviction: Feds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes tried to flee the U.S. after a jury convicted her of felony fraud in early 2022, federal prosecutors alleged in a new court filing.
“Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip,” the document from prosecutors, filed Thursday, said.
It was only after government prosecutors contacted Holmes’ legal team about the “unauthorized flight” that the trip was cancelled.
In her motion, Holmes claimed she was not a flight risk.
Any judge deciding whether to let someone remain free on bail while they appeal would have concerns about a one-way ticket to Mexico, Clark said.

     Summary: Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of disgraced biotech firm Theranos, bought a one-way ticket to Mexico shortly after she was convicted of fraud last January, a court filing submitted Thursday alleges.
Holmes was found guilty on four counts of lying to investors on Jan. 3, 2022.
Shortly thereafter, federal prosecutors allege in the filing, Holmes bought a flight to Mexico departing Jan. 26, 2022 without a scheduled return trip.
"Only after the government raised this unauthorized flight with defense counsel was the trip canceled," prosecutors say.
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila ordered Holmes to surrender herself into custody by April 27.

     Elizabeth Holmes made an ‘attempt to flee the country’ after her conviction, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Elizabeth Holmes made an “attempt to flee the country” by booking a one-way ticket to Mexico departing in January 2022, shortly after the Theranos founder was convicted of fraud, prosecutors alleged in a new court filing Friday.
Holmes was convicted last January of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos.
The court filing includes an email from one of Holmes’ attorneys to the prosecution, claiming that the travel reservation was made before the verdict.
In an earlier court filing, Holmes’ attorneys argued for her release from custody pending appeal, saying she was not a flight risk or a threat to the community.
“There are not two systems of justice – one for the wealthy and one for the poor – there is one criminal justice system in this country,” prosecutors stated in the filing.
