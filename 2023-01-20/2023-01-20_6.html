     Elizabeth Holmes tried "to flee the country" after conviction, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes allegedly made an "attempt to flee the country" shortly after being convicted of conspiracy and fraud, prosectors alleged in a court filing Friday, per CNN.
"The government became aware on January 23, 2022, that Defendant Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip," the court filing obtained by CNN states.
Zoom in: Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison last November but has appealed her conviction.
In the filing, prosecutors claim Holmes has not shown convincing evidence to indicate that she's not a flight risk, as her attorneys have previously argued, CNN reports.
What's next: Holmes is expected to turn herself into custody on April 27.

     Elizabeth Holmes attempted to ‘flee’ US after conviction for Theranos fraud, prosecutors allege
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Theranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes tried to “flee” the United States a few weeks after her conviction for fraud last year, prosecutors said in a court filing Thursday.
Holmes was found guilty of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud last January for misleading investors about the effectiveness of her startup company’s blood-testing technology.
Holmes has since appealed her conviction and filed a motion to be released from detention at an estate while her appeal plays out.
The government then mentioned the trip to Holmes’s defense attorney, and the flight was canceled after that, prosecutors said.
They said the incentive for Holmes to flee the country has never been higher, and she has the resources to do so.

     Summary: Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of disgraced biotech firm Theranos, bought a one-way ticket to Mexico shortly after she was convicted of fraud last January, a court filing submitted Thursday alleges.
Holmes was found guilty on four counts of lying to investors on Jan. 3, 2022.
Shortly thereafter, federal prosecutors allege in the filing, Holmes bought a flight to Mexico departing Jan. 26, 2022 without a scheduled return trip.
"Only after the government raised this unauthorized flight with defense counsel was the trip canceled," prosecutors say.
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila ordered Holmes to surrender herself into custody by April 27.

Ms. Holmes did not provide the government notice of this travel, nor obtain approval from the Court.
We assume Ms. Holmes remains aware of her release conditions.

     Elizabeth Holmes made an ‘attempt to flee the country’ after her conviction, prosecutors say

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Elizabeth Holmes made an “attempt to flee the country” by booking a one-way ticket to Mexico departing in January 2022, shortly after the Theranos founder was convicted of fraud, prosecutors alleged in a new court filing Friday.
Holmes was convicted last January of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos.
The court filing includes an email from one of Holmes’ attorneys to the prosecution, claiming that the travel reservation was made before the verdict.
In an earlier court filing, Holmes’ attorneys argued for her release from custody pending appeal, saying she was not a flight risk or a threat to the community.
“There are not two systems of justice – one for the wealthy and one for the poor – there is one criminal justice system in this country,” prosecutors stated in the filing.
