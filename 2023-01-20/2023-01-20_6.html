     Giants had to burn timeout so QB Daniel Jones could put contact lens back in
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday night, the New York Giants needed to have all hands on deck.
During New York's third possession, the Giants would have to call a timeout.
Was there some sort of defensive alignment Jones didn't like seeing?
Entering this divisional-round matchup, bettors didn’t necessarily expect Jones to continue lighting up the Eagles the way he did the Vikings.
And with the Giants down 28-0 after 30 minutes, it was clear that Saturday was an all-around nightmare day for them.

     Summary: Great work by the FOX Sports camera crew during the second quarter of Saturday’s New York-Philadelphia game at the Linc.
Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has to hustle to the sidelines.
Was he injured?
As the shot showed, Jones had a contact lens dislodged and he was fortunate it landed on his facemask.
A trip to the sidelines for some saline solution and Jones was back in the game with Big Blue trailing, 14-0.

     Brian Daboll doesn't commit to Daniel Jones as Giants' 2023 QB after playoff loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By all accounts, Daniel Jones took significant strides and won over his teammates as the Giants' quarterback in 2022.
Asked after Saturday's playoff loss to the Eagles whether he expects Jones back in 2023, Daboll was decidedly noncommittal.
The two sides were reportedly close on a contract extension prior to the Giants' playoff debut, but as of now, Jones remains unsigned beyond this season.
Daboll, for what it's worth, also downplayed Jones' growth in his postgame remarks, suggesting Jones has been "a consistent guy since he's been here."
When asked to assess the QB's individual performance against the Eagles, he was also tepid.

The Philadelphia Eagles took the opening drive 75 yards for an early 7-0 lead, and it only got worse from there.
Jones and the Giants could find no rhythm on offense against a tough Eagles defense.
Jones getting hit so hard that one of his contacts popped out and got caught on his facemask.
Credit to Jones, who popped the contact back in on the sidelines and didn’t end up missing the play.

     Have Daniel Jones, Saquon Barkley played their last game with the Giants?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Had the Giants season ended there, perhaps the franchise would stay the course with quarterback Daniel Jones, because by most accounts the team was finally trending in the right direction after almost a decade of ineptitude.
At the end of the regular season, a new contract for Daniel Jones seemed inevitable.
What a sequence: Daniel Jones runs out of bounds to lose 5 yards on 2nd down, throws an incomplete pass on 3rd down, and then Daboll punts on 4th and 6 with 13 minutes left in the game down 21.
Have either one (or both) played their final games with the New York Giants?
Or should the Giants consider rewarding and building around the 26-year-old Saquon Barkley, now finally healthy and productive again?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — Daniel Jones had just made history in his playoff debut, and one of the most thoughtful voices around, Giants teammate Darius Slayton, was explaining why it came as no surprise.
“One thing you’ve got to understand about Daniel Jones,” Slayton said, “is he tries his very, very hardest to win these games.
If the Giants are forced to slightly overpay Jones, or to overpay him outright, well, there are worse things in the world.
But Jones is a money player who clearly isn’t motivated (at least not primarily) by the money.
Jones won the respect of everyone who cares about Giants football, and nobody could take that away from him Saturday night in Philly — win or lose.
