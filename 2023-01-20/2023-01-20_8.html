     Summary: “I am grateful for my time working with Nikki Haley and her dedicated team,” Chapman said in a statement.
What role Chapman would potentially play in a Pence campaign is unclear.
During the 2020 campaign, Pence’s advisers blamed Haley for rumors that she would replace Pence on the ticket.
In a forthcoming memoir, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asserts that Haley was privately jockeying to push out Pence, though Haley has insisted the claims are “lies and gossip.”Further complicating the dynamic between Pence and Haley is the long-term overlap between key parts of their teams.
Jon Lerner, a longtime Republican pollster, served as an adviser to both Haley and Pence during the Trump administration.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — Republican Nikki Haley strongly hinted in an interview that aired Thursday that she might run for president, though stopped short of declaring a bid.
"Yes, we need to go in a new direction," Haley said.
"I don’t think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in D.C.
I think we need a young generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things," she said.
Before serving in federal government, Haley was the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017.

     Summary: Former Vice President Mike Pence's political operation has poached Tim Chapman, a top aide to former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, two Republican sources with knowledge of the move confirmed.
Both Pence and Haley are considering White House bids in 2024.
Griffin's move to Pence's team was first reported by Politico.
"I am grateful for my time working with Nikki Haley and her dedicated team," Chapman said in a statement.
Asked Thursday on Fox News about a potential White House bid, Haley seemed to indicate she's inclined to run.

     Summary: However, the only survey that's pitted Trump against Haley shows unfavorable odds for the former governor.
Although Trump remains the front-runner in the race, Haley has remained popular in Republican circles, even after leaving office.
If she jumps in, she will be a top-tier candidate," Klink told Newsweek.
"With her credentials alone, she would shake up the Republican race."
At this point, Klink said the 2024 Republican primary remains "incredibly fluid" and that the field has yet to crystalize.

“I am grateful for my time working with Nikki Haley and her dedicated team,” Chapman said in a statement obtained by Politico.
Mike Pence hired Tim Chapman, a former Nikki Haley staffer.
It’s unclear what role Chapman would play in a potential 2024 Pence presidential campaign.
A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released in December found Haley and Pence tied in terms of 2024 presidential support, with each favored by 5% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.

In a Fox News interview Haley says her camp is still working through a few things but adds that she’s never lost a race and “I’m not going to lose now.”She was also asked about her previous statement that she would not run if Donald Trump were in the race.
To that she says, it’s time for new generational change and that she doesn’t think you need to be 80 years old to be a leader in D.C.

     Summary: Nearly two years ago, Nikki Haley told South Carolina reporters she wouldn’t run for president in 2024 should former President Donald Trump seek another term.
But in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Thursday night, the former South Carolina governor further fueled speculation that a 2024 presidential run is in her future.
“Do I think I could be that leader?” Haley posited.
During a 2021 visit to South Carolina State University, Haley said she would not run for the White House in 2024 if Trump ran.
During Thursday’s interview, Haley was pressed on whether she would be launching an exploratory committee.
