     Fans critical of Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ anniversary logo; Here’s why

     Summary: It was announced this week Pink Floyd will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its classic album “The Dark Side of the Moon” with a new boxed set due March 24.
The problem with this line of thinking, as it is pointed out by Loud Wire, is the cover of “The Dark Side of the Moon,” which debuted in 1973, also has a rainbow on it.
Pink Floyd adds a rainbow to their logo to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dark Side of the Moon, which had a rainbow on the cover, and angry boomers instantly get triggeredUtterly pathetic lmao pic.twitter.com/mOI5WvgX5H — Spironolactone Agnew (@SBElikeswords) January 20, 2023Pink Floyd has gone woke!
pic.twitter.com/XkzqGkvITW — cosme (@cosmepolitics) January 20, 2023In addition, there will also be an authorized Pink Floyd planetarium show comprising “stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond” set to the music of “The Dark Side of the Moon” in chronological order.
The event will begin rolling out in March and is a nod to Pink Floyd’s Feb. 27, 1973, press conference at the London Planetarium, during which the music from “Dark Side” was played back in public for the first time.

To commemorate the milestone, Pink Floyd reimagined their original well-known symbol: a beam of light passing through a prism, resulting in a rainbow beam.
“Lose the rainbow, you’re making yourself look stupid!” one commented, with a second calling it a “disgrace”.
Pink Floyd profile picture (Pink Floyd / Facebook)Several other fans found the angry responses to be baffling, with one writing: “I thought it was a joke and had to come see for myself.
