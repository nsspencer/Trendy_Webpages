     Grizzlies get heated with ex-NFL star Shannon Sharpe before half
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the halftime buzzer, Shannon Sharpe and Tee Morant have to be separated by referees, security and members of the Grizzlies' bench.
Referees and security intervened to settle the confrontation as several Grizzlies players -- including Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Ja Morant and Morant's father, Tee Morant -- gathered on the sideline opposite their bench at Crypto.com Arena to approach Sharpe.
Sharpe has appeared on the show wearing a goat mask and James' jersey, suggesting that James is the greatest player of all time, or GOAT, of the NBA.
Sharpe granted ESPN a brief interview on his walk back to his seat before the second half started.
Cameras later showed Sharpe and Tee Morant shake hands and hug at the end of the third quarter.

     Summary: Fox analyst Shannon Sharpe and Tee Morant, the father of Memphis star Ja Morant, were seen shouting at one another courtside and needed to be separated by several team staffers, arena security and even game officials.
It’s unclear what triggered the incident, but Tee Morant and Grizzlies center Steven Adams were shouting at Sharpe as the teams were heading to the locker room for halftime.
Sharpe issued a brief statement to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin to explain his side of the incident.
“They do all that talking and jockeying and I ain’t about that jockeying.
Don’t let these fools fool you now.”Sounds look good old fashioned courtside trash talking gone wrong in downtown Los Angeles.
