     Dejounte Murray calls out Spurs legend Tony Parker for not being a good mentor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, Parker was not a good mentor to young players coming up, according to former Spur Dejonte Murray.
Murray appeared on the “All the Smoke” podcast and was brutally honest about his relationship with Parker (hat tip CBS Sports).
Parker is under no obligation to mentor Murray and he chose to go where he could get more run rather than hang out in the dying embers of the Spurs’ golden era.
I can’t wait for the “All the Smoke” podcast where Murray eventually opens up about this season.
