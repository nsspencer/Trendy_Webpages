     Kevin Durant's Updated Injury Evaluation Timeline Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are struggling without Kevin Durant.
During the TNT broadcast it was revealed that Kevin Durant is still in a knee brace, and will get his next re-evaluation early next week.
There's no definite timetable on when Kevin Durant, but fortunately the Nets have built enough wiggle room record-wise to survive a bit longer with him out.
Despite the four-game losing streak, the Brooklyn Nets are still the fourth seed, 1.5 games out from the second seed, and three games out from a play-in spot.
The key for the Brooklyn Nets is to survive these next two weeks.

     Kyrie Irving pours in 48 points to lift Nets over Jazz and snap losing streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY — Kyrie Irving carried the red-hot form he showed Thursday against the Suns over into Friday against the Jazz.
In short, he did it all, and did it when the Nets most needed it — for the second straight night, Irving erupted for 21 points in the fourth quarter.
Kyrie Irving, left, celebrates during the Nets’ win over the Jazz on Jan. 20.
Irving scored seven points in a 14-0 Nets run, and his 15-foot jumper put the Nets ahead 16-5 with 6:40 left in the first quarter.
Then Claxton followed with an alley-oop, and an Irving 3-pointer made it 99-92 with 7:24 to play.

    </h2>

     Summary: Ever since superstar Kevin Durant has been out of the lineup with a sprained right MCL, the Brooklyn Nets have started games poorly.
Thursday’s 117-112 loss to the Phoenix Suns was more of the same.
In a game in which the Suns did not have the services of Devin Booker or Chris Paul, the Nets still found a way to start a game on the wrong foot.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn spoke postgame about how Brooklyn didn’t come to play for most of the game:“Yeah, really unfortunate.
Talked about it yesterday, expectations and we just we didn’t come to play the beginning of the game.”ListPlayer grades: Kyrie Irving scores 30 in deceptive 117-112 loss to the SunsListNBA Twitter reacts to Nets' 117-112 loss to the Phoenix SunsStory originally appeared on Nets Wire
