Whether he’s hurt or not, whether he’s feeling it or not, he’s going to have to earn everything he gets because that’s our approach going into this week.”

     Summary: Giants QB Daniel Jones - Jones played perhaps his best game as a pro against a poor Vikings defense and comes in with confidence.
Giants’ Saquon Barkley vs. Eagles’ T.J. Edwards/Kyzir White - The Giants aren’t an explosive team other than Barkley, who can hit the home run at any time.
Giants’ Dexter Lawrence vs. Eagles’ Jason Kelce - Nose tackles typically aren’t game-wreckers but Lawrence was in Minnesota, generating seven pressures from the interior.
-This is only the third time that the Eagles and Giants have met in the postseason.

     Summary: Between Giants coach Brian Daboll and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, Giants running back Saquon Barkley and Eagles counterpart Miles Sanders, Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka and Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham, and former Giant-turned-Eagle James Bradberry, there will be plenty of familiarity Saturday during the NFC divisional-round playoffs.
Let’s take a deeper dive into the matchups we’ll see:Giants pass offense vs. Eagles pass defenseDaniel Jones enters riding the best three-game stretch of his career (108.1 passer rating).
Edge: GiantsEagles pass offense vs. Giants pass defenseIf Jalen Hurts is healthy, he leads one of the most explosive offenses in the league.
Adoree’ Jackson will try to stifle the Eagles’ pass offense, just like he did against Justin Jefferson.
The Giants’ season is an unquestioned success, even if it were to end on a blowout loss.

     Giants vs. Eagles: 3 reasons for optimism in Divisional Round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants (sixth seed) will visit the Philadelphia Eagles (first seed) for an NFC Divisional round matchup this Saturday night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In the Giants’ last game against the Eagles, they only fell by six points as they played Philidelphia without most of their starters.
The Eagles have allowed 121.6 yards per game on the ground this season making them 17th in the league in this category.
In their nine regular season wins, New York has averaged 4.9 rushing yards per attempt and 175.9 rushing yards per game.
With the help of the right playcalling from Mike Kafka, this duo can take advantage of an exposable Eagles rush defense.
