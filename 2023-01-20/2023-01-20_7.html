     Kyrie Irving drops 48, carries Nets to win with clutch threes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving has himself a day, scoring 48 points on 18-of-29 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds and six assists in the Nets' 117-106 win vs. the Jazz.
That hasn't always been the case during the Nets four game losing streak, but it was on Friday.
"Tonight, [Thursday] night, I'm really observing out there on the court and just watching him," Nets big man Nic Claxton said.
In the process, he helped lift the spirits of his team up and make them believe they can win without Durant.
Irving also noted that he feels he has a strong enough connection with Vaughn to be able to take over when needed.

To be fair, there were possessions where the Jazz bottled up Irving and he still hit tough shots.
