     Sharon Stone surprises on 'SNL,' appears in Sam Smith performance and as skit seductress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One could assume Sharon Stone followed her basic instincts when appearing on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
The Oscar-nominated actress joined the sketch show's musical guest, Sam Smith, for their performance of "Gloria," in which Stone's acting was subtle.
Stone, 64, laid down for part of the performance and then sat up and dramatically stared out into the distance.
Stone previously hosted "SNL" in 1992, the year the thriller "Basic Instinct" hit theatres.
"I'm a little nervous," Stone said at the time, wearing a white minidress with a turtleneck in the style of Catherine Tramell.

     Sam Smith Featured A Choir During A 'Gloria' Performance On 'SNL'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In their second performance of the night, Sam Smith delivered a performance of “Gloria” on the Saturday Night Live stage.
During the performance, Smith was joined by a choir, who delivered beautiful harmonies throughout the song.
/ The world revolves around me / As I lay in my bed / Dreaming of more, more,” sing Smith and the choir on the song’s opening verse.
The performance took place days before their upcoming fourth studio album, also called Gloria, is set for release.
While Smith is largely known for their break-up songs and heartbreak anthems, they said in an interview with Refinery29 that Gloria will be rooted in pure queer joy.

Stone has hosted SNL once, in 1992, shortly after the release of Basic Instinct, which catapulted her to global stardom.
