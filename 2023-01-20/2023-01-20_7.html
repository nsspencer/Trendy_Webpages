     Kevin Durant's Updated Injury Evaluation Timeline Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are struggling without Kevin Durant.
During the TNT broadcast it was revealed that Kevin Durant is still in a knee brace, and will get his next re-evaluation early next week.
There's no definite timetable on when Kevin Durant, but fortunately the Nets have built enough wiggle room record-wise to survive a bit longer with him out.
Despite the four-game losing streak, the Brooklyn Nets are still the fourth seed, 1.5 games out from the second seed, and three games out from a play-in spot.
The key for the Brooklyn Nets is to survive these next two weeks.

     Summary: Ever since superstar Kevin Durant has been out of the lineup with a sprained right MCL, the Brooklyn Nets have started games poorly.
Thursday’s 117-112 loss to the Phoenix Suns was more of the same.
In a game in which the Suns did not have the services of Devin Booker or Chris Paul, the Nets still found a way to start a game on the wrong foot.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn spoke postgame about how Brooklyn didn’t come to play for most of the game:“Yeah, really unfortunate.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets (27-17, fourth in the Eastern Conference) visit Vivint Arena on Friday to take on the Utah Jazz (24-24, sixth in the Western Conference) for the first of two matchups between the teams this regular-season.
The next and final time that these teams will play each other this season will be April 2 in Brooklyn.
Over that span, Brooklyn has struggled to generate offense and they have had poor starts to begin most of their games.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn has urged his players to start games better so that they don’t have to rely on heroics at the end of games to get win.
Brooklyn will have to focus on limiting Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen as he has scored at least 30 points in 11 games this season, most recently against the Clippers.
