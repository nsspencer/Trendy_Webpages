Yet they weren't the only contributors to the action: Five Suns (Damion Lee, Saben Lee, Johnson, Ayton and Bridges) scored at least 15 points in action on the night.

     Kyrie Irving drops 48, carries Nets to win with clutch heroics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving has himself a day, scoring 48 points on 18-of-29 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds and six assists in the Nets' 117-106 win vs. the Jazz.
That hasn't always been the case during the Nets four game losing streak, but it was on Friday.
"Tonight, [Thursday] night, I'm really observing out there on the court and just watching him," Nets big man Nic Claxton said.
In the process, he helped lift the spirits of his team up and make them believe they can win without Durant.
Irving also noted that he feels he has a strong enough connection with Vaughn to be able to take over when needed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ever since superstar Kevin Durant has been out of the lineup with a sprained right MCL, the Brooklyn Nets have started games poorly.
Thursday’s 117-112 loss to the Phoenix Suns was more of the same.
In a game in which the Suns did not have the services of Devin Booker or Chris Paul, the Nets still found a way to start a game on the wrong foot.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn spoke postgame about how Brooklyn didn’t come to play for most of the game:“Yeah, really unfortunate.
Talked about it yesterday, expectations and we just we didn’t come to play the beginning of the game.”ListPlayer grades: Kyrie Irving scores 30 in deceptive 117-112 loss to the SunsListNBA Twitter reacts to Nets' 117-112 loss to the Phoenix SunsStory originally appeared on Nets Wire

     Phoenix native Saben Lee shines in Suns' win over Nets, final game of his 10-day contract

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lee's been averaging 11.3 points, 3.8 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 21.8 minutes for the Suns.
“I didn’t really think like it was pressure to me," Lee said to The Arizona Republic after the game.
The Suns have opened Lee's small window of opportunity as they've been short-handed with multiple players out with injuries.
“Energy, speed, he can defend, he scored the ball today, he played great," Johnson said in the postgame about Lee.
He’s able to defend and stay in front of the ball," Williams said.
