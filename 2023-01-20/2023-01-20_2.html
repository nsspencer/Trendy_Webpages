     Google plans to layoff 12,000 workers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday the company is planning to layoff 12,000 people, becoming the latest tech company to slash jobs after rapid expansion during the pandemic.
The big picture: Tech layoffs started soaring late last year, becoming the new normal for an industry that is slowly losing its appeal.
Microsoft said earlier this week it plans to layoff close to 10,000 workers.
Amazon announced in early January it would cut 18,000 jobs and Salesforce said it plans to layoff 10% of its staff.
The threat of layoffs and instability have only lessened the appeal of these tech jobs, which once seemed immune to the broader economy.

     Google axes 12,000 jobs, layoffs spread across tech sector
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just this month, there have been at least 48,000 job cuts announced by major companies in the sector.
There will be job cuts in the U.S. and in other unspecified countries, according to Pichai’s letter.
Those job cuts are hitting smaller players as well.
While the tech layoffs are “shocking numbers,” their effect on tech industry employment is “nowhere near as bad as what it seems,” said John Blevins, an adjunct professor at Cornell University's business school.
“These workers who were laid off will readily get new jobs,” most likely at smaller tech companies, Blevins said.
