     Google layoffs to hit 12,000 workers, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday the company is planning to lay off 12,000 people, becoming the latest tech company to slash jobs after rapid expansion during the pandemic.
The big picture: Tech layoffs started soaring late last year, becoming the new normal for an industry that is slowly losing its appeal.
“Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth," Pichai wrote on the Google blog.
Microsoft said earlier this week it plans to lay off close to 10,000 workers.
The threat of layoffs and instability have only lessened the appeal of these tech jobs, which once seemed immune to the broader economy.
