    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Congress has yet to take action, Hey Love isn’t waiting around.
Jupiter Next Hotel’s ground-floor botanical garden/bar is recognizing the icon’s day of birth this weekend with a bouffant-sized Dolly-themed party.
OK, Parton’s birthday was officially on Jan. 19—she turned 77—but holding the party on Sunday, Jan. 22, means you have an excuse to leisurely day drink in honor of the Leading Lady of Country.
Like Hey Love’s recent holiday pop-up bars—Halloween’s Black Lagoon and Christmastime’s Sleigh Love—the Dolly Parton Birthday Brunch will feature themed food and drink menus—here, they’ll be nods to the star’s life and career.
Dolly wannabes should definitely tease their hair, unleash the cleavage and load up on sequins for this event.
