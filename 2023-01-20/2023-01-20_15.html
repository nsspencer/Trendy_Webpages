Kirk has been Lawrence’s go-to weapon against man coverage, which will show up this week against the Chiefs man-heavy defense.
LB Devin LloydBack when the Chiefs hosted the Jaguars in Week 10, the main character of Jacksonville’s defense was rookie linebacker Devin Lloyd.
Kansas City had a target on 33’s back the entire game.

     Summary: Negating Mahomes best weapon is the key to forcing adjustments from the star quarterback.
2) Can the Jaguars' offensive line limit Chris Jones?
Josh Allen has been playing like a man possessed in recent weeks and, at his current level, should have the advantage over the Chiefs' offensive tackles.
The Jaguars have a lot going against them, simply due to the fact that they are playing the AFC's best team.
But, this Jaguars team feels like one that is almost made of desity, and I like how the Jaguars match up against the Chiefs' defense.
