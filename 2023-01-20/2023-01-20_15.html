     ‘Cobra Kai’ to End With Season 6 on Netflix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix has picked up a sixth season of Cobra Kai — which will also be its last.
“Making Cobra Kai has allowed us to join the same hallowed dojo once inhabited by the great Robert Mark Kamen, John Avildsen, Jerry Weintraub, and all the amazing original cast members.
“Our day one goal with Cobra Kai has always been to end it on our terms, leaving the Valley in the time and place we’ve always imagined.
At six seasons and 60 or so episodes, Cobra Kai will end as one of the longer-running series on Netflix’s current roster.
Heald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg executive produce Cobra Kai via their Counterbalance Entertainment.

     ‘Cobra Kai’ Is Coming To An End
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cobra Kai Credit: NetflixIf I had to pick my favorite soap opera on TV, I’d probably have to go with Cobra Kai, the Netflix Original sequel series to The Karate Kid.
“Our day one goal with Cobra Kai has always been to end it on our terms, leaving the Valley in the time and place we’ve always imagined.
Because as we all know, Cobra Kai Never Dies.”I still think the first season was the best.

Cobra Kai Season 6 doesn’t have a streaming date yet, but I suspect it will be late 2023 or early 2024.
