     Google layoffs to hit 12,000 workers, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday the company is planning to lay off 12,000 people, becoming the latest tech company to slash jobs after rapid expansion during the pandemic.
The big picture: Tech layoffs started soaring late last year, becoming the new normal for an industry that is slowly losing its appeal.
“Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth," Pichai wrote on the Google blog.
Microsoft said earlier this week it plans to lay off close to 10,000 workers.
The threat of layoffs and instability have only lessened the appeal of these tech jobs, which once seemed immune to the broader economy.

     2023 Layoffs: Google Slashes 12,000 Employees While Wayfair Cuts 1,750
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google’s parent company Alphabet announced plans Friday to cut 12,000 workers, while online furniture retailer Wayfair announced it would lay off 1,750 employees in a company-wide restructuring plan—as fears of a looming recession continue into the new year.
Wayfair announced on Friday it would lay off 1,750 employees, its latest round of cuts in recent ... [+] months and the latest U.S. company to reduce its headcount.
Google parent Alphabet plans to cut around 12,000 jobs worldwide, CEO Sundar Pichai said, citing the need for “tough choices” in order to “fully capture” the huge opportunities lying ahead.
Boston-based furniture e-commerce company Wayfair announced it would cut 10% of its global workforce (1,750 employees), including 1,200 corporate positions, in a move to “eliminate management layers and reorganize to be more agile” amid reduced sales—the company’s latest round of job cuts following it’s decision to cut 870 employees last August.
San Francisco-based software giant Salesforce will reduce its headcount by 10%, or 7,900 employees, CEO Marc Benioff announced in an internal letter, amid a “challenging” economic climate and as customers take a “more measured approach to their purchasing decisions.”
