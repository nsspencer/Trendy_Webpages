     Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator, severely impacted by Alphabet mass layoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Area 120, the Google in-house incubator responsible for products such as Checks, Tables, Stack and ThreadBite, has been significantly affected by broader layoffs at Google parent company Alphabet.
Previously, Area 120 was incubating pilots like the workplace video platform ThreadIt, spectrum marketplace Orion, document scanner Stack, and more.
“Employees in the U.S. who were affected have been notified [of layoffs at Area 120], but in other countries this process will take longer, and is subject to local laws and practices,” the spokesperson added.
Last September, Google canceled half the projects at Area 120 and majorly reduced the program’s staffing.
A source previously told TechCrunch that Area 120 had under 100 employees after the previous round of cuts.

     Summary: Google is cutting 12,000 jobs, adding to a series of Big Tech layoffs in JanuaryEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP Jeff Chiu/APGoogle is the latest tech giant to announce a massive layoff: the company announced on Friday that it is slashing about 12,000 jobs.
The company already has notified affected employees in the United States, CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in an email to all Google employees.
It is not clear how many of those jobs are in the U.S.January has been a brutal month for Big Tech workers.
The layoffs also come as major tech companies like Google pivot to artificial intelligence.

     Google layoffs to hit 12,000 workers, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday the company is planning to lay off 12,000 people, becoming the latest tech company to slash jobs after rapid expansion during the pandemic.
The big picture: Tech layoffs started soaring late last year, becoming the new normal for an industry that is slowly losing its appeal.
“Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth," Pichai wrote on the Google blog.
Microsoft said earlier this week it plans to lay off close to 10,000 workers.
The threat of layoffs and instability have only lessened the appeal of these tech jobs, which once seemed immune to the broader economy.
