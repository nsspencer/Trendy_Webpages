     Joe Burrow's father, mother deliver game ball to Athens pizza restaurant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATHENS, Ohio — A Bengals game ball made its way outside of Cincinnati Thursday night, when Joe Burrow's mother and father surprised customers and staff at Courtside Pizza in Athens, Ohio.
This was the first ever Bengals game ball to be delivered to a business outside the city of Cincinnati since the tradition began last season.
And the Bills definitely have to play us this week," Jimmy said while holding the ball.
"We love Athens, we love Ohio, we love the Bengals and we love all the people, our friends and the people like you guys that show up tonight."
The Bengals play the Bills this Sunday in Buffalo at 3 p.m.

     Quick Hits: The Bengals Connection Between Joe Burrow And Josh Allen; More Numbers As Bengals Court History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen has led the Bills in both passing and rushing yards in four of seven career playoff games.
Allen has averaged 354 offensive yards per game in the playoffs, most in NFL history by any player with at least five postseason games.
He also has a 105 passer rating in the fourth quarter of playoff games, the third highest over the last three decades.
Pushing it down the field, getting rid of it quickly, identifying pressure and replacing it with the ball.
Burrow, he believes, has shown the most improvement this season on his velocity and how quickly he is getting rid of it and seeing the field.

     Bengals' Joe Burrow protectors Alex Cappa, Jonah Williams OUT vs. Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their brand-new offensive line started to look better after a rough start.
Unfortunately, that revamped Bengals line won’t be healthy to protect Joe Burrow against the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round, per Bridget Condon.
“Zac Taylor says LT Jonah Williams and RG Alex Cappa officially OUT for Sunday’s game”Alex Cappa was one of the big acquisitions of the Bengals to improve their offensive line.
Even without the injured Von Miller, the Bills still have a formidable pass-rush to terrorize Joe Burrow and the Bengals.
The good news for the Bengals is that Joe Burrow has also made his own improvements in his decision-making.

     Bengals QB Joe Burrow has a growing list of nick names
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati’s quarterback Joe Burrow came onto the scene in a big way, making it to the Super Bowl in just his second season in the NFL.
This season, he’s continued to turn heads as he led the Bengals to a second consecutive AFC North title.
The Cincinnati Bengals’ Joe Burrow is no different.
After suffering a season ending injury in his rookie season, Burrow returned to take his team to within one win of being crowned NFL champions in 2021.
“Anything that Joe ever did from Day One never seemed like it was forced,” said Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard.

     Sam Hubbard and Joe Burrow: The friendship at the core of Bengals’ renaissance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI — Like most great friendships, the one forged between Sam Hubbard and Joe Burrow developed over meals.
pic.twitter.com/fC3kXj16pp — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) January 17, 2023These meals allowed two Ohio kids playing in a sea of the country’s most talented prospects to connect about similar upbringings, views on taking care of others, attitudes toward football and approaches to leadership and winning.
“I was just telling him about (Bengals head coach Zac Taylor),” Hubbard said.
I know it.’ He embraced that.”When Burrow first came to Cincinnati, any initial whereabouts typically came with Hubbard by his side.
