     Michigan fires co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USA Today SportsShortly after Jim Harbaugh announced that he would be rebuffing any NFL interest and returning to Michigan as their head coach, the school put co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Matt Weiss on paid leave during a criminal investigation by university police.
“After a review of University policies, the athletic department has terminated the appointment of co-offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Matt Weiss,” the statement read.
I have nothing but respect for the University of Michigan and the people who make it such a great place.
He was promoted to co-offensive coordinator with Sherrone Moore this year.
Michigan could again look to the NFL ranks to fill the opening on the offensive staff, although there are plenty of offensive coordinator jobs available at the pro level at the moment.

     Summary: The University of Michigan announced it has fired co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss, who is under investigation by university police for "a report of computer access crimes" at the school's football facility.
Weiss has been the co-coordinator at Michigan for one season and with the school overall for two seasons, both of which ended in the College Football Playoff.
Weiss, 39, acknowledged the "ongoing investigation" in a statement to ESPN on Tuesday and said he's "fully cooperating" with investigators.
"I have nothing but respect for the University of Michigan and the people who make it such a great place.
Weiss' firing means that Michigan will need a new coach at one of the program's most important positions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan has fired co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss amid an investigation by university police following a "report of computer access crimes."
The incident allegedly took place during December 21-23 at Schembechler Hall, the team's football facility, though no additional details have been released by UMPD.
Weiss was initially suspended while the investigation took place and was not involved with either team or recruiting activities, nor was he allowed in team facilities.
Weiss did coach for Michigan in the 2022 Fiesta Bowl against TCU on Dec. 31, 2022.
Prior to Michigan, Weiss spent more than a decade in various roles on the Baltimore Ravens staff under Jim Harbaugh's brother, John.
