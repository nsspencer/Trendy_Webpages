     Twins sent batting champ Luis Arraez to Marlins for Pablo López
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Twins traded reigning AL batting champion Luis Arraez to the Miami Marlins Friday for a three-player package featuring starting pitcher Pablo Lopez.
The 25-year-old Arraez had a breakout season for Minnesota last year, making his first All-Star team while batting a league-best .316 and denying Aaron Judge a Triple Crown.
The Twins also received two prospects from the Marlins: infielder Jose Salas and outfielder Byron Chourio.
Lopez will give the Twins yet more depth to an already deep rotation albeit one that's absent a true ace.
Arraez will add a much-needed bat, especially after Miami traded shortstop Miguel Rojas to the Dodgers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Interest from the Twins ramped up over the past two weeks, and that turned into serious talks around Tuesday.
It helped that the Marlins made the signing of veteran starter Johnny Cueto official on Thursday.
With Alcantara and Cueto atop the rotation, plus Jesús Luzardo (100 1/3 innings in 2022), Trevor Rogers (133), Edward Cabrera (71 2/3) and Braxton Garrett (88), Miami has a surplus of starting pitching.
And that’s not to mention the current and former prospects nearing their returns.

     Summary: After winning his first batting title last year, Luis Arraez has been traded from the Minnesota ... [+] Twins to the Miami Marlins.
(Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) Getty ImagesThe Miami Marlins have added a batting champion to their lineup.
In a Friday afternoon trade, the Marlins acquired Luis Arraez from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for Pablo Lopez, a promising young starting pitcher, minor-league infielder Jose Salas, and another prospect.
It was the first time a reigning batting king was traded since the same team — the Minnesota Twins — traded future Hall of Famer Rod Carew to the California Angels in 1978.
Pitcher Pablo Lopez is the latest acquisition by the Minnesota Twins in their bid for supremacy in ... [+] the American League Central.

     Luis Arraez trade: Twins restock rotation, Marlins make puzzling move
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Marlins are sending pitcher Pablo López (plus a pair of prospects) to the Twins in exchange for reigning batting champ Luis Arraez.
No, López isn’t an ace, but he’s a solid option for the middle of the rotation and a critical piece of depth.
After a lackluster 2022, Minnesota’s had a great month, (re-) locking down Carlos Correa and now getting some needed rotation help through López.
The Twins will miss Arraez, but they needed to bolster their pitching far, far more than they needed his bat.
Arraez is another solid bat, but he lacks the power that the Marlins were missing last season.

     Summary: On Friday, Jan. 20, 2023, the Twins traded reigning AL batting champion Arraez to the Miami Marlins for a three-player package featuring starting pitcher Pablo López.
APIt took a little while for Luis Arraez to find out on Friday that he was being traded to the Miami Marlins.
“I want to see that new uniform.”The Marlins acquiring Arraez is the highlight of a flurry of moves Miami has made over the past two-and-a-half weeks.
The Minnesota Twins’ Luis Arraez bats in a game against the Chicago White Sox on April 22, 2022, in Minneapolis.
Miami Marlins pitcher Pablo Lopez (49) throws the ball during the third inning of an MLB game against the Chicago Cubs at loanDepot park in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida, on Tuesday, September 20, 2022.

     Summary: The Twins are dealing second baseman Luis Arraez to the Marlins in exchange for pitcher Pablo Lopez.
(Michael Reaves/Getty Images)Reigning American League batting champion Luis Arraez is headed to Miami in a deal that brings prized pitcher Pablo López to Minnesota.
A preternatural bat-to-ball talent, Arraez is coming off his best season in the majors, in which he earned his first All-Star nod and led the AL with a .316 batting average.
But the Marlins are planning to play him there — and even move a young talent to the outfield to accommodate it.
The 2022 Twins pitching staff and rotation were below average by park-adjusted ERA-.

     Assessing the Luis Arraez for Pablo López Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Logically the name that made the most sense for a trade was Luis Arraez.
The Rod Carew comps, while lofty, are not exaggerated when it comes to Luis Arraez.
Because of the flaws noted above, it has been a question of how much value Luis Arraez could bring back in a trade.
Luis Arraez just won the American League batting title, appeared in the most games in his career, and posted a career high in fWAR.
It’s impossible to write a Luis Arraez trade reaction piece without talking about how big of a bummer it is to lose Luis Arraez.
