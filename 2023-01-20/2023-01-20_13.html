     Michigan fires co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USA Today SportsShortly after Jim Harbaugh announced that he would be rebuffing any NFL interest and returning to Michigan as their head coach, the school put co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Matt Weiss on paid leave during a criminal investigation by university police.
“After a review of University policies, the athletic department has terminated the appointment of co-offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Matt Weiss,” the statement read.
I have nothing but respect for the University of Michigan and the people who make it such a great place.
He was promoted to co-offensive coordinator with Sherrone Moore this year.
Michigan could again look to the NFL ranks to fill the opening on the offensive staff, although there are plenty of offensive coordinator jobs available at the pro level at the moment.

Weiss, 39, acknowledged the "ongoing investigation" in a statement to ESPN on Tuesday and said he's "fully cooperating" with investigators.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan has fired co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss amid an investigation by university police following a "report of computer access crimes."
The incident allegedly took place during December 21-23 at Schembechler Hall, the team's football facility, though no additional details have been released by UMPD.

Prior to Michigan, Weiss spent more than a decade in various roles on the Baltimore Ravens staff under Jim Harbaugh's brother, John.

Before coaching at Michigan, Weiss was an assistant with the Baltimore Ravens from 2009-20 and had worked with Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh when he was at Stanford.
Harbaugh’s return for the upcoming season comes as he’s in the midst of an impasse with the NCAA over his role in an NCAA investigation into the program.
