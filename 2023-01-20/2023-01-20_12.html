     Summary: We have completed an interview with DeMeco Ryans for our head coaching position.
pic.twitter.com/OYH2I5UNII Buy Texans Tickets — Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) January 21, 2023The Houston Texans have completed an interview with San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans for their coaching vacancy.
Ryans led the 49ers defense starting in 2021 where San Francisco finished as the third total defense and tied for ninth in points allowed.
In 2022, the 49ers were second in total defense and first in points allowed.
The Texans have plenty of familiarity with Ryans as he was their 2006 second-round pick from Alabama.

     Why Texans Should Hire 49ers' DeMeco Ryans as HC amid Latest NFL Coaching Rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Zagaris/San Francisco 49ers/Getty ImagesDeMeco Ryans was a Pro Bowl linebacker who played 10 seasons in the NFL, including his first six with the Houston Texans.
According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Ryans interviewed with the Denver Broncos on Thursday and is scheduled to meet with the Texans on Friday.
The 49ers' defense has been dominant throughout the 2022 campaign, which has put Ryans at the forefront of coaching searches.
It's not a given that Ryans is even the front-runner to become Houston's new head coach.
That's what he was during the latter stages of his playing career, so it makes sense he'd be that way as a head coach, too.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if Ryans is interested in the job, the Texans should make sure they hire him, even if Payton is available.
Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle“They can identify with him,” former Texans coach Gary Kubiak said of Houston fans.
