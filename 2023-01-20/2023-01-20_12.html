     Michigan fires co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss amid investigation for 'computer access crimes'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan has fired co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss amid an investigation by university police following a "report of computer access crimes."
The incident allegedly took place during December 21-23 at Schembechler Hall, the team's football facility, though no additional details have been released by UMPD.
Weiss was initially suspended while the investigation took place and was not involved with either team or recruiting activities, nor was he allowed in team facilities.
Weiss did coach for Michigan in the 2022 Fiesta Bowl against TCU on Dec. 31, 2022.
Prior to Michigan, Weiss spent more than a decade in various roles on the Baltimore Ravens staff under Jim Harbaugh's brother, John.
