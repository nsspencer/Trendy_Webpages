     Nikki Haley teases a 2024 presidential run: 'We need to go in a new direction'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Republican Nikki Haley strongly hinted in an interview that aired Thursday that she might run for president, though stopped short of declaring a bid.
"Yes, we need to go in a new direction," Haley said.
"I don’t think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in D.C.
I think we need a young generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things," she said.
Before serving in federal government, Haley was the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017.

     Summary: United Nations ambassador and former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley said that she will be soon making a decision over whether she will be contesting the presidential elections in 2024 or not.
"Well, when you're looking at a run for president, you look at two things.
Big businesses getting these bailouts, all of these things warrant the fact that, yes, we need to go in a new direction," said Haley.
I don't think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in DC.
I think we need a young generation to come in, step up, and really start fixing things," she stated.

     Nikki Haley hints at 2024 presidential run, while taking a dig at elderly politicians like Trump: 'We need to go in a new direction'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nikki Haley heavily hinted at a 2024 presidential bid in an interview with Fox News.
Haley said politics need to go in a "new direction," adding that she could be the leader to do that.
Nikki Haley dropped strong hints of a 2024 presidential bid on Thursday, calling for a "new direction" and more youthful leadership, despite a past pledge not to run against former President Donald Trump.
In April 2021, Haley said she would not make a bid for the White House in 2024 if Trump was running.
Though Trump is the only Republican to so far announce a 2024 presidential run, his influence on the GOP seems to be faltering amid political and legal troubles.

     ‘I think I can be that leader’: SC’s Nikki Haley further fuels speculation of 2024 run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly two years ago, Nikki Haley told South Carolina reporters she wouldn’t run for president in 2024 should former President Donald Trump seek another term.
But in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Thursday night, the former South Carolina governor further fueled speculation that a 2024 presidential run is in her future.
“Do I think I could be that leader?” Haley posited.
During a 2021 visit to South Carolina State University, Haley said she would not run for the White House in 2024 if Trump ran.
During Thursday’s interview, Haley was pressed on whether she would be launching an exploratory committee.

     Summary: Yes, I think I can be that leader,” Haley said.
During the interview, Haley also emphasised that President Biden, a Democrat, should not be given a second term.
