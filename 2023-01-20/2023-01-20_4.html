     Nikki Haley teases a 2024 presidential run: 'We need to go in a new direction'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Republican Nikki Haley strongly hinted in an interview that aired Thursday that she might run for president, though stopped short of declaring a bid.
"Yes, we need to go in a new direction," Haley said.
"I don’t think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in D.C.
I think we need a young generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things," she said.
Before serving in federal government, Haley was the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017.

     ‘I think I can be that leader’: SC’s Nikki Haley further fuels speculation of 2024 run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly two years ago, Nikki Haley told South Carolina reporters she wouldn’t run for president in 2024 should former President Donald Trump seek another term.
But in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Thursday night, the former South Carolina governor further fueled speculation that a 2024 presidential run is in her future.
“Do I think I could be that leader?” Haley posited.
During a 2021 visit to South Carolina State University, Haley said she would not run for the White House in 2024 if Trump ran.
During Thursday’s interview, Haley was pressed on whether she would be launching an exploratory committee.
