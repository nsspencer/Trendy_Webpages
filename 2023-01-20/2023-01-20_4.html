     Nikki Haley teases 2024 presidential plans: ‘I can be that leader’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is inching closer to running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
The Republican nomination race started to take shape last year after Mr. Trump announced his plans to run a third time for the White House.
Mr. Trump had expected the launch to come on the heels of a red wave in the midterms.
… But stay tuned.”A Morning Consult poll released this week found Mr. Trump is the preferred pick of 48% of GOP voters, followed by Gov.
The survey suggested a lot of GOP voters are unfamiliar with Mrs. Haley.

     ‘I think I can be that leader’: SC’s Nikki Haley further fuels speculation of 2024 run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly two years ago, Nikki Haley told South Carolina reporters she wouldn’t run for president in 2024 should former President Donald Trump seek another term.
But in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Thursday night, the former South Carolina governor further fueled speculation that a 2024 presidential run is in her future.
“Do I think I could be that leader?” Haley posited.
During a 2021 visit to South Carolina State University, Haley said she would not run for the White House in 2024 if Trump ran.
During Thursday’s interview, Haley was pressed on whether she would be launching an exploratory committee.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — Republican Nikki Haley strongly hinted in an interview that aired Thursday that she might run for president, though stopped short of declaring a bid.
"Yes, we need to go in a new direction," Haley said.
"I don’t think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in D.C.
I think we need a young generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things," she said.
Before serving in federal government, Haley was the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017.

Ron DeSantis, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, are among those considered likely to jump into the race.
“I am grateful for my time working with Nikki Haley and her dedicated team,” Chapman said in a statement.
Although neither Pence nor Haley has made a 2024 campaign official, both have given signals they’re inching closer to launching bids.
Haley, who in 2021 told the AP that she “would not run if President Trump ran,” has since shifted course.

     Summary: However, the only survey that's pitted Trump against Haley shows unfavorable odds for the former governor.
Although Trump remains the front-runner in the race, Haley has remained popular in Republican circles, even after leaving office.
If she jumps in, she will be a top-tier candidate," Klink told Newsweek.
"With her credentials alone, she would shake up the Republican race."
At this point, Klink said the 2024 Republican primary remains "incredibly fluid" and that the field has yet to crystalize.

Ms Haley told viewers to “stay tuned” when asked if a decision on 2024 is to be made anytime soon.

If she does indeed run, Haley would become the second candidate in the 2024 GOP race, after former President Donald Trump.
Less than two years ago, in 2021, Haley said she would not run in 2024 if Trump did.
In June 2021, Haley spoke to the Iowa Republican Party's Lincoln Day dinner in West Des Moines.
"I had a great working relationship with the president," Haley began:I appreciate all the foreign policy issues we worked on together.

     Summary: “I am grateful for my time working with Nikki Haley and her dedicated team,” Chapman said in a statement.
What role Chapman would potentially play in a Pence campaign is unclear.
During the 2020 campaign, Pence’s advisers blamed Haley for rumors that she would replace Pence on the ticket.
In a forthcoming memoir, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asserts that Haley was privately jockeying to push out Pence, though Haley has insisted the claims are “lies and gossip.”Further complicating the dynamic between Pence and Haley is the long-term overlap between key parts of their teams.
Jon Lerner, a longtime Republican pollster, served as an adviser to both Haley and Pence during the Trump administration.
