     Florence Pugh in negotiations to star in 'Dune' sequel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Little Women star Florence Pugh is currently in talks to star in Dune: Part Two.
Writer/director Denis Villeneuve hopes to direct the sequel during the summer, which will be based on the second half of the book.
The first film ended with Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) escaping into the Arrakis desert.
From that point on, the book takes a different turn, which means that the second film will be a very different viewing experience from the original.
Pugh is keeping busy, as she will be working on Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer as well playing in a biopic about the singer.
