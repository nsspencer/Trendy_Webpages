     Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer Breakdown: Luke Skywalker, Inquisitors, and Prequel Easter Eggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Could anyone have guessed a decade ago that we’d see Ewan McGregor back as Obi-Wan Kenobi in his very own Star Wars live-action series?
But as old Ben’s greatest pupil says in The Rise of Skywalker, “No one’s ever really gone,” especially when it comes to Disney’s very nostalgic version of the galaxy far, far away.
The six-episode Obi-Wan Kenobi picks up 10 years after the Prequels.
Obi-Wan is still on Tatooine, living in exile while the Empire and the Sith reign supreme.
Check out the trailer below:As you can imagine, the trailer packs quite a few surprises and easter eggs, as well as hints as to where this story might be going.

     The first trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi teases the ultimate Star Wars rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first teaser for the upcoming Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus has arrived, giving a first look at Ewan McGregor’s return as the exiled Jedi.
Obi-Wan Kenobi will pick up with its eponymous hero ten years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith — which saw the Jedi Master take refuge on the desolate planet of Tatooine, both to hide from the Empire’s regime and to keep an eye on the infant Luke Skywalker.
But with Hayden Christensen set to reprise his role as a vengeful Darth Vader — aka, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan’s former apprentice, who was last left beaten and burning in lava by his former friend — it sounds Obi-Wan’s time on Tatooine between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope will be anything but peaceful, as the show sets the stage for the ultimate Star Wars rematch.
Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to debut on Disney Plus on May 25th.

     Obi-Wan Kenobi Trailer: A Defeated Hero Faces The Grand Inquisitor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's where the Grand Inquisitor comes in.
Star Wars fans have seen the Grand Inquisitor before, but only in the animated Rebels series, where he was a much more lithe, sinewy figure.
As the John Williams theme “Duel of the Fates” plays—a reference to Kenobi's pivotal confrontation with with Sith apprentice Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace—we hear the voice of the Grand Inquisitor, who seeks to end Kenobi just as Maul brutally ended Qui-Gon Jinn.
The Inquisitors, which include Reva, a new character played by Moses Ingram, pursue the Jedi with a religious fervor.
The very title “inquisitor” is no accident, calling back to the real world zealots who tortured and tormented “heretics” who challenged the official and powerful Roman Catholic faith.
