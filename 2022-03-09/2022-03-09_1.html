The Orange will take on Florida State today at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
Most experts believe winning the entire ACC tournament is the only chance the team has to get an NCAA tournament bid on Sunday night.
"You never really know what can happen in the ACC tournament and the March Madness tournament so hopefully we can maybe spark a run here.

     HILL: When the ACC Tournament really mattered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not that long ago, the ACC Tournament was a matter of life-or-death for players, coaches and fans.
For 20 years from 1954-1974, only the winner of the ACC Tournament, not the regular season, would get invited to the NCAA Tournament.
Had last weekend been the ACC Tournament finals under the original setup, heavily-favored and nationally-ranked Duke would have been sent home in a massive upset by the Tar Heels who would be the only ACC team in the NCAA Tournament.
The ACC Tournament back then essentially was the equivalent of the first three rounds of the NCAA Tournament today.
Teachers would halt all classes and roll out A/V carts with TVs to watch just two things: a NASA rocket launch and the ACC Tournament.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 3Ben McKeown/Associated PressThe ACC's bubble teams have a clear directive for their second-round games in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday.
The Wake Forest Demon Deacons, Virginia Cavaliers and Virginia Tech Hokies can't afford losses to their respective opponents, who won first-round games Tuesday.
Defeats at the ACC tournament Wednesday could doom the NCAA men's basketball tournament hopes of the two Virginia schools and put Wake Forest in more peril.
As of Wednesday morning, ESPN's Joe Lunardi had Wake Forest on the "Last Four Byes" line, Virginia Tech as one of the "First Four Out" and Virginia in the "Next Four Out" column.
Virginia Tech has revenge on its mind after it lost to the Clemson Tigers to end the regular season, while Virginia and Wake Forest should handle two of the weaker sides in the conference.
