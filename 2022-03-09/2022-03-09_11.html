     Buddy Boeheim suspended for ACC tournament quarterfinal vs. Duke after punch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ACC announced it suspended Buddy Boeheim for an apparent punch of Florida State’s Wyatt Wilkes on Wednesday.
Boeheim wasn’t called for a foul for the punch, but Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said after it should’ve been a flagrant foul.
Boeheim apologized after the game, saying he “was wrong to act out in frustration” and said he apologized to Wilkes personally.
If Syracuse wins, Boeheim’s next game will be Friday in the conference tournament semifinals.
However, if Syracuse loses, Boeheim’s season could be over as the Orange aren’t projected to make the Men’s NCAA Tournament.

“It was wrong to act out in frustration.”Boeheim, the son of Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, leads SU and ranks second in the ACC in scoring this season with 19.3 points per game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston College men’s basketball used a heroic late second half run and a stout performance in overtime to stun the #5-seed Wake Forest Demon Deacons 82-77 in Round 2 of the ACC tournament in Brooklyn, NY.
The victory for the Eagles was a heartbreaker for Wake, who sit squarely on the NCAA tournament bubble and really needed a win to cement their resume.
For the Eagles, the victory represents BC’s first trip to the ACC quarterfinals since the Jerome Robinson/Ky Bowman team of 2018.
With 4:53 to go in regulation, the Eagles trailed 66-59, after Wake Forest ran roughshod over them for much of the second half.
They opened OT on a 6-0 run, hit clutch shots as OT drew down, and hung on for the win.

     Summary: The Syracuse Orange live to play another day after a dominant performance against the lengthy and scrappy Florida State Seminoles.
It seemed as if the Seminoles couldn’t buy a basket, while the Orange seemed to make everything they looked at.
The key component behind the Orange’s performance was their ability to make threes.
As a team, the Orange shot 39 percent from three while the Seminoles shot just 8 percent.
Along with Swider, Buddy Boeheim, Jimmy Boeheim, and Joe Girard all scored in double figures.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To anyone out there who might be writing about this please do everyone a favor and stop saying Boeheim “appears to punch” an opponent.
Did Woody Hayes “appear to punch” the Clemson player when the legendary Ohio State coach was ultimately fired?
You’re safe saying Hayes punched that player and you’re safe saying Boeheim did the same.
Boeheim, a senior and the son of legendary Syracuse head coach Jim, has played 120 games for the Orange in his four seasons.
Assuming Syracuse has any sense about themselves they’ll do the right thing and not have him in uniform again for this ridiculousness.
