     The Last Kingdom Cast on the New Big Bad: ‘Brida is Fierce in Season Five’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There is a great deal of love for Uhtred, because if you don’t really love then you don’t really hate.
She’s still half of his life and all of his madness, as Uhtred described her in season three?
“That’s how I want to see it, definitely.”Uhtred sees Brida in the same way, says Dreymon.
Dreymon laughs, “Brida is fierce in season five, scary!”.
The season five opener finds Brida as happy as she could be, with a cult-like army of followers and a mission from the Gods.

     The Last Kingdom Season 5 review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4 Summary More sneaky politicking, grand battles, and historical drama make the fifth season of The Last Kingdom worth the wait.
This review of The Last Kingdom Season 5 is spoiler-free.
Well, the wait is over, as all ten episodes of The Last Kingdom Season 5 debuted on Netflix on March 9, 2022.
When it comes to the action, both large-scale and more personal, The Last Kingdom Season 5 delivers there too, though it occasionally runs the risk of being a little underlit or overedited.
You can stream The Last Kingdom Season 5 exclusively on Netflix.

     Summary: The Last Kingdom producer Nigel Marchant has revealed that the sequel film Seven Kings Must Die will tell a standalone story.
The Last Kingdom season 5 is set to begin streaming this week, and has also been revealed to be the show's final season.
With that said, however, Seven Kings Must Die will apparently not be existing entirely outside of the Last Kingdom narrative.
