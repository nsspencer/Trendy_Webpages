But hear me out, the Wolverines can’t beat two good teams in a row, right?
Is it reset after the Wolverines beat a bad team?
So, if Michigan beats a good team and then a bad team, the Wolverines can once again beat a good team.
In conclusion, Michigan will beat Indiana, then Illinois, but lose to Iowa in the semifinals.
