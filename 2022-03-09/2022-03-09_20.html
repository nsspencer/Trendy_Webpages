     South Africa’s Aspen signs deal with J&amp;J to sell COVID vaccines
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The South African pharmaceutical company will sell and distribute the vaccines, under its own packaging, across Africa.
South African drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare has announced an agreement with American multinational Johnson &amp; Johnson to package, sell and distribute the latter’s COVID-19 vaccines under its own brand in Africa.
The deal was announced on Tuesday.
Aspen had begun discussions with J&amp;J in November for a licensing deal that would give it the freedom to sell and distribute the vaccine under its own brand.
The announcement comes just as J&amp;J rival Moderna announced it had signed an agreement with Kenya to build its first mRNA facility in Africa.

     Can China Shield Africa From Fallout of Sanctions Against Russia?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Countries in North Africa, such as Egypt, Russia’s top Africa trade partner, are expected to especially feel the impact of the sanctions.
“The magnitude of China’s trade with Africa is already 10 or more times bigger than Russia’s trade with Africa,” said Gruzd.
South Africa exports a lot to China and Russia … so South African companies may be looking to China to make up for disruptions,” he said.
But Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said he didn't think sanctions on Russia would increase China-Africa trade.
“We’ve seen a big divergence on that with South Africa and BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa] on the one end and Kenya on the other,” she added, referring to South Africa’s abstention from last week’s U.N. resolution that Russia withdraw from Ukraine (China also abstained).
