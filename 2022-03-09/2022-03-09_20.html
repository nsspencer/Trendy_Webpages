     Florence Pugh is in Talks to Join the Cast of ‘Dune: Part Two’ as Princess Irulan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you were watching Dune and thought, “this story needs more influence from Louisa May Alcott,” the following news is for you.
Little Women star Florence Pugh is in talks to join her former costar Timothée Chalamet in Dune: Part 2, meaning Laurie and Amy’s story may not be over, it’s just getting transported to the desert planet of Arrakis.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Pugh is being considered for the role of Princess Irulan Corrino, Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV’s oldest daughter, who gets romantically involved with Chalamet’s Paul Atreides.
As of now, the casting hasn’t been confirmed as the script is reportedly still being written, and Pugh is waiting to see the draft.
It’s hard to forget how Dune promoted Zendaya’s role in the first film, only to include her on screen for just seven minutes.

     Florence Pugh's Dune 2 Casting Would Be Perfect (Thanks To Chalamet)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's believed that Florence Pugh is in talks to join Dune: Part Two as Princess Irulan and her casting would be a perfect one thanks to Timothée Chalamet.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: Dune Secretly Revealed House Atreides' Key Weakness: How It Impacts Part 2Pugh's Dune casting as Irulan would be perfect.
With Timothée Chalamet in the lead as Paul Atreides, Pugh would potentially play his (future) wife.
As Irulan in the books is romantically involved with Paul, she'd likely share several scenes with Timothée Chalamet in what would mark their second collaboration.
Pugh as Irulan would be excellent for Dune: Part Two, but it would also be a perfect way to make use of her previous work with Chalamet.
