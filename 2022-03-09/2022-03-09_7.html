     CJ Egan-Riley Receives 7/10 From Man City Boss Pep Guardiola After Champions League Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola rated CJ Egan-Riley's Champions League debut as a solid 7/10 after watching him help Manchester City keep a clean sheet against Sporting Lisbon.
With Joao Cancelo ill and Kyle Walker suspended, Guardiola started the 19-year-old at right-back and he played the full 90 minutes the Etihad Stadium.
The pressure on Egan-Riley was reduced slightly by the fact City started the game with a 5-0 lead from the first leg in Portugal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Summary: Manchester City's goalkeeper Scott Carson, left, replaces Manchester City's goalkeeper Ederson during the Champions League round of 16 second leg soccer match between Manchester City and Sporting Lisbon at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.
(AP Photo/Dave Thompson) APWith Manchester City's progress to the Champions League quarterfinals never in doubt, even backup goalkeeper Scott Carson could be brought off the bench for his first appearance in the competition in 17 years.
On a rare Sporting attack, the former England goalkeeper denied Paulinho on his first Champions League appearance since featuring for Liverpool in a 2-1 victory over Juventus in April 2005.
This season, the Premier League leader is hoping to make the Champions League final for a second straight time as it looks to win the European Cup for the first time.
In the night's other last-16 second leg, Karim Benzema scored a hat trick as Real Madrid rallied to beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1.

91st min: Sterling goes down in the box but no penalty despite the appeals, before Mahrez's magic feet fashion a shot.
87th min: Mahrez has a free-kick on target, but easily saved, in the most interesting thing that's happened in the last 10 minutes.
29th min: Sporting have enjoyed their best spell of the game - a couple of minutes of pretty much unbroken passing.
23rd min: Jesus goes down again in the box, and again the referee waves the appeals away.
