     Man City do not fear Premier League sides in the Champions League - Guardiola
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Like City and Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are already assured of their place in the quarterfinals.
They will be joined by four teams from United, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Lille, Juventus, Villarreal, Benfica and Ajax when the final last-16 ties are completed next week.
"The four teams in the last eight already are not bad at all," Guardiola said.

91st min: Sterling goes down in the box but no penalty despite the appeals, before Mahrez's magic feet fashion a shot.
87th min: Mahrez has a free-kick on target, but easily saved, in the most interesting thing that's happened in the last 10 minutes.
29th min: Sporting have enjoyed their best spell of the game - a couple of minutes of pretty much unbroken passing.
