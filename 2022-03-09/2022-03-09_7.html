     Damaged Chernobyl Nuclear Plant, Occupied by Russia, Loses Outside Power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian government officials said Wednesday that damage by Russian forces had left the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant “disconnected” from outside electricity, leaving the site of the worst nuclear accident in history dependent on power from diesel generators and backup supplies.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over the condition of the decommissioned plant, where workers have safeguarded nuclear waste since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.
Russian troops have occupied the facility since the early days of the invasion last month.
Part of the reason is that the used fuel assemblies are old and not as dangerous as they once were.
“The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement.

     Ukraine Warns of Power Outage at Chernobyl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The remains of Chernobyl's main reactor building and site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government says the Chernobyl nuclear power facility now controlled by Russia has lost power, threatening the cooling of radioactive material stored there and risking radioactive leakage.
The organization late Tuesday said that it was no longer receiving data transmission from its systems at the Chernobyl nuclear facility for monitoring activities there.
Nuclear power plants typically have backup power.
It couldn’t immediately be determined if the Chernobyl facility had such backup or if it was operational.

     Nuclear Experts Say Power Cut at Chernobyl Not Cause for Panic, Yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian officials called for a cease-fire on Wednesday after warning that the sole electrical grid supplying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (CNPP) had been damaged amid the combat around Kyiv, the latest nuclear incident in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion.
Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed that the power disruption at the site, which remains dormant decades after its historic disaster, could potentially lead to another nuclear crisis.
“Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP,” Kuleba said.
Though fears tied to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster remain vivid for many people, some experts say that the impact of Russia’s war on the plant is not yet cause for panic.
The end of Europe,” said Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy while denouncing Russia’s attack on the site.

     EXPLAINER: What's behind latest scare at Chernobyl plant?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, fears arose that spent nuclear fuel would overheatWhen fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, some feared that spent nuclear fuel would overheat.
Ukrainian electrical grid operator Ukrenerho said power was cut to all Chernobyl facilities and the diesel generators have fuel for 48 hours.
But that’s “pretty unlikely in the situation because the fuel is so cool,” said Edwin Lyman, nuclear power safety director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODSWhen fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot.
Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.

     Summary: 2/2 — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 9, 2022The IAEA also said Tuesday that it had lost contact with monitoring systems that transmit data on nuclear material at the Chernobyl plant.
“The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon,” it added.

Ukraine’s armed forces conducted combat and first aid training drills on Feb. 5 in an abandoned town near the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said.
