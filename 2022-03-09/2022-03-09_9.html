     What a Power Cutoff Could Mean for Chernobyl’s Nuclear Waste
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nuclear fuel has been removed from all of them, and the turbines and other equipment that generated power have mostly been removed.
This is what happened at the Fukushima reactors in Japan in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami wiped out backup power systems.
But Chernobyl carries some other risks related to the large amount of nuclear waste on site.
As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, the fuel removed from all four Chernobyl reactors over the years, more than 20,000 assemblies in all, is stored in pools of water that dissipate the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively.
If the water in storage tanks got so hot it boiled off, the fuel would be exposed to the air and could catch fire.

     Nuclear Experts Say Power Cut at Chernobyl Not Cause for Panic, Yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian officials called for a cease-fire on Wednesday after warning that the sole electrical grid supplying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (CNPP) had been damaged amid the combat around Kyiv, the latest nuclear incident in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion.
Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed that the power disruption at the site, which remains dormant decades after its historic disaster, could potentially lead to another nuclear crisis.
“Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP,” Kuleba said.
Though fears tied to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster remain vivid for many people, some experts say that the impact of Russia’s war on the plant is not yet cause for panic.
The end of Europe,” said Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy while denouncing Russia’s attack on the site.

     Summary: 2/2 — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 9, 2022The IAEA also said Tuesday that it had lost contact with monitoring systems that transmit data on nuclear material at the Chernobyl plant.
“The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon,” it added.

Ukraine’s armed forces conducted combat and first aid training drills on Feb. 5 in an abandoned town near the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said.

     EXPLAINER: What's behind latest scare at Chernobyl plant?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Wednesday, March 9, 2022 3:35 pmWhen fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, some feared that spent nuclear fuel would overheat.
Ukrainian electrical grid operator Ukrenerho said power was cut to all Chernobyl facilities and the diesel generators have fuel for 48 hours.
But that’s “pretty unlikely in the situation because the fuel is so cool,” said Edwin Lyman, nuclear power safety director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODSWhen fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot.
Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.

     Chernobyl nuclear plant disconnected from power grid as Russian, Ukrainian FMs to meet in Turkey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ukrainian state-run energy company Ukrenergo said Wednesday that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine has been disconnected from the power grid.
"The nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was fully disconnected from the power grid.
"Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chernobyl NPP (Nuclear Power Plant).
However, the United Nations nuclear watchdog denied any critical safety risk after receiving the Ukrainian report about the loss of power at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on Wednesday.
The Chernobyl nuclear plant, some 110 km north of Kiev, suffered one of the worst nuclear accidents in human history on April 26, 1986.
