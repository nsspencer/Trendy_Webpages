     Look: Buddy Boeheim Appears To Cheap Shot FSU Player In Chest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Syracuse basketball star Buddy Boeheim appeared to take a cheap shot on Florida State guard Wyatt Wilkes during the first half of today’s ACC Tournament matchup.
ESPN’s broadcast clearly captured video of Boeheim, the son of Orange head coach Jim Boeheim, striking Wilkes in the chest with his fist as he ran back on defense.
Wilkes folded over in what looked like some serious pain after the shot.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last week we asked Syracuse Orange fans a series of questions to take your pulse of the year and future of the program.
Let’s start with the ACC Tournament and many of you aren’t feeling confident about the Orange’s chances this week in Brooklyn.
We asked how games Syracuse would win and here are the results:None 53%, One game 40%, Two games 2%, Three games 2%, and 3% expect the Orange to cut down the nets in Barclays Center.
Next question was about the immediate future of the Orange and whether or not they’d find themselves ranked at any point next season.

     Syracuse Basketball: Stupidity on social media has reached all-time high
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’m all for free speech, and I always respect the opinions and takes of my fellow Syracuse basketball fans, even when I adamantly disagree with them.
Some Syracuse basketball fans are really, really angry these days, which is understandable.
Boeheim has the second-most wins all-time as a Division I men’s basketball head coach.
If you want a new head coach, that’s all good, and you’ll be getting one at some point in the future.
But to suggest that Boeheim has done nothing for the Syracuse basketball program over the past four-plus decades is an ignorant, comical, disrespectful and totally misinformed statement.
