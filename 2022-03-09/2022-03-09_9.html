     ‘Black Panther’ Director Ryan Coogler Mistaken for Bank Robber in Atlanta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bank of America has apologized to the director Ryan Coogler after he was assumed to be a bank robber and briefly handcuffed by the police while trying to withdraw money from a branch in Atlanta in January.
Mr. Coogler, best known for directing “Black Panther,” had handed a teller a withdrawal slip on Jan. 7, asking for more than $10,000, with a note on the back asking her to “be discreet when handing him the cash,” according to a police report.
Mr. Coogler also had his California state ID card as well as his Bank of America card when he approached the teller.
Both Mr. Coogler and the teller are Black.
The teller “received an alert notification” from Mr. Coogler’s account and quickly advised her manager that he was trying to rob the bank branch in the Buckhead section of Atlanta, the report states.
