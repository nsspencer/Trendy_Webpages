     CJ Egan-Riley Receives 7/10 From Man City Boss Pep Guardiola After Champions League Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola rated CJ Egan-Riley's Champions League debut as a solid 7/10 after watching him help Manchester City keep a clean sheet against Sporting Lisbon.
With Joao Cancelo ill and Kyle Walker suspended, Guardiola started the 19-year-old at right-back and he played the full 90 minutes the Etihad Stadium.
The pressure on Egan-Riley was reduced slightly by the fact City started the game with a 5-0 lead from the first leg in Portugal.

     Man City do not fear Premier League sides in the Champions League - Guardiola
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola says Manchester City do not fear drawing a Premier League side in the quarterfinals of the Champions League despite being knocked out of the competition by an English team in three of the last four campaigns.
Like City and Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are already assured of their place in the quarterfinals.
They will be joined by four teams from United, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Lille, Juventus, Villarreal, Benfica and Ajax when the final last-16 ties are completed next week.
"The four teams in the last eight already are not bad at all," Guardiola said.
"Now it's time to congratulate everyone, focus on the Premier League then next week we will see the draw."

     Summary: 93rd min: Sterling hits the side netting but should do better!
91st min: Sterling goes down in the box but no penalty despite the appeals, before Mahrez's magic feet fashion a shot.
87th min: Mahrez has a free-kick on target, but easily saved, in the most interesting thing that's happened in the last 10 minutes.
29th min: Sporting have enjoyed their best spell of the game - a couple of minutes of pretty much unbroken passing.
23rd min: Jesus goes down again in the box, and again the referee waves the appeals away.
