     Amazon Is Splitting Its Stock. Why It Wants a Lower Share Price.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com shares are moving sharply higher in after-hours trading after the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant declared a 20-for-1 stock split and announced an expanded stock-repurchase program.
While stock splits don’t mathematically create any value for holders—they’re the financial equivalent of cutting a pie into smaller pieces—retail investors tend to like them, and split announcements often trigger short-term rallies.
And, in fact, Amazon shares (ticker: AMZN) were up 6.3% to $2,962 in premarket trading Thursday.

     Amazon Jumps on Plan to Split Stock, Buy Back Up to $10 Billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com Inc. is planning to split its stock for the first time in more than two decades in a move that will end an era of four-digit stock prices for the biggest U.S. technology companies.
Amazon intends to boost its outstanding shares by a 20-to-1 ratio, under a plan disclosed late Wednesday, joining other technology giants like Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. who have turned to splits to make their stocks more attractive to retail investors.
That news combined with a $10 billion share-buyback authorization sent Amazon shares up as much as 11% in New York postmarket trading.

     Amazon's stock is about to get much, much cheaper
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Amazon shares are about to get 20 times less expensive.
The company announced Wednesday its board approved a 20-for-1 stock split, its first split since 1999.
If the stock split were to happen today, Amazon's stock would be worth $139 a share.
Companies split their stocks for numerous reasons: Splits can put their stock within the reach of smaller, individual investors.
It helps companies gain liquidity and splits can create more demand for a company's stock.

     Amazon announces 20-for-1 stock split, $10 billion buyback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon announced its first stock split since the dot-com boom, telling investors on Wednesday that they'll receive 20 shares for each share they currently own.
Amazon is the latest highly valued tech company to pull down the price of each share through a split.
In mid-2020, Apple disclosed plans for a four-for-one split, and Tesla told investors it was instituting a five-for-one split.
Historically, Amazon has relied on generous stock awards to attract talent, but the shares underperformed in 2021, and employees have pressured the company to make changes.

     Amazon follows Google in issuing 20-to-1 stock split — Quartz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s the first time the stock has split in more than 20 years during which the company’s share price has risen 50-fold.
If approved by Amazon shareholders, the 20-to-1 stock split will drastically reduce the tech giant’s notoriously expensive share price.
That should entice new retail investors, and perhaps even earn it a spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The online search and advertising giant Alphabet, parent company of Google, proposed a 20-to-1 split just last month.
The benefits of such membership might be a small but meaningful boost if the goal is to attract more retail investors.

     What Amazon's historic stock split really means for shareholders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Come June 6, if you owned one share of Amazon stock, you will own 20.
Amazon's board approved a 20-1 stock split Wednesday, which will reduce the price of Amazon shares by issuing a bunch of new shares to existing shareholders, making Amazon worth exactly the same as it was previously, just with more shares worth less money.
Amazon's shares nonetheless jumped 6% on the news, because investors have collectively convinced themselves that stock splits are a reason to pay more for a stock.
A long time ago, when retail investors were a more significant factor in stock trading, companies split their stocks to make single shares more affordable.
Update: This story has been corrected on March 9, 2022, to note the correct date of Amazon's stock split and clarify the status of its stock buyback.
