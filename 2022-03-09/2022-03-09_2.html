     At the Bottom of an Icy Sea, One of History’s Great Wrecks Is Found
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mensun Bound, the expedition’s exploration director and a marine archaeologist who has discovered many shipwrecks, said Endurance was the finest he had ever seen.
The ship was found about four miles south of the last location recorded by Shackleton’s captain and navigator, Frank Worsley.
The search had been conducted over a wide area to account for errors in Worsley’s navigation equipment.
Endurance’s relatively pristine appearance was not unexpected, given the cold water and the lack of wood-eating marine organisms in the Weddell Sea that have ravaged shipwrecks elsewhere.
Aside from a few technical glitches involving the two submersibles, and part of a day spent icebound when operations were suspended, the search proceeded relatively smoothly.

     Summary: He added that he had “never ever seen a wreck as bold and beautiful as this,” in the 30 years he had spent working on shipwrecks.
The Weddell Sea’s cold temperatures of the would have played a key role in preserving the ship, said Dan Snow, a British historian whose content platform History Hit partnered with the expedition team to document the discovery.
The ship’s discovery comes 100 years after Shackleton’s death in 1922.
Endurance was found at a depth of 3008 meters in the Weddell Sea.

     Ernest Shackleton's Endurance ship found in Antarctica after 107 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) — More than a century after it sank off the coast of Antarctica, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship HMS Endurance has been located, apparently intact and in good condition.
However, due to the extreme conditions, the ship got stuck amid thick, impenetrable ice in the Weddell Sea.
The 28 men on board, including Shackleton himself, abandoned the Endurance and set up rudimentary camp facilities on board ice floes that were floating northward.
The discovery team departed from Cape Town on the South African polar research and logistics vessel, S.A. Agulhas II.
The Endurance22 was named in honor of the original Endurance, with the current year at the end.

     Summary: Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance is Found9th Wednesday, March 2022 - 10:55 UTC Full article“We are overwhelmed by our good fortune in having located” Endurance, Mensun Bound, Director of Exploration, said.
Photo: Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust and National GeographicThe Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust confirmed on Wednesday that the Endurance22 Expedition has located the wreck of Endurance, Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship which has not been seen since it was crushed by the ice and sank in the Weddell Sea in 1915.
Donald Lamont, Chairman of the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust, said:Our objectives for Endurance22 were to locate, survey and film the wreck, but also to conduct important scientific research, and to run an exceptional outreach programme.
The Expedition team, and the officers and crew of the S.A. Agulhas II, have been simply outstanding.
In the Weddell Sea, Endurance never reached land and became trapped in the dense pack ice and the 28 men on board eventually had no choice but to abandon ship.
