     Cameron Diaz Reveals the Lesson Husband Benji Madden Taught Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Happy Birthday Cameron Diaz!
RewindBenji Madden is an artist, husband and dad—but we might want to add life coach to the list, too.
And that's because Cameron Diaz, who has been married to the rocker since January 2015, recently opened up about the lesson she's learned from her hubby throughout the years—and it's all about taking care of self.
"He's really taught me to value myself a lot more," she said during the March 8 episode of Michelle Visage's Rule Breakers podcast.
For Cameron, who welcomed daughter Raddix with Benji in December 2019, putting their marriage first comes as an easy choice.

     Cameron Diaz Says She Barely Thinks About Her Appearance Since Retiring From Acting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameron Diaz seems to really be enjoying her retirement from acting.
And while I’m obviously very happy for her, it is sad to know we will never get another Nancy Meyers collab.
On Michelle Visage’s Rule Breakers, a BBC podcast, in an episode released this week, Diaz opened up about her decision to leave acting behind.
On the podcast Diaz, whose current project is the wine brand Avaline Wine, said that retiring from acting has freed her from the burden of constantly worrying about her looks.
“I am absolutely a victim to all of the societal objectification and exploitations that women are subjected to,” Diaz says.
