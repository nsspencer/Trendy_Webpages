     The first trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi teases the ultimate Star Wars rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first teaser for the upcoming Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus has arrived, giving a first look at Ewan McGregor’s return as the exiled Jedi.
Obi-Wan Kenobi will pick up with its eponymous hero ten years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith — which saw the Jedi Master take refuge on the desolate planet of Tatooine, both to hide from the Empire’s regime and to keep an eye on the infant Luke Skywalker.
But with Hayden Christensen set to reprise his role as a vengeful Darth Vader — aka, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan’s former apprentice, who was last left beaten and burning in lava by his former friend — it sounds Obi-Wan’s time on Tatooine between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope will be anything but peaceful, as the show sets the stage for the ultimate Star Wars rematch.
Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to debut on Disney Plus on May 25th.

     When is the Obi-Wan Kenobi trailer coming out? Twitter post suggests it's “imminent”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So when General Kenobi finally tweeted for the first time on March 9, fans took notice:It’s not exactly a confirmation that the Obi-Wan Kenobi trailer is coming, but for Star Wars fans, those two words speak volumes.
But why does this tweet mean the first trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi is coming?
When is the Obi-Wan Kenobi trailer coming out?
The company often reveals new trailers and footage at these events, so it seems the Kenobi trailer could appear online soon afterward.
Oh, and Entertainment Weekly just revealed a big Obi-Wan Kenobi feature with new images and interviews from the show.

     New Star Wars Villain Confirmed for Obi-Wan Kenobi Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it comes to Star Wars in 2022, there’s no bigger event than the return of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The Jedi Master stars in his own Disney+ series that picks up 10 years after the events of Revenge of the Sith.
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan is still in exile on Tatooine, watching over young Luke Skywalker from afar…until the time is right.
Either way, the odds are certainly stacked against the beloved Jedi Master.
The show will introduce a brand new Inquisitor to the Star Wars universe: Reva, who is played by Moses Ingram (The Queen’s Gambit).

     Watch the first trailer for Obi-Wan, the next Star Wars Disney Plus show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first trailer for Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ewan McGregor’s Jedi master watches over young Luke Skywalker, while combating the Empire however he can.
The trailer includes a few glimpses of Obi-Wan’s life on Tatooine, but it’s more focused on his new missions as the protector of the Skywalker children.
The trailer is light on details, but as Obi-Wan heads off-world, Sith Inquisitors — the Empire’s Force-sensitive Jedi hunters who also fight with lightsabers — are on his tail, and action ensues.
Along with McGregor and Christensen, Obi-Wan Kenobi will also introduce several new actors to the Star Wars universe, such as Kumail Nanjiani, Bennie Safdie, Rupert Friend, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and Sung Kang.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, which will run for six episodes, premieres on Disney Plus on May 25.

     Summary: (Seriously, she was a card-carrying member of the Star Wars Fan Club when she had no other real reason to own a wallet.)
If we didn’t know we were staring into the face of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, we might have looked right past him.
The Grand Inquisitor arrives.
Now, the circular tool of the demonic-looking Grand Inquisitor joins the arsenal.
In Star Wars, and an all-around sci-fi nerd who always has just one more question in an inexhaustible list of curiosities.
