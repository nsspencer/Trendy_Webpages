     Power loss at Chernobyl is worrying, but it’s not an immediate threat, the U.N. says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over a loss of power at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, but left clear that the situation around the site of the world’s largest nuclear power disaster was deteriorating.
Losing electricity means the potential loss of the ability to keep the water that cools radioactive material circulating.
But the agency added that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient, even without continuous power to the plant.
The shelling last week of a different, operating nuclear power facility led to calls from President Biden to the embattled president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Mr. Biden later denounced the military action, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex in southern Ukraine, as “reckless,” one of a series of nuclear hazards that have been created by the invasion.

     Ukraine Sees Risk of Radiation Leak at Chernobyl, IAEA Sees 'No Critical Impact' on Safety

     Summary: By Natalia ZinetsLVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Wednesday there was a danger of a radiation leak at the Chernobyl nuclear power station after electricity was cut off to the plant, but the U.N. nuclear watchdog saw "no critical impact on security".
Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 136 Images"After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent," he said on Twitter.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Twitter that the "development violates (a) key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply" but that "in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety."
The IAEA had warned on Tuesday that the systems monitoring nuclear material at the radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl had stopped transmitting data.
"The power cut could lead to water in the storage facility evaporating and exposure of spent fuel rods.

     Summary: Ukraine reports power cut at the Chernobyl nuclear plant as IAEA says outage has no ‘critical impact’ on safety.
Ukraine has appealed to Russia for a temporary ceasefire to allow repairs to be made to a power line to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, warning that there could be a radiation leak if the electricity outage continued.
After that, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,” he wrote on Twitter.

     Ukraine Warns of Power Outage at Chernobyl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The remains of Chernobyl's main reactor building and site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government says the Chernobyl nuclear power facility now controlled by Russia has lost power, threatening the cooling of radioactive material stored there and risking radioactive leakage.
The organization late Tuesday said that it was no longer receiving data transmission from its systems at the Chernobyl nuclear facility for monitoring activities there.
Nuclear power plants typically have backup power.
It couldn’t immediately be determined if the Chernobyl facility had such backup or if it was operational.

Ukraine’s armed forces conducted combat and first aid training drills on Feb. 5 in an abandoned town near the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said.
