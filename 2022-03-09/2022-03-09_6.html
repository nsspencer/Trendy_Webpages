     Chernobyl power supply cut but IAEA says no imminent safety threat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant, but the UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern.
Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said the power supply to the Chernobyl plant failed on Wednesday morning, and the national power company Ukrenergo said it was impossible to restore the power lines because of fighting in the surrounding areas.
The nuclear energy company Energoatom said in a post on the Telegram messaging app: “Emergency diesel generators are switched on at the site to supply power to safety-critical systems.
This process is slow and mitigations should be straightforward.”Acton said the risks at Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants were much higher than at Chernobyl.
One of Ukraine’s four functioning nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe, is under Russian control after it was fired on with artillery.

     Ukraine Warns of Power Outage at Chernobyl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The remains of Chernobyl's main reactor building and site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government says the Chernobyl nuclear power facility now controlled by Russia has lost power, threatening the cooling of radioactive material stored there and risking radioactive leakage.
The organization late Tuesday said that it was no longer receiving data transmission from its systems at the Chernobyl nuclear facility for monitoring activities there.
Nuclear power plants typically have backup power.
It couldn’t immediately be determined if the Chernobyl facility had such backup or if it was operational.

     Summary: Ukraine reports power cut at the Chernobyl nuclear plant as IAEA says outage has no ‘critical impact’ on safety.
Ukraine has appealed to Russia for a temporary ceasefire to allow repairs to be made to a power line to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, warning that there could be a radiation leak if the electricity outage continued.
After that, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,” he wrote on Twitter.

The Chernobyl plant was seized by Russian forces on February 24, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

     EXPLAINER: What's behind latest scare at Chernobyl plant?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Wednesday, March 9, 2022 3:35 pmWhen fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, some feared that spent nuclear fuel would overheat.
Ukrainian electrical grid operator Ukrenerho said power was cut to all Chernobyl facilities and the diesel generators have fuel for 48 hours.
But that’s “pretty unlikely in the situation because the fuel is so cool,” said Edwin Lyman, nuclear power safety director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODSWhen fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot.
Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.

     Summary: 2/2 — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 9, 2022The IAEA also said Tuesday that it had lost contact with monitoring systems that transmit data on nuclear material at the Chernobyl plant.
“The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon,” it added.

Ukraine’s armed forces conducted combat and first aid training drills on Feb. 5 in an abandoned town near the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said.

     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine — They met in high school but became a couple years later, after meeting again on a dance floor at a Ukrainian nightclub.
They shared a country home with friends, and Ms. Perebyinis was a dedicated gardener and an avid skier.
The Perebyinis family had already been displaced once by war, in 2014, when they were living in Donetsk in the east and Russia fomented a separatist uprising.
Through the night, Mr. Perebyinis had tried to monitor his wife’s location using a locator app on their phones.
After hostilities began, the crossing point closed and Mr. Perebyinis was trapped in the East.
