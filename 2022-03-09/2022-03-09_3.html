     At the Bottom of an Icy Sea, One of History’s Great Wrecks Is Found
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mensun Bound, the expedition’s exploration director and a marine archaeologist who has discovered many shipwrecks, said Endurance was the finest he had ever seen.
The ship was found about four miles south of the last location recorded by Shackleton’s captain and navigator, Frank Worsley.
The search had been conducted over a wide area to account for errors in Worsley’s navigation equipment.
Endurance’s relatively pristine appearance was not unexpected, given the cold water and the lack of wood-eating marine organisms in the Weddell Sea that have ravaged shipwrecks elsewhere.
Aside from a few technical glitches involving the two submersibles, and part of a day spent icebound when operations were suspended, the search proceeded relatively smoothly.

     WATCH: Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton’s sunken ship found after a century
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Scientists say they have found the sunken wreck of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton’s ship Endurance, more than a century after it was lost to the Antarctic ice.
An expedition set off from South Africa last month to search for the ship, which was crushed by ice and sank in November 1915.
Mensun Bound, director of exploration for the Endurance22 expedition, said footage revealed the ship to be in remarkably good condition.
But his successful bid to reach help at a remote South Atlantic whaling station and rescue his men is considered a heroic feat of endurance.
The expedition to find the ship comes 100 years after Shackleton’s death in 1922.
