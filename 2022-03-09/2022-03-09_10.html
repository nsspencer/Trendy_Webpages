     Skateboarder Tony Hawk suffers broken femur injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk shared to his Instagram on Tuesday that he broke his femur this week and is recovering in the hospital from the injury.
Hawk did not provide a recovery timeline as it is still too soon after his injury.
Hawk posted to Instagram on Tuesday stating that the injury happened the day prior.
“I’ve said many times that I won’t stop skating until I am physically unable,” Hawk’s Instagram caption reads.
I’ll be back … maybe not at full capacity but I resigned to that notion years ago as I approached ‘mid-life.’”TMZ Sports reported that Hawk’s injury was from a skating accident.

     Summary: Tony Hawk is on the mend.
The 53-year-old professional skateboarder shared an update on Instagram about a recent injury, which he said will be difficult to recover from due to its severity.
I’ve said many times that I won’t stop skating until I am physically unable.
A broken leg – with plenty of hardware – will probably be the biggest test of that creed.
We are wishing Tony Hawk a speedy recovery.

     Skateboarding icon Tony Hawk breaks leg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN DIEGO (KSWB) – Skateboarding icon Tony Hawk said he broke his leg Monday, but the San Diego native is determined to return to the board even if not at “full capacity” again.
Hawk said he expects his recovery to be more challenging than in the past due to the severity of the injury and his age.
“Yesterday sucked,” Hawk wrote in a tweet.
“The answer is complicated, but ultimately it’s because I have found my sense of purpose and shaped my identity through skating, and it nourishes my mental health immensely,” Hawk wrote.
But, he concedes, his broken leg will be a major test.
