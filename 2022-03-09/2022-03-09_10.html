     Ryan Reynolds' Father's Death Inspired Emotional Adam Project Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Reynolds recently shared that the personal tragedy of his father's death inspired an emotional moment in his new film, The Adam Project.
But where Free Guy was a riotous action jaunt into the world of video games, The Adam Project features more emotional gut-punches throughout its sentimental time travel plot.
The Adam Project also stars Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana.
Levy recently warned prospective The Adam Project viewers in an interview to prepare themselves for the emotional moments weaved throughout the film, teasing that Reynolds will deliver "one of his greatest dramatic performances ever," and that the actor brought impressive "emotional authenticity" to his The Adam Project role.
Audiences can look forward to seeing Ryan Reynolds' powerful, real-life-inspired performance when The Adam Project debuts on Netflix.
