     Ben Simmons' Status For Nets-76ers Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets will be in Philadelphia to play the 76ers on Thursday night, which is the first time the two teams will play since their blockbuster trade last month.
The Nets sent James Harden and Paul Milsap to the 76ers in exchange for Seth Curry, Andre Drummond, Ben Simmons and draft picks.
For the game, Simmons has been ruled out, so he will not be playing against his former team (see injury report below).
However, the three-time NBA All-Star is expected to be on the Nets bench in the arena, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium (see tweet below).
The Nets come into the game with a 33-33 record in 66 games, which has them as the eight seed in the Western Conference.

     Summary: On Thursday night, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Brooklyn Nets will meet for the fourth and final time during the regular season.
When the two teams meet once again in South Philly on Thursday, Harden will don Sixers threads while Ben Simmons will be with his new teammates on the other end.
Although he mentioned he hoped to play in Thursday's game, Simmons has yet to take the court for the Nets on game night.
Earlier this week, it was reported that Simmons intends to join his Nets teammates on the bench on Thursday night.
Simmons Knows What to ExpectOn Tuesday, Brooklyn's head coach Steve Nash mentioned he believes it will be good for Simmons to finally face a hostile Philly crowd.

     Latest Kyrie Irving Woj bomb brings full-time optimism to Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets have dealt with a lot of moving pieces within their roster the past few weeks.
Another piece that has contributed to the Nets’ lack of stability this season is Kyrie Irving.
ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski shared his thoughts on the topic on NBA Today.
On NBA Today, Woj said there’s “optimism” around the Nets, league office, and players association that Kyrie Irving will be full-time.
“Certainly you’ve seen a progression in the mayor’s office of alleviating restriction but still the performer restriction that keeps Kyrie Irving out hasn’t changed.”For now, the Nets continue to play their home games without Irving.

     Summary: Tuesday night in Charlotte after a 132-121 win over the Hornets, the first question Durant received was about Irving’s stunningly surgical 50-point night, and he did the same.
And it was just incredible, incredible performance.
There was just under a minute to go in the game when Irving maneuvered his way into the lane, hung through contact, and dropped in the finish to hit 50.
But it was consistently Irving who came up with the answer to dull the Charlotte momentum.
Those were really big shots he made in the second half but overall it’s just an incredible player, shotmaker.”

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — With the Nets set to face former teammate James Harden for the first time since he forced last month’s trade, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant aren’t sure they could’ve said or done anything to change his mind about leaving.
“Now I’m answering questions about what happened, or whether or not things could’ve gone better or not.
If that’s what James wanted, then I respect his decision and that’s just what it is.
He also said he’s not certain there’s anything that could’ve convinced Harden to stay long term.
“It’ll be a different feeling to play against him soon after the trade, but exciting,” Nets coach Steve Nash said.

That put a lot of pressure on Harden to lead the Nets, but it seemed tiring for the 32-year-old.
Durant was asked about facing Harden for the first time and whether he could have convinced The Beard to stay in Brooklyn.

If they can put it together, one can assume the Nets will battle Harden and the Sixers for supremacy in the Eastern Conference.

“I’m sure Philly fans and people watching the game and media think this is somewhat of a budding rivalry.
It was a good run, one coach Doc Rivers said would justify a tribute video if the Sixers opt to give Simmons one.
But Philadelphia fans — who once booed and threw snowballs at Santa Claus at a football game — can probably make Thursday’s situation work.
With Embiid playing at an MVP level and Harden providing an immediate boost, the Sixers are second in the East.

     Summary: On Tuesday night, Kyrie Irving had one of the top performances of the season for the Brooklyn Nets in their win 132-121 over the Charlotte Hornets.
Irving dropped 50 points on an absurd 15-for-19 from the field, and 11-for-13 from the free-throw line, nine of his field goals came from beyond the three-point line.
Not satisfied with just his 50 points, Irving chipped six assists and three rebounds to seal off a double-digit dub.
Kyrie Irving has the most 50 point-games in Nets’ franchise history.
This was a big win for the Nets, as the Hornets are one of their nearest rivals in the Eastern Conference playoff race.

     – NBA roundup: Sixers, Nets clash for first time since trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James Harden and Kyrie Irving will go head-to-head on the court, their explosive partnership having flamed out in just 13 months.
A month after Harden and Simmons were swapped in a blockbuster NBA trade, Brooklyn visits Philadelphia on Thursday in what’s more than just perhaps the most-hyped game of the stretch run.
It’s unclear exactly when Harden soured on the Nets after only joining them in January 2021.
With Embiid playing at an MVP level and Harden providing an immediate boost, the Sixers are second in the East.
The Nets are eighth and appear headed for the play-in rounds, though they showed how dangerous they can be when Irving scored 50 points on just 19 shots in a victory at Charlotte on Tuesday.
