    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BERLIN -- Inge Deutschkron, a Holocaust survivor who hid in Berlin during the Third Reich to escape deportation to Nazi death camps and later wrote an autobiography, has died.
“A long life of fighting for justice and against anti-Semitic and right-wing tendencies in our society has come to an end,” the Inge Deutschkron Foundation said in a written statement.
“The death of Inge Deutschkron fills me with deep sadness," Steinmeier said in a statement, adding that she "rendered outstanding services to our country, to her country.
We will never forget her.”“Despite everything that was done to her by Germans, Inge Deutschkron did not turn her back on Germany.
After years on the run and in hiding, Deutschkron collapsed at the end of the war when the German capital was taken by the Soviet Red Army.
