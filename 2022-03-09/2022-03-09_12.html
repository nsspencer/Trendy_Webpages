     Summary: latest-newsEintracht Frankfurt and Olympique Lyon have taken big steps towards the quarter-finals of the Europa League with away victories at Real Betis and Porto in the first leg of their round of 16 ties.
Home keeper Claudio Bravo kept his side alive heading to Frankfurt for next week's second leg with a string of fine saves, including from a second half Rafael Borre penalty.
Lyon struck the only goal in Porto just before the hour when Moussa Dembele's clever assist set up Lucas Paqueta to secure a 1-0 win.
The remaining first leg ties, including Barcelona v Galatasaray, are on Thursday.

     Summary: And they will face a Barca side that has rejuvenated itself under new coach Xavi Hernandez.
The Europa League is still Barcelona's only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season and there remains a defensive fragility that will offer opponents encouragement.
Europa League kingsIn the other enticing tie of the round, Europa League specialist Sevilla hosts English side West Ham in the first leg.
Sevilla, who has won the Europa League four times in the last eight seasons, will face a West Ham side which is battling for a trophy.
"That performance will give us a lot of belief and hopefully we can take that into the Europa League now," Noble said on the club's website.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertising Read moreTheir last-16 tie against West Ham starts at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Thursday, pitting two of the tournament’s favourites against each other in the first round of the knock-out stage.
But while West Ham have enjoyed an impressive season in the Premier League, where until recently they were challenging for the top four, Sevilla’s Europa League pedigree is unparallelled.
And in the Champions League, they disappointed, failing even to qualify from a group they could have won, which featured Lille, Salzburg and Wolfsburg.
CRISTINA QUICLER AFP/FileIn his first season at Sevilla, Lopetegui led them to Champions League qualification, twice, by finishing fourth in La Liga and then winning the Europa League too.
The regret is not that Sevilla might win the Europa League again, which would be another momentous achievement, but that for a while it seemed they could do even more.

     Summary: West Ham enters the matchup having won just one game in its last five matches.
They lost their previous Europa League tie against Dinamo Zagreb but still advanced due to their lead in aggregate scoring.
With all that in mind, here are three bold predictions for West Ham in the first leg of their Europa League Round of 16 battle against Sevilla.

"I want to show everyone outside England what West Ham can do.
West Ham travel to Spain with the availability of several key players in doubt, most notably Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice.
A repeat performance and Fornals is in no doubt that West Ham can give Sevilla a real test.

“We’re excited, we want to win titles and now we’re in the Europa League.
We have to continue winning but we also want to win playing well.
The first is to qualify for the Champions League next season and the other is winning the Europa League,” Xavi added.

     Summary: Brazilian Lucas Paqueta scored the winner as Lyon took a step towards the Europa League quarter-finals on Wednesday with a 1-0 first-leg victory at Porto.
Paqueta produced the game's deciding moment just before the hour mark after a disappointing first half, collecting Tanguy Ndombele's pass and slotting home.
There was more drama deep into stoppage time, as Porto defender Chancel Mbemba had an effort ruled out for offside.
The Bundesliga club took an early lead through Filip Kostic, before Nabil Fekir levelled for Betis in the 30th minute.
The other last-16 first legs take place on Thursday, including Barcelona's match against Galatasaray at Camp Nou.
