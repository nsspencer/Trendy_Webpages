     Giant parachuting ‘Joro’ spiders set to invade eastern U.S. this summer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just when winter’s cold is loosening its grip and people start venturing outdoors for some warm-weather R&amp;R, a plague of giant spiders is forecast to start falling from the sky across parts of the eastern United States this summer.
Hatchlings of the Joro spider (Trichonephila clavata) take to the air using self-made parachutes, silken webs spun to catch air currents and float to whatever distant earthbound destination they’ll eventually call home.
We call it freaky, and even the people who came up with the spider’s “Joro” nickname in its native Japan must’ve agreed.
It’s small consolation that these spiders are huge enough that people can at least see them coming.
While no one can say for sure how they set up shop in the U.S., researchers believe the spiders arrived as spindly stowaways on seabound shipping containers.

     Giant spiders expected to drop from sky across the East Coast this spring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An invasive species of spider the size of a child's hand is expected to “colonize” the entire East Coast this spring by parachuting down from the sky, researchers at the University of Georgia announced last week.
Why it matters: Large Joro spiders — millions of them — are expected to begin “ballooning” up and down the East Coast as early as May.
Researchers have determined that the spiders can tolerate cold weather, but are harmless to humans as their fangs are too small to break human skin.
The Joro spider is native to Japan but began infiltrating the U.S. in 2013, concentrating in the southeast and specifically Georgia, according to NPR.

     Summary: Come back when you’re ready, and we’ll talk about what these spiders—they’re called joro spiders, by the way—are actually like.
Are joro spiders venomous?
Joro spiders are all legs, and if you include outstretched legs in your measurement, the adults measure about three inches wide.
Joro spiders, originally from Japan, have been living in Georgia since 2013.
AdvertisementBut joro spiders aren’t expected to cause any significant damage or disruption.

     Will giant Joro spiders parachute their way into N.J. and other northern states?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you are terrified of spiders, you might freak out when you hear about the potential East Coast invasion of a giant, eight-legged bug called the Joro spider.
Researchers say the Joro spider, a large spider that proliferated in Georgia in 2021, could spread to much of the East Coast.
And so far, there’s no evidence the Joro will damage any trees or plants, “although their large webs might have negative aesthetic effect.”This photo shows a female Joro spider.
(Courtesy/ Christina Butler via WikiMedia Commons)Last year, the Joro spider’s wide golden web took over yards, porches and power lines all across northern Georgia, unnerving some residents.
Experts say the Joro spider was first seen in the southeastern United States in 2013, likely hitching a ride on a cargo container from Asia.

Part of me would fear Joro spiders actually hunt in packs and several other Joros would jump me the minute I took a swing at their friend.
That should help people all up and down the East Coast sleep better at night.
