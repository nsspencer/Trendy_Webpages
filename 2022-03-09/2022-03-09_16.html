     Amazon Announces 20-for-1 Stock Split and $10 Billion Buyback Plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com shares are moving sharply higher in after-hours trading after the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant declared a 20-for-1 stock split and announced an expanded stock-repurchase program.
While stock splits don’t mathematically create any value for holders—they’re the financial equivalent of cutting a pie into smaller pieces—retail investors tend to like them, and split announcements often trigger short-term rallies.
And, in fact, Amazon shares (ticker: AMZN) are up nearly 7% on the news, at $2,978.

     Amazon announces 20-for-1 stock split, $10 billion buyback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.Com Inc., during the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Washington, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021.
Amazon announced its first stock split since the dot-com boom, telling investors on Wednesday that they'll receive 20 shares for each share they currently own.
The company also said the board authorized it to buy back up to $10 billion worth of shares.
Amazon is the latest highly valued tech company to pull down the price of each share through a split.
In mid-2020, Apple disclosed plans for a four-for-one split, and Tesla told investors it was instituting a five-for-one split.

     Amazon board approves 20-for-1 stock split, the first since before the dot-com bust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)Amazon’s board has approved the company’s first stock split in more than two decades.
Subject to shareholder approval, the 20-for-1 split would revalue Amazon’s individual shares, aiming to make them more affordable for individual investors, recognizing the long-term increase in the company’s share price.
The change will take effect in June if shareholders approve the split at the company’s annual meeting in May.
The company has split its stock three times before, all of them in the late 1990s, prior to the dot-com bust: a 2-for-1 split in June 1998; a 3-for-1 split in January 1999; and a 2-for-1 split in September 1999.
Amazon offers restricted stock units as part of its standard pay package for corporate and tech employees.

     Amazon Shares Rise After Company Announces 20-For-1 Stock Split, $10B Buyback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon stock rose 7% in after-hours trading after the tech company announced a 20-for-1 stock split and a $10 billion share buyback authorization.
Shares in the company have been comfortably above $3,000 throughout 2021 before slumping this year along with those of many other tech firms.
A stock split reduces the share price and boosts liquidity, but it does not change the value of the company.
The stock split and buyback are both subject to shareholder approval at the company’s annual meeting on May 25.
Splits as large as 20-for-1 are fairly uncommon, but such scale is possible for a company with the resources of Amazon.

     Amazon to split stock for the first time since the dot-com boom, after gains of more than 4,500%
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares have gained 4,579.2% since Amazon last split its stock in 1999, according to Dow Jones Market Data, pushing per-share prices to nearly $2,800.
The stock split could make Amazon more palatable as a possible addition to the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.00% , which avoids companies with high per-share prices.
If that price were just evenly divided by 20, the per-share price would drop to about $139.28.
Prices could rise before the split, however; Amazon shares gained 5.6% between the announcement of its first stock split on April 27, 1998, and the actual split, which occurred on June 2 of that year, according to Dow Jones Market Data group.
To preserve continuity, changes are rare,” S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices states on its website.
