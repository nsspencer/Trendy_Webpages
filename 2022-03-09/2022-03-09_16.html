     Tony Hawk Suffers a Severe Injury in Skating Accident

     Summary: Tony Hawk is on the mend.
The 53-year-old professional skateboarder shared an update on Instagram about a recent injury, which he said will be difficult to recover from due to its severity.
I’ve said many times that I won’t stop skating until I am physically unable.
A broken leg – with plenty of hardware – will probably be the biggest test of that creed.
We are wishing Tony Hawk a speedy recovery.

     Summary: SAN DIEGO (KSWB) – Skateboarding icon Tony Hawk said he broke his leg Monday, but the San Diego native is determined to return to the board even if not at “full capacity” again.
Hawk said he expects his recovery to be more challenging than in the past due to the severity of the injury and his age.
“Yesterday sucked,” Hawk wrote in a tweet.
“The answer is complicated, but ultimately it’s because I have found my sense of purpose and shaped my identity through skating, and it nourishes my mental health immensely,” Hawk wrote.
But, he concedes, his broken leg will be a major test.
