     Summary: And they will face a Barca side that has rejuvenated itself under new coach Xavi Hernandez.
The Europa League is still Barcelona's only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season and there remains a defensive fragility that will offer opponents encouragement.
Europa League kingsIn the other enticing tie of the round, Europa League specialist Sevilla hosts English side West Ham in the first leg.
Sevilla, who has won the Europa League four times in the last eight seasons, will face a West Ham side which is battling for a trophy.
"That performance will give us a lot of belief and hopefully we can take that into the Europa League now," Noble said on the club's website.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertising Read moreTheir last-16 tie against West Ham starts at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Thursday, pitting two of the tournament’s favourites against each other in the first round of the knock-out stage.
But while West Ham have enjoyed an impressive season in the Premier League, where until recently they were challenging for the top four, Sevilla’s Europa League pedigree is unparallelled.
And in the Champions League, they disappointed, failing even to qualify from a group they could have won, which featured Lille, Salzburg and Wolfsburg.
CRISTINA QUICLER AFP/FileIn his first season at Sevilla, Lopetegui led them to Champions League qualification, twice, by finishing fourth in La Liga and then winning the Europa League too.
The regret is not that Sevilla might win the Europa League again, which would be another momentous achievement, but that for a while it seemed they could do even more.

     Summary: West Ham enters the matchup having won just one game in its last five matches.
They lost their previous Europa League tie against Dinamo Zagreb but still advanced due to their lead in aggregate scoring.
With all that in mind, here are three bold predictions for West Ham in the first leg of their Europa League Round of 16 battle against Sevilla.

     Summary: And, on their way to winning the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1981, they beat West Ham.

If West Ham go out to Sevilla, it will at least be preferable to ignominious exits to Astra Giurgiu.
Southampton beat Inter Milan, six years after their Champions League win.
Perhaps West Ham will advance to get a still more glamorous meeting with Barcelona.

And they also impressed in their Europa League knockout stage clash with Napoli, drawing in the first leg but blowing the Serie A giants away in the second leg.
Barca have never won the Europa League, largely because they are usually in the Premier League, but they are being rated as favourites as many given their recent form.
We have a lot of excitement, it’s not the Champions League but it’s a European competition.
We are in a very good dynamic and it has to be hard to get out of it.

     Summary: March 9 (Reuters) - Barcelona are in a good place at the moment and are looking to win the Europa League to make up for a difficult start to the season, midfielder Frenkie de Jong said on Wednesday.
Although the Europa League is a step down from Barcelona's usual standards, it represents a chance to finish the season on a positive note.
"We're excited, we want to win titles and now we're in the Europa League.
We have to continue winning but we also want to win playing well.
The first is to qualify for the Champions League next season and the other is winning the Europa League," Xavi added.

"I want to show everyone outside England what West Ham can do.
West Ham travel to Spain with the availability of several key players in doubt, most notably Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice.
A repeat performance and Fornals is in no doubt that West Ham can give Sevilla a real test.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even before the draw was made Patrick van Aanholt had an inkling what the Europa League round of 16 might have in store for him and his Galatasaray teammates.
Perhaps, Van Aanholt felt he was destined to meet up with the team he had followed from afar while growing up in 's-Hertogenbosch.
We have a very good team and we proved it in the group stage of the Europa League.
After all, Van Aanholt notes, they were not among the favorites to escape from a Europa League quartet of Lazio, Marseille and Lokomotiv Moscow.
Certainly Elabdellaoui's remarkable return to the field puts a Europa League campaign in perspective.
