     Will Ferrell helps lighten Warriors' mood as skid ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Will Ferrell emailed Steve Kerr a while back, and the Warriors coach didn’t believe it was really the actor writing.
A few exchanges later, Ferrell was warming up with Golden State on a night the Warriors needed a little fun and lightheartedness to forget their recent funk.
Klay Thompson scored 20 points after the comedy star surprised him and teammates before the game, and Golden State snapped a five-game skid by beating the LA Clippers 112-97 on Tuesday.
I’m very thankful for that film.”He added, “That was so cool, dreams do come true.”Kerr knew it meant a lot.
“As many games as we can get is huge, obviously,” Curry said of getting Green back before the playoffs.

     Will Ferrell Crashes Warriors' Warm-Ups in Costume as Semi-Pro Character: 'He's Hilarious'

     Summary: The actor dressed as his character Jackie Moon from the 2008 hit basketball comedy Semi-Pro while warming up with the Golden State WarriorsWill Ferrell just reprised his character Jackie Moon from the 2008 hit basketball comedy Semi-Pro in a fitting — but unlikely — venue.
Ferrell wore a sweatband and dressed in a Flint Tropics jersey as he warmed up with the team.
The Flint Tropics are the fictional team at the center of the comedy film, and Moon is their coach and owner.
The outlet noted that Thompson, 32, is a fan of the movie and actually dressed as the character for Halloween a few years ago.
I was actually surprised, his form, he actually had some good rotation on the ball, and endless energy.

     Summary: Star shooter Klay Thompson broke into a huge smile when he saw Ferrell cross the court to greet him.
Ferrell also hit a half-court shot and set up shop on the free throw line where he worked on his foul shots alongside Warriors star Stephen Curry, shooting underhand, much like former Warriors star Rick Barry used to do in his playing days.
Thompson, who has endured multiple injuries over the last three seasons, also said “Semi-Pro” helped him while he recovered.
“That movie, ‘Semi-Pro,’ during my rehabilitation, when I’d have some dark days, I would just put that movie on and it would make me smile, so I’m very thankful for that film,” he added.
Will Ferrell shows Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry a lesson in how too shoot free throws.

The Warriors star, who has been mired in a horrible slump, was surprised when Ferrell came on to the court to warm up with him dressed as Moon.
Thompson, who scored 20 points in the win, spoke afterward about how Ferrell and "Semi-Pro" helped him get through the tough times during two long rehabs.
Head coach Steve Kerr told reporters postgame that Ferrell emailed him and the two came up with the idea executed Thursday.
Now, it's up to Kerr, Thompson and Curry to keep the good times created by Moon's visit going.

     Will Ferrell's 'Jackie Moon' Brings Unexpected Fun in Warriors' Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thompson added, "That was so much fun — some of the most fun I've had on the court this year."
You may recall that Thompson did a little cosplay on Halloween 2018 when he dressed up as Ferrell's Jackie Moon.
Thompson's season highs include a 33-point game against the Los Angeles Lakers in February, where he shot nearly 55% in a Warrior's 117-115 win.
"And that’s not necessarily a change for the worse," The Ringer said, noting that prior to this season, Thompson ranked 65th in three-point attempts.
Given the Warriors' recent defensive struggles, Thompson's "D" has been closely watched, and is considered critical to the Warriors' playoff success.

     Summary: Will Ferrell dressed up as one of his classic characters and joined a professional NBA team.
Ferrell played the role of Jackie Moon in the 2008 film Semi-Pro, which follows a comedic tale of Moon owning his own basketball team.
So, it seemed perfectly reasonable that Will Ferrell was joining the NBA team, since technically, he did own a basketball team, even if it was fictional.
“That was so cool, dreams do come true.” But how exactly did Ferrell have the opportunity to join the NBA team?
The team Moon owns is called the Flint Michigan Tropics, and is a terrible basketball team.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Energized from the opening tip, Golden State pressured the ball, spread the floor, made the extra pass and cruised to a 20-point lead late in the second quarter.
In doing so, Golden State snapped a five-game skid and, at least for the time being, quieted doomsday chatter.
Total fouls: L.A. Clippers 12, Golden State 20.
Finally, after months without multiple key players, Golden State is poised to be at full strength for the first time this season.
But even as it waits for important reinforcements, Golden State is still making strides.
