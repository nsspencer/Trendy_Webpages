     'The Adam Project' review: Or, why I can't stand Ryan Reynolds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Reynolds is an extremely talented human being.
I saw The Adam Project (available on Netflix starting March 11) about a month ago at an early preview.
After some very deep internal reflection, I think I know what’s wrong with Ryan Reynolds.
You might as well just take The Adam Project and rename it Ryan Reynolds Movie #3.

     Review: In ‘The Adam Project,’ a blockbuster therapy session
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pathos and action are found in equal parts in “ The Adam Project,” the latest attempt by Netflix to create the kind of throwback blockbuster that you might have paid to see in movie theaters.
In “The Adam Project,” we’re introduced to a 40-something Adam (Reynolds) in the middle of a space chase.
Adult Adam isn’t there for young Adam, he just needs to treat his wound before going to look for his wife (Zoe Saldaña).
In other words, “The Adam Project” should have taken a note from one of its own lessons: The only way to save the future is to reconcile with the past.
“The Adam Project,” a Netflix release out Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for “Language, violence, action and suggestive references.” Running time: 106 minutes.

     'The Adam Project' Review: 'Flight of the Navigator' for the Marvel Generation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doane Gregory/NetflixThe Adam Project is about a guy time-traveling back to meet himself as a kid, which is perfect because it's basically a trip back to the family adventures of the 1980s.
Ryan Reynolds stars as a wisecracking time-flyer in Netflix's breezy but heartfelt version of ET, Back to the Future and Flight of the Navigator for the Marvel era.
Before the bad guys start shooting, The Adam Project explores how young Adam is dealing with the loss of his father.
Of course, nobody really cares about the time travel stuff.
If your kids want some zippy sci-fi action and you need a break from superheroes, The Adam Project is worth making time for.

     The Adam Project Review

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Adam Project debuts on Netflix on March 11, 2022.
The Adam Project is this generation’s The Last Starfighter.
He's the perfect young Adam to Reynolds' future Adam, and he’s definitely one to watch.
On the surface, The Adam Project is another attempt to hook us with nostalgia.
Throw in a handful of epic action scenes and an almost-lightsaber and The Adam Project gives us a sci-fi epic that will really take you back.

     Review: Recycled ideas keep time travel flick ‘The Adam Project’ stuck in the past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the question undertaken rather literally in Shawn Levy’s clever time travel flick “The Adam Project.”Levy and star Ryan Reynolds recently collaborated on “Free Guy,” and “The Adam Project,” written by Jonathan Tropper, T.S.
“The Adam Project” is doubly quippy with the presence of Walker Scobell, who plays Young Adam to Reynold’s Big Adam, and matches him beat for beat when they meet in their respective timelines.
AdvertisementBig Adam comes from 2050, and he’s crash-landed in 2022, in his old backyard, where Young Adam, a twerpy tween who’s too smart by half, is trying to survive age 12.
“The Adam Project” is clearly inspired by films like “Back to the Future” and “The Terminator,” both directly referenced in the script.
What makes “The Adam Project” unique is its grounded aesthetic, the woodsy, organic landscape of the Pacific Northwest offering a backdrop for the super high-tech futuristic weapons of invisible planes and light saber bow staffs.

     ‘The Adam Project:’ Ryan Reynolds Leads Strong Cast in Fun Throwback Pic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Adam Project stars Ryan Reynolds as Adam Reed, a future pilot who flies through a wormhole to travel into the past.
And Ryan Reynolds, as he did with Free Guy, makes this material work against all odds.
If The Adam Project has a flaw, then it’s that it must eventually provide closure to the time-travel narrative.
But The Adam Project eventually wears thin in a VFX-heavy final confrontation that isn’t nearly as fun as the film’s world building.
Still, come to The Adam Project for Ryan Reynolds.
