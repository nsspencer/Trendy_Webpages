    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Wearing Wednesday red just like her father wore Sunday red, Sam Woods shined bright while introducing her father, Tiger, for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
The oldest of Tiger Woods' two children cracked jokes and was unbroken when talking about difficult times she has shared with her father.
Also inducted was former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and three-time U.S. Women's Open champion Susie Maxwell Berning.
Tiger Woods was still wearing his Sunday red after finishing runner-up in the 2007 U.S. Open at Oakmont in Pennsylvania.
"I had this burning desire to be able to express myself in this game of golf," Woods said.
