     Frankfurt, Lyon, shine in Europa League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: latest-newsEintracht Frankfurt and Olympique Lyon have taken big steps towards the quarter-finals of the Europa League with away victories at Real Betis and Porto in the first leg of their round of 16 ties.
Home keeper Claudio Bravo kept his side alive heading to Frankfurt for next week's second leg with a string of fine saves, including from a second half Rafael Borre penalty.
Lyon struck the only goal in Porto just before the hour when Moussa Dembele's clever assist set up Lucas Paqueta to secure a 1-0 win.
The remaining first leg ties, including Barcelona v Galatasaray, are on Thursday.

     Struggling Galatasaray faces rejuvenated Barca in Europa League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And they will face a Barca side that has rejuvenated itself under new coach Xavi Hernandez.
The Europa League is still Barcelona's only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season and there remains a defensive fragility that will offer opponents encouragement.
Europa League kingsIn the other enticing tie of the round, Europa League specialist Sevilla hosts English side West Ham in the first leg.
Sevilla, who has won the Europa League four times in the last eight seasons, will face a West Ham side which is battling for a trophy.
"That performance will give us a lot of belief and hopefully we can take that into the Europa League now," Noble said on the club's website.

     Sevilla return to Europa League against West Ham wondering what might have been
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertising Read moreTheir last-16 tie against West Ham starts at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Thursday, pitting two of the tournament’s favourites against each other in the first round of the knock-out stage.
But while West Ham have enjoyed an impressive season in the Premier League, where until recently they were challenging for the top four, Sevilla’s Europa League pedigree is unparallelled.
And in the Champions League, they disappointed, failing even to qualify from a group they could have won, which featured Lille, Salzburg and Wolfsburg.
CRISTINA QUICLER AFP/FileIn his first season at Sevilla, Lopetegui led them to Champions League qualification, twice, by finishing fourth in La Liga and then winning the Europa League too.
The regret is not that Sevilla might win the Europa League again, which would be another momentous achievement, but that for a while it seemed they could do even more.

     Paqueta gives Lyon Europa League victory in Porto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brazilian Lucas Paqueta scored the winner as Lyon took a step towards the Europa League quarter-finals on Wednesday with a 1-0 first-leg victory at Porto.
Paqueta produced the game's deciding moment just before the hour mark after a disappointing first half, collecting Tanguy Ndombele's pass and slotting home.
There was more drama deep into stoppage time, as Porto defender Chancel Mbemba had an effort ruled out for offside.
"Porto are a good team with good players but, in my opinion, we deserved to win," said Lyon coach Bosz.
The Bundesliga club took an early lead through Filip Kostic, before Nabil Fekir levelled for Betis in the 30th minute.

     Summary: And, on their way to winning the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1981, they beat West Ham.
That was a quarter-final and they meet the serial Europa League winners Sevilla in the last 16 now.
If West Ham go out to Sevilla, it will at least be preferable to ignominious exits to Astra Giurgiu.
Southampton beat Inter Milan, six years after their Champions League win.
Perhaps West Ham will advance to get a still more glamorous meeting with Barcelona.

     Summary: Barcelona are in a good place at the moment and are looking to win the Europa League to make up for a difficult start to the season, midfielder Frenkie de Jong said on Wednesday.
Although the Europa League is a step down from Barcelona’s usual standards, it represents a chance to finish the season on a positive note.
“We’re excited, we want to win titles and now we’re in the Europa League.
We have to continue winning but we also want to win playing well.
The first is to qualify for the Champions League next season and the other is winning the Europa League,” Xavi added.

     Summary: Thursday's Europa League round of 16 tie between Sevilla and West Ham (airing on Paramount+) brings with it something of a divergence in the respective continental heritage of these two sides.
"I want to show everyone outside England what West Ham can do.
West Ham travel to Spain with the availability of several key players in doubt, most notably Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice.
A repeat performance and Fornals is in no doubt that West Ham can give Sevilla a real test.
It would be disrespectful for West Ham if he's not in the next England squad.

And they also impressed in their Europa League knockout stage clash with Napoli, drawing in the first leg but blowing the Serie A giants away in the second leg.
Barca have never won the Europa League, largely because they are usually in the Premier League, but they are being rated as favourites as many given their recent form.
We have a lot of excitement, it’s not the Champions League but it’s a European competition.
We are in a very good dynamic and it has to be hard to get out of it.
