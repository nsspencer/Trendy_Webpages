     Elon Musk Shares Mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto Tweet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk has shared a relatively old Satoshi-related meme about his or her name formation being tied to the largest Asian companies and corporations, like Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi and Motorola.
By combining parts of those companies, users can form the name "Satoshi."
ToSHIBA meme appearsSome crypto community members also noticed that part of the Toshiba company's name contains "SHIB" in it and immediately pointed that out.
However, Toshiba has no ties to the famous memecurency that gained around 1,000% during the bullrun on the cryptocurrency market.
Others created their own versions of the meme and recreated Elon Musk's name from the names of brands like CoComelon, Mars, Musketeers and others.

     Elon Musk Floats New Conspiracy Theory About The Identity Of Elusive Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto - Tesla Motors (TSLA)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person(s) who developed apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has taken a 'conspiracy' spin on how the name came into being.
What Happened: Musk took to Twitter to highlight that the name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ is apparently derived from the names of four companies – Samsung Electronics, Toshiba Corp. (OTC:TOSYY), Nakamichi Corp. and Motorola.
Some theorists have insisted Satoshi Nakomoto is more than one person hiding behind the pseudonym.
It may be noted that Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) co-creator Billy Markus goes by the username of “Shibetoshi Nakamoto” on Twitter.
Those wondering if the elusive Satoshi Nakomoto would respond to Musk’s tweet should note that the last time a message was posted with this pseudonym was in December 2010.

     Summary: Elon Musk, the cryptonian CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has tweeted out a theory of who is Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s inventor, to his 77 million followers.
According to Musk, Satoshi Nakamoto is not actually a person, but a group of some of the biggest tech companies.
It would make us bother to google Nakamichi (pioneered cassettes, got disrupted by CDs, now does Shockwafe Ultra stereos).
More disciplined than a monk, in a self-sacrifice of sorts or statement whereby he remains unknown nearly a generation on.
One of them maybe even being you Mr Musk.

     Summary: Elon Musk's tweet on Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, sent Twitter into a conspiracy theory overdrive.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk has added fuel to fire with his tweet on Bitcoin developer ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’.
Several people have claimed to be ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’, the famed Japanese coder and developer, but the identity was never confirmed.
Speculations are rife that despite the Japanese pseudonym, Nakamoto is possibly not Japanese and may also be a team and not just one individual.
