     Summary: Galatasaray faces tough Barcelona test in Europa LeagueISTANBULGalatasaray travels to Camp Nou on March 10 to play Barcelona in a Europa League last 16th match amid efforts to put its season back on track.
Torrent is no stranger to Barcelona, having worked at the Catalan club as an assistant to Pep Guardiola.
“Barcelona is currently one of the most in-form teams in Europe and the world,” he said.
The Europa League is still Barcelona’s only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season, and there remains a defensive fragility that will encourage opponents.
Aso in the Europa League, Sevilla, which has won the Europa League four times in the last eight seasons, will face a West Ham side that is battling for a trophy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertising Read moreTheir last-16 tie against West Ham starts at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Thursday, pitting two of the tournament’s favourites against each other in the first round of the knock-out stage.
But while West Ham have enjoyed an impressive season in the Premier League, where until recently they were challenging for the top four, Sevilla’s Europa League pedigree is unparallelled.
And in the Champions League, they disappointed, failing even to qualify from a group they could have won, which featured Lille, Salzburg and Wolfsburg.
CRISTINA QUICLER AFP/FileIn his first season at Sevilla, Lopetegui led them to Champions League qualification, twice, by finishing fourth in La Liga and then winning the Europa League too.
The regret is not that Sevilla might win the Europa League again, which would be another momentous achievement, but that for a while it seemed they could do even more.

     UEFA Europa League: What to look out for in the round of 16 first legs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UEFA Europa League is reaching its business end with plenty of European thoroughbreds, and a few dark horses, still in the running.
Following the departure of Steven Gerrard for Aston Villa, the club turned to former midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst to take them forward.
Losing finalists in this competition in 2007/08, Rangers' only major European title remains the European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in Barcelona in 1972.
Alba will look to do that against Galatasaray, and maybe pick out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has hit 26 UEFA Europa League goals in his career so far and needs just seven more to join Porto and Atlético great Radamel Falcao as the competition's all-time top scorer.
No away goals rule Following the recommendation of the UEFA Club Competitions Committee and the UEFA Women's Football Committee, the UEFA Executive Committee approved in June a proposal to remove the so-called away goals rule from all UEFA club competitions.

"I want to show everyone outside England what West Ham can do.
West Ham travel to Spain with the availability of several key players in doubt, most notably Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice.
A repeat performance and Fornals is in no doubt that West Ham can give Sevilla a real test.

     Summary: Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong has said the club are determined to win the Europa League to make up for a disappointing start to the season.
"We're excited, we want to win titles and now we're in the Europa League.
With Real Madrid leading the La Liga standings comfortably, and their Copa del Rey campaign ended by Athletic Bilbao, the Europa League looks like the only way to win a trophy this season for Xavi Hernandez's side.
The first is to qualify for the Champions League next season and the other is winning the Europa League," Xavi added.
"But how we finish in La Liga is the best indicator about how we are doing our job because of the weekly effort."
