     Cameron Diaz Says She Barely Thinks About Her Appearance Since Retiring From Acting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameron Diaz seems to really be enjoying her retirement from acting.
And while I’m obviously very happy for her, it is sad to know we will never get another Nancy Meyers collab.
On Michelle Visage’s Rule Breakers, a BBC podcast, in an episode released this week, Diaz opened up about her decision to leave acting behind.
On the podcast Diaz, whose current project is the wine brand Avaline Wine, said that retiring from acting has freed her from the burden of constantly worrying about her looks.
“I am absolutely a victim to all of the societal objectification and exploitations that women are subjected to,” Diaz says.
