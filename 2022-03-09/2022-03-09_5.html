     Power loss at Chernobyl is worrying, but it’s not an immediate threat, the U.N. says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over a loss of power at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, but left clear that the situation around the site of the world’s largest nuclear power disaster was deteriorating.
Losing electricity means the potential loss of the ability to keep the water that cools radioactive material circulating.
But the agency added that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient, even without continuous power to the plant.
The shelling last week of a different, operating nuclear power facility led to calls from President Biden to the embattled president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Mr. Biden later denounced the military action, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex in southern Ukraine, as “reckless,” one of a series of nuclear hazards that have been created by the invasion.

     Summary: Ukraine reports power cut at the Chernobyl nuclear plant as IAEA says outage has no ‘critical impact’ on safety.
Ukraine has appealed to Russia for a temporary ceasefire to allow repairs to be made to a power line to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, warning that there could be a radiation leak if the electricity outage continued.
After that, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,” he wrote on Twitter.

     Summary: The remains of Chernobyl's main reactor building and site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government says the Chernobyl nuclear power facility now controlled by Russia has lost power, threatening the cooling of radioactive material stored there and risking radioactive leakage.
The organization late Tuesday said that it was no longer receiving data transmission from its systems at the Chernobyl nuclear facility for monitoring activities there.
Nuclear power plants typically have backup power.
It couldn’t immediately be determined if the Chernobyl facility had such backup or if it was operational.

     EXPLAINER: What's behind latest scare at Chernobyl plant?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, fears arose that spent nuclear fuel would overheatWhen fighting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in power cuts to the critical cooling system at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant, some feared that spent nuclear fuel would overheat.
Ukrainian electrical grid operator Ukrenerho said power was cut to all Chernobyl facilities and the diesel generators have fuel for 48 hours.
But that’s “pretty unlikely in the situation because the fuel is so cool,” said Edwin Lyman, nuclear power safety director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODSWhen fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot.
Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.

“The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon,” it added.

Ukraine’s armed forces conducted combat and first aid training drills on Feb. 5 in an abandoned town near the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said.
