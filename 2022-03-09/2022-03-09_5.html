     Power loss at Chernobyl is worrying, but it’s not an immediate threat, the U.N. says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over a loss of power at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, but left clear that the situation around the site of the world’s largest nuclear power disaster was deteriorating.
Losing electricity means the potential loss of the ability to keep the water that cools radioactive material circulating.
But the agency added that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient, even without continuous power to the plant.
The shelling last week of a different, operating nuclear power facility led to calls from President Biden to the embattled president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Mr. Biden later denounced the military action, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex in southern Ukraine, as “reckless,” one of a series of nuclear hazards that have been created by the invasion.

     Chernobyl power supply cut but IAEA says no imminent safety threat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant, but the UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern.
Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said the power supply to the Chernobyl plant failed on Wednesday morning, and the national power company Ukrenergo said it was impossible to restore the power lines because of fighting in the surrounding areas.
This process is slow and mitigations should be straightforward.”Acton said the risks at Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants were much higher than at Chernobyl.
One of Ukraine’s four functioning nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe, is under Russian control after it was fired on with artillery.
Grossi repeated his offer to travel to Chernobyl or elsewhere to secure safety guarantees for Ukraine’s nuclear plants.

     Ukraine Warns of Power Outage at Chernobyl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The remains of Chernobyl's main reactor building and site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government says the Chernobyl nuclear power facility now controlled by Russia has lost power, threatening the cooling of radioactive material stored there and risking radioactive leakage.
The organization late Tuesday said that it was no longer receiving data transmission from its systems at the Chernobyl nuclear facility for monitoring activities there.
Nuclear power plants typically have backup power.
It couldn’t immediately be determined if the Chernobyl facility had such backup or if it was operational.

     Summary: Ukraine reports power cut at the Chernobyl nuclear plant as IAEA says outage has no ‘critical impact’ on safety.
Ukraine has appealed to Russia for a temporary ceasefire to allow repairs to be made to a power line to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, warning that there could be a radiation leak if the electricity outage continued.
After that, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,” he wrote on Twitter.

The Chernobyl plant was seized by Russian forces on February 24, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

     Ukraine warns Chernobyl nuclear plant is without power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ukrainian government warned Wednesday that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other nuclear facilities near it now controlled by Russian forces no longer have electricity after a power line was damaged.
“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety.
The big picture: Russian forces took control of the plant early on during Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
Ukraine's Ministry of Energy said Friday that Russian troops have been holding staff at the nuclear facilities hostage.
Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces erupted last week near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine — Europe's largest nuclear power station.
