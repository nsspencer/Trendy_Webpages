     'Survivor' Castaway Leaves the Game After 48 Hours Following Shocking Reveal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Castaway Jackson Fox, a 48-year-old healthcare worker hailing from Pasadena, Texas, is the franchise's first openly transgender contestant and he had quite a whirlwind 48 hours on Survivor.
He was there to have a difficult, but important conversation with Jackson about his future in the game.
But, with lack of resources for testing due to their remote location, and as the season wears on, the side effects of the intense Survivor game was a concern to production.
As the Survivor host detailed, flags were raised when potential side effects Jackson could suffer from the game while on medication could be crippling.
"It's weird that I'm getting emotional about it but even to test yourself for 48 hours, it is such an adventure.
