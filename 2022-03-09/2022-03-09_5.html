     Summary: Does Duke have the most to prove in the ACC Tournament after their embarrassing home loss to UNC to end the season?
BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Duke had a humbling loss at home to rival North Carolina to end the season.
Candace Cooper of the Locked On ACC podcast joined Peter Bukowski on the Locked On Today podcast to discuss why she thinks Duke will have a chip on their shoulder in the ACC Tournament.
Duke, North Carolina, Miami, Notre Dame and Wake Forest are teams that likely have a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
While North Carolina, Virginia and Miami have all defeated Duke this season and could make a run to win the ACC Tournament, Cooper said she believes it will be Duke that wins the tourney.
