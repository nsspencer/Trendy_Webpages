     Summary: Nepotism sure has its pluses and minuses, but you really don’t want to vouch for your kid, pull some strings to get him on a roster with a bunch of scholarship players, and then have him go around sucker punching opposing players in the guts while up 15 in the first-half of a must-win ACC Tournament game.
The sins of the father might not be the sins of the son, but that equation doesn’t exactly work in reverse.
Thus are the hazards of parenting.

     Summary: Syracuse guard Buddy Boeheim, son of coach coach Jim Boeheim, doesn’t have a reputation as a dirty player.
But it’s impossible to defend one moment from the guard early in today’s ACC tournament blowout win over Florida State.
“In the heat of today’s game, after some shoving in the lane, I swung my arm while turning to go back up the court,” Boeheim said in a statement released after the game.
I will not react that way again.”The statement comes as the ACC looks into the play ahead of Syracuse’s game against Duke tomorrow.
After the game, Jim Boeheim said that the punch would have likely resulted in a flagrant 1 foul, but he doesn’t believe his son will be suspended after the league’s review.
