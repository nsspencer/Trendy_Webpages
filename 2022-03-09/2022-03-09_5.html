     The first trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi teases the ultimate Star Wars rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first teaser for the upcoming Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus has arrived, giving a first look at Ewan McGregor’s return as the exiled Jedi.
Obi-Wan Kenobi will pick up with its eponymous hero ten years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith — which saw the Jedi Master take refuge on the desolate planet of Tatooine, both to hide from the Empire’s regime and to keep an eye on the infant Luke Skywalker.
But with Hayden Christensen set to reprise his role as a vengeful Darth Vader — aka, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan’s former apprentice, who was last left beaten and burning in lava by his former friend — it sounds Obi-Wan’s time on Tatooine between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope will be anything but peaceful, as the show sets the stage for the ultimate Star Wars rematch.
Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi is set to debut on Disney Plus on May 25th.

     New Star Wars Villain Confirmed for Obi-Wan Kenobi Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it comes to Star Wars in 2022, there’s no bigger event than the return of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The Jedi Master stars in his own Disney+ series that picks up 10 years after the events of Revenge of the Sith.
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan is still in exile on Tatooine, watching over young Luke Skywalker from afar…until the time is right.
Either way, the odds are certainly stacked against the beloved Jedi Master.
The show will introduce a brand new Inquisitor to the Star Wars universe: Reva, who is played by Moses Ingram (The Queen’s Gambit).

     Obi-Wan Kenobi looks after Luke in teaser for Disney Plus show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last year, Ewan McGregor promised that Disney Plus’ Obi-Wan Kenobi series would look nothing like the prequels.
Fans have been curious about what the Star Wars universe would look like during the prequel years without the campiness of it all, and now Disney Plus has given us a glimpse with the first teaser trailer of the series.
It’s too early to tell if Obi-Wan Kenobi seems to be more promising than the prequels, but McGregor seems confident in its direction.
She directed a couple [episodes] of The Mandalorian and she’s a really great director.
I think it’s no secret that Hayden Christensen comes back and we got to play scenes together again as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker and it was just fantastic to work with him again.”Obi-Wan Kenobi premieres on Disney Plus on May 25.
