“I go to him for physical needs, anything I need to do or change, I go to Mr. Lex.
Anything spiritual, I go to Mr. Lex, because Mr. Lex is a man of God.

No matter what happens, I gave it everything that I had.”The two-hour premiere of “Survivor” Season 42 airs at 7 p.m. Central time on Wednesday, March 7, on CBS.
