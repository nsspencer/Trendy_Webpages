     Game Preview: Florida State's ACC Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Florida State enters the ACC Tournament as the 8 seed, and will play 9-seeded Syracuse, a team they split the season series with.
From what I can tell, this is the first time the defending ACC Tournament Champions (Georgia Tech) have lost in the first round of the tournament since Duke in 2007.
If Florida State wants to make the NCAA Tournament, they have to win the whole ACC Tournament; that's their only hope right now.
However, the 8-seed has not beaten the 1-seed in the ACC Tournament since 1997, and the 8-seed has never won the ACC Tournament.
The highest seed to ever win the ACC Tournament is 6-seeded Maryland in 2004.
