    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last week we asked Syracuse Orange fans a series of questions to take your pulse of the year and future of the program.
Let’s start with the ACC Tournament and many of you aren’t feeling confident about the Orange’s chances this week in Brooklyn.
We asked how games Syracuse would win and here are the results:None 53%, One game 40%, Two games 2%, Three games 2%, and 3% expect the Orange to cut down the nets in Barclays Center.
Next question was about the immediate future of the Orange and whether or not they’d find themselves ranked at any point next season.

     Syracuse basketball: Buddy Boeheim’s punching of FSU player ‘inadvertent,’ Jim Boeheim says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim does not believe his son, Buddy Boeheim, was doing anything egregious after Buddy Boeheim appeared to punch Florida State’s Wyatt Wilkes in the Orange's 96-57 win in the second round of the ACC Tournament Wednesday.
“I saw the play, the kid pushed him twice, I think it was inadvertent," Jim Boeheim said in the postgame press conference.
"Took a little shot there from Buddy Boeheim, that looked intentional," Bilas said during the broadcast.
Syracuse (16-16) likely needs to win the ACC Tournament if it wants a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
“We’re a good team,” Jim Boeheim said heading into the ACC Tournament.

     Summary: The Jim Boeheim led Syracuse Orange handily defeated Florida State, 96-57, to set up a meeting between two of college basketball’s most storied coaches in the ACC quarterfinals.
It’s no secret that this year’s ACC Tournament in Brooklyn would focus heavily on the legendary coach’s final time leading Duke through it.
For Syracuse, the idea is to not get too caught up in the outside noise.
“I mean, you just play your game,” Syracuse guard Joseph Girard III.
So we’ll see what happens tomorrow.”The win over FSU should serve as a good boost for the Orange, who led for 36:24 of Wednesday’s win.

     Syracuse Basketball: Stupidity on social media has reached all-time high

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’m all for free speech, and I always respect the opinions and takes of my fellow Syracuse basketball fans, even when I adamantly disagree with them.
Some Syracuse basketball fans are really, really angry these days, which is understandable.
Boeheim has the second-most wins all-time as a Division I men’s basketball head coach.
If you want a new head coach, that’s all good, and you’ll be getting one at some point in the future.
But to suggest that Boeheim has done nothing for the Syracuse basketball program over the past four-plus decades is an ignorant, comical, disrespectful and totally misinformed statement.
