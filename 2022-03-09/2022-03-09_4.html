     Florence Pugh's Dune 2 Casting Would Be Perfect (Thanks To Chalamet)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's believed that Florence Pugh is in talks to join Dune: Part Two as Princess Irulan and her casting would be a perfect one thanks to Timothée Chalamet.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: Dune Secretly Revealed House Atreides' Key Weakness: How It Impacts Part 2Pugh's Dune casting as Irulan would be perfect.
With Timothée Chalamet in the lead as Paul Atreides, Pugh would potentially play his (future) wife.
As Irulan in the books is romantically involved with Paul, she'd likely share several scenes with Timothée Chalamet in what would mark their second collaboration.
Pugh as Irulan would be excellent for Dune: Part Two, but it would also be a perfect way to make use of her previous work with Chalamet.
