     Super Bowl bonus: How much extra money do the winners and losers make?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agreement stipulates players on the winning team earn an extra $157,000 for playing in the Super Bowl, while players on the losing team earn $82,000.
Players are set to receive their Super Bowl bonus pay within 15 day of the big game, according to the agreement.
By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000.
NFL players also get paid extra for playing in other playoff games or the Pro Bowl, but each of those extra payments is smaller than the Super Bowl bonus.
The 2023 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 Eastern Time at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

The Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl for the third time in the past five years.
Edge: ChiefsIntangiblesIt sure feels as if the Chiefs are more familiar with what goes down at a Super Bowl, but they have just 13 players remaining from their team that won Super Bowl LIV three years ago.
The Eagles have eight players on the roster who were part of their Super Bowl LII victory five years ago.
