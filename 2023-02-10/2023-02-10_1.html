     Eagles task in Super Bowl: Stop MVP Patrick Mahomes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX – Patrick Mahomes is solely focused on winning another ring, but already has some more hardware for his trophy case in advance of Super Bowl LVII.
This will mark the fourth time that the Super Bowl will feature a matchup of the league MVP and runner-up at quarterback, with the runner-up having won all three previous matchups.
Mahomes was not available for comment with reporters in attendance at NFL Honors given that he’s preparing for Super Bowl Sunday, but a pre-recorded video was shown in which he thanked God, his family and lastly the Chiefs organization.
“Every day, we’re giving everything that we have together to go for the ultimate goal, the Super Bowl.
Those totals combined established a new league record for total yards, breaking Drew Brees old mark, which had stood since 2011.

     Why Patrick Mahomes fell in the 2017 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a starter, Mahomes went 13-19, and while football is seen as a team sport, Mahomes was dinged for that as well.
What we learned from the draft process of Patrick Mahomes is that sometimes, doing the prototypical dropback passing isn’t enough in the NFL.
Patrick Mahomes was an extremely talented QB, who went to one of the best QB developers in the NFL in Andy Reid along with Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill.
The draft process of Patrick Mahomes is one that serves as a critical turning point in the evaluation of future QBs.
Not every QB is Patrick Mahomes, though.

Only six players have won the regular season and Super Bowl MVPs in the same season and none since Kurt Warner in the 1999 season.
Here is a look at the six previous players who won the regular season and Super Bowl MVPs in the same season.

     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article SharePHOENIX — Patrick Mahomes still looks at his fame through wide eyes.
During this Super Bowl run, the admiration of Mahomes has shifted from his talent to his toughness as he plays through a high ankle sprain.
But while he won a championship at 24, he also has fallen a game short of the Super Bowl twice and looked helpless behind a battered offensive line in losing Super Bowl LV, 31-9, to the Brady-led Tampa Bay Buccaneers two years ago.
After the Super Bowl, left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. will be a free agent.
“I think it feels more special the older you get, because you have the failure, the failure of not getting to this game,” Mahomes said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Super Bowl LVII is a highly anticipated matchup for many reasons -- 57, if you're counting.
Together, Hurts and Mahomes have already made history, as they'll be the first pair of African-American QBs to ever go at it in a Super Bowl.
In reality, the Eagles QB is a bit stockier, but more than that, he tends to play lower to the ground, evoking a running back's posture as a refined, tough-nosed ball-carrier.

We might excuse the two picks against the 49ers due to nerves from his Super Bowl debut -- Mahomes and the Chiefs did win, after all, and he enjoyed Super Bowl MVP honors after helping guide 21 unanswered points.
