    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Mahomes won going away.
In an early matchup between this weekend's opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks, Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs was named this year's Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player, easily outdistancing the Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Hurts.
"Every day giving everything that we have together to go for the ultimate goal, the Super Bowl.
His total yards surpassed the previous record of 5,562 yards by Drew Brees.
This year's Super Bowl will be historic: it will be the first Super Bowl featuring two Black starting quarterbacks.

     Summary: Mahomes, not surprisingly, is the favorite to win the Super Bowl MVP.
Only six players have won the regular season and Super Bowl MVPs in the same season and none since Kurt Warner in the 1999 season.
Here is a look at the six previous players who won the regular season and Super Bowl MVPs in the same season.
He then led the Packers to a victory in the first Super Bowl, defeating the Chiefs, 35-10, in Los Angeles.
He had led the 49ers to three Super Bowl titles during the decade and was a two-time Super Bowl MVP.

     Why Patrick Mahomes fell in the 2017 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a starter, Mahomes went 13-19, and while football is seen as a team sport, Mahomes was dinged for that as well.
What we learned from the draft process of Patrick Mahomes is that sometimes, doing the prototypical dropback passing isn’t enough in the NFL.
Patrick Mahomes was an extremely talented QB, who went to one of the best QB developers in the NFL in Andy Reid along with Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill.
The draft process of Patrick Mahomes is one that serves as a critical turning point in the evaluation of future QBs.
Not every QB is Patrick Mahomes, though.

     Patrick Mahomes vs. Jalen Hurts: Tale of the tape as Chiefs, Eagles QBs square off in Super Bowl 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Super Bowl LVII is a highly anticipated matchup for many reasons -- 57, if you're counting.
Together, Hurts and Mahomes have already made history, as they'll be the first pair of African-American QBs to ever go at it in a Super Bowl.
In reality, the Eagles QB is a bit stockier, but more than that, he tends to play lower to the ground, evoking a running back's posture as a refined, tough-nosed ball-carrier.

We might excuse the two picks against the 49ers due to nerves from his Super Bowl debut -- Mahomes and the Chiefs did win, after all, and he enjoyed Super Bowl MVP honors after helping guide 21 unanswered points.

This Super Bowl is also the first in which brothers are playing on opposite sides.

     Summary: Greatness is happening with the NFL right now.
It sounds wild to say this about a 27-year-old player, especially a quarterback, but it’s fair to ask the question: Is Patrick Mahomes the best quarterback ever?
Patrick Mahomes has started his career like no other quarterback in NFL history.
(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)Longevity will push him out of this conversation for many people since his NFL career really only started in 2018, but unheard of production and accolades are still unheard of production and accolades.
Mahomes is undoubtedly the best quarterback in the league today and he is so far ahead of his peers that it’s fair to bring the entire scope of NFL history into play.

     Summary: If you answered yes to any of those questions, then you might want to prepare yourself for an Eagles victory in Super Bowl LVII.
-- when Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams stopped the Tennessee Titans at the 1-yard line to win Super Bowl XXXIV.
He and the Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl, where some truly terrible officiating contributed to a 21-10 loss to the Steelers.
He then felt the wrath of the curse, losing the undefeated season in Super Bowl LII to the Giants.
It's especially odd considering an MVP won the Super Bowl in five of the seven years prior to the curse beginning in the year 2000.
