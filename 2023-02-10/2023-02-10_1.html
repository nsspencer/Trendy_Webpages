     Summary: PHOENIX – Patrick Mahomes is solely focused on winning another ring, but already has some more hardware for his trophy case in advance of Super Bowl LVII.
This will mark the fourth time that the Super Bowl will feature a matchup of the league MVP and runner-up at quarterback, with the runner-up having won all three previous matchups.
Mahomes was not available for comment with reporters in attendance at NFL Honors given that he’s preparing for Super Bowl Sunday, but a pre-recorded video was shown in which he thanked God, his family and lastly the Chiefs organization.
“Every day, we’re giving everything that we have together to go for the ultimate goal, the Super Bowl.
Those totals combined established a new league record for total yards, breaking Drew Brees old mark, which had stood since 2011.

     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article SharePHOENIX — Patrick Mahomes still looks at his fame through wide eyes.
During this Super Bowl run, the admiration of Mahomes has shifted from his talent to his toughness as he plays through a high ankle sprain.
But while he won a championship at 24, he also has fallen a game short of the Super Bowl twice and looked helpless behind a battered offensive line in losing Super Bowl LV, 31-9, to the Brady-led Tampa Bay Buccaneers two years ago.
After the Super Bowl, left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. will be a free agent.
“I think it feels more special the older you get, because you have the failure, the failure of not getting to this game,” Mahomes said.

     Why Patrick Mahomes fell in the 2017 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a starter, Mahomes went 13-19, and while football is seen as a team sport, Mahomes was dinged for that as well.
What we learned from the draft process of Patrick Mahomes is that sometimes, doing the prototypical dropback passing isn’t enough in the NFL.
Patrick Mahomes was an extremely talented QB, who went to one of the best QB developers in the NFL in Andy Reid along with Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill.
The draft process of Patrick Mahomes is one that serves as a critical turning point in the evaluation of future QBs.
Not every QB is Patrick Mahomes, though.

     Eagles matchup to watch, Super Bowl edition: Jalen Hurts vs. Patrick Mahomes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Super Bowl LVII on Sunday will mark the first time ever that two Black quarterbacks will be starting in the Super Bowl.
Does Mahomes, who’s had the stage for the last five years, stay there, or does he make way for Hurts?
Hurts is still dealing with a right shoulder injury that he suffered against the Chicago Bears on December 18 in Chicago.
“They’re great all of the way through, I think that’s the biggest thing,” Mahomes said about the Eagles’ defense.
If Mahomes can move, the Eagles have a formidable enough defense to run what they have all season.

As a child, he recalled reading books about the Negro Leagues — part of why he was eager to to go the museum with the Chiefs’ rookie class in 2017.
Given that Mahomes perceives the path from the Negro Leagues and Paige to his father to himself, it’s no wonder Kendrick believes he sees the spirit of the Negro Leagues in Mahomes’ singular style — a signature of substance and show.
