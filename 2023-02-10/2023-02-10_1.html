     Listen: 70 minutes of Rihanna before Super Bowl Halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It feels like it could have only been now.” That’s how Rihanna describes her upcoming Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show, which marks the first time in seven years that she’ll perform her music live.
Since her first album, 2005’s Music Of The Sun, Rihanna has weathered countless trends and carved out her own eras across eight studio albums, securing a well-earned spot in the modern pantheon of Main Pop Girls.
Rihanna has confirmed she has a 13-minute performance planned for Sunday– but before she hits the mic, she’ll have to narrow down the 39 set lists she says she’s drafted so far.
While fans may never know what numbers ended up on the cutting room floor, some studying up is in order regardless before Sunday.
Club has compiled 16 songs from the singer’s discography to prepare you for Sunday’s Rihanna concert, cleverly disguised as a football game.

     Summary: "The Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world, it's an entertainer's dream to be on a stage like that."
So it’s a good thing she’s not hard pressed for cash, because Rihanna won’t be paid for her Super Bowl performance as is custom for halftime headliners.
And like Super Bowl commercials, halftime shows don’t come cheap—productions can cost north of $10 million dollars.
“Whether it’s the Super Bowl, whether it’s a makeup product, whether it's Savage lingerie…I want to see the copy on the website.
“Super Bowl is one thing,” she said.
