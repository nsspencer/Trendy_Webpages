     49ers news: San Francisco nabs Charvarius Ward away from Chiefs on 3-year, $40.5 million deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers added a key piece to their defense on Monday night, nabbing former Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Charvarius Ward on a three-year deal.
NFL Media’s Ian Rapaport notes it’s a $40.5 million deal, while ESPN’s Adam Schefter says the contract has $26.7 million guaranteed and carries a max value of $42 million.
Ward was a mainstay on the Chiefs’ defense the past three seasons, starting in all but two games after playing a more limited role as a rookie in 2018.
This past season, he racked up 67 total tackles, two interceptions and 10 passes defended in 13 games, with 12 of those being starts.
The 49ers nearly rode their strong defensive unit to another Super Bowl appearance this past season, only to fall just short against the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.

     Charvarius Ward’s departure leaves Chiefs thinner at cornerback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most of Chiefs Kingdom knew that cornerback Charvarius Ward was a likely candidate to leave in free agency.
Ward’s ascent in playing time is a testament to his hard work and natural talent—as well as the Chiefs’ coaching staff.
The Kansas City Chiefs are much thinner at cornerback with the news that Charvarius Ward left for the San Francisco 49ers.
There’s a reason the Niners wanted to get this deal done early in free agency: Ward is perfect for what they want to do.
Ward’s exit is a great story for him, but it leaves the Chiefs in the lurch with a real need to fill.

     Summary: Opposite him was Charvarius Ward, an unheralded cornerback completing his first full season as a Kansas City Chiefs starter.
Ward agreed to a three-year, $42 million deal with $26.7 million guaranteed, according to his agency, Universal Sports Management.
James, in fact, beat Ward for a last-minute, game-winning touchdown catch in the pair’s pro debut, the 2018 preseason opener.
Ward made a career-high $3.4 million last season on a one-year tender as a Chiefs’ restricted free agent.
It also didn’t come at the sticker price of an infamous 49ers cornerback signing in 2007: Nate Clements, who was released four seasons into his eight-year, $80 million deal.
