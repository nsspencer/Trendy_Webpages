     Baker Mayfield trade rumors: Browns QB seemingly says goodbye to Cleveland with social media post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although the Browns quarterback appears to know his fate with the organization as he posted what seems to be a farewell letter on social media Tuesday night.
Regardless if the Browns are able to land Watson or not, Mayfield may have forced his hand with the Browns with this farewell message.
If the Browns aren't committed to Mayfield, the quarterback is looking to find his next destination sooner rather than later.
Mayfield had surgery on the torn labrum in January, ending his season once the Browns were officially eliminated from the playoffs.
Of 32 qualified quarterbacks, Mayfield finished 27th in completion percentage, 22nd in touchdown passes, 17th in yards per attempt (7.2), and 27th in quarterback rating.

     'I have no clue what happens next': Baker Mayfield thanks Browns fans amid uncertain future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield posted what read like a farewell letter to Cleveland on his Twitter and Instagram accounts late Tuesday.
Not long after the Browns wrapped up their meeting with Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson on Tuesday night, Mayfield thanked Cleveland and conceded he doesn't know what his NFL future holds.
If the Browns were to complete a trade for the controversial Watson, they would obviously deal Mayfield to another team.
If the Browns fail to land Watson and still trade Mayfield, they'll be hunting for another starting quarterback.
Will the Cleveland Browns bite?

The Browns flew to Houston on Tuesday to pitch Watson on waiving his no-trade clause to come to Cleveland, a league source told ESPN.
Watson has already met with the Saints and Panthers and is scheduled to meet with the Falcons on Wednesday.
Despite that, Mayfield led Cleveland to its first playoff victory in 26 years during the 2020 campaign.
He wound up finishing 27th in the league in QBR as the Browns missed the playoffs and finished with a disappointing 8-9 record.
