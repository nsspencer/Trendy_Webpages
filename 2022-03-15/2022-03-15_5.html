     Man Hit Woman in the Head 125 Times Because She Was Asian, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The force of the blow knocks the woman to the ground.
As she lies there, her attacker bends down and pummels her repeatedly with both hands for the next minute, more than 125 blows altogether.
He then stomps on her seven times and spits on her before walking away.
The sickening assault, captured by a security camera, came after the woman, who is of Asian descent, passed the man on her way into the building, officials said.
Moments later, he attacked her in what officials said was violence driven by anti-Asian bias, yet another incident in a nationwide surge.

     Tammel Esco, charged with attempted murder in brutal anti-Asian attack in Yonkers, has lengthy criminal record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suspect charged with attempted murder as a hate crime after Asian woman viciously attackedYONKERS, N.Y. -- A woman from the Philippines is recovering from a vicious anti-Asian attack in Yonkers.
The suspect is charged with attempted murder as a hate crime and has a long criminal history, CBS2's Tony Aiello reported Monday.
Wendy Trinidad reacted with horror to surveillance video of the hate crime committed in the lobby of her building.
Esco threw 125 punches and seven vicious kicks, then twice spit on the woman and used anti-Asian slurs.
"We're gonna file this as a hate crime, and we're charging attempted murder based on the number of strikes and the length of the attack," Yonkers Police Commissioner John Mueller said.

     NY Man Arrested in ‘Appalling' Hate Crime Beating of Woman Who Was Punched 125 Times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 42-year-old Yonkers man has been arrested on attempted murder as a hate crime and other charges in the vicious caught-on-camera beating of a 67-year-old Asian woman who was attacked as she returned home last week, police said Monday.
According to the investigation, the victim simply passed by Esco on her way home and he yelled a racial slur at her.
Investigators said that one of the most appalling attacks they have ever seen started with a man calling an Asian woman a racial slur.
"To beat a helpless woman is despicable and targeting her because of her race makes it more so," Mueller said.
A recent national survey from the group "Stop AAPI Hate" found more than 10,000 incidents reported in the last two years alone.
