     Manchester United vs Atletico Madrid live updates: Renan Lodi's goal puts desperate United out of Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United are out of the Champions League after a miserable 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford.
United had a lot of the ball without really troubling Oblak after that, and Atletico became more confident on the break as the first half progressed.
Joao Felix had a goal disallowed for offside and then Renan Lodi headed Atletico into the lead after an excellent move.
The United players thought the goal should have been disallowed for a foul on Elanga, and their frustration grew during a niggly, stop-start second half.
But United became too desperate, too early and were unable to generate any momentum.

Atletico defeated United 1-0 at Old Trafford as the LaLiga side advanced 2-1 on aggregate and into the Champions League quarterfinals.
The loss condemns United to another year without a trophy after last lifting silverware in 2017 and De Gea accepted it will go down as a "bad year."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Renan Lodi scored the only goal as Atletico Madrid beat Manchester United 1-0 to reach the Champions League quarter-finalsManchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) – Atletico Madrid drove the final nail in the coffin of a miserable season for Manchester United as Renan Lodi's header sent the Spanish champions into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford to progress 2-1 on aggregate.
United now face an uphill task just to get back into the Champions League next season as an under-performing squad filled with star names sits fifth in the Premier League.
But the experience of Diego Simeone's men in the Champions League knockouts shone through as they comfortably saw the game out to reach the last eight for the sixth time in the last nine seasons.
Diogo Dalot's low cross picked out Elanga and his goalbound effort rebounded off Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak's head to safety.
The home fans were still screaming for a foul on Elanga in the Atletico half when the visitors fed the ball forward to Felix, whose backheel found Antoine Griezmann and his cross picked out the unmarked Lodi to head home.

     Summary: Ralf Rangnick questioned the “curious refereeing decisions” after Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid.
1-0 win at Old Trafford was enough to help Atletico reach the quarter-finals and signal another trophyless season for United.
"We want to qualify for the Champions League again and we're fully aware that to do that we have to win most of those nine games.
My focus is on finishing the highest possible level with this team then it is time to speak about other things."
