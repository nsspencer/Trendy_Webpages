He has spent his entire six-year career in Jacksonville and signed a four-year, $57 million extension in August 2019 that made him the third-highest-paid inside linebacker.

     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars went on a spending spree on the first day of legal tampering, handing out six big contracts.
On Tuesday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the Jaguars are releasing linebacker Myles Jack.
Jack is just 26 years old and led the Jaguars with 108 combined tackles last season.
He's an athletic backer who has 82 starts to his name, and should immediately draw interest on the open market.
It's possible Jack won't be the only Jaguars starter who could be playing for a new team in 2022.

     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars will be releasing linebacker Myles Jack, according to a report by Adam Schefter of ESPN.
After Monday’s spending spree, the Jaguars are releasing LB Myles Jack, per source.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 15, 2022The move to release Jack comes as a bit of a surprise, however given that the new regime is seemingly completely changing the look of the Jaguars’ roster.
The release of Jack saves the Jaguars just over $8 million in cap space, so it’s very possible the Jaguars aren’t totally done in spending money in free agency.
The team did sign linebacker Foye Oloukon on Monday, who is a similar style of linebacker as Jack and there was some talk it could possibly point to the end of the Myles Jack era.

     Jacksonville Jaguars release leading tackler Myles Jack after spending spree
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jaguars have released veteran linebacker Myles Jack in a move that will save the team $8.35 million.
Jack was the Jaguars' leading tackler last season with 108 and has had at least 107 tackles in three of the past four seasons.
The move costs the Jaguars $4.8 million in dead money.
Jack has missed only nine games in his six-year career and has 513 tackles, 6.5 sacks, 3 interceptions and 4 fumble recoveries.
Replays showed he wasn't down, and that birthed the "Myles Jack wasn't down" phenomenon among Jacksonville fans.

     As Jaguars Release Myles Jack, Here's Why the Bears May or May Not Sign Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But arguably the biggest surprise of the first two days of legal tampering has been the Jaguars' reported decision to part ways with cornerstone linebacker Myles Jack.
In that defense, Jack primarily played as the middle linebacker, but he played a little strongside and weakside linebacker as well.
Against the run, Jack excels at making plays in his gap.
If the Bears determine that they want Smith to play middle linebacker, however, this pairing may not make as much sense.
In six seasons with the Jaguars, Jack has played in 88 games, starting 82 of them.
