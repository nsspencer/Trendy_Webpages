     Fake Heiress Anna Sorokin, Who Swindled Elite, Faces Deportation to Germany
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even as her deportation loomed, Anna Sorokin appeared not to believe media speculation that she would soon be sent back to Germany.
The rumors were devastating to the fake German heiress, who prefers to be called Anna Delvey and whose exploits were fictionalized on “Inventing Anna,” a Netflix series created by Shonda Rhimes released last month.
Then, last March, amid a bevy of media appearances, at a routine check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Lower Manhattan, ICE authorities arrested her on charges of overstaying her visa.
From detention cells in New Jersey and at Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen, N.Y., Ms. Sorokin, who was born in Russia but has family in Germany, fought her deportation for almost a year.
Once, in a phone interview, she referred to deportation as feeling like “a big L on my end.”

     The real-life 'Inventing Anna' is facing deportation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Anna Sorokin, the fake German heiress Netflix's "Inventing Anna" is based on, remains in Immigration and Enforcement custody, a spokesman for the agency said Tuesday.
Her attorney had reportedly feared her deportation when he couldn't reach her on Monday.
The agency did not specify where Sorokin is currently being held and said it could not discuss any future deportation plans.
Attorney Manny Arora told NBC News on Monday that he hadn't been able to reach Sorokin and was "working under the presumption that she is being deported."
Arora could not be immediately reached for comment.

     Fake heiress Anna Sorokin still in US, attorney says after saying she was likely deported

     Summary: Anna Sorokin is led away after being sentenced in Manhattan Supreme Court May 9, 2019 following her conviction last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services.

Asked Tuesday about Arora’s comments, another lawyer for Sorokin, Audrey Thomas, said: “Presumptions are wrong.”“We’re doing our best,” she said.
She was the subject of a Netflix documentary, “Inventing Anna.”Last March, six weeks after Sorokin’s release from prison, immigration authorities took her into custody for overstaying her visa.
A deportation order for Sorokin was signed on Feb. 17, giving her lawyers 30 days to file an appeal, Arora said Monday.

     Fake heiress Anna Sorokin makes new bid to fight deportation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Anna Sorokin, the convicted swindler who claimed to be a German heiress to finance a posh lifestyle in New York, is making a new bid to fight deportation, a lawyer said Tuesday.
Sorokin, whose scheme inspired the recent Netflix series “Inventing Anna,” was taken into U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement custodynearly a year ago.
Sorokin, who was convicted in 2019and spent more than three years behind bars, has since been challenging deportation.
An appellate immigration judge last month declined to stop the 31-year-old German citizen from being removed.
Using the name Anna Delvey, Sorokin maneuvered her way into elite New York social circles by passing herself off as a socialite with a $67 million (61 million euros) fortune overseas, according to prosecutors.

     ‘Inventing Anna’ Fake Heiress Anna Sorokin Facing Imminent Deportation – Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anna Sorokin, the convicted swindler whose criminal adventures formed the basis of the hit Netflix 2022 series Inventing Anna, will soon be deported to Germany – if she hasn’t already been sent packing.
Manny Arora, her attorney in the criminal appeal, told GMA this morning that he hadn’t heard from her yesterday, which was unusual.
Sorokin had been fighting deportation for a year, having completed her prison stint for the crimes depicted in the Shonda Rhimes-created series in February 2021.
Last month, Sorokin confirmed that she was working with Surviving R. Kelly producer Bunim/Murray Productions on a new limited documentary series that would chronicle her life following the events portrayed in Inventing Anna.
Last month, it was revealed that Sorokin received about $320,000 from Netflix for the story that eventually became Inventing Anna.
