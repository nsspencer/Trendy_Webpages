     Judge makes ban on Bob Saget autopsy records release permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge in Florida on Tuesday agreed to make a permanent order that prohibits the release of photos, video or other records related to the investigation into the death of comedian Bob Saget.
The family members had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the release of any records from the local medical examiner’s office and the Orange County Sheriff’s Office involving the investigation into Saget’s death.
Saget, 65, was found dead January 9 in a room at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando.
During the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner’s office and sheriff’s office created graphic videos and photos of Saget’s body, as well as audio recordings.
Such records are prohibited by state law from being released publicly, but some media outlets had already filed requests for them, according to the family’s lawsuit.

     Bob Saget death: Photos of comedian taken after he died will be shielded from public, judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A limited number of records around Bob Saget’s death will be protected from public release, a US judge has ruled.
A day later, Circuit Court Judge Vincent Chiu allowed a temporary injunction on photos and videos taken of Saget after his death.
The Saget family’s lawyer Brian Bieber at the hearing revealed that the sheriff’s office had taken 147 images of Saget after his death.
Further, Florida’s public records laws mandate that photos, video and audio recordings of autopsies be exempt from public disclosure.
Saget’s death was ruled an accident.

     Judge permanently blocks release of certain records in Bob Saget’s death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. (WFLA) — A judge in Florida on Monday agreed with a request from the family of comedian Bob Saget and will permanently block certain records of his death, according to WESH.
Saget’s wife and his three daughters filed a lawsuit in February asking for a ruling to prohibit the release of any records from the local medical examiner’s office and the Orange County Sheriff’s Office involving the probe into Saget’s death.
All of the prayers and well wishes continuously extended to the family are beyond appreciated,” Saget’s family wrote in a statement obtained by WESH.
An autopsy report shows Saget’s cause of death was “blunt head trauma” that resulted in multiple fractures to the skull and hemorrhaging near the brain.
During the course of the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner’s office and sheriff’s office created graphic videos and photos of Saget’s body, as well as audio recordings.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Had he been with people at the time, they would have noticed “confusion, balance, and/or slurred speech,” the report states.
Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay.
A toxicology analysis didn’t show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget’s body.
The report ruled out countertops, tables and nightstands in the hotel room since those all had hard surfaces.
A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget’s suite since it had been latched from inside.
