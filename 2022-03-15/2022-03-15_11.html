    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Had he been with people at the time, they would have noticed “confusion, balance, and/or slurred speech,” the report states.
Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay.
A toxicology analysis didn’t show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget’s body.
The report ruled out countertops, tables and nightstands in the hotel room since those all had hard surfaces.
A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget’s suite since it had been latched from inside.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Nothing was located" in Bob Saget's hotel room that "allows for a definitive conclusion" on his death, according to the incident report released on TuesdayThere isn't conclusive reasoning for Bob Saget's fatal injury, according to an incident report from the Orange County Sheriff's Office.
In the incident report, obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, an autopsy conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Joshua Stephany, M.D.
Dr. Stephany stated flatly that Mr. Saget could not have made any type of extended drive with the injury he sustained," the report detailed.
Most of the chairs and couches were thickly upholstered and were too soft to have caused the type and extent of injury Mr. Saget suffered."

     Some photos, records of 'Full House' star Bob Saget's death won't be made public, Florida judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video footage and audio recordings taken inside the Orlando hotel room where Saget died also will remain private.
However, 57 photos depicting the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes hotel or Saget's room without items can be released to the public.
So can body camera footage filmed outside Saget's room and a redacted investigative report.
Publishing these records would cause "irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish and emotional distress" for Saget's family, the lawsuit read.
The Saget family had argued that records from the death investigation and autopsy are exempt from public disclosure under Florida law.
