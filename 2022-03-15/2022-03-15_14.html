     Will Dr. Fauci Finally Get Downsized? – OpEd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 1968, Dr. Fauci was hired on with the National Institutes of Health and he has headed NIAID since 1984.
Dr. Fauci’s bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry.
With his NIAID budget of more than $6 billion, Fauci controls public health policy and medical research spending, a dangerous concentration of power.
Dr. Fauci has reversed himself on many issues but now claims “I represent science.” Such a person is unfit to head a government agency dealing with public health.
Like most government bureaucracies, Fauci’s NIAID is too failed to be big.

     Murkowski joins six GOP senators opposing elimination of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s job as head of NIAID
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Six Republican senators — including Sen. Lisa Murkowski — voted against an amendment on Tuesday that would have eliminated the position of director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a job currently held by Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul made the amendment that would replace NIAID with a trio of national research institutes.
In addition to a “no” vote from Murkowski, Republican Senators Richard Burr-N.C., Susan Collins-Maine, Bill Cassidy-La., Mitt Romney-Utah, and Jerry Moran-Kansas voted no.
Sen. Paul has been on a mission to get rid of Fauci, who has been the leading national expert on Covid-19 pandemic policy since he served in the Trump White House.
Fauci has called for mask mandates, vaccine mandates, economic shutdowns, and the closing of schools due to the pandemic.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For reasons that have never made sense, many Republicans are heavily invested in the idea that Dr. Anthony Fauci must be driven from his current position.
Even Donald Trump couldn’t fire Fauci because the infectious disease expert is not a political appointee.
Paul wants to scrap the singular role of NIAID director and replace it with three separate directors of newly created institutes: a National Institute of Allergic Diseases, a National Institute of Infectious Diseases and a National Institute of Immunologic Diseases.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases doesn’t have that kind of authority.
It would put Paul in a position to actually pursue many of his strange ideas, including this one.

The amendment would create three new director positions—one for the National Institute of Allergic Disease, one for the National Institute of Infectious Disease and one for the National Institute of Immunologic Diseases.
During that same hearing, Fauci held up a graphic from Paul's website with "Fire Dr. Fauci" on it, asking for campaign donations.
During that November hearing, Paul said that Fauci's denials were a "clear and present danger to the country and the world."
In July 2021, Paul said that he was going to push for a criminal investigation into Fauci during a Senate hearing.

     Rand Paul’s latest legislation would kill an entire federal agency to get rid of Dr Fauci
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Rand Paul has introduced legislation to eliminate an entire federal agency, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, in order to oust its longtime director, Dr Anthony Fauci.
He has also frequently called for Dr Fauci to be fired and has suggested — without evidence — that the veteran physician, who also serves as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, is guilty of several federal crimes.
But as a senator, the Kentucky Republican can neither relieve Dr Fauci of duty nor charge him with any violation of law, so instead he is proposing to eliminate the agency he runs.
Mr Paul’s push to eliminate Dr Fauci’s position is in line with other members of the Republican Party who have made the physician into a hate object.
A separate bill introduced by Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the “Fire Fauci Act,” has 20 GOP co-sponsors.

     Summary: OPINION:Sen. Rand Paul has introduced a measure to make a repeat of Dr. Anthony Fauci “I am zee law!” lockdowns less likely in the face of a new pandemic.
“If Fauci was simply one family doctor in Peoria, his mistakes would not be so catastrophic,” Paul wrote for Fox.
“But since Fauci is allowed to be a medical czar for the whole country, his errors are amplified throughout the land.
It removes the ability of Fauci and any future Fauci types to be in charge of both policy and funding.
Maybe then, when Fauci says jump, we won’t have to say, “How high?” We can say thanks — but we got it.

     Sen. Dr. Rand Paul introduces amendment to eliminate Fauci’s position as director of NIAID
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S.
Senator and Dr. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced an amendment to eliminate Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and replace it with three separate national research institutes.“We’ve learned a lot over the past two years, but one lesson in particular is that no one person should be deemed “dictator-in-chief.” No one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans,” said Dr. Paul.“To ensure that ineffective, unscientific lockdowns and mandates are never foisted on the American people ever again, I’ve introduced this amendment to eliminate Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and divide his power into three separate new institutes.
This will create accountability and oversight into a taxpayer funded position that has largely abused its power, and has been responsible for many failures and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.”As recently as 2012, Congress passed a law that eliminated the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and reassigned some of its programs to a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and assigned other NCRR functions to other institutes within NIH.Dr.
Paul’s amendment would keep with this precedent of reorganization, and would immediately eliminate Dr. Fauci’s position and replace it with three new directors of the following new institutes:National Institute of Allergic DiseasesNational Institute of Infectious DiseasesNational Institute of Immunologic DiseasesEach of these three institutes will be led by a director who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a 5-year term.This amendment also aligns with NIAID’s existing mission statement, which begins by saying: “NIAID conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases.”Read Dr. Paul’s amendment at https://www.paul.senate.gov/sites/default/files/page-attachments/Paul%20Amendment.pdf
