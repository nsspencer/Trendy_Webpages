YouTuber rampage TV compared the PS5 version with the PC version featuring Razed's NaturalVision Evolved mod, which clearly still looks better than the newly released next-gen version.
Nonetheless, the PC version of GTA V could still use these improvements as a new baseline for new graphics mods that could undoubtedly boost the visuals even further.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you're asking how to get GTA 5 Enhanced Version on PS5 and Xbox Series X, then you'll know that a new and improved version of the game is now available and may be looking for a smooth transition – especially if you've been playing the PS4 or Xbox One version of GTA 5 on your new-gen console for some time already.
How to get GTA 5 Enhanced Version(Image credit: Rockstar Games)The first thing to note if you want to get the GTA 5 Enhanced Version, is that it's a completely separate product to the PS4 or Xbox One release of GTA 5 you already have installed.
Thanks to Sony's long-standing relationship with Rockstar and GTA, the Enhanced Edition is cheaper on PS5 than Xbox Series X, and you can find all of the details for this in our separate GTA 5 price guide.
Once you've purchased and installed the GTA 5 Enhanced Version, you'll just need to transfer GTA 5 Story Mode progress to PS5 and Xbox Series X then follow the process for how to transfer GTA Online and you'll be all set.

     Summary: If you're jumping back into GTA Online, you'll likely be wondering if friends on PS4 can play with people on PS5 with GTA 5 crossplay.
Crossplay in GTA 5 PS5Unfortunately, GTA 5 next gen does not support crossplay at all.
PS5 players cannot play with Xbox players, and PS5 players can't even play with PS4 GTA Online players.

     Summary: Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming up on its ninth year of being available to gamers.
Grand Theft Auto 5 suffered delays for its PS5 and Xbox Series X versions though, meaning that a 2021 release date was abandoned.
There seems to be little competition between the two consoles as the PS5's load times finally bring an end to Grand Theft Auto 5 slow loading.
With Grand Theft Auto 6 likely some years away, though, fans may have to keep playing the new versions of Grand Theft Auto 5 for some time.
Grand Theft Auto 5 will release on March 15 for Xbox Series X and PS5, with pre-loading available now.

     Summary: In summary, there are two products - GTA 5 Story Mode and GTA Online - and they're available separately or bundled.
In this article, I want to draw your attention to nearly 10 years of Grand Theft Auto 5 by compiling some of the best pieces we've written about it.
It's a game that - courtesy of GTA Online - has lived on and on.
Isn't it funny to think that GTA 5 launched without GTA Online all that time ago?
Another part of the appeal are the almost absurd races in GTA Online, where players switch from car to jet and back again to nail gargantuan ramps on mind-bending racetracks.

     Hands On: Is GTA 5 PS5 Worth It?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aiming is significantly less sluggish, while driving through Los Santos with the new GTA Online tuning upgrades – more on those later – feels positively WipEout-esque.
From there, we clocked 11 seconds from the main menu into the single player campaign, and just six seconds when changing characters.
The single player campaign, despite being dated in some areas, is still laugh out loud funny at times, though – and it has some truly memorable moments in it.
But if you’ve played these missions before, and you don’t have any interest in GTA Online, it’s going to prove a more difficult sell we suppose.
Will you be returning to GTA 5 and GTA Online on PS5 this week?
