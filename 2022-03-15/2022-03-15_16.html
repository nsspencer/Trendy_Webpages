     Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws herself from consideration to the Federal Reserve Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Sarah Bloom Raskin has withdrawn from consideration to be a nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
Raskin submitted her withdrawal in a letter to President Joe Biden.
Biden nominated Raskin in January for the position of vice chair of supervision at the Fed, a role that would have made her a powerful regulator in the banking world.
But Raskin, a former Fed governor who was deputy Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, faced stiff opposition in the Senate based on her stance on climate change and fear that she could discourage banks from lending to fossil fuel companies.
In her letter to Biden withdrawing her nomination, which was shared with CNN, she wrote that many "in and outside the Senate are unwilling to acknowledge the economic complications of climate change and the toll it has placed, and will continue to place, on Americans. "

     Summary: Fed nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws after fight over her climate change stanceEnlarge this image toggle caption Ken Cedeno/AP Ken Cedeno/APPresident Biden's nominee for a top regulatory post at the Federal Reserve has withdrawn after opposition from fossil fuel interests dashed her hopes of confirmation in the closely divided Senate.
Sarah Bloom Raskin had drawn criticism from Senate Republicans for arguing that bank regulators should pay more attention to the financial risks posed by climate change.
Other Fed nominees likely to get a Senate voteRaskin's withdrawal clears the way for Senate action on four other Fed nominations, including a second term as Fed chairman for Jerome Powell.
Those nominations had been stalled, as Republicans boycotted a vote on Raskin in the Senate Banking Committee.
Raskin previously served on the Fed board of governors and in a top post at the Treasury Department.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailSarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination to become vice chair of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the White House confirmed.
Why it matters: Raskin's nomination was effectively set to fail after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced his opposition on Monday.
The setback reflects resistance to integrating climate change risk analysis into the U.S.'s top financial regulatory institution, Axios' Andrew Freedman writes.
"Any vice chair for supervision who ignored these realities — which are manifesting every day across this country — would be guilty of gross dereliction of duty."
Without Raskin in the role of vice chair, big banks won't have to worry as much about continuing to finance fossil fuel projects.

     Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws from contention to be Fed vice chair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sarah Bloom Raskin is withdrawing from contention to be vice chair for supervision at the Federal Reserve, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as she appears to lack the votes for confirmation in the Senate.
One day earlier, centrist Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his opposition to Raskin, throwing the nomination into doubt in the Senate.
His opposition meant she would need at least one Republican to support her to be confirmed, and there were no immediate volunteers.
Opponents of her nomination argued she would support factoring in the economic risks of climate change when making Fed policy decisions.
“She was unanimously confirmed twice by the Senate and has unquestionable qualifications.”Raskin, 60, served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2010 to 2014.

     Summary: Bloom Raskin, who is a law professor at Duke University, is not a new or untested figure on the national economic stage.
“This is not a novel or radical position,” Bloom Raskin says in her letter.
“The Department of Defense has been systematically analyzing the energy security risks of climate change for years, developing mitigation strategies to confront them.
Chairman Powell has recognized climate change as a significant risk that needs to be incorporated into the supervisory process.
(The allegations against Bloom Raskin, who has denied any improper behavior, dissolved under closer examination.)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House and Senate Democrats had stood by Raskin’s confirmation and vowed to lock in bipartisan support.
Senate Democrats expressed frustration that Republicans held up the confirmation process instead of voting against Raskin during the committee hearing.
Biden’s nominees for two other seats on the Fed board — economists Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson — also have yet to be confirmed.
But Democrats had refused to siphon off Raskin fearing Republicans would keep her from being confirmed indefinitely.
They were also hoping the Fed will move toward encouraging banks to reduce their exposures to climate risks.
