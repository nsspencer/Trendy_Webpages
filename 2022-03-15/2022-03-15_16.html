     Summary: If you're jumping back into GTA Online, you'll likely be wondering if friends on PS4 can play with people on PS5 with GTA 5 crossplay.
Crossplay in GTA 5 PS5Unfortunately, GTA 5 next gen does not support crossplay at all.
PS5 players cannot play with Xbox players, and PS5 players can't even play with PS4 GTA Online players.

This can be done across console families too, although: "For GTA Online platform migrations, purchased GTA$ can only be transferred between platforms of the same family (PS4 -&gt; PS5, Xbox One -&gt; Xbox Series).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming up on its ninth year of being available to gamers.
Grand Theft Auto 5 suffered delays for its PS5 and Xbox Series X versions though, meaning that a 2021 release date was abandoned.
There seems to be little competition between the two consoles as the PS5's load times finally bring an end to Grand Theft Auto 5 slow loading.
With Grand Theft Auto 6 likely some years away, though, fans may have to keep playing the new versions of Grand Theft Auto 5 for some time.
Grand Theft Auto 5 will release on March 15 for Xbox Series X and PS5, with pre-loading available now.

     Hands On: Is GTA 5 PS5 Worth It?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aiming is significantly less sluggish, while driving through Los Santos with the new GTA Online tuning upgrades – more on those later – feels positively WipEout-esque.
From there, we clocked 11 seconds from the main menu into the single player campaign, and just six seconds when changing characters.
The single player campaign, despite being dated in some areas, is still laugh out loud funny at times, though – and it has some truly memorable moments in it.
But if you’ve played these missions before, and you don’t have any interest in GTA Online, it’s going to prove a more difficult sell we suppose.
Will you be returning to GTA 5 and GTA Online on PS5 this week?
