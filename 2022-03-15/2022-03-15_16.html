    </h2>

     Summary: After years of denying having any plastic surgery, Bella Hadid is admitting she got a nose job when she was 14, though she now regrets the decision.
"I wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors,” Hadid – born to Dutch-born model and former "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Yolanda Hadid and Palestinian real estate developer Mohamed Hadid – told Vogue in a cover story published Tuesday.
Over the years, Hadid has denied getting any lip fillers, eye lifts or jaw reductions.
Hadid also opened up about struggling with self image growing up and working in the industry, both with her older sister, fellow model Gigi Hadid, 26.
But in seven years I never missed a job, canceled a job, was late to a job.

In a new cover story for Vogue, the supermodel confirmed that she did have a nose job when she was 14 years old and it's a decision she seriously regrets to this day.
“I think I would have grown into it.”But despite assumptions she's also done everything from getting her eyes lifted to having her jaw shaved, Hadid says none of that is true.
