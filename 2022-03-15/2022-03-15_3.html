     Summary: Sandra Bullock Isn't Writing Off Sequels AnymoreWhat's your favorite Sandra Bullock sequel?
That's sort of a trick question because, as Bullock herself admits, she's only done two and "they were horrible."
This was, as The Hollywood Reporter details, around the time of "The Heat," Bullock's 2013 buddy cop comedy with Melissa McCarthy.
That year, Bullock said in no uncertain terms:"I'm not doing a sequel to 'The Heat.'
Since then, however, Bullock has rethought her stance on sequels.

     Sandra Bullock Is Taking a Break from Acting, a Devastating Blow to Rom Com Fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rom com fans, we’ve got some potentially devastating news: Sandra Bullock is taking a break from acting.
“I take my job very seriously when I’m at work,” said the mom of Louis, 12, and Laila, 10.
There’s more than enough in her canon to hold us over while she takes a beat to recharge with her family.
Also, when you’re worth a cool $250 million at 57-years-old, you should absolutely stop working any job and simply *exist.
* Spend that money, Sandy.
