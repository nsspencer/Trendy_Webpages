     Nets Fined $50,000 for Letting Kyrie Irving Into Their Locker Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: fined the Nets $50,000 for allowing guard Kyrie Irving to enter the team’s locker room during Sunday’s game against the Knicks even though Irving had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus and thus was not allowed to be with the team at Barclays Center.
Irving had attended the game as a spectator, with a seat in the front row.
Under New York City law, Irving cannot play in games at Barclays Center because of a vaccine mandate for New York City-based workers who perform in-person work.
During a public appearance on Sunday, Adams responded to a heckler who urged him to let Irving play: “Listen, you’re right.
Kyrie can play tomorrow: Get vaccinated.”Nets forward Kevin Durant called the rule “ridiculous” after the game against the Knicks on Sunday.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving scored a career-high 60 points in a 150-108 win against the Orlando Magic.
Irving matched Minnesota All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns for most points in a single NBA game this season.
Towns had 60 points Monday night at San Antonio.
Tuesday's game marks the second time in his last three games that Irving has scored 50 or more.
Kevin Durant had 53 points in that game, giving Brooklyn a 50-point scorer in three of its last four games.

     Kyrie Irving erupts for career-high 60 points as NBA's scoring binge shows no signs of slowing down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One night after Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns set this season's single-game scoring high with 60 points against the Spurs, Kyrie Irving matched him with his own 60 piece in Brooklyn's 150-108 victory over the Magic on Tuesday.
Just like Towns, Irving only needed 31 shots for his 60 points.
The 60 points is a Brooklyn Nets franchise record, breaking Deron Williams' previous mark of 57.
Over the past two weeks alone, there have been six games of at least 50 points: Irving (50, 60), LeBron James (50, 56) Jayson Tatum (54) and Kevin Durant (53).
Irving scored 41 of his 60 in the first half, the highest single-half output in the league this season.

     Summary: Kevin Durant came into the defense of his Brooklyn Nets teammate Kyrie Irving once again as the fiery guard continues to refuse getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Irving exploded for 60 points on Tuesday to lead the Nets to a 150-108 victory over the Orlando Magic at Amway Center.
Durant also noted that Irving doesn’t deserve the criticisms he’s getting for his vaccination status.
Kevin Durant shares a bit about the talks he's had with Kyrie Irving on vaccines: -Doesn't think it's his own responsibility to push the issue with Irving.
So far Kyrie can attend in home games as a spectator but not play because of the COVID-19 vaccine rules in private organizations.

     Summary: For the second time in two nights, one of the NBA’s 30 single-game team scoring records has fallen.
Irving’s outburst — also a career high — came just two games after he poured in 50 on a ridiculous 19 shots against Charlotte.
Averaging nearly two points per attempt, Irving shot 20-for-31 from the floor, including 8-for-12 on 3-pointers, and was nearly perfect at the foul line (12-for-13).
Content to sit back and enjoy the show as well, fellow scoring ace Kevin Durant took only nine shots to finish with a tidy 19 points.
It also marked their sixth 50-point outing in only two active seasons together, four for Irving and two for Durant.

"Let Kyrie play," Cruz said at a Tuesday news conference.
"By the way, if Brooklyn won't let Kyrie play, I'm going to make a pitch to (him) directly, 'Kyrie, come to Houston, play for the Rockets.
According to New York City's workplace vaccine mandate, Irving is allowed to attend games in NYC as a spectator but is not allowed to play.
It's not the first time Cruz has pitched for Irving to play for Houston, either.

Irving can only play on the road because he’s unvaccinated and barred from playing home games in Brooklyn.
Irving’s 60-point output established a new career-high and set a Nets record.
If Irving and Kevin Durant (19 points, seven assists, five rebounds) are having some kind of scoring challenge, it’s a historic one.
“Making history and doing it with that guy is very special,” Irving said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two nights after Kevin Durant scored 53 points, a week after he had hit for 50 himself, Kyrie Irving rang up a historic night in Orlando with a franchise-record 60 points in a 150-108 win over the Magic.
“I think you could see that we're both in a nice little groove right now and we want to continue.
The 60 points were a career-high, as well as matching Karl-Anthony Towns for the highest scoring game in the NBA this season, which Towns accomplished just one night earlier.
It's just like that every game for Ky when you look up you're like, damn, he got 10, 12, 14 points already.
Irving had 60, and with that came the end of his night as a road crowd he had converted in the game’s earliest moments shared its admiration.
