     Premier League: Liverpool Pick Up Crucial Arsenal Win To Close Down Gap On Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool reignited the Premier League title race and came within a point of the top spot with a 2-0 win over Arsenal on Wednesday after scoring two second-half goals to extend their winning streak to nine games.
Liverpool now has 69 points, one behind Manchester City, which slipped up with a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace on Monday.
If Liverpool can win its remaining nine matches, including against City on April 10, the Reds will win the league.
“But momentum is the most fragile flower on the planet.”His team is trying to reclaim the Premier League title from City, which lifted the trophy last season.
Liverpool left back Andy Robertson predicted the title race could go down to the wire.

     Arsenal's Arteta lashes Premier League over fixture pile-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lashed out at Premier League bosses on Wednesday (Mar 16) over a pile-up of fixtures his side faces as it chases its first top-four finish in England's top league since 2016.
Arsenal's next match is an early kick off against Aston Villa on Saturday, before a hectic run of fixtures on Apr 4, 9, 16 and then Apr 20 and 23 against close league rivals Chelsea and Manchester United.
"Thank you so much to the Premier League," an animated Arteta told reporters after the Liverpool game.
Arteta said his side, which had a game against fierce north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur postponed in January after an outbreak of COVID-19, said he had already made representations to the Premier League about the pile-up of games.
"The only thing we care about is Arsenal, and for Arsenal it is not fair."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta’s men had been closing in on a Champions League finish this season, with games in hand on Manchester United.
The club were bottom of the table in August, and players such as Ben White were yet to establish themselves.
But as the season progressed, players such as Martin Odegaard, Buyako Saka, and Aaron Ramsdale started to prove their worth.
They then proceeded to secure a famous Premier League title in the eerie atmosphere of the pandemic-inflicted season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Momentum is a vital ingredient for any team chasing a league title and Liverpool are over-flowing with it right now.
Second-half goals by Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino at the Emirates secured Liverpool's ninth straight league win and moved them to just one point behind leaders City, who they face at the Etihad on April 10.
Monday's 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was an unexpected stumble by City, but Liverpool still had to beat Arsenal to capitalise on it.
The reality of this Arsenal team is that it now has an identity and a clear pathway in front of it.
They have won their last nine league games -- if they win their next nine, Liverpool will be champions.

     Summary: (AFP via Getty Images)Mikel Arteta has hit out at the Premier League over the scheduling of Arsenal’s fixtures.
“Thank you so much to the Premier League to do that,” said Arteta, who interjected a question about the tight turnaround to Aston Villa on Saturday.
They will eat, sleep well, but thank you so much to the Premier League for putting the fixtures like this.
Very, very helpful.”Asked if Arsenal made a case to the Premier League about the fixtures, Arteta said: “Yes, absolutely, because it is not fair.
But the one that is affected is Arsenal and the only thing that I care [about] and we care [about] is Arsenal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Draws are no good in this title race so Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino waited to join the game.
It was impressive and courageous management from Klopp during a game that had at times seen his team second best.
Jota left the field without touching the ball again which may have aggrieved the scorer a little.
But then Liverpool twice burgled Arsenal of possession in their own half and the smartness of Klopp’s decision was laid bare.
It is in passages of play such as this that we see one part of this Liverpool team’s beauty.
