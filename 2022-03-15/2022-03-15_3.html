     Browns Trade Patriots for LB Chase Winovich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The AFC North continues to get more difficult as the Cleveland Browns trade with the New England Patriots for outside linebacker Chase Winovich, according to NFL Network.
Winovich was the Patriots third-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, and has played 45 games for New England, including nine starts.
The Pittsburgh Steelers have been connected to Winovich since his days at Michigan.
The Browns do have Jaeveon Clowney floating around free agency with no certainty to re-sign him.

     Patriots trade linebacker Chase Winovich to Browns for Mack Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His snaps slipped significantly in 2021, playing just 10 percent of the defensive snaps and registering just 5 total tackles on the season.
The Patriots got the trade winds blowing early Tuesday, sending edge defender Chase Winovich to the Browns in exchange for inside linebacker Mack Wilson, according to a league source.
AdvertisementAfter news of the trade broke, Winovich posted a message on Twitter to say he was grateful for his time in New England.
Wilson, who like Winovich is in the final year of his rookie deal, was a rotational player in Cleveland’s defense.
In 2018, Wilson had one sack and two interceptions for Alabama, along with 71 total tackles.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns have agreed to a trade with the New England Patriots for linebacker Chase Winovich.
The Browns will be sending linebacker Mack Wilson to the Patriots in a trade of players who need a fresh start.
The #Patriots are sending OLB Chase Winovich to the #Browns for LB Mack Wilson, per sources.
While he played 13 games last season, Winovich saw his playing time decrease from 594 defensive snaps (with nine starts) in 2020 to just 113 (with no starts) last season.
The trade isn’t surprising, but his inability to carve out more of a defensive role after his 2020 season was a bit of a mystery.

     Patriots trading OLB Chase Winovich to Browns for LB Mack Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots are trading edge rusher ﻿Chase Winovich﻿ to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for linebacker ﻿Mack Wilson﻿, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.
Drafted in the fifth round of the same draft, Wilson carved out a nice starting role in Cleveland over his first three seasons, starting 28 of 43 games played in the middle of the Browns defense.
Like Winovich, the former Alabama standout also saw his play time decrease on defense in 2021 and played nearly as many snaps on special teams as he did at LB.
In Winovich, Cleveland gets some pass rush depth that could help offset the potential loss of ﻿Jadeveon Clowney﻿.
In Wilson, the Patriots reap an inexpensive defender with starter potential to help replace ﻿Dont'a Hightower﻿, ﻿Ja'Whaun Bentley﻿ and ﻿Jamie Collins﻿, all of whom may leave in free agency, plus some valuable special teams experience.

     Chase Winovich says goodbye to Patriots following trade to Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After three seasons, Chase Winovich is no longer with the New England Patriots.
Regardless, he always kept a positive attitude and that was reflected in his goodbye tweet following the trade.
“I am so grateful for my experience in New England,” Winovich wrote.
📖💓✌🏻🍯 — Chase Winovich (@Wino) March 15, 2022The Patriots needed depth and speed with off-the-ball linebackers and Wilson brings just that.
New England traded Winovich for a player at a different position, but it’s something the Patriots are focused on — especially with the potential losses through free agency.

     Quick-hit thoughts on the Patriots trading Chase Winovich for Mack Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots opened the second day of the NFL’s legal tampering period by making a change at the linebacker position.
The team moved on from former third-round draft pick Chase Winovich via trade, sending him to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Mack Wilson.
Wilson and Winovich do not play the same positionsWhile both players are listed as linebackers, Mack Wilson and Chase Winovich are not the same type of player: whereas Wilson is more of an off-the-ball linebacker, Winovich has traditionally been playing on the edge for the Patriots.
Patriots improve their off-the-ball depth but weaken their edgeNew England’s off-the-ball linebacker position remains a major need at the moment, but Wilson adds some experienced depth to the group.
Wilson adds experience on special teamsChase Winovich’s biggest contributions to the Patriots’ roster in 2021 came on special teams.
