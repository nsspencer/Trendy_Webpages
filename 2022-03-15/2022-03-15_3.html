     Nets Fined $50,000 for Letting Kyrie Irving Into Their Locker Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: fined the Nets $50,000 for allowing guard Kyrie Irving to enter the team’s locker room during Sunday’s game against the Knicks even though Irving had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus and thus was not allowed to be with the team at Barclays Center.
Irving had attended the game as a spectator, with a seat in the front row.
Under New York City law, Irving cannot play in games at Barclays Center because of a vaccine mandate for New York City-based workers who perform in-person work.
During a public appearance on Sunday, Adams responded to a heckler who urged him to let Irving play: “Listen, you’re right.
Kyrie can play tomorrow: Get vaccinated.”Nets forward Kevin Durant called the rule “ridiculous” after the game against the Knicks on Sunday.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving scored a career-high 60 points in a 150-108 win against the Orlando Magic.
Irving matched Minnesota All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns for most points in a single NBA game this season.
Towns had 60 points Monday night at San Antonio.
Tuesday's game marks the second time in his last three games that Irving has scored 50 or more.
Kevin Durant had 53 points in that game, giving Brooklyn a 50-point scorer in three of its last four games.

     Summary: As Republican lawmakers urged the Biden administration to end the federal mask mandate for airline passengers, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz used the opportunity to instead pitch Kyrie Irving on the Rockets.
"Let Kyrie play," Cruz said at a Tuesday news conference.
"By the way, if Brooklyn won't let Kyrie play, I'm going to make a pitch to (him) directly, 'Kyrie, come to Houston, play for the Rockets.
According to New York City's workplace vaccine mandate, Irving is allowed to attend games in NYC as a spectator but is not allowed to play.
It's not the first time Cruz has pitched for Irving to play for Houston, either.

     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — In a career of great offensive nights, this was Kyrie Irving’s greatest.
The Nets star’s mesmerizing 60 points were a career-high and a franchise record, while matching an NBA season-best.
Those 60 points also led the Nets to their fourth consecutive win, a 150-108 rout of the Magic, as Irving was showered with cheers and serenaded with chants of “Kyrie!
The irony of the Magic crowd reveling in Irving’s magic while he still can’t play on his home court at Barclays Center wasn’t lost on the Nets.
The second half was simply perfunctory, as the Nets led by as many as 44 points.
