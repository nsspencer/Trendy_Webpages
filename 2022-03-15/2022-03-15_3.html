     Lions set to sign DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Lions re-signed Josh Reynolds last week and now theyâ€™re set to add a wideout from outside the organization this week.
According to multiple reports, the Lions have agreed to terms with DJ Chark on a one-year deal.
Chark fractured his ankle while playing for the Jaguars in Week Four of the 2021.
That injury likely put him on the path to a one-year deal with an eye on playing well enough to land a larger pact heading into the 2023 season.
The Jaguars picked Chark in the second round of the 2018 draft.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an exploding wide receiver market, the Detroit Lions took a measured approach to their free agent shopping at the position.
The Lions agreed to a one-year contract Tuesday with Jacksonville Jaguars receiver DJ Chark, a league source told the Free Press.
The Los Angeles Chargers signed Mike Williams to a three-year, $60 million contract before the start of free agency.
And Christian Kirk agreed to a four-year deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Day 1 of free agency Monday that has a maximum value of $84 million.
The Lions entered free agency determined to add an outside receiver to their offense that struggled in the red zone and to push the ball downfield last season.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>

     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout D.J.
Chark to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
On the other side of the ball, Detroit is slated to re-sign pass rusher ï»¿Charles Harrisï»¿ to a two-year, $14 million deal, Rapoport added.
