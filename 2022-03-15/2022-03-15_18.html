    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 16 seed in the main tournament bracket and an opening game against Baylor, a No.
“Some people look at equality and say, we have a seat at the table,” said J. Kenyatta Cavil, a professor at Texas Southern and an expert on H.B.C.U.
Many H.B.C.U.s play most or all of their nonconference games on the road, often participating in so-called “buy” games.
Schools earn roughly $75,000 to $100,000 per game to play teams in higher-rated conferences, in essence trading fierce competition and frequent defeat for paychecks.
Texas Southern opened the season with seven consecutive road defeats and did not play at home until Jan. 8.
