     Summary: The San Diego Padres have a tough situation on their hands.
Fernando Tatis Jr. is now out for three months as a result of a fractured wrist.
The way Tatis sustained his injury will certainly infuriate the Padres management, as well as their fanbase.
Tatis injured his wrist in a motorcycle accident during the lockout, while players and team personnel could not contact one another.
New Padres manager Bob Melvin spoke to the media regarding the incident and said that he believes Tatis’ motorcycle days are over.

     Fernando Tatis Jr. Addresses Motorcycle Accidents During Offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Padres announced Tuesday that star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. suffered a fractured wrist during the offseason and could miss up to three months to recover.
However, he did allude to the reported motorcycle accident that the 23-year-old Tatis was involved in the Dominican Republic in December.
According to Kevin Acee of The San Diego Union-Tribune, Tatis suffered “minor scrapes” in the accident.
However, when speaking to the media Tuesday, the Padres shortstop seemingly admitted that he was in a number of minor accidents during the offseason.
When a reporter asked him when the originally reported motorcycle accident occurred, Tatis replied, “Which one?” He remained vague when asked to clarify the date of the accident in ensuing questions.

     Delay costly to Tatis, Padres; mid-June ‘realistic’ for return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fact pattern, including multiple photographs on social media in the ensuing weeks that show Tatis’ wrist in a brace, seems to support this conjecture.
Due to the lockout, communication between Tatis and Padres officials after the accident was limited and second- or third-hand.
(Padres team physicians are contracted through UCSD Health.)
But, relying on conversations with Tatis’ representatives, the team felt assured Tatis merely suffered scrapes and bruises in the fall from the motorcycle.
The Padres were not aware of any issue regarding Tatis’ wrist until after the lockout ended.

     Fernando Tatis Jr. injury: Star out up to three months with fractured wrist; Padres address motorcycle riding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Diego Padres superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. suffered a fractured wrist at some point during the offseason and could be out up to three months, GM A.J.
"Nothing crazy, I thought it was something we could work through," Tatis told reporters, including MLB.com's AJ Cassavell, about the injury.
In his three MLB seasons, Tatis has played 273 of 384 possible regular season games, or 71 percent.
I feel like everybody's disappointed, especially me," Tatis told Cassavell.
San Diego traded second baseman Adam Frazier to the Mariners prior to the lockout, thinning the club's middle infield depth.
