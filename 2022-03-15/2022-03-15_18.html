He is restricted from posting, commenting and other actions for 24 hours and the company will take further action if necessary, the spokesperson said.

     Kanye picks up a 24-hour Instagram ban after Trevor Noah comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instagram has finally reached the state that so many of us have achieved over the last decade and change.
I .e., being all full up on hearing from Kanye West.
Which is to say that the Meta-owned social media network has issued a 24-hour ban to the musician, presumably linked to comments he recently made about Daily Show host Trevor Noah.
West’s response to Noah’s commentary has since been deleted, but, per Variety, it apparently involved at least one racial slur.
Anyway, we can’t wait for this 24-hour ban from social media to help Kanye get his head right and stop doing stuff like this, once and for all.

     Summary: Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours, after he used a racial slur to describe TV presenter Trevor Noah.
I don’t care if you support Trump and I don’t care if you roast Pete.
Kardashian filed for divorce in January 2021, and she was declared legally single by a US court earlier this month.
West has lamented the split on his 2021 album Donda and in a recent poem, Divorce.
West later apologised for posting the screenshots and accompanying messages, saying: “I know sharing screen shots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim.

     Kanye West Suspended From Instagram For One Day After Posting Slur Targeting Trevor Noah
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after the rapper posted a slur targeting The Daily Show host Trevor Noah, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.
As part of the temporary suspension, West — who legally goes by “Ye” — will not be able to post, comment or send DMs, the spokesperson said.
Earlier on Wednesday, West directed a slur toward Noah after the talk show host addressed the contentious divorce between the Donda artist and Kim Kardashian.
I do however care when I see you on a path that’s dangerously close to peril and pain.
But you have to know the difference between that and fighting your family,” Noah wrote.
