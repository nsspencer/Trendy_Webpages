     NFL free agency 2022: 49ers to sign former Chiefs cornerback Charvarius Ward to three-year deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Charvarius Ward is set to take his talents to the Bay Area.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, Ward has agreed to a three-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers.
The deal is said to be worth up to $42 million and includes $26.7 million guaranteed.
Following his arrival in Kansas City, Ward blossomed into a key player in the club's secondary.
Adding a starting-caliber cornerback was high on the 49ers' offseason list and Ward now looks primed to start in a secondary that includes Emmanuel Moseley and second-year cornerback Ambry Thomas.

     What the 49ers are Getting in Charvarius Ward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers reeled in Charvarius Ward, formerly of the Chiefs, and is slated to be the new starting cornerback opposite of Emmanuel Moseley.
While he isn't the alluring player like a J.C. Jackson, Ward still provides a boost in the secondary for the 49ers.
Even with Ambry Thomas, who had his moments, wasn't sufficient for it, hence why Ward is now with the 49ers.
Jordan Foote, Deputy Editor of Arrowhead Report (sister site to All49ersSI), and Tucker Franklin of KCSportsNetwork, schooled me up on what the 49ers are getting in Charvarius Ward.
The Chiefs couldn’t afford to splurge on him, but the 49ers are getting a very solid player."

     Charvarius Ward’s departure leaves Chiefs thinner at cornerback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most of Chiefs Kingdom knew that cornerback Charvarius Ward was a likely candidate to leave in free agency.
Ward’s ascent in playing time is a testament to his hard work and natural talent—as well as the Chiefs’ coaching staff.
The Kansas City Chiefs are much thinner at cornerback with the news that Charvarius Ward left for the San Francisco 49ers.
There’s a reason the Niners wanted to get this deal done early in free agency: Ward is perfect for what they want to do.
Ward’s exit is a great story for him, but it leaves the Chiefs in the lurch with a real need to fill.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers watched some of their key players depart in NFL free agency on Monday, but they landed a big-ticket option in cornerback Charvarius Ward.
With Ward in the mix, how will his presence shake up San Francisco’s cornerback depth chart?
What Charvarius Ward means for 49ers cornerback depth chartThere’s little doubting the 49ers have full intention of making Ward their primary boundary cornerback, upgrading over both last year’s late-season starters, Emmanuel Moseley and Ambry Thomas, while also all but guaranteeing the Niners bid farewell to Norman.

     49ers break with tradition to spend big bucks on cornerback Charvarius Ward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opposite him was Charvarius Ward, an unheralded cornerback completing his first full season as a Kansas City Chiefs starter.
Ward agreed to a three-year, $42 million deal with $26.7 million guaranteed, according to his agency, Universal Sports Management.
James, in fact, beat Ward for a last-minute, game-winning touchdown catch in the pair’s pro debut, the 2018 preseason opener.
Ward made a career-high $3.4 million last season on a one-year tender as a Chiefs’ restricted free agent.
It also didn’t come at the sticker price of an infamous 49ers cornerback signing in 2007: Nate Clements, who was released four seasons into his eight-year, $80 million deal.
