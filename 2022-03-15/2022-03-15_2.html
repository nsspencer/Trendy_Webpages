     Randy Gregory: Broncos to sign DE to five-year deal worth $70M after Cowboys deal falls apart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory is signing with the Broncos after initially reportedly agreeing to terms with the Cowboys, according to Denver’s Altitude Sports’s Vic Lombardi.
The Cowboys were re-signing defensive end Randy Gregory to a five-year deal worth $70 million, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter and he will get the same deal in Denver, per NFL Network.
Gregory changed his mind about a Dallas return because the team insisted on language that protected them, per NFL Network.
The Cowboys drafted Gregory in the second round of the 2015 NFL draft and has been there ever since.
Now he joins an up-and-coming Denver team who just added Russell Wilson last week.

     Grading the Denver Broncos stealing Randy Gregory in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)The Denver Broncos are going to gamble on a player with huge potential.
The Broncos have agreed to terms with pass-rushing specialist Randy Gregory in a deal that could become one of the bigger stories of this year’s free-agent signing period.
What makes this move so interesting is that Gregory initially agreed to remain with the Dallas Cowboys.
But Gregory seems to have gotten his act together since then and flourished within a solid Dallas defense last season, registering six sacks, one interception and one fumble recovery.
But as Mike Klis of 9News reported, Gregory was the Broncos’ top pass-rushing target in free agency.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just moments after the Cowboys announced they had agreed to terms on a new five-year deal with Randy Gregory, the defensive end changed his mind, spurning Dallas to instead agree to a five-year, $70 million deal with the Denver Broncos, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport added that a hang-up in contract language was a sticking point for Gregory in returning to the Cowboys.
Per Rapoport, the Cowboys deal was also going to be for $70 million.
NFL Network's James Palmer reported that the Broncos turned their attention to Gregory when it became apparent that Miller would be too expensive to sign.
With a healthy Bradley Chubb in the mix, Denver will have two excellent edge rushers set to hunt quarterbacks.

     Summary: Adam Schefter explains what caused Randy Gregory to change his mind and leave the Cowboys for the Broncos.
(1:09)How Randy Gregory went from staying with Dallas to leaving for Denver (1:09)ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- In a stunning -- and public -- reversal of free-agency fortune, the Denver Broncos have agreed to terms with outside linebacker Randy Gregory.
When questioned about the clause, the Cowboys said that it is included in every Dallas player contract but Dak Prescott's, the source told Werder.
Denver also agreed to re-sign linebacker Josey Jewell to a two-year, $11 million contract Tuesday, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
Gregory made a career-high 11 starts last season, missing time because of a calf strain and COVID-19.

     Randy Gregory to sign with Broncos, not Cowboys, in NFL free agency flip-flop

     Summary: Because defensive end Randy Gregory, two people with knowledge of the deal confirmed to USA TODAY Sports, pivoted.
But multiple reports said the Cowboys added a clause in the deal that Gregory and his representation weren’t comfortable with.
Gregory’s marijuana usage was in part how he handled intense social anxiety, he told USA TODAY Sports.
“It’s refreshing to see how far Randy’s come.”In 50 career games for the Cowboys, Gregory collected 85 tackles, 16 ½ sacks, eight forced fumbles and 52 quarterback hits.
The Broncos tweeted a GIF that needed just one word: “SURPRISE.”Follow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.
