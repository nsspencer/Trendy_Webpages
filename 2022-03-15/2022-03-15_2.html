     Permanent daylight saving time? America tried it before ... and it didn't go well.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. is seriously considering making daylight saving time permanent, a move that would likely be popular.
But history suggests that opinion might not last.
About three-quarters of Americans recently said they would prefer not switching back and forth between between standard and daylight saving time, a poll conducted in October 2021 from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found.
Experts have lamented that changing the clocks has wide-ranging negative consequences, from sleep disruptions to a temporary uptick in traffic accidents.

     Baldwin, Johnson Both Agree: Make Daylight Savings Time Permanent – KFIZ News-Talk 1450 AM

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Local NewsIt’s something that both Senators Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson can agree on: no more switching to back and forth Daylight Savings Time.
The US Senate voted unanimously on Tuesday to make the switch to Daylight Savings Time permanent.
That would mean no more Spring Forward, Fall Back shifts to move sunrise and sunset in the winter.
Supporters of the bill say the change will help lessen depression and allow children more time to play outdoors.
The measure would need approval from the house before it moves to President Biden’s desk.

     A Groggy Senate Approves Making Daylight Saving Time Permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — After losing an hour of sleep over the weekend, members of the United States Senate returned to the Capitol this week a bit groggy and in a mood to put an end to all this frustrating clock-changing.
So on Tuesday, with almost no warning and no debate, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to do away with the biannual springing forward and falling back that most Americans have come to despise, in favor of making daylight saving time permanent.
The bill’s fate in the House was not immediately clear, but if the legislation were to pass there and be signed by President Biden, it would take effect in November 2023.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rose on the Senate floor on Tuesday to speak in favor of his bill, called the Sunshine Protection Act, which would end the practice of turning clocks back one hour to standard time every November, making daylight saving time, which currently begins in March, last throughout the year.
“One has to ask themselves after a while: Why do we keep doing it?” Mr. Rubio said, adding, “The majority of the American people’s preference is just to stop the back-and-forth changing.”

     Senate unanimously approves making Daylight Savings Time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill in an unanimous voice vote that would make daylight savings time permanent, potentially putting an end to the twice-annual time changes.
The federal legislation comes after around 30 states have passed legislation to make it daylight savings time year-round.
The system began in the United States in 1918, and was originally put into place by Germany to conserve fuel during World War I.
According to a Department of Transportation study from 1975, the United States used around one percent less energy during daylight savings time.
Supporters of daylight savings time credit the time change with helping to reduce crime as it increases daylight hours, making it harder for criminals to go undetected.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoWASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.
On Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour.
Pallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.
Daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918.
The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s happened: On Tuesday, the US Senate voted unanimously to make daylight saving time permanent beginning in 2023.
Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I and became a national standard in the 1960s.
Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.
Daylight saving time — and yes, it’s “saving time” and not “savings time”— begins in the spring, just as the increase in daylight hours starts to be noticeably longer.
There was a year in the 1970s when daylight saving time lasted for 16 months, and not everyone was pleased.
