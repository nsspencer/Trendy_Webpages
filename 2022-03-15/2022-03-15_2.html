     Google Doodle Honours French Painter Rosa Bonheur on Her 200th Birth Anniversary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born on 16 March 1822 in Bordeaux, France.
Her father, who was a landscape painter, helped Rosa in her early artistic education.
Her aspirations as an artist were considered unconventional for women of the time.
With her work, she earned a reputation as an animal painter, which further grew in the 1840s, with many of her works exhibited at the prestigious Paris Salon from 1841 to 1853.

     Google Doodle Celebrates French Artist Rosa Bonheur's 200th Birthday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GoogleTwo centuries ago, the educational opportunities available to women in the art world were limited.
But art seemed to be in Rosa Bonheur's blood.
Born into a family of painters, the French artist was sketching with pencil and paper before she could talk.
To honor Bonheur's contribution to the art world and a career that inspired generations of female artists to come, Google dedicated its Doodle on Wednesday to the artist on her 200th birthday.
After a failed apprenticeship as a seamstress at the age of 12, Bonheur's father began instructing her in art and painting.
