The management team for the 42-year-old "Milkshake" singer confirmed that her photographer spouse passed away at the age of 37 following his battle with cancer.
"Sadly, it's true that Mike Mora has passed away," Red Light Management's Steve Satterthwaite told Entertainment Tonight.
He was hospitalized and "extremely worried" about Kelis and their newborn daughter, the couple having welcomed the child just 17 days before.
"In fact, while she was in the NICU for 10 days (whole other story), I thought the whole time that I just had an ulcer," Mora wrote.
