     Why Randy Gregory’s deal with Cowboys fell apart, to sign with Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a drama-filled afternoon on Tuesday after former Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory changed his mind and elected to join the Broncos instead of return to the Cowboys.
It was initially reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter that the Cowboys were re-signing Gregory to a five-year deal worth $70 million.
However, less than two hours later, Denver’s Altitude Sports’s Vic Lombardi reported that he was instead joining the Broncos.
The Cowboys insisted on contract language that protected themselves and Gregory didn’t like it, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
The Cowboys tweeted that they had agreed to terms with Gregory and had to swiftly delete the post.

     Randy Gregory flips on Dallas Cowboys after agreeing to contract, to join Denver Broncos instead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter explains what caused Randy Gregory to change his mind and leave the Cowboys for the Broncos.
(1:09)How Randy Gregory went from staying with Dallas to leaving for Denver (1:09)ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- In a stunning -- and public -- reversal of free-agency fortune, the Denver Broncos have agreed to terms with outside linebacker Randy Gregory.
Because of a variety of injuries and suspensions, Gregory has never started more than 11 games in a season nor finished with more than six sacks.
Gregory made a career-high 11 starts last season, missing time because of a calf strain and COVID-19.
The Cowboys selected Gregory in the second round of the 2015 draft after off-field issues hurt his status.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just moments after the Cowboys announced they had agreed to terms on a new five-year deal with Randy Gregory, the defensive end changed his mind, spurning Dallas to instead agree to a five-year, $70 million deal with the Denver Broncos, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport added that a hang-up in contract language was a sticking point for Gregory in returning to the Cowboys.
Per Rapoport, the Cowboys deal was also going to be for $70 million.
NFL Network's James Palmer reported that the Broncos turned their attention to Gregory when it became apparent that Miller would be too expensive to sign.
With a healthy Bradley Chubb in the mix, Denver will have two excellent edge rushers set to hunt quarterbacks.

     Randy Gregory to sign with Broncos, not Cowboys, in NFL free agency flip-flop

     Summary: Because defensive end Randy Gregory, two people with knowledge of the deal confirmed to USA TODAY Sports, pivoted.
But multiple reports said the Cowboys added a clause in the deal that Gregory and his representation weren’t comfortable with.
Gregory’s marijuana usage was in part how he handled intense social anxiety, he told USA TODAY Sports.
“It’s refreshing to see how far Randy’s come.”In 50 career games for the Cowboys, Gregory collected 85 tackles, 16 ½ sacks, eight forced fumbles and 52 quarterback hits.
The Broncos tweeted a GIF that needed just one word: “SURPRISE.”Follow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.
