     Lions set to sign DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Lions re-signed Josh Reynolds last week and now they’re set to add a wideout from outside the organization this week.
According to multiple reports, the Lions have agreed to terms with DJ Chark on a one-year deal.
Chark fractured his ankle while playing for the Jaguars in Week Four of the 2021.
That injury likely put him on the path to a one-year deal with an eye on playing well enough to land a larger pact heading into the 2023 season.
The Jaguars picked Chark in the second round of the 2018 draft.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>

     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout D.J.
Chark to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
On the other side of the ball, Detroit is slated to re-sign pass rusher ﻿Charles Harris﻿ to a two-year, $14 million deal, Rapoport added.

     4 quick thoughts on the Detroit Lions adding DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions finally struck in free agency by reportedly agreeing to terms with former Jaguars receiver DJ Chark on Tuesday morning.
“Whether that’s a big guy with a lot of strength and size, whether that’s a guy with elite quickness or speed.
Typically you’d see Chark seeking a longer-term deal, but the Lions sweetened the pot by making it fully guaranteed.
Chark’s $10 million+ cap hit cuts the Lions’ free agency spending money basically in half.
Lions still very much in the WR market in the draftWith Chark only inked for one year, this shouldn’t change the Lions’ plans at receiver in the draft.
