     Lions set to sign DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Lions re-signed Josh Reynolds last week and now they’re set to add a wideout from outside the organization this week.
According to multiple reports, the Lions have agreed to terms with DJ Chark on a one-year deal.
Chark fractured his ankle while playing for the Jaguars in Week Four of the 2021.
That injury likely put him on the path to a one-year deal with an eye on playing well enough to land a larger pact heading into the 2023 season.
The Jaguars picked Chark in the second round of the 2018 draft.

     Former Jacksonville Jaguars WR DJ Chark Jr. to sign 1-year deal with Detroit Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark Jr. intends to sign a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The deal is expected to be worth up to $13 million, according to the source.
Chark, 25, had seven catches for 154 yards and two touchdowns before getting hurt last season.
One AFC executive told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Chark has what it takes to be great, but his fitness and nuanced route running aren't where they could be.
He followed that up with 53 catches for 706 yards and five touchdowns in 2020.

The deal is worth $10 million fully guaranteed per Ian Rapoport with the potential of maxing out at $12 million.
Given that this is just a one-year deal for Chark, this shouldn’t alter Detroit’s plans for adding a receiver in the draft.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the 25-year-old agreed to one-year contract with the Lions on Tuesday.
He led the Jags in targets (118), receptions (73), receiving yards (1,008) and receiving touchdowns (eight) in 15 games.
He still led the team in targets (93), receiving yards (506) and tied for the team lead in touchdowns (five).
Amon-Ra St. Brown led the team in receptions (90) and receiving yards (912) as a rookie and filled in nicely for Kenny Golladay after Golladay left in free agency.
A one-year deal for Chark allows him to potentially parlay a big season into a nice payday this time next spring.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal

     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout ﻿D.J.
Chark﻿ to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
For Lions general manager Brad Holmes, this is precisely the type of deal that fits Detroit's timeline.
