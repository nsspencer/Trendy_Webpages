     Summary: The Detroit Lions were expected to be big spenders for one of the talented free agent wide receivers to hit the market.
Detroit has reached a contract agreement with former Jacksonville Jaguars wideout D.J.
In four NFL seasons, Chark Jr. has amassed 147 receptions for 2,042 yards and 15 touchdowns.
He also acknowledged adding a talented wideout to the roster capable of winning one-on-one matchups regularly would provide a boost to several areas of the offense.
That’s something we need to look at and need to continue to explore.”This article was produced by the staff at Sports Illustrated/All Lions.

     Former Jacksonville Jaguars WR DJ Chark Jr. to sign 1-year deal with Detroit Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark Jr. intends to sign a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Lions also are re-signing defensive end Charles Harris to a two-year $14 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Harris had 7.5 sacks with the Lions last season, his first with the franchise.
Chark, 25, had seven catches for 154 yards and two touchdowns before getting hurt last season.
One AFC executive told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Chark has what it takes to be great, but his fitness and nuanced route running aren't where they could be.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that Chark signed a one-year, fully guaranteed deal worth $10 million with the Lions.
Chark made the Pro Bowl back in 2019 after amassing over 1,000 receiving yards and eight touchdowns.
The Jaguars’ wide receiver corps will look significantly different in 2022.
Besides Chark, the Jaguars could also lose Laquon Treadwell, who developed a nice rapport with Trevor Lawrence and stepped up towards the end of the 2021 season.
That could leave Marvin Jones Jr. as the lone remaining member of the Jags’ 2021 wide receiver corps.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout D.J.
Chark to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
On the other side of the ball, Detroit is slated to re-sign pass rusher ﻿Charles Harris﻿ to a two-year, $14 million deal, Rapoport added.

     4 quick thoughts on the Detroit Lions adding DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions finally struck in free agency by reportedly agreeing to terms with former Jaguars receiver DJ Chark on Tuesday morning.
“Whether that’s a big guy with a lot of strength and size, whether that’s a guy with elite quickness or speed.
Typically you’d see Chark seeking a longer-term deal, but the Lions sweetened the pot by making it fully guaranteed.
Chark’s $10 million+ cap hit cuts the Lions’ free agency spending money basically in half.
Lions still very much in the WR market in the draftWith Chark only inked for one year, this shouldn’t change the Lions’ plans at receiver in the draft.
