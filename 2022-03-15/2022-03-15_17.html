     Ginni Thomas' revelation she went to Jan. 6 rally puts squishy Supreme Court rules in spotlight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ginni Thomas has questioned whether the 2020 election was fraudulent, but said she had no part in the riot.
The situation has drawn attention to the rules around Supreme Court recusals, or when justices sit out a case.
Republicans are expected to press Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson about whether she'll recuse herself in a case involving Harvard.
WASHINGTON – The revelation that Virginia "Ginni" Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, attended President Donald Trump's rally ahead of the attack last year on the U.S. Capitol has once again opened the couple up to scrutiny and raised questions about when members of the high court should recuse themselves.

     Ginni Thomas’ attendance at Jan. 6 rally sparks new controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack subpoenaed White House materials, Donald Trump sued to keep the documents from his administration hidden.
The former president ran out of options, however, two months ago: The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Republican’s emergency appeal, clearing the way for disclosure.
The New York Times reported:Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, said in an interview published on Monday that she attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally at the Ellipse in Washington.
Ginni Thomas’ efforts on Jan. 6 have been the subject of quite a bit of scrutiny lately.
In case this isn’t obvious, Ginni Thomas is not just some random person with conservative political beliefs.

     Summary: "Federal recusal law says that any justice 'shall disqualify' if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned," said Gabe Roth of Fix the Court, a group seeking more transparency from Supreme Court justices.
"Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America," Thomas told the Free Beacon.
"But we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too," she said.

     Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Wants a Section 230 Reckoning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Never one to shy away from the Big Tech debate, the conservative Supreme Court justice recently hinted that Section 230—“the twenty-six words that created the internet”—could soon be in the highest court’s crosshairs.
Second, Big Tech companies never fail to abuse the privilege.
But it is his impugnment of the tech companies themselves—who use the statute as a shield—that deserves attention.
The implications of Justice Thomas’s thinking for Big Tech are stark.
But should they fail, Thomas’s most recent attempt to rally his confreres on the court may be exactly what Americans need to compel a reckoning with Big Tech.

     Virginia Thomas, wife of right-wing Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, admits to participating in January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an article published Monday by the right-wing Washington Free Beacon, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, revealed that she attended the “Stop the Steal” rally outside the White House on January 6, 2021, in support of Donald Trump’s extra-constitutional attempt to overthrow the election of Joe Biden.
For most of her adult life, Virginia Thomas has been politically active in the far-right of the Republican Party, advocating, organizing and helping to implement measures to further empower the most rapacious sections of the financial oligarchy.
Virginia "Ginni" Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, arrives to watch Amy Coney Barrett take the Constitutional Oath on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, October 26, 2020.
Virginia has used her relationship with Clarence, whom she married in 1987, four years before his accession to the Supreme Court, to advance their shared extreme right-wing political agenda.
This past January, the Supreme Court rejected Trump’s request, on specious grounds of “executive privilege,” that it intervene to stop the House January 6 Committee from accessing White House records from his term of office.
