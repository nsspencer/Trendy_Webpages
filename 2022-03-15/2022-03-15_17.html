     Biden nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws her candidacy for Federal Reserve board

     Summary: Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's embattled nominee to the Federal Reserve, on Tuesday withdrew her candidacy to serve at the central bank, ending a weekslong partisan battle in the Senate over her views on climate policy.
Manchin's decision would have made her confirmation nearly impossible in a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.
Biden in a statement praised Raskin while blasting her opponents.
"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people," the president said.
Raskin, who previously served as a Fed governor and deputy Treasury secretary, echoed that statement in a letter to Biden, in which she blamed "relentless attacks by special interests" in derailing her nomination.

     Biden to Withdraw Nomination for Fed’s Top Bank Cop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden will withdraw his nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as the Federal Reserve’s top bank regulator on Tuesday, after a Democratic senator said he would join Republicans in voting against her, most likely dooming her chances of confirmation.
Ms. Raskin earlier on Tuesday sent a letter to the White House asking to withdraw her name from consideration to be the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, according to two people familiar with the decision.
“Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups,” Mr. Biden said in a statement released on Tuesday afternoon.
While the end of Ms. Raskin’s candidacy will leave the Biden administration without the regulatory voice it was hoping for at the Fed Board, which oversees the nation’s largest banks, it could pave the way toward confirmation for the White House’s other Fed picks.
Republicans had been stonewalling Ms. Raskin’s nomination, and in the process they were holding up the White House’s four other Fed nominees, including Jerome H. Powell, who is seeking confirmation to a second term as Fed chair.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailSarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination to become vice chair of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the White House confirmed.
Why it matters: Raskin's nomination was effectively set to fail after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced his opposition on Monday.
The setback reflects resistance to integrating climate change risk analysis into the U.S.'s top financial regulatory institution, Axios' Andrew Freedman writes.
"Any vice chair for supervision who ignored these realities — which are manifesting every day across this country — would be guilty of gross dereliction of duty."
Without Raskin in the role of vice chair, big banks won't have to worry as much about continuing to finance fossil fuel projects.

     Fed nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws after fight over her climate change stance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Bloom Raskin had drawn criticism from Senate Republicans for arguing that bank regulators should pay more attention to the financial risks posed by climate change.
Biden complained that Raskin had been the target of "baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups."
Raskin's withdrawal clears the way for Senate action on four other Fed nominations, including a second term as Fed chairman for Jerome Powell.
Those nominations had been stalled, as Republicans boycotted a vote on Raskin in the Senate Banking committee.
Raskin previously served on the Fed board of governors and in a top post at the Treasury Department.

“This is not a novel or radical position,” Bloom Raskin says in her letter.
“The Department of Defense has been systematically analyzing the energy security risks of climate change for years, developing mitigation strategies to confront them.
Chairman Powell has recognized climate change as a significant risk that needs to be incorporated into the supervisory process.
