     Biden Withdraws Nomination for Fed’s Top Bank Cop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden withdrew his nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as the Federal Reserve’s top bank regulator on Tuesday, after a Democratic senator said he would join Republicans in voting against her.
Ms. Raskin had earlier sent a letter to the White House on Tuesday asking to withdraw her name from consideration for the job, according to two people familiar with the decision.
The New Yorker earlier reported the existence of the letter.
“Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups,” Mr. Biden said in a statement released on Tuesday afternoon.
Republicans had been stonewalling Ms. Raskin’s nomination, and in the process they were holding up the White House’s four other Fed picks, including the renomination of Mr. Powell for Fed chair.

     Biden nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws her candidacy for Federal Reserve board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's embattled nominee to the Federal Reserve, on Tuesday withdrew her candidacy to serve at the central bank, ending a weekslong partisan battle in the Senate over her views on climate policy.
Manchin's decision would have made her confirmation nearly impossible in a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.
Biden in a statement praised Raskin while blasting her opponents.
"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people," the president said.
Raskin, who previously served as a Fed governor and deputy Treasury secretary, echoed that statement in a letter to Biden, in which she blamed "relentless attacks by special interests" in derailing her nomination.

     Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws herself from consideration to the Federal Reserve Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Sarah Bloom Raskin has withdrawn from consideration to be a nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
Raskin submitted her withdrawal in a letter to President Joe Biden.
Biden nominated Raskin in January for the position of vice chair of supervision at the Fed, a role that would have made her a powerful regulator in the banking world.
But Raskin, a former Fed governor who was deputy Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, faced stiff opposition in the Senate based on her stance on climate change and fear that she could discourage banks from lending to fossil fuel companies.
In her letter to Biden withdrawing her nomination, which was shared with CNN, she wrote that many "in and outside the Senate are unwilling to acknowledge the economic complications of climate change and the toll it has placed, and will continue to place, on Americans. "

     Sarah Bloom Raskin Withdraws as Biden’s Pick for Top Fed Banking Regulator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON—Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s nominee to become the government’s most powerful banking regulator, withdrew from consideration on Tuesday, the White House said, amid opposition to her nomination from Republicans and a key Democrat.
The withdrawal is a major blow for the Biden administration, which has struggled to advance its financial nominees through the evenly divided Senate.
It came a day after Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a key Democratic vote in the evenly divided chamber, said Monday that he couldn’t support Ms. Raskin’s nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.

     Summary: Bloom Raskin, who is a law professor at Duke University, is not a new or untested figure on the national economic stage.
“This is not a novel or radical position,” Bloom Raskin says in her letter.
“The Department of Defense has been systematically analyzing the energy security risks of climate change for years, developing mitigation strategies to confront them.
Chairman Powell has recognized climate change as a significant risk that needs to be incorporated into the supervisory process.
(The allegations against Bloom Raskin, who has denied any improper behavior, dissolved under closer examination.)

     Summary: The White House and Senate Democrats had stood by Raskin’s confirmation and vowed to lock in bipartisan support.
"We are entering an era of financial economic war, inflation, and climate transition,” Raskin wrote to Biden.
Senate Democrats expressed frustration that Republicans held up the confirmation process, instead of voting against Raskin during the committee hearing.
Biden’s nominees for two other seats on the Fed board — economists Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson — also have yet to be confirmed.
They were also hoping the Fed will move toward encouraging banks to reduce their exposures to climate risks.
