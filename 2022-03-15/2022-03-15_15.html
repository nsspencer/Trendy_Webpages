     Summary: Check out some of the best plays from Kris Bryant's 2021 campaign with both the Cubs and the Giants.
(1:33)Third baseman Kris Bryant and the Colorado Rockies are in agreement on a seven-year, $182 million contract, sources confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday.
He got off to a hot start with the Cubs but cooled off some after the trade, slashing .265/.353/.481 between the two teams.
Bryant also is an obvious candidate to join Charlie Blackmon among the Rockies' designated hitters.
Eventually, he was traded to the Giants for prospects as his seven-year career in Chicago came to an end.

     Rockies To Sign Kris Bryant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rockies have made the free agent splash theyâ€™d been seeking, reportedly agreeing to terms on a seven-year, $182MM deal with Kris Bryant.

Bryant hit .262/.344/.444 in 212 plate appearances in black and orange.
