     Marcus Williams Provides Immediate Upgrade to Ravens Secondary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — The Ravens were looking to boost their secondary and they found themselves a huge playmaker in free agency with Marcus Williams.
Baltimore inked the free safety to a five-year, $70 million deal, according to multiple reports.
Both of those players suffered season-ending injuries last year, but they are expected to return healthy.
Williams will be paired with strong safety Chuck Clark, who is one of the team's top playmakers.
Last year for the New Orleans Saints, Williams had a career-high 74 tackles with two interceptions and eight passes defensed.

     Ravens make a big splash, signing Saints safety Marcus Williams to five-year, $70M deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens made their first move of 2022 free agency on Tuesday, and it was a big one, agreeing to terms with star Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
After playing under the franchise tag in 2021, Williams will make an average of $14M per year, putting him among the eight highest-paid safeties in the NFL.
He'll join a big-name secondary in Baltimore, which welcomed Mike Macdonald as its new defensive coordinator this offseason, accompanying Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and Chuck Clark in the starting lineup.
Williams emerged as a rookie starter in 2017, logging four interceptions for the Saints defense.
After playing alongside Malcolm Jenkins at the back end of New Orleans' secondary in 2020, he would've been the consensus top safety to hit free agency before the Saints used the tag.

     Sources -- Baltimore Ravens add safety Marcus Williams and offensive tackle Morgan Moses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- After a quiet first day of free agency, the Baltimore Ravens reached agreements with safety Marcus Williams and offensive tackle Morgan Moses on Tuesday, according to sources.
The Ravens found their ball-hawking safety in Williams and an answer at right tackle in Moses.
After signing a one-year, $3.6 million contract last June, Moses was placed into a competition with George Fant at right tackle.
In Week 1, the Jets moved Fant to left tackle when Mekhi Becton went down because of a knee injury, opening a spot at right tackle for Moses.
The Ravens had four linemen play at least 60 snaps at right tackle in 2021.

     Saints project to receive mid-round comp pick in 2023 for Marcus Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, for example, if the Saints sign pending free agent safety Tyrann Mathieu to a contract averaging $14 million per year then they wouldn’t qualify for a compensatory pick next year.
But which round could fans expect a comp pick for Williams to slot in at?
A fourth rounder feels most likely (the highest compensatory pick allowed is a third rounder), given recent history.
The Saints are expected to receive a compensatory fourth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft after losing defensive end Trey Hendrickson last offseason.
If they add more qualifying players than they lose, regardless of their contract value, they won’t earn any comp picks at all.

     Ravens To Sign Marcus Williams
    </h2>

     Summary: The Ravens have agreed to terms with Marcus Williams.
The standout safety will leave New Orleans and head to Baltimore on a whopping five-year, $70MM deal (Twitter link via ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler).
Williams, 26 in September, played on the tag last season after attempts to reach a long-term agreement came up short.
With incumbent DeShon Elliott a pending free agent, it is not surprising the Ravens have made the investment in Williams.
With Williams in place, the Ravens’ secondary still includes All Pro corners in Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Peters.
