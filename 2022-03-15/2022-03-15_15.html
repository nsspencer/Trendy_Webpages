     Marcus Williams Provides Immediate Upgrade to Ravens Secondary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — The Ravens were looking to boost their secondary and they found themselves a huge playmaker in free agency with Marcus Williams.
Baltimore inked the free safety to a five-year, $70 million deal, according to multiple reports.
Both of those players suffered season-ending injuries last year, but they are expected to return healthy.
Williams will be paired with strong safety Chuck Clark, who is one of the team's top playmakers.
Last year for the New Orleans Saints, Williams had a career-high 74 tackles with two interceptions and eight passes defensed.

     Former Saints safety Marcus Williams signing with Ravens on five-year, $70M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens agreed to terms with former Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported.
The deal includes $37 million guaranteed, Pelissero reported.
Williams is one of the top safeties in the NFL and a rangy playmaker that immediately upgrades Baltimore's secondary.
A second-round pick by New Orleans in 2017, Williams has generated 312 tackles, 15 interceptions, 38 passes defended and three forced fumbles.
He's one of six players with two-plus interceptions in each of the past five seasons.

     Ravens make a big splash, signing Saints safety Marcus Williams to five-year, $70M deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens made their first move of 2022 free agency on Tuesday, and it was a big one, agreeing to terms with star Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
After playing under the franchise tag in 2021, Williams will make an average of $14M per year, putting him among the eight highest-paid safeties in the NFL.
He'll join a big-name secondary in Baltimore, which welcomed Mike Macdonald as its new defensive coordinator this offseason, accompanying Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and Chuck Clark in the starting lineup.
Williams emerged as a rookie starter in 2017, logging four interceptions for the Saints defense.
After playing alongside Malcolm Jenkins at the back end of New Orleans' secondary in 2020, he would've been the consensus top safety to hit free agency before the Saints used the tag.

     Saints project to receive mid-round comp pick in 2023 for Marcus Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, for example, if the Saints sign pending free agent safety Tyrann Mathieu to a contract averaging $14 million per year then they wouldn’t qualify for a compensatory pick next year.
But which round could fans expect a comp pick for Williams to slot in at?
A fourth rounder feels most likely (the highest compensatory pick allowed is a third rounder), given recent history.
The Saints are expected to receive a compensatory fourth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft after losing defensive end Trey Hendrickson last offseason.
If they add more qualifying players than they lose, regardless of their contract value, they won’t earn any comp picks at all.

     Sources -- Baltimore Ravens add safety Marcus Williams and offensive tackle Morgan Moses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- After a quiet first day of free agency, the Baltimore Ravens reached agreements with safety Marcus Williams and offensive tackle Morgan Moses on Tuesday, according to sources.
The Ravens found their ball-hawking safety in Williams and an answer at right tackle in Moses.
After signing a one-year, $3.6 million contract last June, Moses was placed into a competition with George Fant at right tackle.
In Week 1, the Jets moved Fant to left tackle when Mekhi Becton went down because of a knee injury, opening a spot at right tackle for Moses.
The Ravens had four linemen play at least 60 snaps at right tackle in 2021.

     Marcus Williams has reportedly left the Saints, agreeing to a $70M contract with the Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williams contract with Baltimore — which he cannot officially sign until after the start of the new league year Wednesday — includes $37 million in guaranteed money.
Earlier this month, the Saints declined to use the franchise tag on Williams for a second consecutive year, a move that would have cost the Saints approximately $12.7 million against this year's salary cap.

It was only the third time in franchise history the Saints had used a franchise tag on a player, with Williams joining Drew Brees (2012) and Jimmy Graham (2014).
Williams, who in the last two seasons has filled in when Williams has missed time to injury, is also an unrestricted free agent.
