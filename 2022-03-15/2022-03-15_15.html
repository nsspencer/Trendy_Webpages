     Summary: Check out some of the best plays from Kris Bryant's 2021 campaign with both the Cubs and the Giants.
(1:33)Third baseman Kris Bryant and the Colorado Rockies are in agreement on a seven-year, $182 million contract, sources confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday.
He got off to a hot start with the Cubs but cooled off some after the trade, slashing .265/.353/.481 between the two teams.
Bryant also is an obvious candidate to join Charlie Blackmon among the Rockies' designated hitters.
Eventually, he was traded to the Giants for prospects as his seven-year career in Chicago came to an end.

     Summary: (Stephen Hopson/Icon Sportswire)Hours after the Phillies reportedly reached an agreement with Kyle Schwarber, his former Chicago Cubs teammate Kris Bryant has a new home.
According to Jon Heyman of Audacy Sports, Bryant is signing a seven-year/$182 million deal to join the Colorado Rockies.
On Audacy Sports, I predicted that Bryant would land a six-year/$140 million deal.

     Rockies To Sign Kris Bryant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rockies have made the free agent splash they’d been seeking, reportedly agreeing to terms on a seven-year, $182MM deal with Kris Bryant.
Bryant seemed on the path towards a free agent megadeal, but his production plummeted in 2020.
Bryant hit .262/.344/.444 in 212 plate appearances in black and orange.
MLBTR ranked Bryant as the winter’s #4 free agent in November, projecting him to receive a six-year, $160MM guarantee.
Jon Heyman of the MLB Network first reported Bryant was signing with the Rockies and the financial terms.
