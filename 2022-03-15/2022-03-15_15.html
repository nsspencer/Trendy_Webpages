     Report: Detroit Lions signing DJ Chark to 1-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It didn’t take long for the Detroit Lions to get the receiver they’ve been looking for.
According to a report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Lions have agreed to terms with former Jaguars receiver DJ Chark on a one-year deal.
The deal is worth $10 million fully guaranteed per Ian Rapoport with the potential of maxing out at $12 million.
Given that this is just a one-year deal for Chark, this shouldn’t alter Detroit’s plans for adding a receiver in the draft.

Detroit has reached a contract agreement with former Jacksonville Jaguars wideout D.J.
In four NFL seasons, Chark Jr. has amassed 147 receptions for 2,042 yards and 15 touchdowns.
He also acknowledged adding a talented wideout to the roster capable of winning one-on-one matchups regularly would provide a boost to several areas of the offense.

     Summary: Former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark Jr. intends to sign a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The deal is expected to be worth up to $13 million, according to the source.

Harris had 7.5 sacks with the Lions last season, his first with the franchise.
One AFC executive told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Chark has what it takes to be great, but his fitness and nuanced route running aren't where they could be.

     Lions agree to deal with former Jaguars WR DJ Chark, re-sign DE Charles Harris: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lions have agreed to a deal with former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark, a league source told The Athletic on Tuesday.
Detroit also retained one of its own Tuesday by re-signing defensive end Charles Harris to a two-year deal worth a maximum of $14 million, according to a source.
Chark, a 2018 second-round draft pick by the Jaguars, has played all four seasons with Jacksonville.
He caught seven passes for 154 yards and two touchdowns last season before a fractured ankle ended his campaign in Week 4.
Harris, the Dolphins' 2017 first-round pick, is coming off his best NFL season.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>

     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout D.J.
Chark to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
On the other side of the ball, Detroit is slated to re-sign pass rusher ﻿Charles Harris﻿ to a two-year, $14 million deal, Rapoport added.
