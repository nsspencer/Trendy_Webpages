     Bob Saget’s fractures possibly caused by fall on carpeted floor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Fractures around Bob Saget’s eye sockets and bleeding around his brain were possibly caused by the comedian hitting “something hard, covered by something soft,” such as a carpeted floor, according to a report released Tuesday that provides more details of the TV’s star’s death.
Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay.
There were no signs of blood on the hotel bed’s sheets or bedspread, according to the report released Tuesday.
An initial examination of Saget’s body in the hotel suite showed that he had slight swelling and small bruises in the corner of his left eye.
A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget’s suite since it had been latched from inside.

     Judge makes ban on Bob Saget autopsy records release permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge in Florida on Tuesday agreed to make a permanent order that prohibits the release of photos, video or other records related to the investigation into the death of comedian Bob Saget.
The family members had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the release of any records from the local medical examiner’s office and the Orange County Sheriff’s Office involving the investigation into Saget’s death.
Saget, 65, was found dead January 9 in a room at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando.
During the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner’s office and sheriff’s office created graphic videos and photos of Saget’s body, as well as audio recordings.
Such records are prohibited by state law from being released publicly, but some media outlets had already filed requests for them, according to the family’s lawsuit.

     Some photos, records of 'Full House' star Bob Saget's death won't be made public, Florida judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video footage and audio recordings taken inside the Orlando hotel room where Saget died also will remain private.
However, 57 photos depicting the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes hotel or Saget's room without items can be released to the public.
So can body camera footage filmed outside Saget's room and a redacted investigative report.
Publishing these records would cause "irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish and emotional distress" for Saget's family, the lawsuit read.
The Saget family had argued that records from the death investigation and autopsy are exempt from public disclosure under Florida law.
