     Nets Fined $50,000 for Letting Kyrie Irving Into Their Locker Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: fined the Nets $50,000 for allowing guard Kyrie Irving to enter the team’s locker room during Sunday’s game against the Knicks even though Irving had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus and thus was not allowed to be with the team at Barclays Center.
Irving had attended the game as a spectator, with a seat in the front row.
Under New York City law, Irving cannot play in games at Barclays Center because of a vaccine mandate for New York City-based workers who perform in-person work.
During a public appearance on Sunday, Adams responded to a heckler who urged him to let Irving play: “Listen, you’re right.
Kyrie can play tomorrow: Get vaccinated.”Nets forward Kevin Durant called the rule “ridiculous” after the game against the Knicks on Sunday.

     Kyrie Irving: NBA fines Brooklyn Nets $50,000 for allowing player to enter team locker room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The NBA has fined the Brooklyn Nets organization $50,000 for allowing Kyrie Irving into the team's locker room on Sunday.
Irving, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, is unable to play in the team's home games due to New York City's workplace vaccine mandate but is allowed to attend home games as a spectator.
Irving was in attendance courtside for the team's 110-107 victory over the New York Knicks at Barclays Center in New York, and the NBA says the Nets were fined for "violating local New York City law and league health and safety protocols."
According the ESPN's Malika Andrews, Irving purchased the courtside seats.
In a statement released on Monday, Nets star forward Kevin Durant expressed his appreciation for New York Mayor Eric Adams' efforts after critiquing him and the city's vaccination mandate on Sunday.
