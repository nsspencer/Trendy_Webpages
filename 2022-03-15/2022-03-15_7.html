     Jaguars Releasing LB Myles Jack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Adam Schefter, the Jaguars are releasing LB Myles Jack on Tuesday.
Jack was the team’s leading tackler last season but Jacksonville spent big yesterday on another linebacker, Foyesade Oluokun.
Releasing Jack saves a decent chunk of cap space for the team as they look to go in a different direction.
According to Over The Cap, it frees up $8.35 million in cap space and leaves behind $4.8 million in dead money.
In 2021, Jack appeared in 15 games and recorded 108 total tackles, three tackles for loss and no sacks or interceptions.

     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars will be releasing linebacker Myles Jack, according to a report by Adam Schefter of ESPN.
After Monday’s spending spree, the Jaguars are releasing LB Myles Jack, per source.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 15, 2022The move to release Jack comes as a bit of a surprise, however given that the new regime is seemingly completely changing the look of the Jaguars roster.
The release of Jack saves the Jaguars just over $8 million in cap space, so it’s very possible the Jaguars aren’t totally done in spending money in free agency.
The team did sign linebacker Foye Oloukon on Monday, who is a similar style of linebacker as Jack and there was some talk it could possibly point to the end of the Myles Jack era.

     Jaguars releasing Myles Jack: Linebacker on open market after leading team in tackles last season, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars went on a spending spree on the first day of legal tampering, handing out six big contracts.
On Tuesday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the Jaguars are releasing linebacker Myles Jack.
Jack is just 26 years old and led the Jaguars with 108 combined tackles last season.
He's an athletic backer who has 82 starts to his name, and should immediately draw interest on the open market.
It's possible Jack won't be the only Jaguars starter who could be playing for a new team in 2022.

     Bears should target LB Myles Jack in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL free agency is underway, and the Chicago Bears have made just one move through the first day of the legal tampering period.
They’re expected to sign defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi, but there are other needs they need to address, including linebacker.
The Jacksonville Jaguars released linebacker Myles Jack, who’s expected to garner plenty of interest on the free agent market.
There are several intriguing options on the free agent market outside of Jack, including Bobby Wagner, Anthony Walker Jr. and Anthony Hitchens.
