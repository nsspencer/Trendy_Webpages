     Fake heiress Anna Sorokin still in U.S., attorney says after saying she was likely deported
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that Sorokin, a German citizen, was still in custody and declined further comment.
Asked Tuesday about Arora’s comments, another lawyer for Sorokin, Audrey Thomas, said: “Presumptions are wrong.”"We’re doing our best," she said.
The confusion comes after Sorokin, 31, who falsely claimed to be a German heiress worth $60 million, served roughly four years in prison for swindling hundreds of thousands of dollars from friends, banks and hotels.
Last March, six weeks after Sorokin's release from prison, immigration authorities took her into custody for overstaying her visa.
A deportation order for Sorokin was signed on Feb. 17, giving her lawyers 30 days to file an appeal, Arora said Monday.

     Summary: (CNN) Anna Sorokin, the fake German heiress Netflix's "Inventing Anna" is based on, remains in Immigration and Enforcement custody, a spokesman for the agency said Tuesday.

     Fake heiress Anna Sorokin makes new bid to fight deportation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Anna Sorokin, the convicted swindler who claimed to be a German heiress to finance a posh lifestyle in New York, is making a new bid to fight deportation, a lawyer said Tuesday.
Sorokin, whose scheme inspired the recent Netflix series “Inventing Anna,” was taken into U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement custodynearly a year ago.
Sorokin, who was convicted in 2019and spent more than three years behind bars, has since been challenging deportation.
An appellate immigration judge last month declined to stop the 31-year-old German citizen from being removed.
Using the name Anna Delvey, Sorokin maneuvered her way into elite New York social circles by passing herself off as a socialite with a $67 million (61 million euros) fortune overseas, according to prosecutors.

     ‘Inventing Anna’ Fake Heiress Anna Sorokin Facing Imminent Deportation – Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anna Sorokin, the convicted swindler whose criminal adventures formed the basis of the hit Netflix 2022 series Inventing Anna, will soon be deported to Germany – if she hasn’t already been sent packing.
Manny Arora, her attorney in the criminal appeal, told GMA this morning that he hadn’t heard from her yesterday, which was unusual.
Sorokin had been fighting deportation for a year, having completed her prison stint for the crimes depicted in the Shonda Rhimes-created series in February 2021.
Last month, Sorokin confirmed that she was working with Surviving R. Kelly producer Bunim/Murray Productions on a new limited documentary series that would chronicle her life following the events portrayed in Inventing Anna.
Last month, it was revealed that Sorokin received about $320,000 from Netflix for the story that eventually became Inventing Anna.
