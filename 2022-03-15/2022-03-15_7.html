     Ravens make a big splash, signing Saints safety Marcus Williams to five-year, $70M deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens made their first move of 2022 free agency on Tuesday, and it was a big one, agreeing to terms with star Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
After playing under the franchise tag in 2021, Williams will make an average of $14M per year, putting him among the eight highest-paid safeties in the NFL.
He'll join a big-name secondary in Baltimore, which welcomed Mike Macdonald as its new defensive coordinator this offseason, accompanying Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and Chuck Clark in the starting lineup.
Williams emerged as a rookie starter in 2017, logging four interceptions for the Saints defense.
After playing alongside Malcolm Jenkins at the back end of New Orleans' secondary in 2020, he would've been the consensus top safety to hit free agency before the Saints used the tag.

     Ravens To Sign Marcus Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens have agreed to terms with Marcus Williams.
The standout safety will leave New Orleans and head to Baltimore on a whopping five-year, $70MM deal (Twitter link via ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler).
Williams, 26 in September, played on the tag last season after attempts to reach a long-term agreement came up short.
With incumbent DeShon Elliott a pending free agent, it is not surprising the Ravens have made the investment in Williams.
With Williams in place, the Ravens’ secondary still includes All Pro corners in Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Peters.

     Summary: Williams contract with Baltimore — which he cannot officially sign until after the start of the new league year Wednesday — includes $37 million in guaranteed money.

It was only the third time in franchise history the Saints had used a franchise tag on a player, with Williams joining Drew Brees (2012) and Jimmy Graham (2014).
Williams, who in the last two seasons has filled in when Williams has missed time to injury, is also an unrestricted free agent.

     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens have signed safety Marcus Williams to a five-year, $70 million deal.
Now, they’ve landed a top-flight free safety to improve last season’s No.
— Kyle BarberFree safety was a pressing need for the Ravens this offseason and by signing Marcus Williams, they land the best available player at the position.
Williams is an elite coverage player and instantly changes the complexion of the Ravens’ defense.
Compared to Tyrann Mathieu, the other top free agent safety who many fans wanted, Williams is a better true free safety, better fit for the Ravens, and several years younger.
