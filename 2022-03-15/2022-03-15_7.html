     Sandra Bullock to take a break from acting to focus on her family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speaking with ET, Bullock revealed that she’s going to take a break from acting so she can be “in the place that makes me happiest”—which is, evidently, not the famously warm-hearted and comforting world of movie-making.
AdvertisementBullock says she takes acting very seriously when she’s at work, so much so that it’s a “24/7 job,” but at this point in her life she just wants to “be 24/7” with her family.
“That’s where I’m gonna be for a while,” she says, taking up her time “servicing their every need” and managing “their social calendar” instead of being in movies.
(ET notes that Bullock’s kids are 12 and 10.)
Write this stuff down, Sandra!

     Summary: Sandra Bullock is sharing all the hilarious details of the awkward encounter she had with Channing Tatum in their new film.
During an interview on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" this week, the talk show host asked the actor if Tatum was actually naked during the scene.
"In the movie, he drops trou completely, and I think, ‘Oh, they’re handling that in a tasteful way' — until they don’t.
Kimberley French / ParamountAfter Bullock's character checks Tatum's back for leeches, his character turns around, and she comes face to face with him.
Full on face to face with the landscape that I needed to (investigate)," she said.

     Sandra Bullock Sacrificed Her Feet to Make The Lost City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The real breakout of the new adventure-comedy The Lost City is neither Sandra Bullock nor one of her handsome costars, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe, and Brad Pitt.
It’s the fuchsia sequin jumpsuit Bullock wears throughout much of the movie while trekking through the jungle in search of hidden treasure.
“The jumpsuit, she’s literally become the lead character of the film,” said Bullock at The Lost City’s New York screening on Monday evening.
The film was written by “Weird Al” Yankovic and Eric Appel, who also directed the feature.
“The Weird Al project is one of the most fun things I have ever been involved with,” said Radcliffe.
