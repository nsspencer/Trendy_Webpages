    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Kamala Khan's Ms. Marvel, a beloved recent addition to the superhero comic canon, is joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) this summer.

     Ms. Marvel Trailer Introduces Marvel’s First Muslim Hero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On March 15, the studio released the first trailer for Ms. Marvel, a new TV series that introduces the extended universe’s first Muslim superhero.
Ms. Marvel centers on Kamala Khan, a relatively recent addition to the Marvel canon, as she was introduced in 2013.
She takes up the name Ms. Marvel, which had previously been used by other characters, including Carol Danvers (who Brie Larsen plays in Captain Marvel).
Given the Marvel universe’s love of high-profile cameos, it’s quite likely we’ll see some of the established stars make appearances in Ms. Marvel.
She hasn’t done much press about the series yet, but in an August 2021 interview with Variety, she spoke about the potential impact Ms. Marvel could have on viewers.
