     Ravens Signing S Marcus Williams To Five-Year, $70M Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeremy Fowler of ESPN reports that the Ravens are signing S Marcus Williams to a five-year, $70 million contract.
Williams was the top safety in this year’s free agent market and one of the best remaining players on the board.
He played out the final year of his four-year, $6.2 million contract with New Orleans before the Saints used the franchise tag on him last year.
Williams made $10.612 million fully guaranteed for the 2021 season and was once again testing the open market as an unrestricted free agent this offseason.
In 2021, Williams appeared in 16 games for the Saints and recorded 74 tackles, two interceptions, a forced fumble, and eight pass deflections.

     Ravens To Sign Marcus Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens have agreed to terms with Marcus Williams.
The standout safety will leave New Orleans and head to Baltimore on a whopping five-year, $70MM deal (Twitter link via ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler).
Williams, 26 in September, played on the tag last season after attempts to reach a long-term agreement came up short.
With incumbent DeShon Elliott a pending free agent, it is not surprising the Ravens have made the investment in Williams.
With Williams in place, the Ravens’ secondary still includes All Pro corners in Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Peters.

     Ravens make a big splash, signing Saints safety Marcus Williams to five-year, $70M deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens made their first move of 2022 free agency on Tuesday, and it was a big one, agreeing to terms with star Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
After playing under the franchise tag in 2021, Williams will make an average of $14M per year, putting him among the eight highest-paid safeties in the NFL.
He'll join a big-name secondary in Baltimore, which welcomed Mike Macdonald as its new defensive coordinator this offseason, accompanying Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and Chuck Clark in the starting lineup.
Williams emerged as a rookie starter in 2017, logging four interceptions for the Saints defense.
After playing alongside Malcolm Jenkins at the back end of New Orleans' secondary in 2020, he would've been the consensus top safety to hit free agency before the Saints used the tag.

     Summary: The Ravens agreed to terms with former Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported.
The deal includes $37 million guaranteed, Pelissero reported.
Williams is one of the top safeties in the NFL and a rangy playmaker that immediately upgrades Baltimore's secondary.
A second-round pick by New Orleans in 2017, Williams has generated 312 tackles, 15 interceptions, 38 passes defended and three forced fumbles.
He's one of six players with two-plus interceptions in each of the past five seasons.

     Report: Jets interested in Marcus Williams, but not at his current price
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Remain interested in S Marcus Williams, but asking price still too high for teams.
There’s a greater precedent for free safety contracts in the $14 million range, so that’s quite a gulf to travel.
That sort of nuance typically doesn’t translate to contract negotiations, leading Williams to seek major compensation in a deal.
And from Cimini’s report, it doesn’t sound like teams are interested in paying what he’s seeking, though he is still projected to rank high among his peers in the end.
It’s also possible, maybe even likely, that Williams is waiting to see whether the Saints pull off a landmark trade for Deshaun Watson.

Now, they’ve landed a top-flight free safety to improve last season’s No.
— Kyle BarberFree safety was a pressing need for the Ravens this offseason and by signing Marcus Williams, they land the best available player at the position.
Williams is an elite coverage player and instantly changes the complexion of the Ravens’ defense.
Compared to Tyrann Mathieu, the other top free agent safety who many fans wanted, Williams is a better true free safety, better fit for the Ravens, and several years younger.
