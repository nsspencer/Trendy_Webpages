     Man Hit Woman in the Head 125 Times Because She Was Asian, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The force of the blow knocks the woman to the ground.
As she lies there, her attacker bends down and pummels her repeatedly with both hands for the next minute, more than 125 blows altogether.
He then stomps on her seven times and spits on her before walking away.
The sickening assault, captured by a security camera, came after the woman, who is of Asian descent, passed the man on her way into the building, officials said.
Moments later, he attacked her in what officials said was violence driven by anti-Asian bias, yet another incident in a nationwide surge.
