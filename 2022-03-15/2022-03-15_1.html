     A Groggy Senate Approves Making Daylight Saving Time Permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — After losing an hour of sleep over the weekend, members of the United States Senate returned to the Capitol this week a bit groggy and in a mood to put an end to all this frustrating clock-changing.
So on Tuesday, with almost no warning and no debate, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to do away with the biannual springing forward and falling back that most Americans have come to despise, in favor of making daylight saving time permanent.
The bill’s fate in the House was not immediately clear, but if the legislation were to pass there and be signed by President Biden, it would take effect in November 2023.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rose on the Senate floor on Tuesday to speak in favor of his bill, called the Sunshine Protection Act, which would end the practice of turning clocks back one hour to standard time every November, making daylight saving time, which currently begins in March, last throughout the year.
“One has to ask themselves after a while: Why do we keep doing it?” Mr. Rubio said, adding, “The majority of the American people’s preference is just to stop the back-and-forth changing.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The clock may be running out on daylight saving time — but what does that mean?
The US Senate on Tuesday voted unanimously to rescind the twice-a-year shift in our clocks, a controversial measure designed to maximize sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere.
Here’s a look at daylight savings time and how it could affect you if the House and President Joe Biden agree to scrap it.
If the Sunshine Protection Act is passed, Americans will no longer adjust the hour forward or backward.

     Summary: Southern Wisconsin would see more than two-and-half months of sunrises that don’t come until 8:00 a.m. or later.
The sun would not rise again in the seven o’clock hour for another 80 days on February 11.
Daylight saving time resumed on Sunday as many Americans set their clocks one hour ahead.
According to an Associated Press poll, most Americans want to stop switching between daylight saving and standard time, but are divided on which should be used all year.
Members of Congress have long been interested in the potential benefits and costs of daylight saving time since it was first adopted as a wartime measure in 1942.

     U.S. Senate approves bill to make daylight saving time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoWASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.
On Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour.
Pallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.
Daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918.
The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

     Should daylight saving time be year-round? Iowa Lawmakers are considering it.

     Summary: Iowa lawmakers think they have a solution: observe daylight saving time all year long.
Lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish daylight saving time as the official time in the state year-round.
It would only take effect if the federal government passes legislation allowing states to shift to year-round daylight saving time.
Leslie Carpenter, a lobbyist with Iowa Mental Health Advocacy, spoke in favor of the bill at the Iowa Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday.
18 states already passed daylight saving lawEighteen states had passed their own laws that will make daylight saving time permanent if the federal government ever allows the change, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Congress had voted on December 14, 1973, to put the US on daylight saving time for two years.
The US had gone to permanent daylight saving time before, during World War II.
His idea even got traction in Congress, via a bill from US Representative Patsy Mink of Hawaii.
Energy savings, a House panel noted, “must be balanced against a majority of the public’s distaste for the observance of Daylight Saving Time.”Don’t Miss Another Big Story—Get Our Weekend Newsletter Our most popular stories of the week, sent every Saturday.

     Summary: It’s happened: On Tuesday, the US Senate voted unanimously to make daylight saving time permanent beginning in 2023.
Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I and became a national standard in the 1960s.
Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.
Daylight saving time — and yes, it’s “saving time” and not “savings time”— begins in the spring, just as the increase in daylight hours starts to be noticeably longer.
There was a year in the 1970s when daylight saving time lasted for 16 months, and not everyone was pleased.
