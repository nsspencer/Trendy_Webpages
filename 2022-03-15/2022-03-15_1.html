     Google Doodle Celebrates French Artist Rosa Bonheur's 200th Birthday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GoogleTwo centuries ago, the educational opportunities available to women in the art world were limited.
But art seemed to be in Rosa Bonheur's blood.
Born into a family of painters, the French artist was sketching with pencil and paper before she could talk.
To honor Bonheur's contribution to the art world and a career that inspired generations of female artists to come, Google dedicated its Doodle on Wednesday to the artist on her 200th birthday.
After a failed apprenticeship as a seamstress at the age of 12, Bonheur's father began instructing her in art and painting.
