     Summary: Marisa Tomei is looking back at her career!
The 57-year-old actress made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday (March 14), where she discussed the 30th anniversary of My Cousin Vinny and tried out a sandwich that had been inspired by her.
“I was just happy to have a job.”Jimmy then mentioned that Vice President Kamala Harris had said that My Cousin Vinny was her favorite movie and that he’d heard some people include it in their curriculum in law school.
“There’s a sandwich named after you,” Jimmy said, explaining that she had inspired a sandwich at “the world-famous Lioni’s deli in Brooklyn.”The pair then tried out the dish and you can see Marisa‘s reaction down below!
In case you missed it, the actress recently clarified some comments she made about not getting paid for one of her movies.
