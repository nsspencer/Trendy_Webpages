     Nets' Kyrie Irving rides insane first half vs. Magic to 60-point game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns scored an NBA-season-high 60 points against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.
And Towns' total was matched one night later.
Nets guard Kyrie Irving put up 60 points in a mesmerizing performance during Brooklyn's 150-108 rout of the Magic in Orlando on Tuesday.
In 34:56 of game action, Irving tallied 60 points, six rebounds, four assists, four steals and one block on 20-for-31 shooting overall, 8-for-12 from 3-point range and 12-for-13 from the free throw line.
This performance came exactly one week after Irving went off for 50 against the Charlotte Hornets, too.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving leads the way for the Nets with 41 points vs. the Magic in the first half.
The 29-year-old Brooklyn Nets guard dropped 60 points en route to his team's 150-108 win over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.
He scored 41 in the first half alone -- the most anyone has scored in a single half since Devin Booker's 51 in 2017.
He now holds the Nets' franchise record for points in a single game.
Combined with Towns' 60-point performance Monday, it's the first time players have scored 60 points on consecutive days since 1962, when Wilt Chamberlain did it all by himself in back-to-back games.

     Summary: One night after Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns set this season's single-game scoring high with 60 points against the Spurs, Kyrie Irving matched him with his own 60 piece in Brooklyn's 150-108 victory over the Magic on Tuesday.
Just like Towns, Irving only needed 31 shots for his 60 points.
The 60 points is a Brooklyn Nets franchise record, breaking Deron Williams' previous mark of 57.
Over the past two weeks alone, there have been six games of at least 50 points: Irving (50, 60), LeBron James (50, 56) Jayson Tatum (54) and Kevin Durant (53).
Irving scored 41 of his 60 in the first half, the highest single-half output in the league this season.

Irving exploded for 60 points on Tuesday to lead the Nets to a 150-108 victory over the Orlando Magic at Amway Center.
Durant also noted that Irving doesn’t deserve the criticisms he’s getting for his vaccination status.
Kevin Durant shares a bit about the talks he's had with Kyrie Irving on vaccines: -Doesn't think it's his own responsibility to push the issue with Irving.
So far Kyrie can attend in home games as a spectator but not play because of the COVID-19 vaccine rules in private organizations.

     Nets Fined $50,000 for Letting Kyrie Irving Into Their Locker Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: fined the Nets $50,000 for allowing guard Kyrie Irving to enter the team’s locker room during Sunday’s game against the Knicks even though Irving had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus and thus was not allowed to be with the team at Barclays Center.
Irving had attended the game as a spectator, with a seat in the front row.
Under New York City law, Irving cannot play in games at Barclays Center because of a vaccine mandate for New York City-based workers who perform in-person work.
During a public appearance on Sunday, Adams responded to a heckler who urged him to let Irving play: “Listen, you’re right.
Kyrie can play tomorrow: Get vaccinated.”Nets forward Kevin Durant called the rule “ridiculous” after the game against the Knicks on Sunday.

     NBA scoring onslaught continues as Kyrie Irving erupts for Nets-record 60 points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time in two nights, one of the NBA’s 30 single-game team scoring records has fallen.
Averaging nearly two points per attempt, Irving shot 20-for-31 from the floor, including 8-for-12 on 3-pointers, and was nearly perfect at the foul line (12-for-13).
The stage for Irving’s record night was set in the first half, when Kyrie scored a staggering 41 points — the same total as Wilt Chamberlain during his record 100-point night in 1962.
Additionally, his 41 points in the first half are the most in any half of an NBA game since Devin Booker scored 51 in his 70-point game in 2017.
The back-to-back 50-point outings from Durant and Irving also marked their sixth 50-point outing in only two active seasons together: four for Irving and two for Durant.
