    </h2>

     Summary: At the eleventh hour, Randy Gregory opted to take his talents to the Mile High City.
After an agreement to remain with the Dallas Cowboys "fell apart," multiple media reports confirmed the Denver Broncos have signed the free-agent pass-rusher to a five-year, $70 million contract that includes $28 million guaranteed.
"When people put our tape on, I want them to see a defense that’s playing fast, that’s playing aggressive, that’s playing physical, and we’re flying around to the ball," Evero said amid his Feb. 22 introductory press conference.

     Randy Gregory Changes Course, Opts For Denver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of the more eventful turns in recent Cowboys free agency memory, Randy Gregory is off to Denver, shortly after reportedly agreeing to an extension with the Cowboys.
"No doubt what Jerry has done for him the last seven years played a huge part," Schaffer told The Dallas Morning News.
It's quite a change of course for the Cowboys, who drafted Gregory No.
At times, it looked dubious whether Gregory would ever make it to this foray into free agency.
From there, Gregory went on to be one of the team's biggest success story for 2021.

     Summary: Adam Schefter explains what caused Randy Gregory to change his mind and leave the Cowboys for the Broncos.
(1:09)How Randy Gregory went from staying with Dallas to leaving for Denver (1:09)ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- In a stunning -- and public -- reversal of free-agency fortune, the Denver Broncos have agreed to terms with outside linebacker Randy Gregory.
When questioned about the clause, the Cowboys said that it is included in every Dallas player contract but Dak Prescott's, the source told Werder.
Denver also agreed to re-sign linebacker Josey Jewell to a two-year, $11 million contract Tuesday, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
Gregory made a career-high 11 starts last season, missing time because of a calf strain and COVID-19.

     Randy Gregory to sign with Broncos, not Cowboys, in NFL free agency flip-flop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Because defensive end Randy Gregory, two people with knowledge of the deal confirmed to USA TODAY Sports, pivoted.
But multiple reports said the Cowboys added a clause in the deal that Gregory and his representation weren’t comfortable with.
Gregory’s marijuana usage was in part how he handled intense social anxiety, he told USA TODAY Sports.
“It’s refreshing to see how far Randy’s come.”In 50 career games for the Cowboys, Gregory collected 85 tackles, 16 ½ sacks, eight forced fumbles and 52 quarterback hits.
The Broncos tweeted a GIF that needed just one word: “SURPRISE.”Follow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.

     Randy Gregory expected to sign with Broncos after nearly agreeing to deal with Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just moments after the Cowboys announced they had agreed to terms on a new five-year deal with Randy Gregory, the defensive end changed his mind, spurning Dallas to instead agree to a five-year, $70 million deal with the Denver Broncos, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport added that a hang-up in contract language was a sticking point for Gregory in returning to the Cowboys.
Per Rapoport, the Cowboys deal was also going to be for $70 million.
NFL Network's James Palmer reported that the Broncos turned their attention to Gregory when it became apparent that Miller would be too expensive to sign.
With a healthy Bradley Chubb in the mix, Denver will have two excellent edge rushers set to hunt quarterbacks.
