     Senate passes bill that would make Daylight Saving Time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Senate on Tuesday passed a measure that would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States.
The bill would still need to pass the House and be signed by President Joe Biden to become law.
If the measure clears Congress and is signed into law, it would mean no more falling back every year in the fall.
Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was presiding at the time of the bill's consideration and who represents Arizona, a state that doesn't observe Daylight Saving Time, could be heard on the mic saying "Ooh, I love it."
The bill has bipartisan backing including several Republican and Democratic cosponsors.

     Summary: “If we can get this passed, we don’t have to keep doing this stupidity anymore,” Rubio said.
Whitehouse said he has not received an assurance from Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the permanent-DST bill’s future in the House.
The House could also theoretically amend the bill to change its implementation date, which would require further Senate action.
… I hope it works out wonderfully.”Congress tried a permanent daylight saving time in the 1970s, but quickly reversed course on the move amid widespread public outcry over the switch.
“Americans want more sunshine and less depression,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said as she hailed the legislation on the floor.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoWASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.
On Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour.
Pallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.
Daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918.
The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

     Summary: If enacted into law, it would also mean that early risers lose an hour of daylight in the mornings in November, December, January and February.
In New York, for example, under current law the sun will rise at 7:15 a.m. on Dec. 21, the shortest day of the year.
If the Sunshine Protection Act becomes law, New Yorkers won’t see the sun rise until 8:15 a.m. that day.
“The benefits of daylight saving time has been accounted for in the research: Reduced crime as there is light later in the day, decrease in seasonal depression that many feel during standard time and the practical one,” he added.
Rubio said it would also give school kids more time to play in the daylight after school.
