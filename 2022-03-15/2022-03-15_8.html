    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick is the club's fifth manager in nine yearsManchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) – "We are not good enough," admitted Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea when faced with the fact the Red Devils will now go five years without winning a trophy.
Advertising Read moreA limp 1-0 home defeat to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday saw United bow out of the Champions League at the last 16 and the final chance of silverware from a miserable season slip away.
Just like United in the Premier League, Simeone's men face a battle in the final months of the La Liga season just to qualify for next season's Champions League.
The 37-year-old has finally started to show his age in recent months and for the first time he completed 90 minutes in the Champions League without registering a shot.
Whether Ronaldo stays for the second year of his contract at United will depend heavily on if they make it into the Champions League next season.

     Summary: Match statistics: Manchester United 0-1 Atletico MadridIn a season of lows for Manchester United, this was the lowest.
Their final chance of silverware gone, as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford.
Not only does this mean that their wait for a trophy will go into a sixth year, but their dismal record in Champions League knockout ties has continued.
It was Cristiano Ronaldo's first Champions League game in 11 years where he played 90 minutes and did not manage a shot.
We are really really sad.

     Deflated David De Gea lost for words as Man Utd crash out of Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David De Gea looked deflated as the long-serving goalkeeper reflected on “another bad year” for Manchester United following the meek Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid.
The Champions League offered hope, albeit faint, of a first trophy since lifting the Europa League in 2017, but wily Atleti extinguished those hopes.
“Difficult to describe with words how I feel, how we feel,” the crestfallen Spain international said in the post-match press conference.
I think they’re an experienced team, they know how to play those games very well and it’s a very difficult moment for us.”Asked if it was the most upset he felt after a Champions League elimination, De Gea said: “Yeah, it’s always tough when you go out of the Champions League, especially the way we did.
“There are too many years without any trophies, even without fighting for trophies,” De Gea said.

Cheers at Maguire’s humiliation were replaced by boos at the full-time whistle as United exited the Champions League with a whimper.
“It’s like they’ve never seen Atletico Madrid play before,” Hargreaves said.
Savic and Gimenez just kept heading everything out.”Scholes added: “They are not a better team than Man United, but they’ve got a better coach.
