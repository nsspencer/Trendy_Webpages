     Former Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield Comments on Uncertain Future with Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amidst heavy rumors that the Cleveland Browns are pursuing Houston Texans quarterback DeShaun Watson, among others, former OU signal-caller Baker Mayfield posted a statement on the situation on Twitter.
“The past 4 years have been nothing short of truly life changing since I heard my name called in the draft to go to Cleveland,” Mayfield wrote.
This is strictly to thank the city of Cleveland for embracing my family and me.
I have no clue what happens next, which is the meaning behind the silence I have had during the duration of this process.
SI Sooners will continue to provide updates on Mayfield’s status with the Browns as they become available.

     Baker Mayfield trade rumors: Browns' QB seemingly says goodbye to Cleveland with social media post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although the Browns quarterback appears to know his fate with the organization as he posted what seems to be a farewell letter on social media Tuesday night.
Regardless if the Browns are able to land Watson or not, Mayfield may have forced his hand with the Browns with this farewell message.
If the Browns aren't committed to Mayfield, the quarterback is looking to find his next destination sooner rather than later.
Mayfield had surgery on the torn labrum in January, ending his season once the Browns were officially eliminated from the playoffs.
Of 32 qualified quarterbacks, Mayfield finished 27th in completion percentage, 22nd in touchdown passes, 17th in yards per attempt (7.2), and 27th in quarterback rating.

(Photo by Adam Glanzman/Getty Images)Baker Mayfield will likely leave the Cleveland Browns soon.
Mary Kay Cabot was the first to report (and deserves some respect) that the Browns were pursuing Watson, who is going to meet with the Browns today.
This all but assures that Baker Mayfield is done in Cleveland, whether it’s in an eventual trade or after the year is over.
The Browns front office, which many thoughts was so shiny and new, is starting to show some serious issues and cracks in the foundation.

     QB Baker Mayfield posts message thanking Cleveland fans on same day Browns brass meets with Deshaun Watson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Browns brass flew back from a meeting with who they hope will be their future quarterback, Deshaun Watson, their current quarterback, Baker Mayfield, posted a statement to social media on Tuesday night thanking the city of Cleveland and its fans "who truly embraced who I am."
This is strictly to thank the city of Cleveland for embracing my family and me," he said.
The Browns flew to Houston on Tuesday to pitch Watson on waiving his no-trade clause to come to Cleveland, a league source told ESPN.
Despite that, Mayfield led Cleveland to its first playoff victory in 26 years during the 2020 season.
He wound up finishing 27th in the league in QBR, as the Browns missed the playoffs and finished with a disappointing 8-9 record.
