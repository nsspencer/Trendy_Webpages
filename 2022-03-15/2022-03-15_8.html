     Jussie Smollett Released From Jail on Order of Appellate Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Illinois appellate court ruled Wednesday that the actor Jussie Smollett be released from jail on bond pending his appeal of his conviction for falsely reporting that he had been the victim of a hate crime.
Mr. Smollett was sentenced last week to five months in jail, but his lawyers quickly asked a panel of judges to stay the sentence while they appealed the conviction.
Mr. Smollett’s lawyers had argued in court papers that the sentence should be stayed because his term would likely be finished before his appeal was completed and that being incarcerated threatened his health and safety.
On Wednesday night, Mr. Smollett walked out of Cook County Jail with supporters at his side.
Nenye Uche, Mr. Smollett’s lead lawyer, said in a video posted to his client’s Instagram account, “They released him and that says a lot about what the appellate court thinks of this case.”

     Summary: Jussie Smollett was released from jail Wednesday night, hours after an Illinois state appellate court ruled he could go free while his lawyers appeal his conviction for staging a hate crime.

Shame on you if you think they should.”A court allowed Jussie Smollett to be released from prison while he appeals his conviction.
The experience was so traumatic that Smollett ‘‘nearly lost faith in our justice system’ and couldn’t eat, Uche said.

     Jussie Smollett released from county jail during appeal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former “Empire” actor walked out of the Cook County Jail on Wednesday surrounded by security.
The appeals court ruling came after a Cook County judge sentenced Smollett last week to immediately begin serving 150 days in jail for his conviction on five felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police.
Smollett defense attorney Nenye Uche, speaking to reporters outside the jail after Smollett left, said the Smollett family is “very very happy with today’s developments.” Uche said during his time at the jail, Smollett had not eaten and drank only water, though he did not say why.
He criticized the special prosecutor’s decision to charge Smollett again after the initial charges were dropped by Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and he paid a fine.
Judge James Linn sentenced Smollett last week to 150 days in jail — with good behavior he could have been released in as little as 75 days.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Jussie Smollett was released from jail Wednesday night, after an Illinois appeals court granted an emergency motion by his defense attorneys.
Uche, as well as other attorneys from the team who spoke Wednesday, criticized the judge who sentenced Smollett last week.
Over the past six days in jail, Smollett did not eat anything besides ice water, Uche said.
In their response filed Wednesday, prosecutors vehemently disagreed with the defense's reasoning, arguing that there is "no emergency that warrants the extraordinary relief" of delaying Smollett's sentence while his appeal is pending.
