     Jaguars releasing Myles Jack: Linebacker on open market after leading team in tackles last season, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars went on a spending spree on the first day of legal tampering, handing out six big contracts.
On Tuesday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the Jaguars are releasing linebacker Myles Jack.
Jack is just 26 years old and led the Jaguars with 108 combined tackles last season.
He's an athletic backer who has 82 starts to his name, and should immediately draw interest on the open market.
It's possible Jack won't be the only Jaguars starter who could be playing for a new team in 2022.

     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars will be releasing linebacker Myles Jack, according to a report by Adam Schefter of ESPN.
After Monday’s spending spree, the Jaguars are releasing LB Myles Jack, per source.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 15, 2022The move to release Jack comes as a bit of a surprise, however given that the new regime is seemingly completely changing the look of the Jaguars’ roster.
The release of Jack saves the Jaguars just over $8 million in cap space, so it’s very possible the Jaguars aren’t totally done in spending money in free agency.
The team did sign linebacker Foye Oloukon on Monday, who is a similar style of linebacker as Jack and there was some talk it could possibly point to the end of the Myles Jack era.

     Jacksonville Jaguars release leading tackler Myles Jack after spending spree
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jaguars are releasing veteran linebacker Myles Jack in a move that will save the team $8.35 million, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Jack was the Jaguars' leading tackler last season with 108 and has had at least 107 tackles in three of the past four seasons.
The move will cost the Jaguars $4.8 million in dead money.
Jack has missed only nine games in his six-year career and has 513 tackles, 6.5 sacks, 3 interceptions and 4 fumble recoveries.
Replays showed he wasn't down, and that birthed the "Myles Jack wasn't down" phenomenon among Jacksonville fans.
