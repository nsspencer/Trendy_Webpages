     Summary: Stephany told investigators a fall onto a carpeted floor, like those in the hotel room, was a possibility, the report said.
Saget could have gotten hurt within a few hours to a couple of days before he died but “would have exhibited significant signs that something was wrong,” the medical examiner told investigators.

     Final police report on Bob Saget’s fatal injury rules out foul play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A final incident report from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in Florida could not determine what caused the accidental head injury that killed Bob Saget, although the report ruled out foul play.
A medical examiner's autopsy found no "definitive conclusion" about what caused "Full House" star Bob Saget's fatal head injury in January.
After Dr. Stephany completed his autopsy, Saget’s hotel room was re-examined to try to determine how the late comedian might have sustained his head injury.
Most of the chairs and couches were thickly upholstered and were too soft to have caused the type and extent of injury Mr. Saget suffered," it continued.
The report was filed a day after a Florida judge permanently blocked the release of certain investigation records related to Saget’s death.

     Summary: Hotel valet Orlando Nunez says he met the “Full House” actor as he returned from a gig over two hours away.
Nunez asked for a photo, and despite the late hour, Saget obliged.
After snapping the pic, the pair spoke for a few minutes before Saget made his way to his room and Nunez parked his car.

Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay.
A toxicology analysis didn’t show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget’s body.
The report ruled out countertops, tables and nightstands in the hotel room since those all had hard surfaces.
A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget’s suite since it had been latched from inside.

     Summary: (CNN) The Orange County Sheriff's Office issued its final report into the death of Bob Saget on Tuesday and said it will comply with a court-ordered permanent injunction blocking the release of additional details of the comedian's untimely death.
"Yesterday, a court order was entered prohibiting the release of certain materials gathered during the course of OCSO's investigation into the death of Bob Saget.
A Florida judge granted a permanent injunction Monday blocking the release of additional records related to the death investigation, CNN previously reported.
"No one entered or left his room, until security entered that afternoon at the request of his family," the report says.
Stephany noted Saget's head injury likely occurred within a few hours of his death but could have occurred in the days prior, the report says.
