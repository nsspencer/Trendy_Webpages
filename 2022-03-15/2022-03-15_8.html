     Ben Simmons' Status For Nets-Magic Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are in Florida to take on the Orlando Magic on Monday evening, and for the game they remain without three-time NBA All-Star Ben Simmons.
The 25-year-old was acquired in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers last month, but has yet to make his debut for his new team.
The status of Simmons can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of the Nets.
The Nets come into the night on a three-game winning streak with consecutive road wins over the Charlotte Hornets, Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks.
They are currently the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 35-33 record in the 68 games that they have played in so far this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — In a career of great offensive nights, this was Kyrie Irving’s greatest.
The Nets star’s mesmerizing 60 points were a career-high and a franchise record, while matching an NBA season-best.
Those 60 points also led the Nets to their fourth consecutive win, a 150-108 rout of the Magic, as Irving was showered with cheers and serenaded with chants of “Kyrie!
The irony of the Magic crowd reveling in Irving’s magic while he still can’t play on his home court at Barclays Center wasn’t lost on the Nets.
The second half was simply perfunctory, as the Nets led by as many as 44 points.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — After four months away from the game, sitting at home, Goran Dragic signed with the Nets.
The 35-year-old guard had about a week to get in game shape, and another week before he was handed the keys to the offense and told to run it.
How quickly Dragic has been thrust into a pivotal role and a starting spot would shock many, if the Nets weren’t in such dire straits.
Goran Dragic, driving on Jericho Sims during the Nets’ win over the Knicks, already has been given a big role for Brooklyn.
But with Irving ineligible at home (he’ll be able to play just three more games this regular season), the Nets need Dragic.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Knicks’ Mitchell Robinson slipped into space in the lane, Bruce Brown closed out hard and deflected Fournier’s pass, breaking up the play.
It also was consistent with the level Brown has been at since he moved into the starting lineup back on Feb. 12.
In a big man’s role, Brown played much larger than his size.
Brown also averaged 5.4 rebounds in 22.3 minutes per game, a per-36 rate of 8.7 that was also No.
In the 14 games before he moved back into the starting lineup, Brown averaged 3.9 points per game and scored in double-figures just once.
