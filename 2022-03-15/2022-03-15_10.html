     Manchester United vs Atletico Madrid live updates: Renan Lodi's goal puts desperate United out of Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United are out of the Champions League after a miserable 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford.
United had a lot of the ball without really troubling Oblak after that, and Atletico became more confident on the break as the first half progressed.
Joao Felix had a goal disallowed for offside and then Renan Lodi headed Atletico into the lead after an excellent move.
The United players thought the goal should have been disallowed for a foul on Elanga, and their frustration grew during a niggly, stop-start second half.
But United became too desperate, too early and were unable to generate any momentum.

Atletico defeated United 1-0 at Old Trafford as the LaLiga side advanced 2-1 on aggregate and into the Champions League quarterfinals.
The loss condemns United to another year without a trophy after last lifting silverware in 2017 and De Gea accepted it will go down as a "bad year."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ralf Rangnick questioned the “curious refereeing decisions” after Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid.
1-0 win at Old Trafford was enough to help Atletico reach the quarter-finals and signal another trophyless season for United.
"We want to qualify for the Champions League again and we're fully aware that to do that we have to win most of those nine games.
My focus is on finishing the highest possible level with this team then it is time to speak about other things."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David De Gea looked deflated as the long-serving goalkeeper reflected on “another bad year” for Manchester United following the meek Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid.
The Champions League offered hope, albeit faint, of a first trophy since lifting the Europa League in 2017, but wily Atleti extinguished those hopes.
“Difficult to describe with words how I feel, how we feel,” the crestfallen Spain international said in the post-match press conference.
“There are too many years without any trophies, even without fighting for trophies,” De Gea said.
“So we need much more from everyone because this club is too big for where we are now.

Cheers at Maguire’s humiliation were replaced by boos at the full-time whistle as United exited the Champions League with a whimper.
“It’s like they’ve never seen Atletico Madrid play before,” Hargreaves said.
