     Judge makes ban on Bob Saget autopsy records release permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge in Florida on Tuesday agreed to make a permanent order that prohibits the release of photos, video or other records related to the investigation into the death of comedian Bob Saget.
The family members had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the release of any records from the local medical examiner’s office and the Orange County Sheriff’s Office involving the investigation into Saget’s death.
Saget, 65, was found dead January 9 in a room at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando.
During the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner’s office and sheriff’s office created graphic videos and photos of Saget’s body, as well as audio recordings.
Such records are prohibited by state law from being released publicly, but some media outlets had already filed requests for them, according to the family’s lawsuit.

     Summary: Had he been with people at the time, they would have noticed “confusion, balance, and/or slurred speech,” the report states.
Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay.
A toxicology analysis didn’t show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget’s body.
The report ruled out countertops, tables and nightstands in the hotel room since those all had hard surfaces.
A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget’s suite since it had been latched from inside.
