    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco, CA – The Golden State Warriors got Draymond Green back on the court and won their fourth straight game.
It was the first game Green, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry played together since the 2019 NBA Finals.
In his first offensive possession, Green assisted Curry, who got open for a quick three-pointer that essentially started the night.
Not because they beat a good team, but because Green, Curry, and Thompson are playing together again.
“I saw a stat that said every playoff game we’ve started together we’ve never lost a series,” Thompson said.

With Steph, everything looks and feels a little bit different.”No one knows how to optimize Curry’s game better than Green.
If you ask Curry, no one has been more integral in his journey to become the greatest three-point shooter in NBA history than Green.
Warriors back in the championship conversationWithout Green, the Warriors probably don’t stand a chance at making a run to the NBA Finals.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Draymond Green returns to the court after missing the last 30 games and quickly hits Steph Curry for a 3-pointer.
(0:48)SAN FRANCISCO -- The moment Draymond Green checked in to the Golden State Warriors' 126-112 win over the Washington Wizards on Monday night might have been the best birthday present Stephen Curry could have wished for.
"100 percent," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said when asked if there was a correlation between Curry's night and Green's return.
With Green playing under a 20 minutes restriction, he and Curry shared the court for just 15 minutes against the Wizards.
"He's amazing at reading plays, whether he's the one playmaking or he's setting screens," Curry said of Green.

     Draymond Green says Warriors 'going to win a championship' after Stephen Curry drops 47 points in his return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Green said that Curry had called the play as soon as he entered the game.
3 seed, we're going to win a championship," Green told NBC Sports Bay Area after the game.
But more than any skill that Green brings on either end, it's the energy, swagger and confidence he emanates that makes this Warriors team click.
With Monday's win, the Warriors improved to 29-6 when Green plays this season, so his influence is clear.
Mix that in with a fully loaded offense with a jelling backcourt trio of Curry, Thompson and Jordan Poole, and Green's championship guarantee suddenly doesn't seem that far-fetched.
