     Marvel debuts trailer for first Muslim superhero ‘Ms. Marvel’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) - Marvel is introducing its first Muslim superhero on screen.
The character, Kamala Khan, was introduced in comics in 2013 before getting her own series the next year.
Kamala, played by Iman Vellani, is a Muslim, Pakistani-American high school student from New Jersey.
The new series appears to be her origin story, in which she envisions herself as a version of Captain Marvel.
The trailer doesn’t show how she gets her powers or their extent, but she describes them as “cosmic.”“Ms.

     Ms. Marvel’s first trailer teases a cosmic take on Kamala Khan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike her fellow Jersey teens who insist that superheroes aren’t cool, Kamala Khan, the heroine of Marvel’s upcoming Ms. Marvel series, thinks capes are the flyest thing in the world.
Naturally, she wants to become one of them herself, and in Ms. Marvel’s first trailer, the young girl’s wish starts to come true.
From series creator Bisha K. Ali, Ms. Marvel tells the story of how Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), a diehard Carol Danvers stan, first discovers her own burgeoning superpowers and starts putting them to good use as supervillainy begins to take root in Jersey City.
But unlike comics Kamala, who develops the power to embiggen parts of her body through the Inhuman terrigenesis process, Ms. Marvel’s Kamala’s abilities are apparently more cosmic in nature and involve her making energy constructs.
You won’t have to wait all that long to meet Kamala, though, as Ms. Marvel hits Disney Plus on June 8th.

     Ms. Marvel Trailer Breakdown: New Powers and More!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel has to work with more restrictions than the comics here, so Kamala can’t be obsessed with Wolverine just yet.
Captain MarvelIf there’s someone Kamala Khan looks up to more than Wolverine, or anyone else really, it’s Captain Marvel.
What Are Ms. Marvel’s New Powers?
In the comics, Kamala’s powers include the ability to fully transform her entire self to becoming larger or smaller.
Since this is only a trailer and the Disney+ show itself is still an introduction, there’s plenty of room for Ms. Marvel’s powers to grow and change in The Marvels or other future MCU outings.

     Ms. Marvel Trailer Introduces Marvel’s First Muslim Hero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On March 15, the studio released the first trailer for Ms. Marvel, a new TV series that introduces the extended universe’s first Muslim superhero.
Ms. Marvel centers on Kamala Khan, a relatively recent addition to the Marvel canon, as she was introduced in 2013.
She takes up the name Ms. Marvel, which had previously been used by other characters, including Carol Danvers (who Brie Larsen plays in Captain Marvel).
Given the Marvel universe’s love of high-profile cameos, it’s quite likely we’ll see some of the established stars make appearances in Ms. Marvel.
She hasn’t done much press about the series yet, but in an August 2021 interview with Variety, she spoke about the potential impact Ms. Marvel could have on viewers.

     The Marvelous Ms. Marvel Trailer: You Glow Girl!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Between Black Widow and WandaVision, and the upcoming She-Hulk series, Disney+ really is the place to see a female-led project in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
In the trailer for the upcoming Ms. Marvel series, Kamala is a New Jersey teen with her head in the clouds and Jordan Firstman for a guidance counselor.
“It’s not really the brown girls from Jersey City who save the world,” she tells a friend in the trailer.
When the Kamala Khan iteration of the Ms. Marvel character debuted in 2014, she was the first Muslim Marvel hero to have her own comic title.
Bisha K. Ali, a screenwriter who worked on Hulu’s Four Weddings and a Funeral, is credited as the creator of the Ms. Marvel series, which streams June 8 on Disney+.
