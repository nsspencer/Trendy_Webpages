     Ms. Marvel’s first trailer teases a cosmic take on Kamala Khan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike her fellow Jersey teens who insist that superheroes aren’t cool, Kamala Khan, the heroine of Marvel’s upcoming Ms. Marvel series, thinks capes are the flyest thing in the world.
Naturally, she wants to become one of them herself, and in Ms. Marvel’s first trailer, the young girl’s wish starts to come true.
From series creator Bisha K. Ali, Ms. Marvel tells the story of how Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), a diehard Carol Danvers stan, first discovers her own burgeoning superpowers and starts putting them to good use as supervillainy begins to take root in Jersey City.
But unlike comics Kamala, who develops the power to embiggen parts of her body through the Inhuman terrigenesis process, Ms. Marvel’s Kamala’s abilities are apparently more cosmic in nature and involve her making energy constructs.
You won’t have to wait all that long to meet Kamala, though, as Ms. Marvel hits Disney Plus on June 8th.
