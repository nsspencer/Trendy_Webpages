     Ms. Marvel’s first trailer teases a cosmic take on Kamala Khan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike her fellow Jersey teens who insist that superheroes aren’t cool, Kamala Khan, the heroine of Marvel’s upcoming Ms. Marvel series, thinks capes are the flyest thing in the world.
Naturally, she wants to become one of them herself, and in Ms. Marvel’s first trailer, the young girl’s wish starts to come true.
From series creator Bisha K. Ali, Ms. Marvel tells the story of how Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), a diehard Carol Danvers stan, first discovers her own burgeoning superpowers and starts putting them to good use as supervillainy begins to take root in Jersey City.
But unlike comics Kamala, who develops the power to embiggen parts of her body through the Inhuman terrigenesis process, Ms. Marvel’s Kamala’s abilities are apparently more cosmic in nature and involve her making energy constructs.
You won’t have to wait all that long to meet Kamala, though, as Ms. Marvel hits Disney Plus on June 8th.

     'Ms. Marvel' trailer introduces the MCU's Muslim teen superhero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Kamala Khan's Ms. Marvel, a beloved recent addition to the superhero comic canon, is joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) this summer.
And based on the trailer for her new self-titled Disney+ series, she's every bit as endearing and relatable as her comic iteration.
Ms. Marvel, an Original series from Marvel Studios, starts streaming June 8 on @DisneyPlus.
"It's not really the brown girls from Jersey City who save the world," Kamala says at one point in the trailer.
But "Ms. Marvel" the series will likely prove her wrong.

     Ms. Marvel Trailer Breakdown: New Powers and More!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel has to work with more restrictions than the comics here, so Kamala can’t be obsessed with Wolverine just yet.
Captain MarvelIf there’s someone Kamala Khan looks up to more than Wolverine, or anyone else really, it’s Captain Marvel.
What Are Ms. Marvel’s New Powers?
In the comics, Kamala’s powers include the ability to fully transform her entire self to becoming larger or smaller.
Since this is only a trailer and the Disney+ show itself is still an introduction, there’s plenty of room for Ms. Marvel’s powers to grow and change in The Marvels or other future MCU outings.
