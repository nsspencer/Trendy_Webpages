     Former Jacksonville Jaguars WR DJ Chark Jr. to sign 1-year deal with Detroit Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark Jr. intends to sign a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The deal is expected to be worth up to $13 million, according to the source.
The Lions also are re-signing defensive end Charles Harris to a two-year $14 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Harris had 7.5 sacks with the Lions last season, his first with the franchise.
One AFC executive told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Chark has what it takes to be great, but his fitness and nuanced route running aren't where they could be.

     Lions agree to deal with former Jaguars WR DJ Chark, re-sign DE Charles Harris: Sources
    </h2>

     Summary: The Lions have agreed to a deal with former Jaguars wide receiver DJ Chark, a league source told The Athletic on Tuesday.
Detroit also retained one of its own Tuesday by re-signing defensive end Charles Harris to a two-year deal worth a maximum of $14 million, according to a source.
Chark, a 2018 second-round draft pick by the Jaguars, has played all four seasons with Jacksonville.

     In wild WR market, Detroit Lions show restraint, add Jaguars' DJ Chark on 1-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an exploding wide receiver market, the Detroit Lions took a measured approach to their free agent shopping at the position.
The Lions agreed to a one-year contract Tuesday with Jacksonville Jaguars receiver DJ Chark, a league source told the Free Press.
The Los Angeles Chargers signed Mike Williams to a three-year, $60 million contract before the start of free agency.
And Christian Kirk agreed to a four-year deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Day 1 of free agency Monday that has a maximum value of $84 million.
The Lions entered free agency determined to add an outside receiver to their offense that struggled in the red zone and to push the ball downfield last season.

     Lions to sign WR D.J. Chark to one-year, $10M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday morning that the Lions are expected to sign free-agent wideout D.J.
Chark to a one-year deal worth $10 million fully guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
The one-year, prove-it deal for Chark makes sense after the wideout played in just four games in 2021 due to a fractured ankle.
When healthy, Chark has proven he can be an explosive playmaker.
On the other side of the ball, Detroit is slated to re-sign pass rusher ﻿Charles Harris﻿ to a two-year, $14 million deal, Rapoport added.

     4 quick thoughts on the Detroit Lions adding DJ Chark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions finally struck in free agency by reportedly agreeing to terms with former Jaguars receiver DJ Chark on Tuesday morning.
“Whether that’s a big guy with a lot of strength and size, whether that’s a guy with elite quickness or speed.
Typically you’d see Chark seeking a longer-term deal, but the Lions sweetened the pot by making it fully guaranteed.
Chark’s $10 million+ cap hit cuts the Lions’ free agency spending money basically in half.
Lions still very much in the WR market in the draftWith Chark only inked for one year, this shouldn’t change the Lions’ plans at receiver in the draft.
