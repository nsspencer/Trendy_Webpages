     Ms. Marvel’s first trailer teases a cosmic take on Kamala Khan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike her fellow Jersey teens who insist that superheroes aren’t cool, Kamala Khan, the heroine of Marvel’s upcoming Ms. Marvel series, thinks capes are the flyest thing in the world.
Naturally, she wants to become one of them herself, and in Ms. Marvel’s first trailer, the young girl’s wish starts to come true.
From series creator Bisha K. Ali, Ms. Marvel tells the story of how Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), a diehard Carol Danvers stan, first discovers her own burgeoning superpowers and starts putting them to good use as supervillainy begins to take root in Jersey City.
But unlike comics Kamala, who develops the power to embiggen parts of her body through the Inhuman terrigenesis process, Ms. Marvel’s Kamala’s abilities are apparently more cosmic in nature and involve her making energy constructs.
You won’t have to wait all that long to meet Kamala, though, as Ms. Marvel hits Disney Plus on June 8th.

     Kamala Khan Gets Her Superhero Origin Story in New ‘Ms. Marvel’ Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Superhero-obsessed Kamala Khan winds up with some superpowers of her own in the new trailer for Ms. Marvel, the next Marvel Studios series arriving on Disney+ on June 8.
It’s a balancing act that grows even more complicated once Kamala suddenly gets superpowers of her own, transforming her into Ms. Marvel.
Ms. Marvel stars Iman Vellani as Kamala/Ms.Marvel, while the cast also boasts Aramis Knight, Saagar Shaikh, Rish Shah, Zenobia Shroff, Mohan Kapur, Matt Lintz, Yasmeen Fletcher, Laith Nakli, Azhar Usman, Travina Springer, and Nimra Bucha.
The new Ms. Marvel series springs from the celebrated run of Ms. Marvel comic books where Kamala was introduced as Ms. Marvel, marking the first Marvel series to feature a Muslim character in the main role.
Amant is now a co-executive producer on the series, while Bisha K. Ali was tapped to be the show’s head writer.
