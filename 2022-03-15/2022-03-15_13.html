     Lille 1-2 Chelsea (1-4 agg.): Blues into Champions League quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lille put up a good fight, but Chelsea's quality shone through as the Premier League club won 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 second-leg meeting on Wednesday.
Wednesday's victory combined with the first-leg result means Chelsea claims a 4-1 aggregate victory over the French champions.
After going down a goal thanks to Burak Yilmaz's 38th-minute penalty kick, Chelsea found the motivation needed to kick things into a higher gear.
Then, in the 71st minute, Chelsea made the hosts pay for their misses as César Azpilicueta scored to put the result out of reach.
Chelsea moves on to the quarterfinals as the English club looks to repeat as Champions League titleholder.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pulisic scored his second goal in his past three appearances for Chelsea as the defending UEFA Champions League winners advanced into the quarterfinals by a 4-1 aggregate scoreline.
Burak Yilmaz cut Lille’s deficit to 2-1 on aggregate with his 38th minute penalty-kick goal, but Pulisic re-extended Chelsea’s advantage before halftime.
The 23-year-old received a stellar pass from Jorginho in the box before unleashing a right-footed shot into the bottom-left corner from a tight angle.
Pulisic was substituted off in the 74th minute with Chelsea’s FA Cup quarterfinal tie at Middlesbrough coming up on Saturday.
Chelsea will learn its opponents for the UCL quarterfinals on Friday, with fellow English Premier League sides Manchester City and Liverpool also advancing to the final eight.

     Summary: Chelsea are set to play any remaining home Champions League fixtures behind closed doors after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU, The Athletic understands.
If they progress to the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to have fans present at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea are not allowed to sell tickets in order to generate revenue.
On Tuesday afternoon, Chelsea complained to the FA that playing without away fans in the FA Cup threatened “sporting integrity”, an appeal which was withdrawn hours later.
A UEFA statement said: “UEFA is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions.

     Summary: LILLE, France, March 16 (Reuters) - Holders Chelsea made light of their off-pitch problems to reach the Champions League quarter-finals by beating Lille 2-1 away on Wednesday to complete a 4-1 aggregate victory.
French champions Lille dominated for long spells and opened the scoring thanks to a Burak Yilmaz penalty in the opening half, but lacked precision up front and paid dearly for lapses in concentration.
Football is the priority at Chelsea, that's why we're focused on what happens on the pitch," Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel told French TV channel RMC Sport.
Jocelyn Gouvennec's side put Chelsea on the back foot as Mateo Kovacic, Jorginho and N'Golo Kante struggled to take control of the midfield.
