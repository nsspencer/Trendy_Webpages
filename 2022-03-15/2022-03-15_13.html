     South Carolina basketball coaching search: Potential candidates to replace Frank Martin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: South Carolina basketball moved on from longtime coach Frank Martin Monday after the Gamecocks failed to reach the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive season, Martin's 10th overall at the program.
He led South Carolina to its only Final Four appearance in program history during the 2016-17 season, but the Gamecocks have fallen on hard times since, which necessitated a change in leadership.
The Big Spur's John Whittle released his initial coaching hot board (VIP) shortly after Martin's firing and from there, more reports of potential candidates to fill South Carolina's vacancy surfaced.
With the NCAA Tournament set to begin this week, some of South Carolina's possible targets on its replacements list are still playing active seasons.
Here's a look at some of the early names to surface who could be candidates for the Gamecocks, who have reportedly already started their coaching search.

     South Carolina fires Frank Martin as men’s basketball coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 10 years, the South Carolina men’s basketball team will finally see a changing of the guard, as the school has decided to move on from coach Frank Martin.
Martin, who is the third longest-tenured coach in program history, compiled a 171-147 record (79-99 in SEC regular-season games) with the Gamecocks — highlighted, of course, by the team’s first-ever Final Four appearance.
South Carolina also appeared in the NIT once under Martin, and had two 20-win seasons.
South Carolina just wrapped up an 18-13 (9-9 SEC) season, punctuated by an immediate and disappointing exit from the SEC Tournament, and failed to make the postseason.
For the first time in a while, the men’s basketball program will have an intriguing offseason ahead of it.

     UNC Basketball Recruiting: G.G. Jackson’s Crystal Ball flipping to rival
    </h2>

     Summary: Recent Crystal Ball predictions for the top UNC basketball recruiting target in the class of 2023 have shifted.
When South Carolina head coach Frank Martin was relieved of his duties on Monday afternoon, speculation regarding Gregory “G.G.” Jackson’s high-profile recruitment and upcoming college decision immediately began to swirl.
So, too, must the level of confidence in their picks, which currently stands at low (3) and medium (5), respectively.
Nothing is set in stone, though, and there’s apparently time remaining in Jackson’s recruitment before a decision is made.

     Summary: Martin was brought in to turn around a struggling program in 2012 following Darrin Horn’s dismal four-year term.
Save for one Final Four run, however, Martin was never able to truly get the Gamecocks program off the ground and take it to the heights that seemed possible following the 2017 season.
After 10 seasons, Martin was fired on Monday, exiting as the third-longest tenured head coach in program history, amassing a 171-157 record and just one NCAA Tournament appearance.
In the meantime, we are taking a look back at a handful of the top moments for South Carolina during the Martin Era.

     South Carolina fires Frank Martin. Could it help UNC or Duke land this 5-star recruit?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And South Carolina’s Monday firing of coach Frank Martin gives UNC and Duke even more short-term opportunity.
“We’re still a ways off,” Greg Jackson told The State’s Phil Kornblut last week.
Traditional college programs made up five of Jackson’s top six finalists, and he has officially visited four of them: UNC, Duke, Georgetown and South Carolina.
“This definitely has an effect because (Martin) recruited me as a coach and is close with my family,” Jackson told 247Sports’ Travis Branham on Tuesday.
Despite Monday’s turbulence, Jackson told 247Sports he’s now shooting for an April decision.
