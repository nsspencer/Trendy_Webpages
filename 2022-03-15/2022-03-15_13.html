     Ravens make a big splash, signing Saints safety Marcus Williams to five-year, $70M deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ravens made their first move of 2022 free agency on Tuesday, and it was a big one, agreeing to terms with star Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
After playing under the franchise tag in 2021, Williams will make an average of $14M per year, putting him among the eight highest-paid safeties in the NFL.
He'll join a big-name secondary in Baltimore, which welcomed Mike Macdonald as its new defensive coordinator this offseason, accompanying Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and Chuck Clark in the starting lineup.
Williams emerged as a rookie starter in 2017, logging four interceptions for the Saints defense.
After playing alongside Malcolm Jenkins at the back end of New Orleans' secondary in 2020, he would've been the consensus top safety to hit free agency before the Saints used the tag.

     Summary: The Ravens agreed to terms with former Saints safety Marcus Williams on a five-year, $70 million contract, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported.
The deal includes $37 million guaranteed, Pelissero reported.
Williams is one of the top safeties in the NFL and a rangy playmaker that immediately upgrades Baltimore's secondary.
A second-round pick by New Orleans in 2017, Williams has generated 312 tackles, 15 interceptions, 38 passes defended and three forced fumbles.
He's one of six players with two-plus interceptions in each of the past five seasons.

     Summary: Williams contract with Baltimore — which he cannot officially sign until after the start of the new league year Wednesday — includes $37 million in guaranteed money.
Earlier this month, the Saints declined to use the franchise tag on Williams for a second consecutive year, a move that would have cost the Saints approximately $12.7 million against this year's salary cap.

It was only the third time in franchise history the Saints had used a franchise tag on a player, with Williams joining Drew Brees (2012) and Jimmy Graham (2014).
Williams, who in the last two seasons has filled in when Williams has missed time to injury, is also an unrestricted free agent.

     Saints project to receive mid-round comp pick in 2023 for Marcus Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, for example, if the Saints sign pending free agent safety Tyrann Mathieu to a contract averaging $14 million per year then they wouldn’t qualify for a compensatory pick next year.
But which round could fans expect a comp pick for Williams to slot in at?
A fourth rounder feels most likely (the highest compensatory pick allowed is a third rounder), given recent history.
The Saints are expected to receive a compensatory fourth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft after losing defensive end Trey Hendrickson last offseason.
If they add more qualifying players than they lose, regardless of their contract value, they won’t earn any comp picks at all.

     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens have signed safety Marcus Williams to a five-year, $70 million deal.
Now, they’ve landed a top-flight free safety to improve last season’s No.
— Kyle BarberFree safety was a pressing need for the Ravens this offseason and by signing Marcus Williams, they land the best available player at the position.
Williams is an elite coverage player and instantly changes the complexion of the Ravens’ defense.
Compared to Tyrann Mathieu, the other top free agent safety who many fans wanted, Williams is a better true free safety, better fit for the Ravens, and several years younger.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No one has played more defensive snaps than Marcus Williams for Dennis Allen since the New Orleans Saints drafted him back in 2017, with Williams totaling 4,778 snaps — that’s more than Cameron Jordan (4,392), Marshon Lattimore (4,345), and everyone else.
A lot of the continuity Allen was touted for when they promoted him to head coach is walking out the door.
The Saints don’t have an easy replacement for Williams on the roster.
It’s one thing if Williams was leaving on a market-setting contract that the Saints can’t afford to match.
Maybe the Saints make a smart move and come out ahead in the end.

     Summary: But it’s not just Alvin Kamara and Marshon Lattimore that will leave their mark on the Saints franchise record books.
As observed by friend of the blog Evan Saacks on Twitter, 2017 second-round safety Marcus Williams will leave the Saints tied for eighth all-time in interceptions after just five seasons.
William’s total of 15 regular season interceptions also tops the team since he was drafted.
By the way, not far behind Williams is fellow 2017 draft pick cornerback Marshon Lattimore.
