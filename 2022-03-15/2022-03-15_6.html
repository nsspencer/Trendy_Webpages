     Browns Trade Patriots for LB Chase Winovich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The AFC North continues to get more difficult as the Cleveland Browns trade with the New England Patriots for outside linebacker Chase Winovich, according to NFL Network.
Winovich was the Patriots third-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, and has played 45 games for New England, including nine starts.
The Pittsburgh Steelers have been connected to Winovich since his days at Michigan.
The Browns do have Jaeveon Clowney floating around free agency with no certainty to re-sign him.

     Browns trade for LB Chase Winovich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns have agreed to a trade with the New England Patriots for linebacker Chase Winovich.
The Browns will be sending linebacker Mack Wilson to the Patriots in a trade of players who need a fresh start.
The #Patriots are sending OLB Chase Winovich to the #Browns for LB Mack Wilson, per sources.
While he played 13 games last season, Winovich saw his playing time decrease from 594 defensive snaps (with nine starts) in 2020 to just 113 (with no starts) last season.
The trade isn’t surprising, but his inability to carve out more of a defensive role after his 2020 season was a bit of a mystery.

     Patriots trading OLB Chase Winovich to Browns for LB Mack Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots are trading edge rusher Chase Winovich to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for linebacker Mack Wilson﻿, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.
Drafted in the fifth round of the same draft, Wilson carved out a nice starting role in Cleveland over his first three seasons, starting 28 of 43 games played in the middle of the Browns defense.
Like Winovich, the former Alabama standout also saw his play time decrease on defense in 2021 and played nearly as many snaps on special teams as he did at LB.
In Winovich, Cleveland gets some pass-rush depth that could help offset the potential loss of Jadeveon Clowney﻿.
In Wilson, the Patriots reap an inexpensive defender with starter potential to help replace Dont'a Hightower﻿, Ja'Whaun Bentley and Jamie Collins﻿, all of whom may leave in free agency, plus some valuable special teams experience.

     Patriots trade guard Shaq Mason to Bucs, linebacker Chase Winovich to Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots swung a pair of trades on Tuesday, parting ways with stalwart right guard Shaq Mason after shipping out outside linebacker Chase Winovich, league sources confirmed.
Winovich, who had his playing time drop significantly in 2021, was sent to the Browns for inside linebacker Mack Wilson.
AdvertisementThough the Mason move weakens New England’s offensive line — they lost left guard Ted Karras to the Bengals Monday — it does clear up approximately $7 million in salary cap space.
Winovich was a healthy scratch for the playoff loss in Buffalo, a harbinger of his future with the Patriots.
Shortly after the trade, Mac Jones tweeted at his former college teammate, “BAMA … let’s work.’’Both offensive line and linebacker likely will be addressed in the draft.

     Summary: After three seasons, Chase Winovich is no longer with the New England Patriots.
Regardless, he always kept a positive attitude and that was reflected in his goodbye tweet following the trade.
“I am so grateful for my experience in New England,” Winovich wrote.
📖💓✌🏻🍯 — Chase Winovich (@Wino) March 15, 2022The Patriots needed depth and speed with off-the-ball linebackers and Wilson brings just that.
New England traded Winovich for a player at a different position, but it’s something the Patriots are focused on — especially with the potential losses through free agency.

     What the Chase Winovich trade says about the Patriots’ direction at linebacker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patriots What the Chase Winovich trade says about the Patriots’ direction at linebacker The Patriots gave Chase Winovich a change of scenery while grabbing a player in Mack Wilson that fits their current needs at linebacker.
The New England Patriots are moving on from Chase Winovich.
Their player-for-player swap of Chase Winovich for Cleveland reserve linebacker Mack Wilson stands out as their splashiest move so far this week.
Looking beyond just Wilson, though, the trade might also signal a shift in how the Patriots view linebackers, at least in the short term.
That’s quite a difference compared to Dont’a Hightower (260 pounds) and Ja’Whaun Bentley (255 pounds), the team’s two starting off-ball linebackers from a year ago.
