     Ben Simmons' Status For Nets-Magic Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are in Florida to take on the Orlando Magic on Monday evening, and for the game they remain without three-time NBA All-Star Ben Simmons.
The 25-year-old was acquired in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers last month, but has yet to make his debut for his new team.
The status of Simmons can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of the Nets.
The Nets come into the night on a three-game winning streak with consecutive road wins over the Charlotte Hornets, Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks.
They are currently the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 35-33 record in the 68 games that they have played in so far this season.

     Kyrie Irving scores career- and franchise-high 60 points as Brooklyn Nets rout Orlando Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving scored a career-high 60 points and matched an NBA season-high in points on Tuesday in a brilliant display of scoring.
Irving followed Karl-Anthony Towns’ 60 points on Monday against the San Antonio Spurs.
In the Nets’ 150-108 victory against the Orlando Magic, Irving scored 41 of his points in the first half, setting Nets and individual records.
Had it not been a blowout, Irving would have had a chance to pass Towns’ 60 points, but he checked out of the game with 8:32 left in the fourth quarter after collecting his 60th point.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving scored a career-high 60 points in a 150-108 win against the Orlando Magic.
Irving matched Minnesota All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns for most points in a single NBA game this season.
Towns had 60 points Monday night at San Antonio.
Tuesday's game marks the second time in his last three games that Irving has scored 50 or more.
Kevin Durant had 53 points in that game, giving Brooklyn a 50-point scorer in three of its last four games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second time in two nights, one of the NBA’s 30 single-game team scoring records has fallen.
Irving’s outburst — also a career high — came just two games after he poured in 50 on a ridiculous 19 shots against Charlotte.
Averaging nearly two points per attempt, Irving shot 20-for-31 from the floor, including 8-for-12 on 3-pointers, and was nearly perfect at the foul line (12-for-13).
Content to sit back and enjoy the show as well, fellow scoring ace Kevin Durant took only nine shots to finish with a tidy 19 points.
It also marked their sixth 50-point outing in only two active seasons together, four for Irving and two for Durant.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets star’s mesmerizing 60 points were a career-high and a franchise record, while matching an NBA season-best.
Irving can only play on the road because he’s unvaccinated and barred from playing home games in Brooklyn.
Irving’s 60-point output established a new career-high and set a Nets record.
If Irving and Kevin Durant (19 points, seven assists, five rebounds) are having some kind of scoring challenge, it’s a historic one.
“Making history and doing it with that guy is very special,” Irving said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — After four months away from the game, sitting at home, Goran Dragic signed with the Nets.
The 35-year-old guard had about a week to get in game shape, and another week before he was handed the keys to the offense and told to run it.
How quickly Dragic has been thrust into a pivotal role and a starting spot would shock many, if the Nets weren’t in such dire straits.
Goran Dragic, driving on Jericho Sims during the Nets’ win over the Knicks, already has been given a big role for Brooklyn.
But with Irving ineligible at home (he’ll be able to play just three more games this regular season), the Nets need Dragic.
