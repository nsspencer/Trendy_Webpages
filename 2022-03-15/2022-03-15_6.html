     Summary: Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Banking Committee, issued the following statement in response to Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) announced opposition to the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Federal Reserve Board:“Once again Senator Joe Manchin shows himself to be a statesman who understands the American economy and the strength of American energy production with his announcement to oppose Sarah Bloom Raskin.
This raises awareness that radicals who speak out against fossil fuels and capital investment are out of the mainstream in this country.
It is especially important during these times when energy has become a weapon used by despots and dictators.
We should instead be using it as a tool for peace, American energy dominance, and economic security.”Background:Senator Cramer has been vocal in his concern about Sarah Bloom Raskin’s radical financial philosophy and the ethical cloud surrounding her conduct:Morning’s with Maria (Jan. 27) “I have great concerns about Bloom Raskin.

     Nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for Fed seat in doubt after Manchin opposition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin III will not support one of President Joe Biden’s picks to sit on the Federal Reserve Board, Sarah Bloom Raskin of Maryland, Manchin said Monday.
The announcement casts serious doubt on the chances of Senate confirmation for Raskin, who was a Fed governor from 2010 to 2014 and deputy Treasury secretary from 2014 to 2017.
“Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs,” the Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee chairman said.
With Manchin in opposition, she would need at least one Republican vote on the Senate floor, but no Senate Republicans have publicly said they would support her.
“Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,” the spokesperson said.

     Why Biden’s Fed nominee has run into a conservative Senate wall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raskin — at the time, Maryland’s commissioner of financial regulation — was so accomplished and obviously well qualified that the Senate confirmed her unanimously.
As NBC News reported yesterday, Raskin’s nomination has run into a conservative wall in the Senate.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Monday that he is “unable” to support President Joe Biden’s nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for the Federal Reserve Board.
Perhaps some of the less conservative members of the Senate Republican conference might help make up the difference?
And why, pray tell, are conservative senators so opposed to a highly qualified nominee who’s twice been easily confirmed by the Senate?

     Outlook grim for Sarah Bloom Raskin’s Fed nomination

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementBoth the White House and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the Banking Committee, say it’s still possible.
I think she is a flawed nominee.”Collins told reporters she agrees with Manchin’s belief that there is no path forward for Raskin’s nomination.
Manchin said yesterday that he’s unable to support Raskin’s nomination to be the Fed’s vice chair for supervision because of her climate-related comments.
Republicans have stalled voting on Raskin for weeks alongside four other Fed picks in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
Bowman currently heads the Fed committee charged with setting the central bank’s agenda on financial regulation, a role she would presumably keep absent a new nominee.
