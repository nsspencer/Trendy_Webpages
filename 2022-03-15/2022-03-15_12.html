     Browns agree to swap Mack Wilson for Chase Winovich in trade with Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Browns agreed Tuesday to trade Wilson to the New England Patriots for Winovich, a person familiar with the deal confirmed.
NFL Network first reported the move involving Wilson, a fifth-round selection in 2019, and Winovich, a third-round choice in the same draft.
Last season, Wilson became mostly a special teams player for the Browns.
All-Pro Myles Garrett is the only starting defensive lineman under contract with the Browns for next season.
Malik McDowell, the other starting defensive tackle last season, won't be retained as an exclusive rights free agent because of his arrest in January.

     What the Chase Winovich trade says about the Patriots’ direction at linebacker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patriots What the Chase Winovich trade says about the Patriots’ direction at linebacker The Patriots gave Chase Winovich a change of scenery while grabbing a player in Mack Wilson that fits their current needs at linebacker.
The New England Patriots are moving on from Chase Winovich.
Their player-for-player swap of Chase Winovich for Cleveland reserve linebacker Mack Wilson stands out as their splashiest move so far this week.
Looking beyond just Wilson, though, the trade might also signal a shift in how the Patriots view linebackers, at least in the short term.
That’s quite a difference compared to Dont’a Hightower (260 pounds) and Ja’Whaun Bentley (255 pounds), the team’s two starting off-ball linebackers from a year ago.

     Patriots trading OLB Chase Winovich to Browns for LB Mack Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots are trading edge rusher Chase Winovich to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for linebacker Mack Wilson﻿, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.
Drafted in the fifth round of the same draft, Wilson carved out a nice starting role in Cleveland over his first three seasons, starting 28 of 43 games played in the middle of the Browns defense.
Like Winovich, the former Alabama standout also saw his play time decrease on defense in 2021 and played nearly as many snaps on special teams as he did at LB.
In Winovich, Cleveland gets some pass-rush depth that could help offset the potential loss of Jadeveon Clowney﻿.
In Wilson, the Patriots reap an inexpensive defender with starter potential to help replace Dont'a Hightower﻿, Ja'Whaun Bentley and Jamie Collins﻿, all of whom may leave in free agency, plus some valuable special teams experience.

     Patriots trade guard Shaq Mason to Bucs, linebacker Chase Winovich to Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots swung a pair of trades on Tuesday, parting ways with stalwart right guard Shaq Mason after shipping out outside linebacker Chase Winovich, league sources confirmed.
Winovich, who had his playing time drop significantly in 2021, was sent to the Browns for inside linebacker Mack Wilson.
AdvertisementThough the Mason move weakens New England’s offensive line — they lost left guard Ted Karras to the Bengals Monday — it does clear up approximately $7 million in salary-cap space.
Winovich was a healthy scratch for the playoff loss in Buffalo, a harbinger of his future with the Patriots.
Shortly after the trade, Mac Jones tweeted at his former college teammate, “BAMA … let’s work.’’Both offensive line and linebacker likely will be addressed in the draft.
