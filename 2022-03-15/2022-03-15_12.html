    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Diego Padres got some tough news yesterday when it was revealed that their star shortstop, Fernando Tatis Jr. had suffered a fractured wrist and would need to undergo surgery.
Padres are not expected to try and void Fernando Tatis Jr.’s contract for injury possibly being motorcycle-related, per @jonmorosi.
To our knowledge, Tatis didn’t do anything about his injury, and granted, it progressed over time.
But Tatis definitely let his team and his teammates down by making this mistake and showing up to spring training with an unattended injury.
Starting the season without their star is not ideal for a time trying to rebound from a down season.

     Summary: The Padres announced Tuesday that star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. suffered a fractured wrist during the offseason and could miss up to three months to recover.
However, he did allude to the reported motorcycle accident that the 23-year-old Tatis was involved in the Dominican Republic in December.
According to Kevin Acee of The San Diego Union-Tribune, Tatis suffered “minor scrapes” in the accident.
However, when speaking to the media Tuesday, the Padres shortstop seemingly admitted that he was in a number of minor accidents during the offseason.
When a reporter asked him when the originally reported motorcycle accident occurred, Tatis replied, “Which one?” He remained vague when asked to clarify the date of the accident in ensuing questions.

     Delay costly to Tatis, Padres; mid-June ‘realistic’ for return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fact pattern, including multiple photographs on social media in the ensuing weeks that show Tatis’ wrist in a brace, seems to support this conjecture.
Due to the lockout, communication between Tatis and Padres officials after the accident was limited and second- or third-hand.
(Padres team physicians are contracted through UCSD Health.)
But, relying on conversations with Tatis’ representatives, the team felt assured Tatis merely suffered scrapes and bruises in the fall from the motorcycle.
The Padres were not aware of any issue regarding Tatis’ wrist until after the lockout ended.
