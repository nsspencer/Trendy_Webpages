     Jacksonville Jaguars release leading tackler Myles Jack after spending spree
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jaguars have released veteran linebacker Myles Jack in a move that will save the team $8.35 million.
Jack was the Jaguars' leading tackler last season with 108 and has had at least 107 tackles in three of the past four seasons.
The move costs the Jaguars $4.8 million in dead money.
Jack has missed only nine games in his six-year career and has 513 tackles, 6.5 sacks, 3 interceptions and 4 fumble recoveries.
Replays showed he wasn't down, and that birthed the "Myles Jack wasn't down" phenomenon among Jacksonville fans.

     Jaguars releasing Myles Jack: Linebacker on open market after leading team in tackles last season, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars went on a spending spree on the first day of legal tampering, handing out six big contracts.
On Tuesday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the Jaguars are releasing linebacker Myles Jack.
Jack is just 26 years old and led the Jaguars with 108 combined tackles last season.
He's an athletic backer who has 82 starts to his name, and should immediately draw interest on the open market.
It's possible Jack won't be the only Jaguars starter who could be playing for a new team in 2022.

     Jacksonville Jaguars Release Former UCLA Football Standout Myles Jack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After six years with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the rebuilding franchise released its star linebacker and captain Myles Jack on Thursday afternoon.
Drafted by the AFC South squad in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft, the UCLA football alumnus started 82 of the 88 games over his six seasons with the Jaguars.
Jack led the Jaguars in tackles in the 2021 campaign, the first time he did so in his six-year tenure there after ranking second three times.
Current UCLA football kicker Nicholas Barr-Mira is Barr’s half-brother, as the pair share a mother.
