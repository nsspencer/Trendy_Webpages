     Summary: Gonzaga is the top overall seed in this NCAA Tournament.
For more than 30 minutes in Thursday's first-round game against Georgia State, the Bulldogs hardly looked the part – struggling to pull away from a No.
16 seed and temporarily in danger of becoming just the second overall top seed to be eliminated in the first round.
This 'Zags team is pushing to win coach Mark Few his first national title, avenging last year's runner-up finish to Baylor.
Had Gonzaga not controlled the glass (52-40 rebounding margin) or the paint, Georgia State's guard play was keeping the Panthers (18-11) in the game.

     How to Catch Today's Gonzaga Basketball Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And as expected, conference championship week was no different, as the madness had already begun before March had even arrived.
As the initiator of the nation’s best offense, Nembhard has quietly been one of the best point guards in college basketball this season.
During Gonzaga’s tournament run last season, Timme averaged 20.3 points per game on nearly 65% shooting from the floor.
The Gaels are the prime example of how to combat Gonzaga with their physical yet disciplined defense and balanced approach on offense.
It can’t turn into a game of “your turn, my turn” on offense, or it’ll be a bitter end to what has been a stellar season.
