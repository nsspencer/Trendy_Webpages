     Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery’s NCAA Tournament Record Trending After Hawkeyes’ Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 5 Iowa 67–63 in the first round of the NCAA tournament, Hawkeyes coach Fran McCaffery began trending on Twitter and it was not in a good way.
McCaffrey has coached Iowa to six appearances in the Big Dance.
The Hawkeyes were held to 63 points in losing to Richmond, their lowest output since Jan. 19 against Rutgers.
The Hawkeyes entered this year’s tournament having won at least one game in each of their last four NCAA tournament appearances.
The last time Iowa lost before the second round of the tournament was during the 2013–14 season, when the Hawkeyes suffered a 78–65 defeat to No.

     Summary: 12 Richmond’s 67–63 upset over No.
5 Iowa on Thursday, several key missed Hawkeyes chances appeared to come down to calls from the officials—or lack thereof.
Iowa Fans were left upset with the officiating when referees decided to let the game play on multiple times the last minute of the game when fouls could have been called.
The biggest controversy came from a Kris Murray three-point attempt with less than a minute to play.
Murray missed the shot, and the Hawkeyes remained down 60–57.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four days after celebrating a Big Ten Conference championship in Indianapolis, the Iowa Hawkeyes’ season is over.
But chalk up early exits in 2001 (second round); 2005 (first round); 2006 (first round as a No.
3 seed); 2014 (First Four); 2015 (second round); 2016 (second round); 2019 (second round); 2021 (second round as a No.
Despite the loss, this Iowa basketball season will still have been a success.

Photo by Elsa/Getty ImagesBefore Kentucky fell, Big Ten tournament champ Iowa busted a lot of brackets with its loss to Richmond.
But they will face an Iowa State team that's also susceptible to volatility.
I'm also intrigued by LSU vs. Iowa State, mostly just because I want to see how the Tigers respond to Will Wade's firing last weekend.

     Abrupt end of the college basketball road for Hawkeyes’ Jordan Bohannon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertismentAll but one of the 68 teams involved end this tourney with a defeat, but Iowa’s came quickly and left Bohannon in tears as he spoke at a postgame press conference.
“I faced a lot of adversity coming back, you know, a couple of hip surgeries, dealt with a lot of injuries,” he said.
I just wanted to make my family proud and this whole entire state.”But those statistics will keep Bohannon alive in Iowa basketball long after others have worn his No.
Bohannon banked in a bomb with 1.1 seconds left for the winning points in Iowa’s Big Ten semifinal win over Indiana in Indianapolis last Saturday.
More 3s made than anybody else that ever played in the Big Ten, more assists than anybody that ever played at Iowa.
