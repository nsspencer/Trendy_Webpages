     Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery’s NCAA Tournament Record Trending After Hawkeyes’ Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 5 Iowa 67–63 in the first round of the NCAA tournament, Hawkeyes coach Fran McCaffery began trending on Twitter and it was not in a good way.
McCaffrey has coached Iowa to six appearances in the Big Dance.
The Hawkeyes were held to 63 points in losing to Richmond, their lowest output since Jan. 19 against Rutgers.
The Hawkeyes entered this year’s tournament having won at least one game in each of their last four NCAA tournament appearances.
The last time Iowa lost before the second round of the tournament was during the 2013–14 season, when the Hawkeyes suffered a 78–65 defeat to No.

     No. 12 seed Richmond Spiders stun Iowa Hawkeyes in first round of NCAA tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nathan Cayo finishes strong in the paint down the stretch for Richmond in a 67-63 win over Iowa in the NCAA Tournament.
(0:24)BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Upsetting teams in the NCAA tournament is nothing new for the twelfth-seeded Richmond Spiders, who knocked off the fifth-seeded Iowa Hawkeyes 67-63 on Thursday in this year's first big upset.
Since seeding began in the NCAA tournament, the Spiders have nine wins as a 12-seed or lower -- more than twice as many as any other team.
The Big Ten tournament champion has lost its opening NCAA tournament game only twice -- Michigan State in 2016 and Iowa in 2006, per research by ESPN Stats &amp; Information.
McCaffery drops to 4-6 in NCAA tournament games -- the worst tournament win percentage while at a Big Ten school (among 35 coaches with more than five NCAA tournament games coached).

     Summary: AdvertismentAll but one of the 68 teams involved end this tourney with a defeat, but Iowa’s came quickly and left Bohannon in tears as he spoke at a postgame press conference.
“I faced a lot of adversity coming back, you know, a couple of hip surgeries, dealt with a lot of injuries,” he said.
I just wanted to make my family proud and this whole entire state.”But those statistics will keep Bohannon alive in Iowa basketball long after others have worn his No.
Bohannon banked in a bomb with 1.1 seconds left for the winning points in Iowa’s Big Ten semifinal win over Indiana in Indianapolis last Saturday.
More 3s made than anybody else that ever played in the Big Ten, more assists than anybody that ever played at Iowa.

     Summary: I thought we played one of my worst basketball halves all season the first half, and we were only down one.
I really feel like I didn't have on score the ball as much this game.
Everybody -- there's only one team that's going to end on a win, but leaving this game is probably the worst game we played all year.
They just sat five guys back on defense, so we didn't really get to run.
FRAN McCAFFERY: I think that's an incredibly astute observation.
