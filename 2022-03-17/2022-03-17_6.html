     Steelers release former Pro Bowl LB Joe Schobert after reported signing of Myles Jack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A day after the reported signing of Myles Jack, the Pittsburgh Steelers have released veteran linebacker Joe Schobert, who played just one season for the black and gold.
A Pro Bowler for the Browns in 2017, Schobert recorded 120 tackles, one interception, six passed defensed and a forced fumble during his lone season in Pittsburgh.
His forced fumble occurred near the end of the Steelers' Week 8 win over the Cleveland Browns.

The Steelers' have also used free agency to acquire quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and offensive linemen James Daniels and Mason Cole.

     Steelers make decision on Joe Schobert after Myles Jack signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers landed an excellent young linebacker when they picked up the recently-released Myles Jack in free agency.
The Steelers revealed Thursday that they had terminated the contract of linebacker Joe Schobert.
This move isn’t all too surprising, as Schobert was expected to lose his spot to Jack after the acquisition of the former first-round pick on Wednesday.
The Steelers will save $7.95 million against the cap with the move to cut Schobert.
While he didn’t have a bad season for the Steelers last year, the team felt they’d fare better by replacing Schobert with Jack and subsequently releasing him.

     Steelers sign former Jags LB Myles Jack, release other former Jag Joe Schobert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Wednesday that the Steelers are expected to sign Jack to a two-year, $16-million deal.
However, it also signaled the end for another former Jaguar in linebacker Joe Schobert, who was eventually released.
That decision to release Schobert saves them around $7 million in cap room while creating just over $1 million in dead money.
Jaguars’ general manager Trent Baalke and head coach Doug Pederson ultimately made the decision to release Jack to generate more cap space.
Last season, Schobert tallied 112 tackles, one forced fumble, and an interception with Pittsburgh.
