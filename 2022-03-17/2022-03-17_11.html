     Koch Industries breaks silence on Russia to say it will continue to operate its 2 glass facilities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan., company run by right-wing billionaire Charles Koch, released a statement on its Russia operations on Wednesday, in which it said it would continue to operate its glass manufacturing facilities.
The company, which has bucked the trend of U.S. companies withdrawing or curtailing their activities in Russia following its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, said its two glass manufacturing facilities that are part of Guardian Industries, a company it acquired in 2017, employ about 600 people, and that outside of that it employs 15 individuals in Russia.
"While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what The Wall Street Journal has reported they would do)," Chief Operating Officer Dave Robertson said in a statement. "
Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good."
The company is complying with "all applicable sanctions," he added and will continue to monitor the situation.

     Koch calls the Ukraine war “an affront to humanity”—but it’s staying in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Western companies still operating in Russia are facing harsh criticism and calls for boycotts as that country’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week.
Hundreds of foreign firms with stakes in Russia have already cut ties with the country.
But Koch Industries, owned by the influential right-wing billionaire Charles Koch, is staying, even though its interests there are relatively small compared to other Koch-owned businesses, and dwarfed by the size of other US companies that have left.
He notes that Koch “has provided financial assistance to employees and their families from Ukraine and humanitarian aid to those affected in neighboring countries.”The statement also underscores how tiny Koch Industries’ interests are in Russia.
Firms with more to lose than Koch have decided that cutting economic ties to Russia is an effective strategy, knowing that Putin has threatened to nationalize foreign assets.

     Summary: (AP) – Koch Industries is planning to continue running two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia, saying it doesn’t want to hand over the plants to the Russian government.
Dave Robertson, president and COO of Koch Industries, said Koch doesn’t want to turn the plants over to the Russian government “so it can operate and benefit from them.”Koch said if the Russian government had control of the facilities it could put their employees at greater risk.
Koch said it’s in compliance with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing its relationships and transactions in the countries where it has operations.
