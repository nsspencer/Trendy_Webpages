     Allen Robinson signs 3-year deal with Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former Bears receiver agreed to a three-year deal with the defending Super Bowl champion Rams and quarterback Matthew Stafford.
He’ll get $46.5 million with $30.7 million fully guaranteed on a three-year deal, a source confirmed to the Sun-Times.
Robinson, 28, was the Bears’ best offensive player the last four seasons and repeatedly sought a long-term deal to stay with the team.
Robinson left the Bears ranking ninth all-time in receptions (293), 11th in yards receiving (3,561) and 21st in touchdown catches (18).
Between injuries, quarterback struggles and coach Matt Nagy’s dysfunctional offense, Robinson had just 38 catches, 410 yards and one touchdown in 12 games.

     Allen Robinson to Rams: Former Bears WR signing three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have made a move for arguably the top wide receiver on the market.
According to a report from NFL Media on Wednesday, Robinson will sign a three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles.
Robinson spent the last four years with the Chicago Bears.
Prior to last season, Robinson registered back-to-back 1,100-plus yard campaigns, and totaled 255 catches for 3,151 yards and 17 scores in his first three seasons with the Bears.
He signed a three-year, $42 million deal with Chicago, then played that out and spent last season playing on the franchise tag.

     Twitter loves the Rams' signing of Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Outside of signing a few of their own free agents, the Los Angeles Rams had been relatively quiet this week.
They lost several players, including Darious Williams, Von Miller and Austin Corbett, but they joined the fun on Thursday by agreeing to a three-year deal with Allen Robinson.
It’s a three-year deal worth $46.5 million, making him the Rams’ third receiver making more than $15 million per year.
They’re now loaded at wide out, with Robinson joining Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Van Jefferson as Matthew Stafford’s top targets.
Here’s how Twitter reacted to the signing, with an overwhelmingly positive response from both Rams fans and media members who are thrilled to see Robinson finally have a capable quarterback.

     Sources -- Los Angeles Rams add WR Allen Robinson on $45M deal, still hope to re-sign Odell Beckham Jr.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams announced they had agreed to a three-year contract with Robinson but did not disclose financial terms.
The Rams still have money left over for Odell Beckham Jr. and hope to re-sign him, sources told Schefter.
The addition of Robinson comes a day after pass-rusher Von Miller decided to sign with the Buffalo Bills instead of returning to the Rams.
Before he was released by the Cleveland Browns, Beckham had 17 receptions for 232 yards and no touchdowns in six games.
In eight seasons, Robinson has 495 receptions for 6,409 yards and 40 touchdowns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams made a splash in free agency with the signing of former Chicago Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson.
It’s a three-year deal worth $45 million for Robinson, which includes $30 million guaranteed.
Robinson spent the past four seasons with the Bears, where he’s been their most consistent offensive player.
With Robinson’s departure, Chicago could see as high as a third-round compensatory pick, assuming they see another compensatory free agent depart.
Here’s what Twitter is saying about Robinson signing with the Rams:

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.
