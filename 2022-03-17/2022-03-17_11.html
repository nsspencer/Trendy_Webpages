     March Madness 2022: Tennessee basketball impresses with first-round blowout of Longwood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After winning the SEC Tournament, there was a lot of pressure on Tennessee to make a run in March Madness.
That mission got off to a good start Thursday with an 88-56 blowout of Longwood in the Round of 64.
Even though the quality of competition was not great, Tennessee did not mess around with Longwood and put the game away early.
It was an impressive showing from the Vols, who wanted to put to rest their early NCAA Tournament exit in 2021.
As Tennessee dropped the hammer on Longwood, the college basketball media was blown away by how dominant Rick Barnes' team looked.
