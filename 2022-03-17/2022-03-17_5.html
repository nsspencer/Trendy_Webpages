Back after four of the most enjoyable days in recent (and not-so-recent, if we're being honest) Iowa basketball history.
But it's time to lock in again and focus because Iowa has a job to do: beat Richmond, move on to the second round.
Waterbug point guard Jacob Gilyard (5'9", 160 lbs) averages 13.3 ppg and leads the team with 5.4 assists per game.
Also: Iowa has Keegan Murray -- and Richmond doesn't have anyone like that.

     Summary: IOWA CITY — After two straight weeks of high-end basketball that included plenty of March Madness elements — but then an entire week off after that to reset, it begs a question of the Iowa women's basketball team:Will the layoff impact Iowa in the NCAA Tournament?
Although the regular season’s end and Big Ten Tournament didn’t have the official everything-on-the-line designation the NCAA Tournament sports, Iowa had to advance through a series of stages with zero hiccups to re-position itself for the proper March Madness spot.
