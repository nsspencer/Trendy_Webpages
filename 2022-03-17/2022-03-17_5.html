     Koch Industries breaks silence on Russia to say it will continue to operate its 2 glass facilities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan., company run by right-wing billionaire Charles Koch, released a statement on its Russia operations on Wednesday, in which it said it would continue to operate its glass manufacturing facilities.
The company, which has bucked the trend of U.S. companies withdrawing or curtailing their activities in Russia following its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, said its two glass manufacturing facilities that are part of Guardian Industries, a company it acquired in 2017, employ about 600 people, and that outside of that it employs 15 individuals in Russia.
"While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what The Wall Street Journal has reported they would do)," Chief Operating Officer Dave Robertson said in a statement. "
Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good."
The company is complying with "all applicable sanctions," he added and will continue to monitor the situation.

     Summary: The attacks come as Biden for the first time publicly called Putin a “war criminal.”Oil prices: Sanctions on Russia are helping gas prices hit new highs.
The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years.
Meanwhile, in Russia, online access has been significantly curtailed by censors at home and businesses abroad.
Boycotts of Russia and campaigns in support of Ukraine have been launched from a range of industries.
How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

     Koch To Remain Invested In Russia — Staying True To Its Stalin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Pam and Russ Martens wrote on their Wall Street on Parade blog last Tuesday, even when BP, Shell and ExxonMobil(!)
stopped (or at least promised to stop) doing business in Russia, Charles Koch “has been unusually quiet about his plans for his sprawling Russian operations.”Koch Industries has three companies in Russia, an electric component producer Molex, pollution control equipment manufacturer Koch Engineered Solutions, and Guardian Industries, which makes glass and auto parts.
After all, the Koch fortune exists solely because Koch went to Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Russia to sell his services.
Jane Mayer’s Dark Money revealed that the vast fortune the Koch sons would spend on building the Tea Party was generated by their father’s build-up of Nazi Germany’s oil refining capacity.
If the GOP is looking to revive McCarthyism with Russian-money witch-hunts, maybe they should start with their own campaign coffers.
