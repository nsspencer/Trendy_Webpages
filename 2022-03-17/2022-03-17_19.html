     Walking a Tightrope, Atlanta Says Goodbye to a Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Dansby Swanson gathered the final ground ball of the World Series last November, then peeked to second base for an easy force that would have clinched the title for the Atlanta Braves.
“He means everything to this team,” Swanson said later, in the afterglow of the team’s first championship in 26 seasons.
“He’s been through good times, he’s been through the worst of times and now through the best of times.
Nobody deserves it on our team more than him.”It was hard to imagine, on that night of triumph in Houston, that Freeman would not return to Atlanta.
A second-round pick of Atlanta in the 2007 draft, he had capped his 15th professional season with a World Series victory, a year after he won his first Most Valuable Player Award.

     Dodgers place Dustin May on the 60-day injured list
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers placed Dustin May on the 60-day injured list on Thursday, clearing a space on the 40-man roster for Jimmy Nelson, whose signing was finalized.
May had Tommy John surgery last May 11, and isn’t expected to return to the majors until around the All-Star break.
Procedurally, by placing him on the 60-day IL, the earliest possible date May could be activated is June 6.
“Getting back to a good spot, strengthening my arm,” May told Watson.
He’s returning from both Tommy John surgery and right flexor tendon repair last August, so he’s a likely candidate to be placed on the 60-day injured list himself soon to make roster room, perhaps when Freddie Freeman or Hanser Alberto finalize their contracts.

     Dodgers Roster: Dustin May Placed On 60-Day Injured List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers transferred Dustin May to the 60-day injured list in order to clear a spot on their 40-man roster for the signing of Jimmy Nelson.
The move is mostly a paper transaction as May was not due to return until after the All-Star break due to still recovering from last year’s Tommy John surgery.
Dodgers re-sign Jimmy NelsonThe Dodgers re-signed Nelson to a one-year contract with a team option for the 2023 season.
His return is identical to the contract the Dodgers signed Tommy Kahnle to in December 2020 as he was on the mend from Tommy John surgery.
The Dodgers will need to create another 40-man roster spot soon to make the signing of Freddie Freeman official.

     Summary: With Freeman in the fold, the Dodgers are set to have four former MVPs on their roster.
They’re the first team to assemble such a team since, well, last season's squad.
Eight of the nine projected starters in the lineup are former All-Stars.
Will Smith, the only player not on that list, is arguably the best offensive catcher in the Majors.
He’s on his way to representing the Dodgers in the Midsummer Classic potentially as early as this season.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers are a handful of days into Spring Training and on the verge of beginning their Cactus League schedule, but the buzz around Camelback Ranch understandably is centered around Freddie Freeman and his impending arrival.
Increasing anticipation and speculation reached the finish line on Wednesday night with reports Freeman agreed to sign with the Dodgers.
Per standard process, the Dodgers won’t finalize the contract until Freeman completes his physical.
According to Andy McCullough of The Athletic, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts anticipates that taking place Thursday and having Freeman in camp the following morning:Freddie Freeman is expected to join the Dodgers tomorrow, Dave Roberts said.

What more could the Dodgers possibly need on their quest to get a second World Series win in three years?
The starting rotation is the next place that president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman should be working on.
As it stands right now, the starting rotation should be Walker Buehler, Julio Urías, Kershaw, and Andrew Heaney.
But if the Dodgers can acquire another mid-to-top rotation guy, this team might be about as perfect as a team can get.

     Summary: Dodgers fans were on edge for months during the MLB lockout, unsure of where Kershaw would sign once he was able to negotiate a new contract.
Since Kershaw is coming off an injury riddled season, his new contract is loaded with incentives based on durability.
If he makes at least 16 starts in 2022, he'll earn a $1M bonus.
In his last three 162-game regular seasons, Kershaw has averaged about 26 starts.
Clearly, Kershaw and the Dodgers saw eye-to-eye on the challenges and opportunities the veteran has in front of him.

     Three questions for Dodgers after Freddie Freeman signing, including futures of Kenley Jansen and Trevor Bauer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed free-agent first baseman Freddie Freeman to a six-year deal worth more than $160 million.
Depending on what happens with Trevor Bauer, the Dodgers could enter the season with a CBT payroll around $280 million, putting them just $10 million underneath the fourth and highest CBT tier.
The Dodgers would almost certainly have to exceed the highest luxury-tax threshold in order to bring back Jansen.
Of course, the Dodgers could just keep Lux and maintain one of the deeper position player groups in the game.
Manager Dave Roberts, for his part, doesn't expect to have Bauer in his rotation anytime soon, if ever again.

Obviously there’s been a lot of buildup and a lot of talk and a lot of anticipation as to what was going to happen.
The lineup is as good a lineup as I have ever seen.”Throughout the afternoon, Dodgers players also took turns extolling their new teammate.
“With what Freddie brings, he’s gotta be, if not the best, a top three or four hitter in the game,” Kershaw said.
Barnes, who has been behind the plate for many of those battles, said Freeman has always dominated the Dodgers’ game-planning meetings for past series against the Braves.

     Best Dodgers lineup ever? Five ways Freddie Freeman improves an already loaded team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if they weren’t already, the Dodgers’ lineup is now arguably the biggest juggernaut in the league and on paper has the chance to be one of their best ever.
Left-handed balanceBefore acquiring Freeman, the Dodgers’ best left-handed hitters were Muncy (coming off a significant elbow injury), Cody Bellinger (coming off a career-worst year) and still unproven Gavin Lux.
Lineup flexibilityWith Freeman likely locking down first base, the Dodgers now have brand new combinations for utilizing the rest of their lineup.
And when they’re all healthy, a potential lineup could look like this: Betts, Freeman, Trea Turner, Muncy, Will Smith, Justin Turner, Bellinger, AJ Pollock, Taylor.
“He means everything to this team,” Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson said.
