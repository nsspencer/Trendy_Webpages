     Hogwarts Legacy gameplay video confirms a holiday 2022 release window
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Warner Bros and Avalanche Games offered a substantial look at Hogwarts Legacy today, detailing its world, combat and narrative setting, as well as a "Holiday 2022" release window.
You won't be playing as Harry Potter or any of the other famed magic kids, nor meeting them, because Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s.
Exploring the castle itself seems to be a huge part of Hogwarts Legacy.
Magicking goblins to death will play a big part of Hogwarts Legacy, as the narrative is centred around a goblin rebellion, helped along by "Dark wizard Victor Rookwood."
J.K. Rowling, author of the original Harry Potter novels, has come under fire multiple times since 2020 for making transphobic remarks.

     Hogwarts Legacy Gameplay Trailer Shows Off Centaurs, Trolls, and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hogwarts Legacy gives its first major look at gameplay, and it appears that it will be bringing some meat for players to chew on.
Luckily, Hogwarts Legacy is on the horizon, transporting players into the most ambitious video game depiction the series has ever seen.
During today's Hogwarts Legacy State of Play, fans got to see roughly 14 minutes of new gameplay, and it's looking pretty meaty.
Kicking off the trailer, fans get to see some of the mythical creatures they'll encounter throughout their journey, including staples like Centaurs and Trolls.
WB Games has been adamant that Hogwarts Legacy will release this year, but any delay – even a small one – would almost certainly knock it to 2023.

     Hogwarts Legacy’s big gameplay trailer reveals holiday 2022 release date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s, about 100 years before Harry Potter enrolls.
In Hogwarts Legacy, the player character is a new wizard or witch, except they’re starting as a fifth-year student.
Though the game fits into the overall Harry Potter canon, creator J.K. Rowling is not involved in Hogwarts Legacy’s creation.
Immediately after announcing Hogwarts Legacy in September 2020, last Warner Bros. Games distanced the project from her in light of Rowling’s public, and transphobic, remarks on gender identity.
So the reception Hogwarts Legacy gets from the general public will be closely watched.

     JK Rowling's Anti-Transgender Stance And Hogwarts Legacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While GCFs will often publicly state they only believe "some" trans women will target cisgender women, their language implicates all trans women, often only discussing trans women in such contexts.
While GCFs will often publicly state they only believe "some" trans women will target cisgender women, their language implicates all trans women, often only discussing trans women in such contexts.
In 2018, Australian GCF Shelia Jeffrey described trans women to UK parliament as "parasites," language that frames trans people as subhuman.
All of this finally brings us back to the Harry Potter franchise and Hogwarts Legacy.
If you would like to help support transgender causes, please consider donating to the National Center for Transgender Equality or the Transgender Law Center.
