     6 takeaways from Rams' deal with WR Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams missed out on re-signing Von Miller in free agency, losing him to the Bills.
But one day later, they bounced back by striking a big deal of their own – with a wide receiver.
They agreed to a three-year, $46.5 million deal with Allen Robinson, a shocking signing by the receiver-rich Rams.
Wideout wasn’t viewed as a major priority, but the Rams can never have enough talent at the position, apparently.
Here are six takeaways from the addition of Robinson, which will become official once he puts pen to paper.

     By joining Los Angeles Rams, Allen Robinson II finally gets to play with a top-shelf QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES -- If you heard a giddy laugh sometime Thursday afternoon, it was probably coming from new Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Allen Robinson.
The Rams might provide the best place for Robinson to do all three of those things.
Add in Jefferson, who had 50 receptions for 802 yards and six touchdowns last season, and the Rams arguably have the best receiving unit in the NFL.
The NFL saw what a change of scenery to Los Angeles did for Stafford and Beckham last season.
It'll get a chance to see what it does for Robinson this season.

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.

     Sean McVay’s offense receives more help as Rams agree to deal with Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At midseason, the Rams added star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to complement a receiving corps that included Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Van Jefferson.
On Thursday, McVay got another weapon: The Rams agreed to terms with free-agent receiver Allen Robinson, an eight-year veteran who has amassed more than 1,000-yards receiving in a season three times.
Kupp this season will carry a cap number of $18.7 million and Woods $15.7 million, according to overthecap.com.
He and fellow Rams receiver Robert Woods are recovering from knee injuries.
If Robinson similarly blends, McVay has a chance to expand what is already one of the NFL’s most dynamic offenses.
