     Los Angeles Rams add WR Allen Robinson on $45M deal, still hope to re-sign Odell Beckham Jr.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams announced they had agreed to a three-year contract with Robinson but did not disclose financial terms.
The Rams still have money left over for Odell Beckham Jr. and hope to re-sign him, sources told Schefter.
After signing Robinson, the Rams began receiving calls about the availability of Woods, who is now a prime trade candidate, league sources told Schefter.
In 2020, Chicago put Robinson in the slot on 29.6% of his snaps, which led to the receiver amassing 2.02 yards per route run.
In eight seasons, Robinson has 495 receptions for 6,409 yards and 40 touchdowns.

     Allen Robinson's size and physicality make him a great fit with Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All three do everything very well, from blocking to catching short passes to eluding tackles after the catch, but none of them are particularly great at winning contested catches and 50-50 balls.
And thatâ€™s why Robinson is such a great fit with the Rams.
Just look at some of these contested catches heâ€™s made in the NFL.
Allen Robinson: 71 contested catches since 2018 Most among WRs ðŸ’ª pic.twitter.com/gQfLHrXcuf â€” PFF (@PFF) January 20, 2022While Kupp and Woods win by generating separation, Robinson wins by making contested catches.
That ability is unique to the Ramsâ€™ receivers, and will be a difference-maker next season.

     Sean McVayâ€™s offense receives more help as Rams agree to deal with Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At midseason, the Rams added star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to complement a receiving corps that included Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Van Jefferson.
On Thursday, McVay got another weapon: The Rams agreed to terms with free-agent receiver Allen Robinson, an eight-year veteran who has amassed more than 1,000-yards receiving in a season three times.
Kupp this season will carry a cap number of $18.7 million and Woods $15.7 million, according to overthecap.com.
He and fellow Rams receiver Robert Woods are recovering from knee injuries.
If Robinson similarly blends, McVay has a chance to expand what is already one of the NFLâ€™s most dynamic offenses.

     Bearsâ€™ free-agent WR search starts as Allen Robinsonâ€™s ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen Robinson finally found a team willing to pay him â€” and a high-level quarterback to throw him the ball.
The Rams reportedly wonâ€™t let the Robinson signing keep them from pursuing Beckham, who tore his ACL in the Super Bowl.
Robinson will have Matthew Stafford, by far the best quarterback with whom he has ever played, throwing him the ball.
Neither player will prevent the Bears from signing more receivers â€” or drafting one next month.
Running back Damien Williams, who scored three touchdowns for the Bears last year, agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Falcons on Thursday, a source confirmed, while former Bears offensive lineman Alex Bars joined the Raiders.

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.
