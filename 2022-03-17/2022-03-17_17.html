     Walking a Tightrope, Atlanta Says Goodbye to a Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Dansby Swanson gathered the final ground ball of the World Series last November, then peeked to second base for an easy force that would have clinched the title for the Atlanta Braves.
“He means everything to this team,” Swanson said later, in the afterglow of the team’s first championship in 26 seasons.
“He’s been through good times, he’s been through the worst of times and now through the best of times.
Nobody deserves it on our team more than him.”It was hard to imagine, on that night of triumph in Houston, that Freeman would not return to Atlanta.
A second-round pick of Atlanta in the 2007 draft, he had capped his 15th professional season with a World Series victory, a year after he won his first Most Valuable Player Award.

     Dodgers: Full Details of Clayton Kershaw's Contract Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers fans were on edge for months during the MLB lockout, unsure of where Kershaw would sign once he was able to negotiate a new contract.
Since Kershaw is coming off an injury riddled season, his new contract is loaded with incentives based on durability.
If he makes at least 16 starts in 2022, he'll earn a $1M bonus.
In his last three 162-game regular seasons, Kershaw has averaged about 26 starts.
Clearly, Kershaw and the Dodgers saw eye-to-eye on the challenges and opportunities the veteran has in front of him.

He followed his MVP-winning campaign from 2020 with yet another excellent effort, culminating in his exclamation point on the club's World Series victory.
The Dodgers Got a Good OneSave for maybe "Citizen Kane is a good movie, actually," there indeed might not be a more lukewarm take than "Freddie Freeman is good, actually."
World Series or BustEvery team has potential pitfalls, and that's no different even with this stacked Dodgers squad.
So, all Freeman and the Dodgers have to do now is nothing that either party hasn't done before: Go win some games.

     Three questions for Dodgers after Freddie Freeman signing, including futures of Kenley Jansen and Trevor Bauer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed free-agent first baseman Freddie Freeman to a six-year deal worth more than $160 million.
Depending on what happens with Trevor Bauer, the Dodgers could enter the season with a CBT payroll around $280 million, putting them just $10 million underneath the fourth and highest CBT tier.
The Dodgers would almost certainly have to exceed the highest luxury-tax threshold in order to bring back Jansen.
Of course, the Dodgers could just keep Lux and maintain one of the deeper position player groups in the game.
Manager Dave Roberts, for his part, doesn't expect to have Bauer in his rotation anytime soon, if ever again.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent first baseman and Orange County native Freddie Freeman has agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Dodgers on a six-year contract worth $162 million, report Jeff Passan and Kylie McDaniel of ESPN.
Freeman, 32 years old, initially seemed like a lock to return to the Atlanta Braves following last fall's World Series victory.
Freeman in the end got that sixth year from the Dodgers, and he'll be under contract through his age-37 campaign.
Freeman batted .300/.393/.503 (133 OPS+) with 31 home runs last season, running his career line to .295/.384/.509 (138 OPS+).
The Dodgers can certainly fit Freeman in the lineup, particularly now that the universal DH is in force.

     Best Dodgers lineup ever? Five ways Freddie Freeman improves an already loaded team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if they weren’t already, the Dodgers’ lineup is now arguably the biggest juggernaut in the league and on paper has the chance to be one of their best ever.
Left-handed balanceBefore acquiring Freeman, the Dodgers’ best left-handed hitters were Muncy (coming off a significant elbow injury), Cody Bellinger (coming off a career-worst year) and still unproven Gavin Lux.
Lineup flexibilityWith Freeman likely locking down first base, the Dodgers now have brand new combinations for utilizing the rest of their lineup.
And when they’re all healthy, a potential lineup could look like this: Betts, Freeman, Trea Turner, Muncy, Will Smith, Justin Turner, Bellinger, AJ Pollock, Taylor.
“He means everything to this team,” Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The wait finally ended as the Los Angeles Dodgers finalized a six-year, $162 million contract with first baseman Freddie Freeman , a source confirmed to The Athletic.Freeman leaves the Braves after 12 seasons, an MVP award in 2020, and a World Series title in 2021.The Braves signed first baseman Matt Olson to an eight-year, $168 million contract extension on Tuesday after acquiring him in a trade with the Oakland Athletics the day before, replacing Freeman at first base.
Olson, 27, hit 39 homers with a 153 OPS+ for the A’s in 2021, and was a Gold Glove winner in 2018 and 2019.The Dodgers (106-56) finished 2021 in second place in the NL West, losing in the NLCS to the Braves.The Athletic’s panel of experts weighs in on what this deal means for Freeman and the Dodgers, and what losing Freeman means for the Braves.Fabian Ardaya, Dodgers writerThe second Olson landed in Atlanta, this felt like the most logical conclusion.
This is the Dodgers as they’ve operated under Andrew Friedman — being opportunistic with their ample resources whenever the rare, impact-making player suddenly became available.
