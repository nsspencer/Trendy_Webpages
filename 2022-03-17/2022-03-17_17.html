     Kentucky vs. Saint Peter’s time, TV channel, online stream, odds and predictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, the Cats will take on Saint Peter’s from Jersey City (NJ) at 7:10 pm ET Thursday night inside Indianapolis’ Gainbridge Fieldhouse.
Saint Peter’s got it done when it mattered most, beating Monmouth 60-54 on Saturday in the MAAC Championship to punch their ticket into the Big Dance.
This will be Saint Peter’s fourth overall NCAA Tournament appearance, and the first time since 2011.
Making shots may not be as easy as you might think against a MAAC team like Saint Peter’s.
Bottom line: Kentucky should be able to feed Oscar Tshiebwe early and often while overwhelming Saint Peter’s with their size.
