     Celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with a recipe for Irish soda bread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our favorite way to eat soda bread is warm and slathered with cold, sweet butter.
(Credit: Mary Lydon)Traditional Irish Soda Bread consists of flour, salt, baking soda and buttermilk.
The baking soda needs the acid of the buttermilk.
But, over the years, baking powder replaced baking soda for many bakers, and the acid of the buttermilk was no longer required, although many still like it for the taste and texture.
The Society for the Preservation of Irish Soda Bread — no kidding — tells us: “The earliest reference to using soda ash in baking bread seems to be credited to American Indians using it to leaven their bread.” And, “The oldest reference to a published Soda Bread recipe, County Down, Ireland, Nov. 1836.”There are endless versions, including white and brown (whole-wheat and molasses), with added raisins, candied orange peel and caraway seeds.

     How To Make Irish Soda Bread That's Oven-Ready in 10 Minutes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I look forward to my corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes every year — but nothing beats a slice of buttery Irish soda bread to top it all off.
My family and I always buy several loaves of soda bread from various bakeries and farm stands in search of the best one.
This year, however, I decided to try something a little different; I discovered a recipe for Irish soda bread that’s ready to pop in the oven in 10 minutes.
Having never made soda bread before, I was quite excited to find such an easy and classic recipe.
Biting into a thick slice of this Irish soda bread was heaven!

     This quick soda bread takes an Irish staple and enriches it with savory salmon for St. Patrick’s Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The basic traditional Irish soda bread calls for flour, buttermilk, baking soda and salt.
The acid in the buttermilk reacts with the baking soda to create the “rise” or leavening of the bread sans yeast.
This is a savory twist with smoked salmon and fresh chives or dill, with an egg and some grated cheese for richness.
Soda bread tends to dry out rather quickly so it’s best to enjoy it freshly baked and warm.
Soda bread dries out quickly, so enjoy freshly-baked and warm or toasted the next day.
