     NCAA Tournament 2022: What Vermont coach John Becker said about Arkansas Razorbacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vermont coach John Becker expects his team to bring their best to Thursday's NCAA Tournament first-round showdown with fourth-seeded Arkansas, a group that comes into the Big Dance red-hot after nearly winning the SEC this season.
The Catamounts are streaking too, winners of eight consecutive games including four straight by at least 19 points.
Becker has taken Vermont to the NCAA Tournament three times previously, but hasn't advanced past the opening round in any of those trips.
Winning by I think 36.5 points and coming in really confidently, but know we have our hands full against one of the best teams in the country against Arkansas," Becker said this week.
Here's what Becker said about Vermont's challenge against Arkansas and what the Razorbacks bring to the table as one of the NCAA Tournament's strongest No.
