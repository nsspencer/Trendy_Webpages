     Iowa fans upset with officiating late in upset loss to Richmond
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12 Richmond’s 67–63 upset over No.
5 Iowa on Thursday, several key missed Hawkeyes chances appeared to come down to calls from the officials—or lack thereof.
Iowa Fans were left upset with the officiating when referees decided to let the game play on multiple times the last minute of the game when fouls could have been called.
The biggest controversy came from a Kris Murray three-point attempt with less than a minute to play.
Murray missed the shot, and the Hawkeyes remained down 60–57.

Back after four of the most enjoyable days in recent (and not-so-recent, if we're being honest) Iowa basketball history.
But it's time to lock in again and focus because Iowa has a job to do: beat Richmond, move on to the second round.
Waterbug point guard Jacob Gilyard (5'9", 160 lbs) averages 13.3 ppg and leads the team with 5.4 assists per game.
Also: Iowa has Keegan Murray -- and Richmond doesn't have anyone like that.
