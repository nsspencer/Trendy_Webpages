     Koch Industries breaks silence on Russia to say it will continue to operate its 2 glass facilities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan., company run by right-wing billionaire Charles Koch, released a statement on its Russia operations on Wednesday, in which it said it would continue to operate its glass manufacturing facilities.
The company, which has bucked the trend of U.S. companies withdrawing or curtailing their activities in Russia following its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, said its two glass manufacturing facilities that are part of Guardian Industries, a company it acquired in 2017, employ about 600 people, and that outside of that it employs 15 individuals in Russia.
"While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what The Wall Street Journal has reported they would do)," Chief Operating Officer Dave Robertson said in a statement. "
Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good."
The company is complying with "all applicable sanctions," he added and will continue to monitor the situation.

Russia's attack has destroyed several buildings in Irpin, Ukraine (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Koch Industries' infamous links to StalinThe outrage following the Koch Industries' decision to stay put in Russia brought forth the company's rather forgotten links to the Soviet Union.
Stalin had plans to lead an industrial revolution in Russia by selling oil to the European export market.
Koch declared that "socialism is the precursor to communism" and described the Soviet Union as "a land of hunger, misery, and terror."

https://t.co/ec3e3axBC5 — Jane Mayer (@JaneMayerNYer) March 16, 2022Arguing against sanctionsPolitical groups supported by Charles Koch, the right-wing billionaire who is chairman and CEO of Koch Industries, oppose broad economic sanctions against Russia, according to Popular Information, a left-leaning newsletter run by Judd Legum.
Stand Together, a nonprofit founded by Charles Koch, instead "supports targeted sanctions against Russia in response to its immoral invasion of Ukraine.
Advancing that view, Ruger also shared on social media a Reason video entitled "Why Russian sanctions will fail."
