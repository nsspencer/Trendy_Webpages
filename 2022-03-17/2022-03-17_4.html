     How to Catch Today's Gonzaga Basketball Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And as expected, conference championship week was no different, as the madness had already begun before March had even arrived.
As the initiator of the nation‚Äôs best offense, Nembhard has quietly been one of the best point guards in college basketball this season.
During Gonzaga‚Äôs tournament run last season, Timme averaged 20.3 points per game on nearly 65% shooting from the floor.
The Gaels are the prime example of how to combat Gonzaga with their physical yet disciplined defense and balanced approach on offense.
It can‚Äôt turn into a game of ‚Äúyour turn, my turn‚Äù on offense, or it‚Äôll be a bitter end to what has been a stellar season.
