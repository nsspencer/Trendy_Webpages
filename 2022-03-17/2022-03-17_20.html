     'Jujutsu Kaisen 0' Cast Interview With Yuta and Rika
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I recently got the chance to chat with Kayleigh McKee and Anairis Quiñones about Jujutsu Kaisen 0.
The two, who have worked together on other projects before, are the film’s main protagonists, Yuta Okkotsu and Rika Orimoto.
McKee and Quiñones are newcomers to the franchise, as most of the cast is of characters we’ve already met in the anime.
What’s really interesting about the movie is that as tragic and unsettling as this is, the dynamic between Yuta and Rika is actually pretty inspiring.
As I said in my review, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a hauntingly beautiful look at how we deal with grief.

     Summary: Michael OrdoñaLos Angeles Times (TNS)To prep for watching "Jujutsu Kaisen 0," the theatrical prequel to the massively successful "Jujutsu Kaisen" anime TV series and manga, this reviewer consulted an expert: his fangirl daughter.
So we've got some awfully familiar hallmarks of this category of the shonen (action-heavy manga aimed at boys) genre: Kid at a school for monster-fighters struggling with his growing power, alliances with classmates, important mentor figure — check, check, check.
While you can't swing a dead curse without hitting a genre trope, the film is its own jam — not surprising, but freaky and funny at times, and beautifully rendered.
), "Jujutsu Kaisen 0" does not disappoint.

     Summary: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is set to release in international theatres this week, we got the chance to talk to the fantastic English voice cast about their new movie.
HITC recently got the opportunity to interview the English voice cast for the upcoming Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie and was able to pick their brains about the fascinating approaches they had to MAPPA’s latest masterpiece.
On the one hand, the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 voice cast have to continue the growth and development that made their characters so fantastic to watch in the main series.
“I knew that Yuji was an amazing main character and I knew that Yuta was sort of the first step main character type of thing.
These two characters bounce off each other, emotionally and tonally, throughout Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in a fantastic performance from both the voice actors; but what is this dynamic like for two larger-than-life characters like Gojo and Suguru?
