     Xavi amazed by Pedri goal during Galatasaray vs Barcelona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Xavi Hernandez has issued his verdict on Pedri excellent goal during Barcelona’s Europa League win over Galatasaray.
Galatasaray took the lead on the night and on aggregate with Marcao’s 28th minute effort, and Barca had to turn things around.
They levelled the score through an unbelievably Pedri goal which saw the midfielder dummy his way past two defenders before finding the net.
The goal was a brilliant one, and it amazed his boss, Xavi, too.
He told Movistar after the game: “I saw Pedri’s dribble, I need to see it again, but it was an amazing goal!

     Summary: Janusz Michallik rates the goal-scoring performance of Barcelona's Pedri in their win over Galatasaray.
(1:27)Barcelona came from a goal down to beat Galatasaray 2-1 at the NEF Stadyumu to advance to the quarterfinals of the Europa League on Thursday.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put Barca ahead three minutes into the second half with a close-range header after two magnificent stops by Galatasaray goalkeeper Inaki Pena, who is on loan from the Spanish club.
Barca ran down the clock as Galatasaray pushed for an equaliser, infuriating the home crowd who started throwing bottles and plastic cups onto the field.
The referee stopped the game for a few minutes while the Galatasaray players tried to calm their fans down.

     Galatasaray 1-2 Barcelona: Player Ratings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona marched into the Nef Stadium with a fair bit of idea of what to expect from Galatasaray and the home crowd.
What they had in mind and what was presented must have differed, though, because Barcelona, for the majority of that first half, looked absolutely rattled.
Jordi Alba and Ferran Torres looked nervy as well, and it’s never a good sign watching Sergio Busquets misplace passes you expect him to make with a blindfold on.
Adama Traore: 4.75Awfully predictable throughout the first half, Adama was the first player to be subbed off.
Clement Lenglet: 7The Frenchman came on for Pique and had quite the task at hand with the game at 1-2.
