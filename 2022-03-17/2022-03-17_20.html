     UConn men’s basketball team falls to Teddy Allen, New Mexico State in NCAA tourney’s first round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BUFFALO, N.Y. — Teddy Allen did his best Ray Allen impression, and just like that, the UConn men’s basketball team’s season is over.
“We knew it was gonna be a really, really hard game,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said after emerging from an emotional locker room.
“We wanted him to take tough shots, but he just happened to make more tough shots than he’s used to,” Martin said.
Martin got the Allen assignment after Jackson’s second and simply wasn’t able to contain him — though Allen did hit some tough shots.
When Allen hit a jumper with 39 seconds left before the break, New Mexico State had a 32-22 lead.
