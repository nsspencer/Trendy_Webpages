     Kenny Smith Not Concerned With Chet Holmgren's Skinny Frame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImageChet Holmgren is skinny, but that doesn’t bother Kenny Smith.
Smith explains why his frame shouldn’t be a concern heading into the NBA.
He’s a dominant force that can stretch the floor at 7-feet tall, but the first thing people notice about him is his skinny frame.
Kenny Smith, however, doesn’t think his weight should worry NBA scouts.
Those skillsets will far outweigh his skinny frame at the NBA level, according to Smith.
