     UConn men’s basketball team falls to Teddy Allen, New Mexico State in NCAA tourney’s first round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BUFFALO, N.Y. — Teddy Allen did his best Ray Allen impression, and just like that, the UConn men’s basketball team’s season is over.
“We knew it was gonna be a really, really hard game,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said after emerging from an emotional locker room.
“We wanted him to take tough shots, but he just happened to make more tough shots than he’s used to,” Martin said.
Martin got the Allen assignment after Jackson’s second and simply wasn’t able to contain him — though Allen did hit some tough shots.
When Allen hit a jumper with 39 seconds left before the break, New Mexico State had a 32-22 lead.

     How New Mexico State’s Teddy Allen ended UConn men’s basketball season: ‘Tough way to go out’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He scored 37 points, the most ever by a UConn opponent in an NCAA Tournament victory, including his team’s final 15.

On Wednesday, Hurley called Allen “a bucket.”On Thursday, he was 10 buckets and 13 free throws that ended UConn’s season.
The season was built around winning in the NCAA Tournament, at least one game.
“I think these guys have had a couple of really, really good seasons to get this program back in a really good spot, but we played poorly in the NCAA Tournament.

“Like she was his own kid,” said Mario Jimenez, who attended Bunnell High in Stratford, Class of 2003, but moved to Florida as a teenager.
But the team’s recent interactions with the Jimenez Family — the warmth shown by those in and around the program — represent something much more meaningful and impactful.
“Dan and Andrea treated us like we were family,” Mario said.
She’s a regular churchgoer and loves the Pittsburgh Steelers and UConn basketball.
