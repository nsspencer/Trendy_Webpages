     The Worm Moon, the last full moon of winter 2022, rises this Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The full moon technically lasts just an instant, when the moon , sun and Earth line up, in that order, on an invisible 180-degree line, according to NASA .
The March moon goes by many traditional names, according to the Maine Farmer's Almanac, which began publishing Native American moon names for each month of the year beginning in the 1930s.
Tribes living among maple trees favored the names Sap Moon or Sugar Moon, as early spring was the time for tapping maple trees for their sweet syrup, according to NASA.
Farther south, Native American tribes called the March full moon the Worm Moon, as the thawing snow often reveals a trove of earthworm casts (that is, nutrient-rich worm poop made of digested soil).
In Christianity, the moon is called the Lenten Moon if it is the last full moon of winter (which this week's full moon is), or the Paschal Moon if it is the first full moon of spring.

     Is the March 2022 full moon tonight? When the ‘wolf moon’ peaks and how moon name meanings gained traction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In recent years, it has also led to moon names infiltrating pop culture, with this month’s full moon dubbed the “snow moon” – here’s everything you need to know.
March’s full moon has come to be known as the “Worm Moon” in some quarters, as per the American Farmer’s Almanac, which has apparently been designated the gold standard for such matters.
Others, such as the “wolf moon,” aren’t – the tribe apparently referred to January as “long moon month”.
According to Ms Redish, different tribes used different calendars, and a range of calendars seem to have been swiped for the popularly used names, while some of the popular monikers are essentially fabrications.
The Farmer’s Almanac says its names “come from a number of places, including Native American, Colonial American and European sources”.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The March full moon, known as the worm moon, will be at its peak at 3:18 a.m.
This moon will appear larger to viewers because of the "moon illusion," according to the Old Farmer's Almanac .
By comparing these reference points to the moon, our brain tricks us into thinking the moon is bigger.
Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun's light can be damaging to the eye.
A lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align, and the moon passes into Earth's shadow.
