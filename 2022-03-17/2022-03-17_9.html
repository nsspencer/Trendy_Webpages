     UCLA Bruins sign men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to 6-year deal through 2027-28 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UCLA Bruins, after reaching the Final Four last season for the first time in more than a decade, signed men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to a new six-year contract through the 2027-28 season, it was announced Thursday.
The deal signifies a strong commitment from both sides, as Cronin drew interest from multiple job openings during the latest cycle.
The six-year deal and bump in compensation should quiet potential suitors in the immediate future and set a path for Cronin to be at UCLA for a significant stretch.
"I believe we have created a culture of success and competitive greatness at UCLA," Cronin said in a statement.
Cronin, 50, has averaged 25.1 wins per year over the past 12 seasons, which includes his successful stint at Cincinnati.

     UCLA Men's Basketball Beats Akron in Tight NCAA Tournament Opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4 seed UCLA men's basketball (26-7, 15-5 Pac-12) is no Cinderella this time around, coming into the weekend favored to make the Sweet 16 or beyond.
Jaquez hit a couple more free throws, but turned it over before the buzzer as UCLA went into the break down 26-25.
That's when Riley went up and got a block at the rim with his trailing hand, setting up the clinching free throws for Juzang.
UCLA went from getting yelled at in the huddle to trotting off the court with smiles on their faces, and they will get back to work Saturday against No.

     Plaschke: UCLA finds mojo just in time before ugly tradition repeating itself
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ugliest of UCLA tradition dictates that they would have lost.
It has seemed to be in the DNA of recent UCLA basketball coaches to blow an NCAA first-round gimme.
He’s filled Pauley Pavilion, given the Bruins citywide buzz, and basically made UCLA basketball feel like UCLA basketball again.
Then, 30 minutes before the UCLA tipoff, another Bruins victory could be heard in the cheering that filled the Moda Center.
On the play after Cronin called a timeout, the Bruins lost the ball on a 24-second violation, and how often has that happened?
