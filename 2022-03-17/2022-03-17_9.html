     'Sustainable' funds are no more green than traditional products, study finds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/StaffLONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Investment funds that market themselves as sustainable under European rules get similar levels of "green revenues" through the companies they invest in as traditional funds, according to a new study published on Thursday.
So-called "green revenue" is the percentage of sales generated from products that benefit the environment such as with cleaner water or contribute to mitigating climate change.
Clarity found that for Article 8 funds, 3.9% of their revenue through the portfolio companies they own can be classified as green, similar to the 3.1% share for Article 6 products.
Funds in the smaller pool of Article 9 had 15% of revenue as green.
"Article 8 funds are defined as 'promoting E or S characteristics', which is a vague term.
