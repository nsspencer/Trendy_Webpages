     UCLA Bruins sign men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to 6-year deal through 2027-28 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UCLA Bruins, after reaching the Final Four last season for the first time in more than a decade, signed men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to a new six-year contract through the 2027-28 season, it was announced Thursday.
The deal signifies a strong commitment from both sides, as Cronin drew interest from multiple job openings during the latest cycle.
The six-year deal and bump in compensation should quiet potential suitors in the immediate future and set a path for Cronin to be at UCLA for a significant stretch.
"I believe we have created a culture of success and competitive greatness at UCLA," Cronin said in a statement.
Cronin, 50, has averaged 25.1 wins per year over the past 12 seasons, which includes his successful stint at Cincinnati.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4 seed UCLA men's basketball (26-7, 15-5 Pac-12) is no Cinderella this time around, coming into the weekend favored to make the Sweet 16 or beyond.
Jaquez hit a couple more free throws, but turned it over before the buzzer as UCLA went into the break down 26-25.
That's when Riley went up and got a block at the rim with his trailing hand, setting up the clinching free throws for Juzang.
UCLA went from getting yelled at in the huddle to trotting off the court with smiles on their faces, and they will get back to work Saturday against No.
