     UCLA Bruins sign men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to 6-year deal through 2027-28 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UCLA Bruins, after reaching the Final Four last season for the first time in more than a decade, signed men's basketball coach Mick Cronin to a new six-year contract through the 2027-28 season, it was announced Thursday.
The deal signifies a strong commitment from both sides, as Cronin drew interest from multiple job openings during the latest cycle.
The six-year deal and bump in compensation should quiet potential suitors in the immediate future and set a path for Cronin to be at UCLA for a significant stretch.
"I believe we have created a culture of success and competitive greatness at UCLA," Cronin said in a statement.
Cronin, 50, has averaged 25.1 wins per year over the past 12 seasons, which includes his successful stint at Cincinnati.

     Summary: AKRON, Ohio — The reigning MAC champion Akron Zips head out to Portland for the first round of the NCAA tournament as they battle UCLA.
Read some of what Terry Pluto of cleveland.com wrote about the stories of the Akron team that made it to the NCAA tournament.
It’s a good question when it comes to the Akron Zips emerging as winners from the Mid-American Conference men’s basketball tournament last weekend at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.
Can you believe these Zips are headed to the NCAA tournament in Portland, where they will face UCLA Thursday night?
Then they finished the regular season winning five MAC games in a row.

     Summary: Only hours before his team’s NCAA tournament opener, the UCLA basketball coach was rewarded Thursday with a new six-year contract that’s expected to make him the highest-paid coach in the Pac-12 Conference.
“Mick is the right leader for our program because he knows what it means to represent the four letters, he won’t settle for less than being an elite program, and he wins with integrity.
“I believe we have created a culture of success and competitive greatness at UCLA,” Cronin said in a statement.
Primarily known as a strong defensive coach, Cronin’s current team is elite on both sides of the ball, ranking No.
UCLA led the Pac-12 in scoring defense (64.8 points per game) while also committing the fewest turnovers (9.2 per game).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, it has been 27 years since the last time UCLA men's basketball won an NCAA tournament.
A Sweet 16 matchup with Baylor is the real crux of the tournament for the Bruins.
Entering the Sweet 16 would be a success for UCLA in just their second tournament appearance under coach Mick Cronin, and in a highly competitive 2022 field on top of that.
Where the Bruins’ tournament can really start or end would be with Baylor — a matchup which would be reminiscent of UCLA’s battles with fellow No.
