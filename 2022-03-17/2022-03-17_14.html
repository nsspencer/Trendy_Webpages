     Pittsburgh Steelers release LB Joe Schobert after adding Myles Jack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Steelers released veteran linebacker Joe Schobert on Thursday, a day after a source told ESPN that Pittsburgh had agreed to a two-year contract with linebacker Myles Jack.
The Steelers will save $7.8 million on their salary cap by releasing Schobert.
Jack agreed to a two-year, $16 million contract on Wednesday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Steelers acquired Schobert in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars before last season.
For his career, Schobert has 661 tackles, 11 sacks, 10 interceptions and 10 forced fumbles in 93 games.

     Chance to win enticed inside linebacker Myles Jack to sign with Steelers in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Tomlin didn’t have to say much to convince free-agent linebacker Myles Jack to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
“Once he said that, it was a no-brainer.”After being surprised that Jacksonville released him after six seasons, Jack found employment with the Steelers about 24 hours later.
It was the opposite in Jacksonville, where his only taste of winning came in 2017 when the Jaguars went 10-6 and upset the Steelers in the divisional round.
In his five other seasons with Jacksonville, the Jaguars went a combined 18-63 and were 4-29 the past two years.
But Jack was released amid a spending spree by the Jaguars, whose four-year, $57 million deal with free-agent linebacker Foye Oluokun made him expendable.

     Myles Jack Says This Phone Call With Mike Tomlin Sealed Deal for Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers made plenty of noise during the early portion of free agency, but as things started to quiet down, they added one more splash.
The Steelers signed inside linebacker Myles Jack to a two-year contract, which adds a 26-year-old to the mix with Devin Bush.
Coming off back-to-back 100 tackle seasons, Jack's efforts are expected to be high, but head coach Mike Tomlin already knew that.
Jack said a phone call from the Steelers head coach is what sealed the deal for the Steelers.
Wednesday they're saying the Steelers want to talk to you and they're very very interested.
