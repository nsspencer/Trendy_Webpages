There's people that don't want to fight, there's people that do want to fight, and there's people that are looking for a fight.
And I'm very, very, very proud of them.”While Marquette’s emotions seemingly did in the Golden Eagles, that was hardly the case for North Carolina.
It was the second-largest NCAA Tournament halftime lead for the Tar Heels in program history, per school officials.
The 13 total three-pointers scored by the Tar Heels Thursday set a school single-game tournament record.

     UNC gets easy NCAA tournament vs Marquette, will face Baylor | Raleigh News &amp; Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coach Hubert Davis accomplished in his first NCAA tournament game something North Carolina didn’t do in three previous tries — beat a Shaka Smart-coached team.
9 seed Marquette 95-63 in Thursday’s first round, which was the largest margin of victory in an 8-9 seed game in NCAA tournament history.
The Heels’ 53-25 halftime lead was their biggest in the NCAA tournament since leading Marquette 40-15 in the 2011 Sweet 16.
It was the first time UNC had two players with at least five 3s in the same NCAA tournament game.
“It’d be nice if they actually looked at specific stats in terms of how they defended guys throughout the season,” Davis said.
