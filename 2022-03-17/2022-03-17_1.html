6 Colorado State Rams, which happens to be about as favorable of a draw as the maize and blue could have asked for.
Colorado State is no pushover, as this squad earned its seed with solid wins and a good offense.
Without Jones, Michigan is really going to need to have one of its good games from behind the arc.
Watch the offensive rebounds as well, as Colorado State has been willing to let opponents clean up their own glass.
