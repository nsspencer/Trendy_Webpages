     Why Chicago dyes its river green for St. Patrick's Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) For the last 60 years, enterprising Chicagoans have dyed the city's river a vibrant green in honor of St. Patrick's Day.
Thousands of residents turn up to watch the Chicago River light up for the holiday, a tradition so popular it's inspired cities nationwide to color their own waterways.
This year's celebrations were a welcome return to form for Chicago, which canceled previous St. Patrick's Day parades due to the pandemic.
In 1962, members of the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local Union who were feeling festive dumped 100 pounds of that dye into the Chicago River, which turned it green for an entire week, per the Illinois Office of TourismThe union has since perfected its viridescent formula, and these days, it only dyes Chicago's waterways for a few hours on a Saturday on or before St. Patrick's Day, when Chicago's St. Patrick's Day Parade is held.
The Chicago River has been dyed green for St. Patrick's Day since 1962.

     Summary: The St. Patrick's Day Parade has returned to Manhattan's Fifth Avenue after a two-year pandemic hiatus.
Revelers and marchers were arriving hours before the 11 a.m. start time on Thursday, despite the gloomy weather.
Morris Kenneally flew in from Ireland for the celebration, and gave New York some props for the parade.
"We were meant to go here two years ago, COVID shut everything down, but we got here in the end."
One parade official called it “the biggest public event in the world since the pandemic."

     Sea of green in NYC as St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sea of green descended on New York City on Thursday as the nation’s largest and oldest St. Patrick’s Day Parade returned in full for the first time since COVID-19 shut it down two years ago.
When the pandemic unleashed in March 2020, the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was among the first major NYC events to be canceled — marking the first time in the parade’s history that it was shut down.
Others traveled from out-of-state solely for the famed St. Patrick’s Day experience.
“It’s a great place to be on a great day.
Everybody’s Irish on St. Patrick’s day.”Forced to cancel in 2020 and 2021, the parade’s organizers had tried to keep the St. Patrick’s Day tradition going by quietly holding smaller processions around sunrise when the streets of Manhattan were empty.

     Summary: People wait at Fifth Avenue the start of the St. Patrick's Day Parade, Thursday, March 17, 2022, in New York.
“I love St. Patrick’s Day.
The South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day celebration made a big comeback in Savannah, Georgia, where Irish immigrants and their descendants have held parades since 1824.
“This St. Patrick’s Day, we honor those Irish immigrants who relocated and helped build our city, and the many Irish Americans who serve New York City to this day,” the mayor said.
To keep the tradition going, organizers in 2020 and 2021 quietly held small parades on St. Patrick’s Day, right around sunrise, when the streets were empty.
