     ‘We needed this’: Big crowds toast St. Patrick’s Day in Savannah for first time in 3 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thousands in green T-shirts, bowler hats, feather boas, with nary a mask in sight, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder along sidewalks and inside bustling bars Thursday as the South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade returned in Savannah after a two-year coronavirus hiatus.
Started by Irish immigrants to Georgia’s oldest city in 1824, the St. Patrick’s Day parade has morphed into one of the South’s biggest street parties after Mardi Gras.
Purvis said she’s been celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in Savannah since childhood, and the only years she recalls not showing up were 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic forced the parade to be canceled.
“I’m not against masks or anything, but it’s nice to see people outside without masks and enjoying their time,” Purvis said.
“But it wasn’t St. Patrick’s Day.”

     Summary: But for locals, tradition is steeped in the Savannah St Patrick’s Day Parade - a two mile procession through the streets that unites the entire community for one cause, which is much like how it began in 1824.
“And that was the beginning of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade in our city or at least the first public parade in our city,” GSU Center for Irish Research and Teaching director Howard Keeley said.
Bishop England was a tremendous figure of his time, as Georgia Southern Professor Howard Keeley explained.
His name was John England.”Keeley has extensively researched Bishop England and the first St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Savannah.

     Sea of green in NYC as St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sea of green descended on New York City on Thursday as the nation’s largest and oldest St. Patrick’s Day Parade returned in full for the first time since COVID-19 shut it down two years ago.
When the pandemic unleashed in March 2020, the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was among the first major NYC events to be canceled — marking the first time in the parade’s history that it was shut down.
Others traveled from out-of-state solely for the famed St. Patrick’s Day experience.
“It’s a great place to be on a great day.
Everybody’s Irish on St. Patrick’s day.”Forced to cancel in 2020 and 2021, the parade’s organizers had tried to keep the St. Patrick’s Day tradition going by quietly holding smaller processions around sunrise when the streets of Manhattan were empty.

“We need the business, and this really kicked it off.”The South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day celebration made a big comeback in Savannah, Georgia, where Irish immigrants and their descendants have held parades since 1824.
The state chose St. Patrick’s Day two years ago to shutter restaurants, bars and nightclubs – a dramatic move that underscored the fear and uncertainty of the time.
“And now we’re at the 9/12 moment when we march down in the St. Patrick’s Day parade.
