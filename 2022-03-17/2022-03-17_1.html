    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things looked rather dire for Michigan basketball near the end of the first half of its first-round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
The Wolverines weren’t exactly hanging their heads, but with the way the Colorado State Rams had taken a convincing 15-point lead, the opponents of the maize and blue were celebrating on the court.
Michigan ended up finishing with a 75-63 win over the Rams, coming back from that sizable deficit in the first half.
With the defensive and offensive adjustments, alike, there was a lot for head coach Juwan Howard to be happy about.

     Michigan basketball wakes up in 2nd half to beat Colorado State, 75-63, in NCAA tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But coach Juwan Howard and his team were given a second chance, returning to Indianapolis as an 11-seed in the South Region against sixth-seeded Colorado State.
The Wolverines flipped the script from last week's collapse against Indiana to erase a 15-point deficit to Colorado State with a smothering, come-from-behind 75-63 win.
Eli Brooks scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half to stabilize the Wolverines alongside true freshman Frankie Collins (14 points, six rebounds).
They hounded the Rams, challenging every catch and pushing the Colorado State offense deeper and deeper beyond the 3-point line.
"I don't think we responded great when Michigan really turned up their pressure in the second half," Medved said.

     March Madness: Michigan basketball sparked by Frankie Collins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through 15 minutes, Michigan trailed by 15 and had more turnovers than field goals.
Freshman Frankie Collins, Jones’s replacement in the starting lineup and at the point guard spot.
Collins, a touted top-50 recruit who fell to the fringes of the rotation in conference play, has fully experienced the challenges of this Wolverines season.
On the season, Collins averages just 2.5 points.
But remember, the only constant in this Michigan season has been inconsistency.
