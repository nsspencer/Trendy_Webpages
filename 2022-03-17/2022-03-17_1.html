     5 takeaways: Michigan basketball vs. Colorado State in NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a heartbreaking loss in the Big Ten Tournament, where Michigan basketball squandered a 17-point second-half lead to Indiana, Thursday marked a new season in the commencement of the NCAA Tournament.
Though the 11-seed against 6-seed Colorado State, the Wolverines were favored, but the maize and blue were also to be shorthanded with DeVante’ Jones having suffered a concussion on Monday.
In the second half, Michigan looked much better, digging into the deficit, and finally taking the lead for the first time in the game with 12:52 left.
But CSU wasn’t going to go quietly into the night, scoring five to answer, taking a four-point lead a minute later.
The lead ballooned to 10, but the maize and blue held on to survive and advance, 75-63.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But coach Juwan Howard and his team were given a second chance,returning return to Indianapolis as an 11-seed in the South Region against sixth-seeded Colorado State.
The Wolverines flipped the script from last week's collapse against Indiana to erase a 15-point deficit to Colorado State with a smothering, come-from-behind 75-63 win.
Eli Brooks scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half to stabilize the Wolverines alongside true freshman Frankie Collins (14 points, six rebounds).
They hounded the Rams, challenging every catch and pushing the Colorado State offense deeper and deeper beyond the 3-point line.
"I don't think we responded great when Michigan really turned up their pressure in the second half," Medved said.

     Summary: Through 15 minutes, Michigan trailed by 15 and had more turnovers than field goals.
Freshman Frankie Collins, Jones’s replacement in the starting lineup and at the point guard spot.
Collins, a touted top-50 recruit who fell to the fringes of the rotation in conference play, has fully experienced the challenges of this Wolverines season.
On the season, Collins averages just 2.5 points.
But remember, the only constant in this Michigan season has been inconsistency.
