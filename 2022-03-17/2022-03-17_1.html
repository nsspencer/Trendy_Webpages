Major cities around the United States are bringing back their St. Patrick's Day celebrations after going quiet amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Though the event is shortened this year due to the ongoing pandemic, it's a welcome return to normalcy for revelers.
While New Orleans might not be top of the morning — er, mind — when thinking St. Patrick's Day, the city celebrates for weeks (of course) leading up to March 17; this year, marches began as early as March 12 and will run through the April 2 Irish-Italian Parade.
