     Kentucky basketball: Are you kidding? Early exit for Wildcats calls everything into question
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 15 seed Saint Peter’s is a shocking end to a season where Kentucky never quite got over the proverbial hump.
The Wildcats finished the season 26-8 after several significant players could not get untracked.
Graduate shooter Kellan Grady had his second straight miserable shooting game, shooting 1-for-9.
Those who contend that college basketball passed John Calipari by on the night that Wisconsin upset an unbeaten Kentucky team in the 2015 Final Four have another point to add to their argument.
The Wildcats hadn’t suffered an NCAA Tournament loss to a double-digit seed since 1982, when they lost to No.

On the flip side, Saint Peter's made 18 of its 21 free-throw attempts -- making nine in overtime.
Today is about Saint Peter's, now looking to become just the third No.
I'd give Saint Peter's at least one chance in four to advance.

     Kentucky stunned by No. 15 seed Saint Peter's, a new March Madness low for John Calipari
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Calipari built perennial contenders at Kentucky with the very best amateur basketball players in America.
15 seed Saint Peter's in an opening-round men's NCAA tournament game that few thought would even be worth watching.
The Peacocks, led by a coach making less than four Kentucky assistants, stunned one of college basketball's bluest blue bloods in overtime, 85-79.
His fellow junior guard Doug Edert gave Saint Peter's a stunning lead with just over a minute remaining in regulation.
The Wildcats continued to sputter, allowing Saint Peter's to take a five-point lead with 30 seconds to go, and never recovered.
