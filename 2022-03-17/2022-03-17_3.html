     Packers trading star receiver Davante Adams to Raiders for two 2022 draft picks, source confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY - The Green Bay Packers wanted Davante Adams.
So the Packers are sending Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for a pair of 2022 draft picks, a source confirmed Thursday.
That was a major factor in Adams' decision to seek to leave Green Bay, the source said.
According to a league source, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers knew of the evolving deal when he signed his new contract with Green Bay this week.
Rodgers was aware of Adams' unhappiness during his own contract negotiations and knew the receiver would never play again for the Packers, a source said.

     Davante Adams Trade Isn’t Aaron Rodgers’s Fault, But It Is His Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is clear they wanted him badly, while the Packers seemed to want him badly at the correct price and structure.
While this doesn’t directly reflect on Rodgers—please don’t read this as us suggesting Adams would prefer to play with Derek Carr—it does rise to the level of Rodgers’s problem now.
Green Bay’s receiver depth chart has been decimated and most of its best options in free agency have signed elsewhere.
He could roll his eyes and mutter something about the stubbornness of the front office suits when asked about Adams.
When the path to being a was this complicated though, this public and acrimonious, how believable will it really be?

3) Chiefs GM Brett Veach: As happy as Hill has to be with this Adams news, the opposite should be said of Veach.
The hot topic around Kansas City may be the negotiations Veach is having with left tackle Orlando Brown Jr., who received the franchise tag.
If they have to overpay to keep Brown, then the Hill negotiation could become even more difficult.

     Summary: Per a source, the Packers we’re willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are with this new deal but Adams preferred to play elsewhere.
Aaron Rodgers was aware of the developments with Adams as they unfolded in recent days.
So, why would Adams choose the Raiders and Derek Carr — a far above-average quarterback — over Rodgers, who’s absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football we’ve ever seen?
Source: The Packers were willing to pay Davante Adams as much or more than the Raiders are.
Adams went off in his penultimate game with Carr, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown.
