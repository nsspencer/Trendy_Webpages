     NFL offseason madness continues: Raiders finalizing trade for Davante Adams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As if this NFL offseason could not get any wilder, the Green Bay Packers are about to trade superstar wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders in yet another shock acquisition involving an AFC West team.
You may recall the Packers franchise tagged Adams and gave Aaron Rodgers all the money over the past couple of weeks.
Sources: The #Raiders are in the final stages of trading for #Packers star WR Davante Adams, who receives a new contract that makes him the highest paid WR in the NFL.
#Packers QB Aaron Rodgers was aware of trade talks surrounding Davante Adams in recent days before the blockbuster deal was completed, per sources.
It appeared the deal was dead Wednesday; it came back to life and now Adams is about to join the #Raiders.

     How much salary cap space do Packers have after Davante Adams trade?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers will immediately gain almost $20 million in cap space when the trade of Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders is officially completed.
Trading Adams will create around $19.4 million in new cap space, which will give the Packers all the space needed to get aggressive on the open market if desired.
Overall, the Packers will have roughly $20.4 million of cap space after dealing Adams.
Adams was on the books at a $20.1 million cap number after being given the franchise tag earlier this month.
Now, the team must make the most of the picks and cap space.

     Davante Adams' reunion with Derek Carr gives Las Vegas Raiders an elite, All-Pro WR in his prime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Gutierrez breaks down how trading for Davante Adams is beneficial to Derek Carr and the Raiders.
So yeah, Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has had "names" to throw the ball to in his eight-year NFL career.
But with Thursday's blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers for Davante Adams, Carr not only has his first true, still-in-his-prime No.
Because unless the Raiders shore up things up front to give Carr time, it won't matter who is running routes for him.
Adams as WR1 also gives Carr in particular, the Raiders in general, a dominating pass-catching corps.

     Packers Trade Davante Adams in Stunning Blockbuster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers is back but without his right-hand man as the Packers traded Davante Adams to the Raiders on Thursday night.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – In a stunning trade for the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl aspirations, the team traded All-Pro receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday night.
Perhaps the Packers can land a veteran in free agency; Adams cost $20.1 million under the franchise tag.
Everyone in the stadium knew where Rodgers wanted to fire the football and it usually didn’t matter.
Adams wanted to be more of a force after the catch, so he forced 13 missed tackles compared to only four in 2020 and 15 the previous three seasons combined.

     Why Davante Adams chose Derek Carr over Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per a source, the Packers we’re willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are with this new deal but Adams preferred to play elsewhere.
Aaron Rodgers was aware of the developments with Adams as they unfolded in recent days.
So, why would Adams choose the Raiders and Derek Carr — a far above-average quarterback — over Rodgers, who’s absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football we’ve ever seen?
Source: The Packers were willing to pay Davante Adams as much or more than the Raiders are.
Adams went off in his penultimate game with Carr, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown.

     Packers trading Davante Adams to Raiders; WR signing 5-year, $141.25M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams said he wouldn't play under the franchise tag for the Green Bay Packers, and that appears to be the case.
Adams will make a per-year average of $28.25 million and becomes the new highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, Rapoport added.
It's a deal that's quietly been in the works for days with the teams finalizing details and the contract extension for Adams being worked out.
Rodgers was aware during his contract negotiations that Adams "would never play for the Packers again" as "the situation was too far gone," Rapoport reported.
Adams' frustrations over contract negotiations, though he kept them largely quiet, date back to last summer, Pelissero noted.
