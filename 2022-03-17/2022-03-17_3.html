     College basketball fans blasted the refs in Iowa's upset loss to Richmond
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Iowa Hawkeyes went into the men’s NCAA tournament as a popular sleeper pick to make the Final Four out of the Midwest region.
5 seeds came into the NCAA tournament fresh off a Big Ten tournament title and seemed to be getting hot at the right time.
The Richmond Spiders had other ideas, though, but college basketball fans couldn’t get over the officiating down the stretch.
Richmond knocked off Iowa, 67-63, in Thursday’s opening round — an undeniably huge win for Chris Mooney’s squad.
But Hawkeyes fans will be complaining about the blatant missed call on Kris Murray’s would-be tying three for quite some time.

     Summary: We talked to you on Sunday right after the announcement and you didn't really know anything about Illinois State.
We talked about how last year we got to the Sweet 16 with a really, really good offense but a pretty poor defense.
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you want them to have that little bit of excitement, a little of nerves.
If you don't have a little bit of butterflies in your stomach it doesn't mean a lot to you.
I'm really, really glad to see nationally that people understand that and respect her for the player that she is.
