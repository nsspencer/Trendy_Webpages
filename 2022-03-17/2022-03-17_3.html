     Packers trading star receiver Davante Adams to Raiders for two 2022 draft picks, source confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY - The Green Bay Packers wanted Davante Adams.
So the Packers are sending Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for a pair of 2022 draft picks, a source confirmed Thursday.
That was a major factor in Adams' decision to seek to leave Green Bay, the source said.
According to a league source, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers knew of the evolving deal when he signed his new contract with Green Bay this week.
Essentially, the two players were not necessarily considered a package deal for Green Bay.

     Packers trading Davante Adams to Raiders; WR signing 5-year, $141.25M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams said he wouldn't play under the franchise tag for the Green Bay Packers, and that appears to be the case.
Adams will make a per-year average of $28.25 million and becomes the new highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, Rapoport added.
Rodgers was aware during his contract negotiations that Adams "would never play for the Packers again" as "the situation was too far gone," Rapoport reported.
Adams recently purchased a house "right next to his new QB," Rapoport noted.
In their two seasons as Bulldogs, Adams led the Football Bowl Subdivision in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while Carr was atop the FBS in passing yards and passing touchdowns, per NFL Research.

     Packers Trade Davante Adams in Stunning Blockbuster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers is back but without his right-hand man as the Packers traded Davante Adams to the Raiders on Thursday night.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – In a stunning trade for the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl aspirations, the team traded All-Pro receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday night.
Perhaps the Packers can land a veteran in free agency; Adams cost $20.1 million under the franchise tag.
Everyone in the stadium knew where Rodgers wanted to fire the football and it usually didn’t matter.
Adams wanted to be more of a force after the catch, so he forced 13 missed tackles compared to only four in 2020 and 15 the previous three seasons combined.

     Why Davante Adams chose Derek Carr over Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per a source, the Packers we’re willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are with this new deal but Adams preferred to play elsewhere.
Aaron Rodgers was aware of the developments with Adams as they unfolded in recent days.
So, why would Adams choose the Raiders and Derek Carr — a far above-average quarterback — over Rodgers, who’s absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football we’ve ever seen?
Source: The Packers were willing to pay Davante Adams as much or more than the Raiders are.
Adams went off in his penultimate game with Carr, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown.
