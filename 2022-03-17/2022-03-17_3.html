3) Chiefs GM Brett Veach: As happy as Hill has to be with this Adams news, the opposite should be said of Veach.
The hot topic around Kansas City may be the negotiations Veach is having with left tackle Orlando Brown Jr., who received the franchise tag.
If they have to overpay to keep Brown, then the Hill negotiation could become even more difficult.

The Washington Post is reporting the Packers will receive Las Vegas' first-rounder (No.
The franchise tag was a point of contention between Adams and the Packers and was the primary catalyst for this trade being executed.
The NFL Network reports that the reigning league MVP was aware that Adams would never play for the Packers again as he was negotiating his deal.
Meanwhile, Rob Demovsky of ESPN reports that Green Bay was willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are giving him with this new deal, but the receiver preferred to play elsewhere.

     Davante Adams' reunion with Derek Carr gives Las Vegas Raiders an elite, All-Pro WR in his prime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Gutierrez breaks down how trading for Davante Adams is beneficial to Derek Carr and the Raiders.
So yeah, Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has had "names" to throw the ball to in his eight-year NFL career.
But with Thursday's blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers for Davante Adams, Carr not only has his first true, still-in-his-prime No.
Because unless the Raiders shore up things up front to give Carr time, it won't matter who is running routes for him.
Adams as WR1 also gives Carr in particular, the Raiders in general, a dominating pass-catching corps.

     Davante Adams a Raider in blockbuster $141M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders have made a blockbuster move to keep up in the AFC West, acquiring All-Pro receiver Davante Adams from the Green Bay Packers.
22 overall pick in the April draft and additional compensation to the Packers to reunite Adams with his college quarterback, Derek Carr.

     Davante Adams Trade Isn’t Aaron Rodgers’s Fault, But It Is His Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is clear they wanted him badly, while the Packers seemed to want him badly at the correct price and structure.
While this doesn’t directly reflect on Rodgers—please don’t read this as us suggesting Adams would prefer to play with Derek Carr—it does rise to the level of Rodgers’s problem now.
Green Bay’s receiver depth chart has been decimated and most of its best options in free agency have signed elsewhere.
He could roll his eyes and mutter something about the stubbornness of the front office suits when asked about Adams.
When the path to being a was this complicated though, this public and acrimonious, how believable will it really be?

     Why Davante Adams chose Derek Carr over Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per a source, the Packers we’re willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are with this new deal but Adams preferred to play elsewhere.
Aaron Rodgers was aware of the developments with Adams as they unfolded in recent days.
So, why would Adams choose the Raiders and Derek Carr — a far above-average quarterback — over Rodgers, who’s absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football we’ve ever seen?
Source: The Packers were willing to pay Davante Adams as much or more than the Raiders are.
Adams went off in his penultimate game with Carr, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown.
