     Hogwarts Legacy gameplay video confirms a holiday 2022 release window
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Warner Bros and Avalanche Games offered a substantial look at Hogwarts Legacy today, detailing its world, combat and narrative setting, as well as a "Holiday 2022" release window.
You won't be playing as Harry Potter or any of the other famed magic kids, nor meeting them, because Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s.
Exploring the castle itself seems to be a huge part of Hogwarts Legacy.
Magicking goblins to death will play a big part of Hogwarts Legacy, as the narrative is centred around a goblin rebellion, helped along by "Dark wizard Victor Rookwood."
J.K. Rowling, author of the original Harry Potter novels, has come under fire multiple times since 2020 for making transphobic remarks.

     Hogwarts Legacy’s big gameplay trailer reveals holiday 2022 release date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s, about 100 years before Harry Potter enrolls.
In Hogwarts Legacy, the player character is a new wizard or witch, except they’re starting as a fifth-year student.
Though the game fits into the overall Harry Potter canon, creator J.K. Rowling is not involved in Hogwarts Legacy’s creation.
Immediately after announcing Hogwarts Legacy in September 2020, last Warner Bros. Games distanced the project from her in light of Rowling’s public, and transphobic, remarks on gender identity.
So the reception Hogwarts Legacy gets from the general public will be closely watched.
