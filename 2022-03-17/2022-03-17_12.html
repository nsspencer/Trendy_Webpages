     Allen Robinson to Rams: Former Bears WR signing three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have made a move for arguably the top wide receiver on the market.
According to a report from NFL Media on Wednesday, Robinson will sign a three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles.
Robinson spent the last four years with the Chicago Bears.
Prior to last season, Robinson registered back-to-back 1,100-plus yard campaigns, and totaled 255 catches for 3,151 yards and 17 scores in his first three seasons with the Bears.
He signed a three-year, $42 million deal with Chicago, then played that out and spent last season playing on the franchise tag.

     6 takeaways from Rams' deal with WR Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams missed out on re-signing Von Miller in free agency, losing him to the Bills.
But one day later, they bounced back by striking a big deal of their own – with a wide receiver.
They agreed to a three-year, $46.5 million deal with Allen Robinson, a shocking signing by the receiver-rich Rams.
Wideout wasn’t viewed as a major priority, but the Rams can never have enough talent at the position, apparently.
Here are six takeaways from the addition of Robinson, which will become official once he puts pen to paper.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams announced they had agreed to a three-year contract with Robinson but did not disclose financial terms.
The Rams still have money left over for Odell Beckham Jr. and hope to re-sign him, sources told Schefter.
The addition of Robinson comes a day after pass-rusher Von Miller decided to sign with the Buffalo Bills instead of returning to the Rams.
Before he was released by the Cleveland Browns, Beckham had 17 receptions for 232 yards and no touchdowns in six games.
In eight seasons, Robinson has 495 receptions for 6,409 yards and 40 touchdowns.

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams made a splash in free agency with the signing of former Chicago Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson.
It’s a three-year deal worth $45 million for Robinson, which includes $30 million guaranteed.
Robinson spent the past four seasons with the Bears, where he’s been their most consistent offensive player.
With Robinson’s departure, Chicago could see as high as a third-round compensatory pick, assuming they see another compensatory free agent depart.
Here’s what Twitter is saying about Robinson signing with the Rams:
