     Summary: Holi marks the arrival of spring and the end of winter and is also known as the ‘festival of colours’.
This is because it involves dancing, singing, and throwing of powder paint and coloured water.
Some families hold religious ceremonies, but for many Holi is more a time for fun.
Holi also celebrates the Hindu god Krishna and the legend of Holika and Prahlad.
On this Holi, we wish good health, prosperity, and achievements to all those celebrating.

     Holi in Films Is Full of Emotions – From the Exuberant to the Naughty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Holi is often called the ‘festival of colours’, but this is only one aspect of its core components.
In the north, the evening of the full moon (Purnima) of Phalguna Shukla Paksha is ‘choti Holi’ and the burning of Holika, Holika Dahan, while the next day is Holi.
This more sanitised version is the form of Holi which normally makes it into films, where Holi features in song and dance sequences which are usually public events which extend beyond the family circle.
A more recent depiction of Holi shows it not as a public festival which unites villagers as one family but as a private occasion in someone’s (large) garden.
The danger of Holi is also seen on the Holi sequences of Yash Chopra.
