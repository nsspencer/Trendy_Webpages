     March Madness 2022: Tennessee basketball impresses with first-round blowout of Longwood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After winning the SEC Tournament, there was a lot of pressure on Tennessee to make a run in March Madness.
That mission got off to a good start Thursday with an 88-56 blowout of Longwood in the Round of 64.
Even though the quality of competition was not great, Tennessee did not mess around with Longwood and put the game away early.
It was an impressive showing from the Vols, who wanted to put to rest their early NCAA Tournament exit in 2021.
As Tennessee dropped the hammer on Longwood, the college basketball media was blown away by how dominant Rick Barnes' team looked.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Accordingly, there was zero madness behind Tennessee’s 88-56 drubbing of poor Longwood in its first game of the 2022 NCAA Tournament.
Halftime arrived with Tennessee on a 13-0 run and leading by 25 points, the competitive portion of the matchup long since concluded.
11-seeded Michigan (18-14), which hit the accelerator late and sped past Colorado State 75-63 in Thursday’s opener at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.
Overall, Tennessee shot 20-of-30 (66.7%) in the first 20 minutes and had 18 assists – yes, 18 – compared to two turnovers.
Including an opening-round blowout that was supposed to be one, and yet for Tennessee, was even prettier than that.

After all, a program’s very first trip to the NCAA Tournament is no small feat, especially considering the winding path of head coach Griff Aldrich.
