     Summary: The Rams have agreed to a three-year deal with former Bears No.
Per multiple reports, the deal is worth $46.5 million, and includes $30.7 million guaranteed.
A second-round pick out of Penn State in the 2014 NFL Draft, Robinson, 28, played with the Jaguars for four seasons before signing with the Bears in 2018 on a three-year, $42 million deal.

     Champion LA Rams agree to 3-year deal with WR Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams agreed to terms Thursday on a three-year contract for receiver Allen Robinson, one of the NFL's most dependable veteran pass-catchers during his eight seasons in the league.
Robinson has three 1,000-yard seasons during a productive career split between Jacksonville and Chicago.
Robinson also is the first outside free agent signed this month by the Rams, who have lost several key players to free agency and retirement over the past week.
Beckham is an unrestricted free agent, and the Rams have expressed interest in re-signing him.
The Rams also used a second-round pick last season on speedy receiver Tutu Atwell, who was lost early in the regular season to injury.

     Summary: AP Photo/Bruce KluckhohnFree-agent wide receiver Allen Robinson II has agreed to a three-year, $46.5 million contract ($30.7 million fully guaranteed) with the Los Angeles Rams, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network.
Robinson played the first nine games before sitting the next three with a hamstring injury.
He broke out in 2015, notably catching 80 passes for 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns in his second season.
After the campaign ended, the free agent inked a three-year, $42 million contract with the Bears.
Following that deal, Chicago placed a franchise tag on Robinson, who played the year out on a one-year, $17,880,000 contract.

     Rams To Sign Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams are signing Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5MM deal, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero (Twitter link).
Robinson, 28, has spent four seasons with each of the Jaguars and Bears.
However, many saw the disappointing campaign more as an indictment of Matt Nagy and the Bears’ overall struggles on offense than a sign of Robinson slowing down.
In Los Angeles, Robinson will join a receiving corps which already includes Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods.
However, ESPN’s Adam Schefter adds that the Rams “still have money left over for Odell Beckham Jr. and hope to re-sign him” (Twitter link).

     Twitter loves the Rams' signing of Allen Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Outside of signing a few of their own free agents, the Los Angeles Rams had been relatively quiet this week.
They lost several players, including Darious Williams, Von Miller and Austin Corbett, but they joined the fun on Thursday by agreeing to a three-year deal with Allen Robinson.
It’s a three-year deal worth $46.5 million, making him the Rams’ third receiver making more than $15 million per year.
They’re now loaded at wide out, with Robinson joining Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Van Jefferson as Matthew Stafford’s top targets.
Here’s how Twitter reacted to the signing, with an overwhelmingly positive response from both Rams fans and media members who are thrilled to see Robinson finally have a capable quarterback.

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.
