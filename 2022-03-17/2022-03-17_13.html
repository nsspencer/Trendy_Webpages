     Creighton Basketball: 3 keys to Bluejays beating San Diego State in Round of 64
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Creighton Basketball hops into March Madness fresh off a disappointing end to the Big East Tournament, a 54-48 loss to Villanova.
The San Diego State Aztecs are Creighton’s first-round foe, hailing from the Mountain West Conference.
The Big East Freshman of the Year, Nembhard, was lost for the season due to a broken wrist suffered in a win over St. John’s.
While perhaps not as formidable as the Big East, the MWC was a really solid conference all year long.
Let’s take a look at three keys for the Bluejays to advance past San Diego State.

     Aztecs and Creighton look a lot alike, with one key difference
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But San Diego State and Creighton, for all their cosmetic differences, are largely the same basketball team.
Both teams win with stifling defense.
Matt Bradley, one of three SDSU players who hasn’t been here before, neglected to take his name placard from the interview session Wednesday as a keepsake.
His teammates responded in the semifinal win against Colorado State (nine players scored) but not so much in the final.
Like SDSU, they win games with their defense and will try to stop, or at least limit, Bradley.

And, you know, it's unlikely that we're going to have him on Saturday.So couldn't be more proud of this group.
And it has been one heck of a ride to be a part of, and an awful lot of fun.THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.Questions for Coach McDermott, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kaluma, or Mr. Hawkins.
Especially a guy that has been such a big presence on and off the court.If you guys don't know, he's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.
And he made his fair share down the stretch to help them win the game.THE MODERATOR: Any more questions?
