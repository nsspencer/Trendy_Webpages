     Summary: SAN DIEGO — Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats was excited for Jahvon Quinerly to have a chance to play against Notre Dame considering what he showed at the voluntary shootaround Thursday night.

Oats said most teams gave up their 20-minute shooting times, but Alabama decided to keep its time and make it voluntary.
Alabama made 26 of 64 shots from the field (40.6%) against Notre Dame and was 8 of 24 (33.3%) from 3-point range.
"We definitely didn't have the experience Notre Dame had with their guys that have played a lot of games.

     Summary: I thought guys wanted to do well.
We had a lot of guys that were not -- Charles Bediako started for us as a freshman.
We definitely didn't have the experience Notre Dame had with their guys that have played a lot of games.
And those sins don't get fixed because you won the game and you don't think they're that big a deal.
If you're a 2, 3 seed, you're not playing Notre Dame in the first round.

     In-N-Out: Alabama Basketball's NCAA Tournament Road Ended Early by Notre Dame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN DIEGO — Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats stressed three important things that his Crimson Tide needed to improve on heading into the NCAA Tournament.
It was a slow start for both Alabama and Notre Dame to start the game.
At just under three-and-a-half minutes into the game, Crimson Tide junior guard Jahvon Quinerly injured his left knee while driving to the basket.
Ryan finished the game with a team-leading 29 points for Notre Dame, including seven made 3-pointers out of nine shots.
Meanwhile, Notre Dame will advance to take on 3-seed Texas Tech on Sunday in the Second Round.

     Alabama Basketball Season Put To Pasture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Alabama basketball team was defeated 78-64 by a Norte Dame team that had to win a play-in game that went two overtimes on Wednesday followed by an all-night, cross-country flight.
Coach Nate Oats started Jaden Shackelford, Jahvon Quinerly, Charles Bediako, Keon Ellis, and Noah Gurley in the Friday afternoon game.
Shackelford and Ellis hit three point shots to give the Tide a 22-21 lead with seven minutes left in the period.
Alabama had 28 rebounds, 16 assists, nine steals, four blocks, and 14 turnovers.
The transfer portal needs to be worked hard for some hard nose basketball players that play the game the right way.

     Nate Oats: Maturity, experience were issues for Alabama, but still ‘successful’ season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It was a successful season by a lot of standards,” Oats said.
“Just the understanding of what it takes to win at this level -- again, they talk about trying to get old, stay old -- we had a lot of young inexperienced guys,” Oats said.
“I thought maybe we handled adversity a little -- not quite as well,” Oats said of the season as a whole.
It’s a neat group that way.”That sort of leadership never sufficiently emerged for Alabama this season, something Oats made clear after multiple losses this season.
“Overall, I’d say we had a successful season just a little disappointed, a little inconsistent, to be honest with you,” Oats said.
