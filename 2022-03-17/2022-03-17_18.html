     Agony of March: USC loses on cheap foul, free throws with 3 seconds left
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 1989 NCAA Tournament national championship game was decided on a foul call with three seconds left.
Friday in Greenville, S.C., USC and Miami did not play a national championship game or a Final Four game, but the ending looked very familiar.
A whistle occurred with three seconds left in a nail-biter on a play which involved no bump, rake, smack, or slap.
This was a play-on, with USC’s Chevez Goodwin waiting to block Moore’s shot in the final seconds of a 66-66 tie.
USC’s turnovers, shooting fouls against Miami jump shooters, and late missed free throws all prevented the Trojans from having a much more advantageous position in the final seconds.

     USC coach Andy Enfield says late 'wrong call' cost Trojans in first-round loss to Miami
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andy Enfield said his USC team came up "one possession short" in a 68-66 loss to Miami on Friday, and he was eager to point out the possession when it all fell apart.
Enfield criticized officials for two late calls, the most egregious, he said, coming on an out-of-bounds ruling that gave Miami the ball with 2:07 remaining.
"It was a one-point game," Enfield said.
The officials exchanged looks for a moment before ultimately signaling Miami ball, as the USC bench and a host of fans sitting behind them erupted in frustration.
In the end, Enfield said, it was the officials who gifted the win for the Hurricanes.

     USC Men's Basketball Falls To Miami In NCAA Tournament First Round, 68-66, Despite Second-Half Rally

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drew Peterson scored 17 points and Reese Dixon-Waters posted a career-high 16, but it wasn't enough as 7-seed USC men's basketball fell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to 10-seed Miami (Fla.), 68-66, in Greenville, S.C., on Friday.
Isaiah Mobley scored 11 points — all in the second half — with eight assists.
The three consecutive seasons of 20+ wins also equal the school record for most consecutive 20-win seasons set from 2016-18.
Despite trailing by 13 points late in the first half, the Trojans rallied out of halftime and battled with the Hurricanes (24-10, 14-5 ACC) for the entire second half.
