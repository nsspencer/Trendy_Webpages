     Red Sox 'taking a look' at two-time All-Star SS Trevor Story?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Story has spent his entire six-year career with the Colorado Rockies, but the club reportedly signed Kris Bryant on Wednesday.
While "KB" could co-exist with Story in the Colorado infield, the money and years that the Rockies are apparently investing in Bryant would presumably make things difficult in bringing back Story on a new deal.
Story had arguably his best season in 2018, when he registered career-highs in games played (157), at-bats (598), home runs (37), RBIs (108), hits (174), doubles (42) and steals (27) among other categories, while ending with a .291/.348/.567 slash line.
2018 was Story's first All-Star campaign as well and he finished eighth in the NL MVP voting while earning his first Silver Slugger award.
Story again made the NL All-Star team and won a Silver Slugger in 2019 and racked up career-bests in runs scored (111), batting average (.294), on-base percentage (.363) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.917).

     Trevor Story Has Options In Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman, Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, and Anthony Rizzo have all signed, leaving Trevor Story, Nick Castellanos and Carlos Correa as the top three free agents still left unsigned.
Other teams in the mix include the Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins, and St. Louis Cardinals.
After losing out on Freddie Freeman, Red Sox are taking a look at Trevor Story.
St. Louis is the least likely destination, as they already have a solid tandem consisting of Paul DeJong and Edmundo Sosa manning the shortstop position.
In fact, Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated in Monday’s chat that the Cardinals had not even reached out to Story.

     Summary: So are the Boston Red Sox.
MLB Network’s Jon Heyman reports that “After losing out on Freddie Freeman, Red Sox are taking a look at Trevor Story.
One catch: he would likely have to play 2B as 2-time WS champ Xander Bogaerts is the SS.
On the surface, the Red Sox don’t seem like a good match for the 29-year-old Story, since they already have three-time All-Star Xander Bogaerts at shortstop.
According to NBC Sports Boston, Bogaerts made it quite clear he’s not open to changing positions.

Weeks before MLB Opening Day, former Rockies shortstop Trevor Story remains a free agent, but it’s not for a lack of trying.
The Red Sox are reportedly “taking a look” at Story, according to Jon Heyman.
But if Story signs to the historic Boston franchise, there’s a catch: they’ll move him to second base while Xander Bogaerts remains at shortstop.

The Mariners could strike by giving Trevor Story a massive one year dealDipoto has long talked about building a team, or at least signing players, with versatility.
The Mariners lineup goes from a bottom 5-10 in all of baseball in 2021 to a top 5-10 in 2022.
Adding Trevor Story to the Mariners on a one-year deal might not be the ideal move for fans.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)The Boston Red Sox have their eye on free-agent Trevor StoryThe rumor mill has tied the Boston Red Sox to several of the top free-agents this offseason.
Freeman’s camp may have used the Red Sox to drive up the price but they were never realistically going to top the offer he inevitably accepted from the Dodgers.
Story also provides the Red Sox with insurance in the event that Bogaerts opts-out with the intention of bolting next winter.
If Story shows the versatility to handle second base this year, there’s no long-term concern of him blocking Mayer.
He probably wasn’t their first choice but Story is arguably the best remaining option to upgrade the Red Sox lineup through free agency.

     Summary: The Boston Red Sox have maintained a surprisingly low profile since the MLB lockout ended.
The Red Sox have some clear cut needs that have been left unaddressed for the most part.
Trevor Story could fill the gaping hole in the Boston Red Sox infieldThe main issue with Boston’s pursuit of Freeman was his fit in the field.
The real reason the Boston Red Sox are looking into bringing Story onboard is because of his bat.
The Boston Red Sox desperately need another big bat in their lineup to replace the production lost from the departures of Renfroe and Schwarber.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baseball’s lockout had ended, major league transactions were unfrozen, and the Red Sox were well-positioned to come out of the fog with their tires squealing.
They had the money and the roster to be aggressive, decisive, perhaps even a little reckless.Instead, they’ve spent the better part of a week easing into traffic.
Their blinker is on, their seat belts are fastened, and their GPS is set to the most fuel-efficient route.
… If you chase things, you can turn good opportunities into bad opportunities and put yourself in a position not to be able to take the next good opportunity.”He’s probably right.
Logically, rationally, sensibly, there are probably a hundred good reasons the Red Sox have done nothing but sign a couple of left-handed relievers since the lockout ended a week ago.
