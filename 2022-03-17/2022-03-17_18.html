"I just thought it was weird looking because it wasn't a three-leaf clover, and I plucked it and my friend was like me 'Oh, that's a four-leaf clover, you're so lucky.

There's no proof of that, but four-leaf clovers are said to occur once per about ten-thousand of the three-leafed variety.

“As soon as you see it you’ll know,” laughs Betina Reich, who has been finding four leaf clovers since she was 10.

“Four leaf clovers aren’t lucky, it’s the people who take the time to find them are.” reich likes to cultivate her own.
There’s currently a world record holder for the largest collection of four leaf clovers, but there is no record established for the most consecutive days collecting a four-leaf clover, a potential hurdle for Reich.

     Four-Leaf Clover Genes Count
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (DTN photo by Pamela Smith)DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- I've always considered myself lucky that I could spot a four-leaf clover.
Others might consider white clover to be a weed in a manicured lawn, but I don't see it that way.
According to the release (https://newswire.caes.uga.edu/…), University of Georgia researcher Wayne Parrott and his research team identified the genetic markers associated with the four-leaf trait in white clover, (trifolium repens).
Parrott also found the location of other genes that can add red coloring to white clover leaves.
However, Parrott's work also found that the four-leaf trait doesn't always show up, even if the genes are present.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: – Everyone could use a little luck and four-leaf clovers might be the best solution in the month of March, but keep in mind shamrocks and clovers are not the same thing.
Four-leaf clovers aren’t even associated with St. Patrick’s Day.
Although all shamrocks are clovers, not all clovers are shamrocks.
According to Parade.com, Four-leaf clovers are considered lucky for their rarity.
Statistically, if a clover plant produces one four-leaf clover, it’s likely to produce more of them than normal plants would.
