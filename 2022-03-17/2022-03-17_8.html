     Wisconsin woman collects one four-leaf clover a day for 258 days

     Summary: Betina Reich of Eau Claire, Wis., is seeking Guinness World Records recognition after collecting a four-leaf clover every day for 258 consecutive days.
Photo by Bellezza87/Pixabay.comMarch 17 (UPI) -- A Wisconsin woman is seeking a Guinness World Record to make St. Patrick proud after she collected a four-leaf clover every day for 258 consecutive days.
AdvertisementReich said she decided to try to best her personal record in 2021, and ended up collecting a clover each day for 258 days -- from March 22 until the first heavy snow fell on Dec. 4.
Reich, who documented her clover hunts on TikTok, said she is now attempting to get Guinness World Records to create a new category for most consecutive days collecting a four-leaf clover.
The record-keeping agency recognizes a record for largest collection of four-leaf clovers, but would have to create a new category for Reich's accomplishment.

     Four-Leaf Clover Genes Count
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (DTN photo by Pamela Smith)DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- I've always considered myself lucky that I could spot a four-leaf clover.
Others might consider white clover to be a weed in a manicured lawn, but I don't see it that way.
According to the release (https://newswire.caes.uga.edu/…), University of Georgia researcher Wayne Parrott and his research team identified the genetic markers associated with the four-leaf trait in white clover, (trifolium repens).
Parrott also found the location of other genes that can add red coloring to white clover leaves.
However, Parrott's work also found that the four-leaf trait doesn't always show up, even if the genes are present.

     No, a four-leaf clover is not a shamrock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – From Las Vegas to New York City, revelers donned costumes with emerald shamrocks and four-leaf clovers to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.
And if you thought four-leaf clovers were shamrocks, you’re not alone, but the Irish shamrock, the country’s national symbol, only has three leaves.
In 2017, Twitter users were quick to poke fun at former President Trump’s online store, which sold limited edition St. Patrick’s Day MAGA hats with a gold four-leaf clover on the back.
Shoe giant Nike also made the mistake, emblazoning their popular Nike Air Force 1 “Shamrock” shoes in 2021 with four leaf clovers, and famed design house Hermès plastered four-leaf clovers on green, crocodile skin handbags meant to honor Ireland.
According to legend, the shamrock dates back to St. Patrick himself, who used it as a metaphor for the Holy Trinity.
