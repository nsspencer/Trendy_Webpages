     Boston Red Sox reportedly interested in Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY SportsAs the Boston Red Sox schedule draws closer and the top MLB free agents come off the board, it seems free-agent shortstop Trevor Story could be the next target on the club’s radar.
With Kyle Schwarber joining the Philadelphia Phillies, the Red Sox are seeking a middle-of-the-order bat to improve their lineup.
Related: 2022 MLB season predictionsStory has played shortstop throughout his MLB career, but Boston wouldn’t move Xander Bogaerts off his primary position.
Instead, the 29-year-old former Colorado Rockies star should shift to second base and provide the Red Sox with two quality fielders in the middle infield.
Given Story’s preference to stick at shortstop, Boston likely isn’t the favorite to land him.

     Red Sox interested in Trevor Story, but there’s a catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story remains on the free agent market, but if the Boston Red Sox sign him, his situation could change.
Weeks before MLB Opening Day, former Rockies shortstop Trevor Story remains a free agent, but it’s not for a lack of trying.
The Red Sox are reportedly “taking a look” at Story, according to Jon Heyman.
But if Story signs to the historic Boston franchise, there’s a catch: they’ll move him to second base while Xander Bogaerts remains at shortstop.
After losing out on Freddie Freeman, Red Sox are taking a look at Trevor Story.

     Trevor Story Has Options In Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman, Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, and Anthony Rizzo have all signed, leaving Trevor Story, Nick Castellanos and Carlos Correa as the top three free agents still left unsigned.
Other teams in the mix include the Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins, and St. Louis Cardinals.
After losing out on Freddie Freeman, Red Sox are taking a look at Trevor Story.
St. Louis is the least likely destination, as they already have a solid tandem consisting of Paul DeJong and Edmundo Sosa manning the shortstop position.
In fact, Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated in Monday’s chat that the Cardinals had not even reached out to Story.

     Boston Red Sox Rumors: Is Trevor Story the missing piece to the infield?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Red Sox have maintained a surprisingly low profile since the MLB lockout ended.
The Red Sox have some clear cut needs that have been left unaddressed for the most part.
Trevor Story could fill the gaping hole in the Boston Red Sox infieldThe main issue with Boston’s pursuit of Freeman was his fit in the field.
The real reason the Boston Red Sox are looking into bringing Story onboard is because of his bat.
The Boston Red Sox desperately need another big bat in their lineup to replace the production lost from the departures of Renfroe and Schwarber.

The Mariners could strike by giving Trevor Story a massive one year dealDipoto has long talked about building a team, or at least signing players, with versatility.
The Mariners lineup goes from a bottom 5-10 in all of baseball in 2021 to a top 5-10 in 2022.
Adding Trevor Story to the Mariners on a one-year deal might not be the ideal move for fans.

     Red Sox Rumors: Trevor Story emerging as a free-agent target
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)The Boston Red Sox have their eye on free-agent Trevor StoryThe rumor mill has tied the Boston Red Sox to several of the top free-agents this offseason.
Freeman’s camp may have used the Red Sox to drive up the price but they were never realistically going to top the offer he inevitably accepted from the Dodgers.
Story also provides the Red Sox with insurance in the event that Bogaerts opts-out with the intention of bolting next winter.
If Story shows the versatility to handle second base this year, there’s no long-term concern of him blocking Mayer.
He probably wasn’t their first choice but Story is arguably the best remaining option to upgrade the Red Sox lineup through free agency.
