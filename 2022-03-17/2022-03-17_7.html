    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those who are Irish — and those who celebrate with them every year on this day — are preparing for the return of the St. Patrick’s Day Parades.
Sioux City’s parade is back after a two-year absence brought on by the pandemic.
I think it’s going to be a good year — especially after taking two years off,” Quinn says.
“I think people are excited to just get out and about — plus St. Patty’s day is traditionally just a day for every to have fun and kind of let loose,” he says.
Quinn says many local people of Irish heritage will be taking part in the parade, walking or riding on floats.

     Sea of green in NYC as St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sea of green descended on New York City on Thursday as the nation’s largest and oldest St. Patrick’s Day Parade returned in full for the first time since COVID-19 shut it down two years ago.
When the pandemic unleashed in March 2020, the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was among the first major NYC events to be canceled — marking the first time in the parade’s history that it was shut down.
“New York really needs this.”Starting at 44th Street, the parade route marched the 35 blocks up 5th Avenue to 79th Street — past St. Patrick’s Cathedral and Central Park.
ReutersThe parade was being broadcast by NBC4 and livestreamed on the NYC St. Patrick’s Parade website for those who couldn’t make it in person.
We’re just very excited to be outside.”Forced to cancel in 2020 and 2021, the parade’s organizers had quietly held smaller processions on St. Patrick’s Day around sunrise when the streets of Manhattan were empty.

     St. Patrick's Day parades turn pandemic blues green
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — St. Patrick’s Day celebrations across the country are back after a two-year hiatus, including the nation’s largest in New York City, in a sign of growing hope that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic may be over.
“New York really needs this.”The city’s entertainment and nightlife scenes have particularly welcomed the return to a normal St. Patrick’s Day party.
Ron DeSantis chose St. Patrick’s Day two years ago to shutter restaurants, bars, and nightclubs — a dramatic move by the Republican and which underscored the fear and uncertainty of the time.
“This St. Patrick’s Day, we honor those Irish immigrants who relocated and helped build our city, and the many Irish Americans who serve New York City to this day,” the mayor said.
To keep the tradition going, organizers in 2020 and 2021 quietly held small parades on St. Patrick’s Day, right around sunrise, when the streets were empty.
