     Summary: The Golden Eagles, on the other hand, have failed to reach the second round in any of their last three trips to the Big Dance.
The Tar Heels' two meetings with their most hated rival captured the dichotomy of this year's squad.
While still unlikely given their seed, a deep run for the Tar Heels is at least looking plausible.
What's been a glaring problem for the Golden Eagles all season played a big role in their dreadful start.
Whatever goodwill Smart built early on with Golden Eagles fans by reaching the Big Dance might be eroding already.
