     Summary: UW took control of the game late and escaped a first round scare from the Patriot League champs, winning this one 67-60.
Although the offense struggled, the defense stepped up as they’ve done all year, holding Colgate scoreless for minutes at a time.
Following the Badgers’ run, Colgate went on an 11-4 run of their own to regain control.
Colgate’s shooting display in the first nine minutes of the second half was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.
In a game that was largely a back and forth affair, this was the stretch that won the Badgers the game.

     Summary: Wisconsin's Johnny Davis has ice in his veins late as the Badgers manage to escape a scare from 14-seed Colgate.
(0:29)MILWAUKEE -- Johnny Davis took the ball from teammate Steven Crowl, jab-stepped and waited another second before swishing a 3-pointer with 1:27 to play.
"There wasn't too many of them," Davis said after Wisconsin's 67-60 win Friday night in its first-round NCAA tournament game.
But Davis took over down the stretch, slamming the ball on a runout and making all five of his free throw attempts.
"He got going pretty good in the second half there, fortunately took good shots, got to the foul line.

"I think they're ready for it," Gard said.
Back in 2008, the Badgers also earned a 3-seed after winning the Big Ten title but after knocking off No.
They've stayed right true to where their feet are, and it's helped them over the course of this season."
