     Emoni Bates dressed for Memphis basketball’s NCAA Tournament opener vs. Boise State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time in more than six weeks, Emoni Bates is in uniform for Memphis’ men’s basketball team.
The 5-star recruit was reportedly dressed and going through warmups ahead of Thursday’s NCAA Tournament game against Boise State, but it is still uncertain whether the 6-foot-9 wing will play.
Bates practiced with the Tigers on Wednesday, though Memphis head coach Penny Hardaway said he wasn’t sure if Bates would return to action for the first-round matchup scheduled for 1:45 p.m.“I don’t know, to be very honest with you,” Hardaway told reporters.
In 16 games on the floor, the Ypsilanti native averaged 10.4 points, 10.4 points on 38% shooting from the field to go along with 3.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game.
