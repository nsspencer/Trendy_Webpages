     Allen Robinson to Rams: Former Bears WR signing three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have made a move for arguably the top wide receiver on the market.
According to a report from NFL Media on Wednesday, Robinson will sign a three-year, $46.5 million deal with Los Angeles.
Robinson spent the last four years with the Chicago Bears.
Prior to last season, Robinson registered back-to-back 1,100-plus yard campaigns, and totaled 255 catches for 3,151 yards and 17 scores in his first three seasons with the Bears.
He signed a three-year, $42 million deal with Chicago, then played that out and spent last season playing on the franchise tag.

     Rams are signing Allen Robinson to 3-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have made their first big move of the offseason.
According to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, they are signing Allen Robinson to a three-year deal worth $46.5 million.
The #Rams are signing WR Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million deal that includes $30.7M fully guaranteed, per sources.
They’re paying big money to three receivers now, with Robinson, Kupp and Woods all making more than $15 million per year.
Woods is coming off a torn ACL and Jefferson is clearly someone the Rams want more out of after signing Beckham and now Robinson.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams announced they had agreed to a three-year contract with Robinson but did not disclose financial terms.
The Rams still have money left over for Odell Beckham Jr. and hope to re-sign him, sources told Schefter.
The addition of Robinson comes a day after pass-rusher Von Miller decided to sign with the Buffalo Bills instead of returning to the Rams.
Before he was released by the Cleveland Browns, Beckham had 17 receptions for 232 yards and no touchdowns in six games.
In eight seasons, Robinson has 495 receptions for 6,409 yards and 40 touchdowns.

     Rams signing WR Allen Robinson to three-year, $46.5M deal

     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday that the Rams are signing receiver Allen Robinson to a three-year, $46.5 million contract that includes $30.7 million guaranteed, per sources informed of the pact.
When Woods went down with the injury last year, the Rams had just signed Odell Beckham Jr. to step in.
When healthy, Robinson is a difference-making talent who can box out in the red zone and make contested catches.
According to Next Gen Stats, Robinson leads the NFL with 140 tight-window targets (less than 1 yard of separation) since 2018, with 51 catches on tight-window targets in that span (third-most).
Each of the QBs has a sub-90 career passer rating and averaged 7.0 or fewer career pass yards per attempt.

     Bears’ free-agent WR search starts as Allen Robinson’s ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen Robinson finally found a team willing to pay him — and a high-level quarterback to throw him the ball.
The Rams reportedly won’t let the Robinson signing keep them from pursuing Beckham, who tore his ACL in the Super Bowl.
Robinson will have Matthew Stafford, by far the best quarterback with whom he has ever played, throwing him the ball.
Neither player will prevent the Bears from signing more receivers — or drafting one next month.
Running back Damien Williams, who scored three touchdowns for the Bears last year, agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Falcons on Thursday, a source confirmed, while former Bears offensive lineman Alex Bars joined the Raiders.
