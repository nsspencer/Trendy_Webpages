     Summary: San Francisco is not markedly better than Murray State.
Murray State has a bad loss against East Tennessee State, but that's one of only two Murray State losses this season.
So what I'm trying to tell you here is that San Francisco is the best team Murray State will have seen all season.
Murray State goes seven deep, so if the Racers get into foul trouble, things could unravel for them.
