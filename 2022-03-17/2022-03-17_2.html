    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HELENA — The St. Patrick’s Day celebration at the Montana State Capitol started bright and early with the raising of the Irish tri-color flag and traditional Irish dancing.
Governor Greg Gianforte proclaimed March 17 Irish Heritage Day and helped raise the Irish flag at the state capitol at 8:00 a.m.
The raising of the Irish flag has been a tradition for almost 40 years.
The governor joined the Thomas Francis Meagher Division of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians as the celebrations continued in the Rotunda of the capitol building.
Thomas Francis Meagher is a well-known figure here in Montana.

     Summary: ST CHARLES, Mo.
— Thousands packed Historic Main Street in St. Charles to catch the city's first-ever St. Patrick's Day Parade Thursday.
The music, the green clothing and trinkets and the spirit of the Irish heritage moved for a mile.
You could interact with the parade a lot more freely," said Travis Hartman.
The event was free to attendees but donations from people who rode and walked in the parade went to the St. Charles Ancient Order of Hibernians to help them support families and children in need.

     Sea of green in NYC as St. Patrick’s Day Parade returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sea of green descended on New York City on Thursday as the nation’s largest and oldest St. Patrick’s Day Parade returned in full for the first time since COVID-19 shut it down two years ago.
When the pandemic unleashed in March 2020, the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was among the first major NYC events to be canceled — marking the first time in the parade’s history that it was shut down.
Others traveled from out-of-state solely for the famed St. Patrick’s Day experience.
“It’s a great place to be on a great day.
Everybody’s Irish on St. Patrick’s day.”Forced to cancel in 2020 and 2021, the parade’s organizers had tried to keep the St. Patrick’s Day tradition going by quietly holding smaller processions around sunrise when the streets of Manhattan were empty.

     ‘We needed this’: Big crowds toast St. Patrick’s Day in Savannah for first time in 3 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thousands in green T-shirts, bowler hats, feather boas, with nary a mask in sight, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder along sidewalks and inside bustling bars Thursday as the South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade returned in Savannah after a two-year coronavirus hiatus.
Started by Irish immigrants to Georgia’s oldest city in 1824, the St. Patrick’s Day parade has morphed into one of the South’s biggest street parties after Mardi Gras.
Purvis said she’s been celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in Savannah since childhood, and the only years she recalls not showing up were 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic forced the parade to be canceled.
“I’m not against masks or anything, but it’s nice to see people outside without masks and enjoying their time,” Purvis said.
“But it wasn’t St. Patrick’s Day.”

     Summary: “I love St. Patrick’s Day.
“New York really needs this.”The city’s entertainment and nightlife scenes have particularly welcomed the return to a normal St. Patrick’s Day party.
The South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day celebration made a big comeback in Savannah, Georgia, where Irish immigrants and their descendants have held parades since 1824.
“And now we’re at the 9/12 moment when we march down in the St. Patrick’s Day parade.
