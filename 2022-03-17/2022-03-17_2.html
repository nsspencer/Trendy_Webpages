     Summary: GREEN BAY — It turns out Aaron Rodgers isn’t the only Green Bay Packers star who can carry a grudge.
Davante Adams was nothing but the good soldier in the final year of his contract last season, but if reports are true that the Packers were willing to pay him the same as the Las Vegas Raiders did as part of the blockbuster trade the teams made Thursday night, then Adams simply wanted out of Green Bay.

     Green Bay Packers now sixth in 2022 NFL Draft capital after Davante Adams trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are many ways to measure draft capital, with the most popular being Jimmy Johnson’s trade chart from his days with the Dallas Cowboys, simply because it was widely available before more nuanced studies came about.
The Spielberger and Fitzgerald chart, following the trade of receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for the team’s first- and second-round picks, would have the Packers’ draft capital at 7,433 points, good for sixth among NFL teams as it stands today.
For reference, the teams who have more draft capital than Green Bay going into the 2022 draft are the New York Jets (9,432), Jacksonville Jaguars (8,892), New York Giants (8,855), Philadelphia Eagles (8,664) and Detroit Lions (7,915).
Those five teams combined for a collective record of 23-61-1 in 2021, while the Packers were able to acquire this draft capital after a 13-4 season.
The table below shows where every team in the NFL ranks in 2022 NFL Draft capital on March 18th.

Field Yates of ESPN says Adams’ five-year deal, $142.5 million contract is the largest ever for a wide receiver.
Davante Adams' 5-year deal is not only the largest ever for a wide receiver, it's the largest contract for *any* non-QB in NFL history both in terms of average annual value ($28.5M) and total value ($142.5M).
Reports say the Packers offered Adams the same money as the Raiders, but Adams wanted to play elsewhere.
Davante Adams’ deal includes $67.5 million fully guaranteed, per source.

     Packers offered more money, but playing for Raiders was 'lifelong dream' for Davante Adams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From @GMFB: Davante Adams will fulfill his lifelong dream to play for the #Raiders and with QB Derek Carr, becoming the highest-paid WR in the NFL to do it.
In fact, according to Rapoport, it was Adams’ “lifelong dream” to reunite with Carr and play for the Raiders.
The Packers sent Adams to Las Vegas in exchange for first-round and second-round draft picks.
Once officially with the Raiders, Adams will sign a five-year, $141.5 million deal, making him the highest-paid receiver in NFL history and the highest-paid non-quarterback ever.
Offering more money to stay in Green Bay wasn’t enough for the Packers to keep the two-time first-team All-Pro.

     Packers trading Davante Adams to Raiders; WR signing 5-year, $141.25M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams said he wouldn't play under the franchise tag for the Green Bay Packers, and that appears to be the case.
Adams will make a per-year average of $28.25 million and becomes the new highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, Rapoport added.
It's a deal that's quietly been in the works for days with the teams finalizing details and the contract extension for Adams being worked out.
Rodgers was aware during his contract negotiations that Adams "would never play for the Packers again" as "the situation was too far gone," Rapoport reported.
Adams' frustrations over contract negotiations, though he kept them largely quiet, date back to last summer, Pelissero noted.
