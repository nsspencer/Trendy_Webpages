You may recall the Packers franchise tagged Adams and gave Aaron Rodgers all the money over the past couple of weeks.
Sources: The #Raiders are in the final stages of trading for #Packers star WR Davante Adams, who receives a new contract that makes him the highest paid WR in the NFL.
#Packers QB Aaron Rodgers was aware of trade talks surrounding Davante Adams in recent days before the blockbuster deal was completed, per sources.

Adams wanted to be more of a force after the catch, so he forced 13 missed tackles compared to only four in 2020 and 15 the previous three seasons combined.
