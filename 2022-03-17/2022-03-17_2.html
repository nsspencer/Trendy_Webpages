     Packers trading Davante Adams to Raiders; WR signing 5-year, $141.25M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davante Adams said he wouldn't play under the franchise tag for the Green Bay Packers, and that appears to be the case.
Adams will make a per-year average of $28.25 million and becomes the new highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history, Rapoport added.
It's a deal that's quietly been in the works for days with the teams finalizing details and the contract extension for Adams being worked out.
Rodgers was aware during his contract negotiations that Adams "would never play for the Packers again" as "the situation was too far gone," Rapoport reported.
Adams' frustrations over contract negotiations, though he kept them largely quiet, date back to last summer, Pelissero noted.

     Packers Trade Davante Adams in Stunning Blockbuster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers is back but without his right-hand man as the Packers traded Davante Adams to the Raiders on Thursday night.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – In a stunning trade for the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl aspirations, the team traded All-Pro receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday night.
Perhaps the Packers can land a veteran in free agency; Adams cost $20.1 million under the franchise tag.
Everyone in the stadium knew where Rodgers wanted to fire the football and it usually didn’t matter.
Adams wanted to be more of a force after the catch, so he forced 13 missed tackles compared to only four in 2020 and 15 the previous three seasons combined.

     Davante Adams' reunion with Derek Carr gives Las Vegas Raiders an elite, All-Pro WR in his prime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Gutierrez breaks down how trading for Davante Adams is beneficial to Derek Carr and the Raiders.
So yeah, Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has had "names" to throw the ball to in his eight-year NFL career.
But with Thursday's blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers for Davante Adams, Carr not only has his first true, still-in-his-prime No.
Because unless the Raiders shore up things up front to give Carr time, it won't matter who is running routes for him.
Adams as WR1 also gives Carr in particular, the Raiders in general, a dominating pass-catching corps.

     Why Davante Adams chose Derek Carr over Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per a source, the Packers we’re willing to pay Adams equally to what the Raiders are with this new deal but Adams preferred to play elsewhere.
Aaron Rodgers was aware of the developments with Adams as they unfolded in recent days.
So, why would Adams choose the Raiders and Derek Carr — a far above-average quarterback — over Rodgers, who’s absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football we’ve ever seen?
Source: The Packers were willing to pay Davante Adams as much or more than the Raiders are.
Adams went off in his penultimate game with Carr, catching nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown.
