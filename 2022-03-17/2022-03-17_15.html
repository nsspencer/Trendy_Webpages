     Summary: Following his release from Jaguars Tuesday morning, Jack immediately had a market, one that ultimately landed him in Pittsburgh.
@BordasLaw — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) March 17, 2022“I guess, as broad as that sounds, that was it, man,” Jack said to reporters regarding what sold him on Pittsburgh, according to video via the Steelers’ YouTube page.
“When he said championships and winning a championship, that was really all I needed to hear because I feel like in my career, I just really…at this point I just really wanna win games.
To be honest with you at this point, I just wanna win and play good football.
And that’s what I’m here to do.”Myles Jack said he signed with the Steelers because he wants to win games.

     Myles Jack Says This Phone Call With Mike Tomlin Sealed Deal for Steelers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers made plenty of noise during the early portion of free agency, but as things started to quiet down, they added one more splash.
The Steelers signed inside linebacker Myles Jack to a two-year contract, which adds a 26-year-old to the mix with Devin Bush.
Coming off back-to-back 100 tackle seasons, Jack's efforts are expected to be high, but head coach Mike Tomlin already knew that.
Jack said a phone call from the Steelers head coach is what sealed the deal for the Steelers.
Wednesday they're saying the Steelers want to talk to you and they're very very interested.

     Chance to win enticed inside linebacker Myles Jack to sign with Steelers in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Tomlin didn’t have to say much to convince free-agent linebacker Myles Jack to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
“Once he said that, it was a no-brainer.”After being surprised that Jacksonville released him after six seasons, Jack found employment with the Steelers about 24 hours later.
It was the opposite in Jacksonville, where his only taste of winning came in 2017 when the Jaguars went 10-6 and upset the Steelers in the divisional round.
In his five other seasons with Jacksonville, the Jaguars went a combined 18-63 and were 4-29 the past two years.
But Jack was released amid a spending spree by the Jaguars, whose four-year, $57 million deal with free-agent linebacker Foye Oluokun made him expendable.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Wednesday that the Steelers are expected to sign Jack to a two-year, $16-million deal.
However, it also signaled the end for another former Jaguar in linebacker Joe Schobert, who was eventually released.
That decision to release Schobert saves them around $7 million in cap room while creating just over $1 million in dead money.
Jaguars’ general manager Trent Baalke and head coach Doug Pederson ultimately made the decision to release Jack to generate more cap space.
Last season, Schobert tallied 112 tackles, one forced fumble, and an interception with Pittsburgh.
