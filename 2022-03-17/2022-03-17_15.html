     Emoni Bates hits only shot taken in return to Memphis basketball’s lineup during NCAA Tourney win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Emoni Bates made the most of the limited time he saw in his return to the court on Thursday.
The Memphis basketball freshman played just three minutes in the Tigers’ 64-53 win over Boise State in the NCAA Tournament opener -- though he nailed the only shot he took.
The 6-foot-9 wing had been out since Jan. 27, missing Memphis’ previous 12 games with a back injury.
There were questions whether the former 5-star recruit would return to the lineup at all this season, but Bates practiced with the team on Wednesday and suited up on Thursday.
