     'Sustainable' funds are no more green than traditional products, study finds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/StaffLONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Investment funds that market themselves as sustainable under European rules get similar levels of "green revenues" through the companies they invest in as traditional funds, according to a new study published on Thursday.
So-called "green revenue" is the percentage of sales generated from products that benefit the environment such as with cleaner water or contribute to mitigating climate change.
Clarity found that for Article 8 funds, 3.9% of their revenue through the portfolio companies they own can be classified as green, similar to the 3.1% share for Article 6 products.
Funds in the smaller pool of Article 9 had 15% of revenue as green.
"Article 8 funds are defined as 'promoting E or S characteristics', which is a vague term.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY - A woman accused of beheading and dismembering a Green Bay man in his mother's basement will undergo a mental health evaluation to determine if she's competent to stand trial.
She will need to undergo an in-patient evaluation within 15 days after she arrives at a mental health facility.
At some point, they went to his mother's home on Stony Brook Lane on Green Bay's west side and went into the basement.
Jolly said he filed the motion seeking a competency exam based on conversations he had with her.
If an evaluation finds she's not competent to stand trial, the case would continue only after she's treated and restored to competency.
