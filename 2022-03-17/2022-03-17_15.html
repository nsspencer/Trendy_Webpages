     Emoni Bates hits only shot taken in return to Memphis basketball’s lineup during NCAA Tourney win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Emoni Bates made the most of the limited time he saw in his return to the court on Thursday.
The Memphis basketball freshman played just three minutes in the Tigers’ 64-53 win over Boise State in the NCAA Tournament opener -- though he nailed the only shot he took.
The 6-foot-9 wing had been out since Jan. 27, missing Memphis’ previous 12 games with a back injury.
There were questions whether the former 5-star recruit would return to the lineup at all this season, but Bates practiced with the team on Wednesday and suited up on Thursday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) Lessons from a tough start to the season helped Memphis weather a second-half challenge by Boise State on Thursday.
Boise State trailed by 19 at the half but, taking advantage of a cold snap by the Tigers, narrowed the gap to 42-35 with 9:45 left.
The Tigers had scored just four second-half points before Williams' dunk with 9:18 left got them going again.
The Tigers have hit their stride down the stretch, though, reaching the title game of the American Athletic Conference tourney before losing to Houston.
Boise State, which ranked 17th in the nation for defensive efficiency, had not trailed by more than seven points at halftime before Thursday.
