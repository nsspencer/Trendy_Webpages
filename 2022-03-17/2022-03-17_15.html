     Summary: A doctoral student at the University of Georgia considers himself an "amateur clover breeder."
He says for clovers to produce four leaves, it takes a combination of both genes and the environment.
However, the exact interplay of the two is still unsolved.

     Feelin’ Lucky: Eau Claire woman finds hundreds of four leaf clovers, looks to set new world record

     Summary: EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -Hard to find, but lucky to have.
“As soon as you see it you’ll know,” laughs Betina Reich, who has been finding four leaf clovers since she was 10.
And now she’s applying to put her collection in the hands of Guinness, Guinness World Records that is.
“Four leaf clovers aren’t lucky, it’s the people who take the time to find them are.” reich likes to cultivate her own.
There’s currently a world record holder for the largest collection of four leaf clovers, but there is no record established for the most consecutive days collecting a four-leaf clover, a potential hurdle for Reich.

     No, a four-leaf clover is not a shamrock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – From Las Vegas to New York City, revelers donned costumes with emerald shamrocks and four-leaf clovers to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.
And if you thought four-leaf clovers were shamrocks, you’re not alone, but the Irish shamrock, the country’s national symbol, only has three leaves.
In 2017, Twitter users were quick to poke fun at former President Trump’s online store, which sold limited edition St. Patrick’s Day MAGA hats with a gold four-leaf clover on the back.
Shoe giant Nike also made the mistake, emblazoning their popular Nike Air Force 1 “Shamrock” shoes in 2021 with four leaf clovers, and famed design house Hermès plastered four-leaf clovers on green, crocodile skin handbags meant to honor Ireland.
According to legend, the shamrock dates back to St. Patrick himself, who used it as a metaphor for the Holy Trinity.

     Four-Leaf Clover Genes Count
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (DTN photo by Pamela Smith)DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- I've always considered myself lucky that I could spot a four-leaf clover.
Others might consider white clover to be a weed in a manicured lawn, but I don't see it that way.
According to the release (https://newswire.caes.uga.edu/…), University of Georgia researcher Wayne Parrott and his research team identified the genetic markers associated with the four-leaf trait in white clover, (trifolium repens).
Parrott also found the location of other genes that can add red coloring to white clover leaves.
However, Parrott's work also found that the four-leaf trait doesn't always show up, even if the genes are present.
