     Alice Eve to star in Early Edition reboot pilot for CBS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alice Eve has signed on to star in the pilot for CBS’s upcoming revival of ’90s supernatural drama Early Edition, in which she’ll be tasked with the seemingly fantastical responsibility of trying to explain to people in 2022 what a newspaper is.
The Early Edition reboot is being headed up by Melissa Glenn, whose last big credit was a writing/producing role on CBS’s Zoo, the TV show in which all animals fight all human beings.
The original series was created Ian Abrams, Patrick Q.
Page, and Vik Rubenfeld, and, while it would probably be inaccurate to say it launched Chandler to superstardom—he won a Saturn Award for that one , not a Coach Taylor-style Emmy— it was a well-received spin on light TV supernatural drama from 1997 to 2000.
The new series, like the original, is being aimed at CBS.

     CBS' Early Edition Reboot Pilot Casts Alice Eve as the New Kyle Chandler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Alice Eve didn’t already have a newspaper subscription, she does now!
The Belgravia actress has been tapped to lead the pilot of CBS’ gender-swapped Early Edition reboot, our sister site Deadline reports.
For the uninitiated, the original Early Edition starred a pre-Friday Night Lights Kyle Chandler as Gary Hobson, a man who mysteriously received each Chicago Sun-Times newspaper the day before it was published, and used the knowledge he received to prevent terrible events from taking place.
That “uncompromising journalist” happens to be Eve’s character, Beth, an executive producer at local Seattle TV news station KSEA.
Do you see yourself subscribing to CBS’ new Early Edition?

     More boosters, more variants, but less concern: Americans face future of COVID pandemic - CBS News poll analysis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two years in, Americans' concern about COVID-19 has dropped to its lowest level since the CBS News poll started tracking it in the spring of 2020, but they aren't ready to say the pandemic is over.
On a personal level, many say the pandemic has left lasting changes in their own lives, both in how they live and how they work.
As concern has somewhat lessened, more feel comfortable venturing out to public places like restaurants, gathering with friends and getting on an airplane than they did a year ago.
Those who support a mask mandate are particularly likely to say the pandemic is still going.
Most of those who have worked from home at some point say the pandemic has caused changes to the way they do their jobs.
