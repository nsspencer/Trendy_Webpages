     2 Men Posing as Federal Agents Duped Secret Service, U.S. Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was not the first time that the conduct of members of the Secret Service had drawn intense scrutiny to the agency.
The investigation of Mr. Taherzadeh and Mr. Ali began after a letter carrier with the United States Postal Service was assaulted in March at an apartment complex where the men had been living.
The men told the inspector that they were investigators with the U.S. Special Police Investigation Unit, according to the affidavit.
The inspector also learned that Mr. Taherzadeh and Mr. Ali were in regular contact with several members of the Secret Service who lived in the same building and that the men had given them gifts, Mr. Elias wrote.
The inspector reported the information to the Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General, which referred the case to the F.B.I.

     Four U.S. Secret Service agents suspended over ties to phony cops

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoWASHINGTON/SPRINGFIELD, Virginia, April 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service has suspended four agents linked to two men accused of impersonating federal law enforcement officers who authorities said gave gifts worth thousands of dollars to agency personnel including one assigned to protect President Joe Biden's wife.
Prosecutors said they plan to charge them with conspiracy in a scheme in which they are accused of posing as U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents.
Taherzadeh offered to purchase a $2,000 assault rifle for a Secret Service agent assigned to protect first lady Jill Biden and told other government officials they could have access to what he claimed were "official government vehicles," the FBI said.
Taherzadeh and Ali were exposed when they gave false statements about being members of law enforcement to a U.S.
As of Monday, four members of the Secret Service were placed on administrative leave pending further investigation, officials said.
