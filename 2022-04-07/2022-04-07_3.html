     Summary: The Ultimatum Season 2 will have an all-queer cast and is already in the works at Netflix.
The Ultimatum Season 1 Episodes 1-8 debuted Wednesday, April 6 on the streaming service.
For years, fans of reality dating shows have been asking networks to make all-queer seasons of programs like The Ultimatum.
Hopefully there will be many more all-queer seasons of Netflix’s dating shows, which will now be premiering year-round.

     Netflix’s The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On Offers a Sadistic Twist on Reality Romance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It features six established couples, all made up of pairs in which one has given the other an ultimatum to propose or break up.
What’s crazier is this: Ultimatum has each couple pretend to break up, then makes every contestant enter a three-week “trial marriage” with another “newly single” contestant.
Both strangers have to choose each other mutually to enter this trial marriage.
Temptation Island, like The Ultimatum, is also ridiculous—but in its defense, the older show has the benefit of being self-aware.
And yes, dating around is a mechanism for genuine self-discovery and clarity, and some of the clarity appearing to happen on Ultimatum may be legit.

     Summary: The answer is “Yes, absolutely”, and it is delivered in the form of The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On.
Homosexuality has not yet entered the Lacheyean universe, although they have promised a second season with an LGBT cast).
“A” denotes blondness, “B” denotes not-blondness and that is literally everything covered that matters in this show.
The couples are split up and encouraged to lounge round a pool, have dinner, drink cocktails and see if they “spark” with anyone else.
Then they choose a new partner to live with for three weeks before returning to their beloved, and deciding whether to shit or – I mean, marry or move on.

     The Ultimatum: Predicting the Season Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ultimatum is essentially a spin-off of Love Is Blind, one of reality TV’s biggest hits in years.
Most of the “old” relationships were on the verge of breaking because of the ultimatum, and, predictably, most partnerships disintegrated under the pressure.
In The Ultimatum, they were on hand to mediate some of the cast members’ most intense confrontations.
I think Jake and Rae actually may have a future together, and Jake doesn’t want to doom Rae’s relationship with his mom from the jump.
