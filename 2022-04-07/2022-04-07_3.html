     Mark Wahlberg Hints at Leaving Hollywood as He Lists $90 Million Estate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Asked when the curtains will close on his Hollywood career, the actor teased, "sooner rather than later, probably."
Wahlberg is dad to Ella, 18, Michael, 16, Brendan, 13, and Grace, 12, whom he shares with wife Rhea Durham.
TMZ reported Wednesday that the actor has listed the estate, which features 30,500 square feet of living space, for $87.5 million.
It is unclear why Wahlberg is listing his home, though it seems that he isn't quite ready to walk away from Hollywood just yet.
Wahlberg said the film is "really touching everybody who sees it because we're all going through something."

     Summary: Mark Wahlberg's approach to imparting his deep Catholic faith to his children is more about living it than mandating it.
"But even with my faith, I don't force it on them.
TODAY's Carson Daly is another dad of four who has been upfront about the importance of his Catholic faith in his life to the point where he almost became a priest.
He shared with Wahlberg on Thursday that he learned about "Father Stu" from being on the Catholic meditation app Hallow while praying during this holy season of Lent.
"I just felt it was also the best way to make the movie without any kind of interference," he said.

     Summary: Wahlberg gains weight for boxer-turned-priest rolePublished on: Thursday, April 07, 2022By: AFPText Size:LOS ANGELES:Mark Wahlberg has a famously punishing physical routine that has kept the 50-year-old in enviable shape.
But for his latest outing, ‚ÄúFather Stu,‚Äù he had to ditch the training and eat.
For Wahlberg, who also produced the movie, the real-life story of ‚ÄúFather Stu‚Äù is a departure from previous action outings like ‚ÄúMile 22‚Äù and ‚ÄúUncharted‚Äù ‚Äì but, he insists, not unexpected.
Along with its unabashedly religious theme ‚Äì the film will be released in the United States ahead of the Easter Weekend ‚Äì ‚ÄúFather Stu‚Äù also zooms in on family, and on human kindness.
‚ÄúAnd then I would go on set with him and it was just this presence that he has, and his incredible talent.‚ÄùADVERTISEMENTFor Weaver, Wahlberg was one of the biggest revelations of the project.
