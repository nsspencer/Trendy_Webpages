     Summary: And Hoerner, who is out to prove he can emerge from Javier Báez's shadow as Chicago’s everyday shortstop for the next several years, electrified the crowd with that stunning homer.
For the 24-year-old Hoerner, the blast -- which gave the Cubs a 3-1 lead at the time -- marked his first homer since Sept. 21, 2019, when he was rushed to the Majors as a rookie.

     Summary: The uncertainty of Contreras’ part in the Cubs’ future looms over the big-picture implications of this season.
So, too, does the Cubs needing to figure out which players can be more than just a bridge to the next championship-caliber team.
Hoerner and Nick Madrigal have an opportunity to show they are important pieces to the future.
They bring a contact-hitting element that was missing too often last season.
Both players will need to overcome their injury history and be a regular presence in the lineup.

     Cubs Set Balanced Opening Day Roster, Mills to IL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have set their Opening Day 28-man roster, but they didn’t make any cuts to get down from 31.
Instead, three players have been placed on the 10-day injured list, all retroactive to April 4.
We already knew Wade Miley (left elbow inflammation) and Andrelton Simmons (right shoulder inflammation) would be in that group, but Alec Mills (low back strain) was unexpected.
That opens the door for Keegan Thompson to take a spot in the rotation for at least the first turn.
Alfonso Rivas has made the roster as well and will provide a lefty bat at first.

     Summary: It might turn out to be something like 2013 or 2014, he said, when the Cubs stunk but Kris Bryant kept Cubs fans’ hearts warm by tearing up minor-league pitching.
If it walks like a rebuild and talks like a rebuild, it’s probably going to tank like a rebuild.
When former Cubs president Theo Epstein unveiled his goal of “sustained success’’ in October, 2011, we thought he meant long-term success.
The highlight of the Cubs’ offseason was the signing of Japanese star Seiya Suzuki to a five-year deal.
I think we have a roster that we can do that.’’Stay strong, Cubs fans.
