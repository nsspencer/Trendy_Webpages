     Replacing Ezra Miller With Grant Gustin In ‘The Flash’ Is Too Weird To Work
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if Warner Bros. is not moving forward with Miller, fans have a very specific idea of who could replace them.
Fans are rallying to say Gustin deserves a chance to shine on the big screen with a real, non-CW budget.
SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 26: In this handout photo provided by Warner Bros, Grant Gustin of "The Flash" ... [+] attends Comic-Con International 2014 on July 26, 2014 in San Diego, California.
Seeing Grant Gustin alone zapped into the DCEU to play a different version of a character he’s already played for eight years and a hundred hours is just extremely weird to process.
It’s much easier to imagine replacing Miller with another young actor for a fresh start.
