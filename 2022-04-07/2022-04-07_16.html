     Summary: The Cleveland Guardians announced that they’ve traded Bradley Zimmer to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitcher Anthony Castro.
The move comes mere hours after Cleveland dropped their season opener to the Royals.
A game in which rookie outfielder Steven Kwan drew a pair of walks, recorded a hit, and just generally looked like a major-leaguer.
Zimmer concludes his Guardians career with a .225/.310/.347 slash and 19 home runs in 263 games.
The Guardians received 26-year-old right-handed reliever Anthony Castro in return for Zimmer.
