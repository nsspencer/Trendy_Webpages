I grew up in Kansas City, Kan. That’s where I’m really from.
We had a Korn Ferry Tour event in Kansas City last year, and I asked the starter to introduce me as being from Kansas City.

     Harry Higgs continues splurge of under-par performances in Masters debuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doug StutsmanSpecial to the Augusta ChronicleHarry Higgs has one competitive round under his belt and claims to have found the answer to Augusta National.
Since 2019, seven competitors have broken par in every round of their debut, while Sungjae Im (2020) and Will Zalatoris (2021) finished as runner-up.
“I don't think it really takes more than three or four rounds around this place beforehand,” Higgs said.
Four holes play under par year after year, and those are the par 5s.
“I have another Augusta belt, and then a Trinity Forest belt,” he said.

     Blue Valley North’s Harry Higgs finishes -1 after round 1 of the Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA, Ga. — Blue Valley North grad Harry Higgs finished -1 after his first-ever round at the Masters.
“There’s nowhere else in our game like this place,” Higgs said in an interview on Masters.com.
Yes, it’s just a road with trees, but you know what that road leads to.”Higgs earned his ticket to the tournament after finishing tied for fourth at the 2021 PGA Championship.
Higgs led all golfers for a majority of the front-9 before consecutive bogeys in Amen Corner on the 11th and 12th dropped him from the top of the leaderboard.
He recovered with a birdie on the 14th and finished with pars on holes 15 through 18 to finish -1 overall.

     Summary: This was Harry Higgs during the rain delay two days ago, if you needed a millionth reason to pull for him.
After hitting the pro shop for a second time after that dream round, the Higgs family found themselves standing outside, not wanting to leave.
“One of the saddest drives is going the other direction.”Luckily, it was a bucket-list day that the Higgs family gets to relive over and over.

     Why KC’s Harry Higgs, playing in 1st Masters, made this week at Augusta a family affair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Team Higgs will be out in force at Augusta National this week, as Harry Higgs, left, has brough along younger brother Alex, right, as his caddie for his first Masters.
“I struggle to find words to describe it,” Alex Higgs said.
His odds of winning at Augusta National this weekend, per Vegas Insider, make him a bit of a longshot at +55000.
So in some ways, this Masters week was always the goal.
In December, during their first visit to Augusta National, Alex indulged his love of Masters merchandise.
