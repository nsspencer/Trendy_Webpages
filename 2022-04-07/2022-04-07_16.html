     New Season, New Mets: ‘We Just Want to Play Great Baseball.’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When healthy — a challenge right now — the Mets have two of the best pitchers in baseball in the right-handers Jacob deGrom, 33, and Max Scherzer, 37, each of whom have won multiple Cy Young Awards.
And thankfully for the Mets, they swung a trade with the Oakland Athletics in March for the right-handed starting pitcher Chris Bassitt, a 2021 All-Star.
To further overhaul the team heading into this season, the Mets spent a combined $254.5 million on outfielder Starling Marte, the outfielder and first baseman Mark Canha, infielder Eduardo Escobar and Scherzer.
“We just want to play great baseball,” Scherzer, who won the 2019 World Series with the Nationals, said before Thursday’s game.
It’s up to us to come together as a team and as a clubhouse and play well as a team and do the best we can.

     Max Scherzer 'good to go' for Mets debut at Nationals Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APWASHINGTON (AP) — Max Scherzer declared himself “good to go” for his New York Mets debut in Friday's second game of the season against the Washington Nationals, the club he helped win the 2019 World Series.
But Scherzer said he came through some fielding work just fine at Nationals Park before Thursday's game on opening day.
Scherzer became a free agent and signed a three-year, $130 million contract with the Mets, part of a big-spending offseason for owner Steve Cohen.
Loud applause greeted Scherzer when he came out of the dugout for pregame introductions before Game 1 on Thursday night.
A video tribute was shown on the outfield scoreboard, featuring clips from the news conference when he signed with the Nationals and game highlights.

     Mets' Max Scherzer To Start On Friday; Brandon Nimmo Injury Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON -- Although Max Scherzer will not pitch on Opening Day, it sounds like the Mets dodged a bullet with the availability of their interim No.
“I can’t tell you how many pitches I’m going to throw, [will] just manage what you got,” Scherzer said.
Had Scherzer been unable to pitch on Friday, this would've forced the team to bump everyone up a day.
As a result of deGrom's injury, along with Scherzer's hamstring hiccup, second-year hurler Tylor Megill will receive an unlikely nod as the Mets' Opening Day starter this season.
Brandon Nimmo, who has been dealing with neck stiffness since after the Mets' exhibition contest with the Marlins on Sunday, is out of the lineup on Opening Day.
