     Paul Casey out of Masters with back spasms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Casey withdrew from the Masters on Thursday due to back spasms.
Casey was in a grouping with Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith but was removed from the starting list after the opening round was delayed by wet conditions.
Casey, 44, who experienced back spasms at last month’s Dell Technologies Match Play, participated in the Par 3 Challenge on Wednesday.
He was below par in six of his previous eight rounds.
Casey finished 26th in the 2021 Masters and has one top-10 finish in his past five appearances at Augusta National.

     2022 Masters: Paul Casey withdraws from Masters Tournament ahead of first-round tee time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA, Ga. – Paul Casey withdrew from the Masters before he teed off for the opening round at Augusta National Golf Club with ongoing back issues.
“The back issues are persistent and thus preventing me from being able to compete,” Casey said on social media.
He conceded his first match in pool play at Austin Country Club after just two holes and never teed off for his second- and third-day matches.
This would have been the Englishman’s 16th start at the Masters, where he’s posted five top-10 finishes.
There is no alternate list at the Masters and Casey’s withdrawal leaves the field with 90 players.

     Paul Casey Withdraws From The Masters With Injury
    </h2>

     Summary: Golf Monthly Newsletter Golf tips and expert instruction, golf club reviews and the latest golf equipment.
Coming into the Masters, Paul Casey had been a bit of a doubt following his withdrawals from the Valspar Championship and WGC-Dell Technologies Championship (opens in new tab).
Due to injury, Paul Casey has officially withdrawn from the Masters Tournament prior to the start of his first round.
#themastersApril 7, 2022 See moreIt is a very unfortunate situation for Casey who, prior to the injury, had been showing glimpses of superb form.
However, following his withdrawal from the Masters (opens in new tab), it is unclear when Casey will return to competitive action, with the Englishman likely to take some time off to fully recover from the injury that has plagued him during the last month.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Casey has withdrawn from The Masters 2022 prior to teeing off in the first round on Thursday due to injury.
Casey was in 11.4 percent of lineups in the $15 entry, $4M Fantasy Golf Millionaire contest on DraftKings.
So if you’ve got any lineups in that contest, 11.4 percent of the field is essentially eliminated from contention.
Depending on how things go, we should see 6/6 and 5/6 lineups cashing in this contest.
That would be the only way we see any Casey lineups sniffing pay dirt in the $15.
