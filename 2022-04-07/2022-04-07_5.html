     2 Men Posing as Federal Agents Duped Secret Service, U.S. Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was not the first time that the conduct of members of the Secret Service had drawn intense scrutiny to the agency.
The investigation of Mr. Taherzadeh and Mr. Ali began after a letter carrier with the United States Postal Service was assaulted in March at an apartment complex where the men had been living.
The men told the inspector that they were investigators with the U.S. Special Police Investigation Unit, according to the affidavit.
The inspector also learned that Mr. Taherzadeh and Mr. Ali were in regular contact with several members of the Secret Service who lived in the same building and that the men had given them gifts, Mr. Elias wrote.
The inspector reported the information to the Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General, which referred the case to the F.B.I.
