     Summary: How (members of) Pink Floyd reunited to record a song for UkraineEnlarge this image toggle caption Matthew Eisman/Getty Images Matthew Eisman/Getty ImagesWhen the invasion of Ukraine began, singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk cut his U.S. tour short, returned home and took up arms to defend his homeland.
Now, rock legends Pink Floyd have taken Khlyvnyuk's vocals and composed a charity single around it — the band's first new original music since 1994's "Division Bell."
The track, "Hey Hey Rise Up," features 90 seconds of David Gilmour's string-bending solo, and Floyd drummer Nick Mason.
The title references the last line of the protest song: "Hey hey, rise up and rejoice."
The proceeds from the single will go to Ukrainian humanitarian relief, the band said.

     Pink Floyd joins forces with wounded Ukrainian singer in new song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – British rock band Pink Floyd will release a new song on Friday to raise money for humanitarian relief in Ukraine, featuring the vocals of a Ukrainian singer who quit an international tour to fight for his country and was wounded.
Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour said he learned that Khlyvnyuk – with whom he had previously performed – left a U.S. tour with Boombox and returned to Ukraine to join the Territorial Defence Forces.
“I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing.
Gilmour said he had a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren and he was feeling “the fury and the frustration” of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
The track, which samples Khlyvnyuk singing a World War One protest song, also features Nick Mason, a founding member of Pink Floyd, as well as Gilmour and other musicians.
