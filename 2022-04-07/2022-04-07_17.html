     Summary: (CNN) Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey had a bit of a bumpy road before heading down the aisle together.
The couple, who host "Love Is Blind" spinoff "The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On," which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, admitted on the series that at one point after getting serious, they broke up.
"I always said I was going to be that girl that would never give a man an ultimatum," Vanessa says in a clip from the show, adding that eventually she gave Lachey an ultimatum.
They both ended up seeing one other person during their break.
Lachey says the split gave him perspective, while Vanessa said she also realized her love was with Nick.

     Summary: The answer is “Yes, absolutely”, and it is delivered in the form of The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On.
Homosexuality has not yet entered the Lacheyean universe, although they have promised a second season with an LGBT cast).
“A” denotes blondness, “B” denotes not-blondness and that is literally everything covered that matters in this show.
The couples are split up and encouraged to lounge round a pool, have dinner, drink cocktails and see if they “spark” with anyone else.
Then they choose a new partner to live with for three weeks before returning to their beloved, and deciding whether to shit or – I mean, marry or move on.

     Netflix’s The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On Offers a Sadistic Twist on Reality Romance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It features six established couples, all made up of pairs in which one has given the other an ultimatum to propose or break up.
What’s crazier is this: Ultimatum has each couple pretend to break up, then makes every contestant enter a three-week “trial marriage” with another “newly single” contestant.
Both strangers have to choose each other mutually to enter this trial marriage.
Temptation Island, like The Ultimatum, is also ridiculous—but in its defense, the older show has the benefit of being self-aware.
And yes, dating around is a mechanism for genuine self-discovery and clarity, and some of the clarity appearing to happen on Ultimatum may be legit.
