     Mark Wahlberg's Revolting Method For A Body Transformation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark Wahlberg, who famously rises from sleep at about 2:30 am to squeeze in the first of his many daily workouts, took quite a turn for his upcoming movie, Father Stu.
Online, the former Marky Mark revealed his menu, which included a daily glass of olive oil.
Major yikes:“I wasn’t eating anything that you would think, ‘Oh my God, I get to sit on the couch and eat ice cream and pizzas.’ I tried to do it in a healthy way.
It was a dozen eggs and a dozen pieces of bacon, two baked potatoes, a Porterhouse steak, two bowls of white rice, and a glass of olive oil.
Previously, Wahlberg called the diet “fun for about an hour” and more difficult than losing weight would be for a role.

     Summary: Mark Wahlberg's approach to imparting his deep Catholic faith to his children is more about living it than mandating it.
"But even with my faith, I don't force it on them.
TODAY's Carson Daly is another dad of four who has been upfront about the importance of his Catholic faith in his life to the point where he almost became a priest.
He shared with Wahlberg on Thursday that he learned about "Father Stu" from being on the Catholic meditation app Hallow while praying during this holy season of Lent.
"I just felt it was also the best way to make the movie without any kind of interference," he said.
