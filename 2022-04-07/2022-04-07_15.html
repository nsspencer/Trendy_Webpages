     Mark Wahlberg's Revolting Method For A Body Transformation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark Wahlberg, who famously rises from sleep at about 2:30 am to squeeze in the first of his many daily workouts, took quite a turn for his upcoming movie, Father Stu.
Online, the former Marky Mark revealed his menu, which included a daily glass of olive oil.
Major yikes:“I wasn’t eating anything that you would think, ‘Oh my God, I get to sit on the couch and eat ice cream and pizzas.’ I tried to do it in a healthy way.
It was a dozen eggs and a dozen pieces of bacon, two baked potatoes, a Porterhouse steak, two bowls of white rice, and a glass of olive oil.
Previously, Wahlberg called the diet “fun for about an hour” and more difficult than losing weight would be for a role.

     Inside Mark Wahlberg’s Mansion, Which Hit the Market for$87.5 Million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark Wahlberg’s latest movie, Father Stu, is about to hit theaters, and at the same time, he’s teasing a film about a Boston sports legend.
Wahlberg’s mansion is on the market, and it’s not cheap.
In either scenario, Wahlberg’s net worth figures to remain in a very healthy place.
Between the acting, producing, and restaurant business, Mark Wahlberg has several streams of income and a hefty net worth of $300 million.
If Wahlberg’s mansion sells for what he’s asking, that net worth could soon be on the rise.

     Mark Wahlberg Hints at Leaving Hollywood as He Lists $90 Million Estate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Asked when the curtains will close on his Hollywood career, the actor teased, "sooner rather than later, probably."
Wahlberg is dad to Ella, 18, Michael, 16, Brendan, 13, and Grace, 12, whom he shares with wife Rhea Durham.
TMZ reported Wednesday that the actor has listed the estate, which features 30,500 square feet of living space, for $87.5 million.
It is unclear why Wahlberg is listing his home, though it seems that he isn't quite ready to walk away from Hollywood just yet.
Wahlberg said the film is "really touching everybody who sees it because we're all going through something."

     Summary: Mark Wahlberg's approach to imparting his deep Catholic faith to his children is more about living it than mandating it.
"But even with my faith, I don't force it on them.
TODAY's Carson Daly is another dad of four who has been upfront about the importance of his Catholic faith in his life to the point where he almost became a priest.
He shared with Wahlberg on Thursday that he learned about "Father Stu" from being on the Catholic meditation app Hallow while praying during this holy season of Lent.
"I just felt it was also the best way to make the movie without any kind of interference," he said.
