     Here's What Dansby Swanson Said Before The Braves Played the Reds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Braves took the field on Thursday evening to face off with the Cincinnati Reds for their first game of the 2022 MLB season.
It's also their first time taking the field since they won the 2021 World Series, and their first time playing without Freddie Freeman (now on the Los Angeles Dodgers) on the roster since 2010.
Before the game, former MLB Draft first overall pick Dansby Swanson spoke to the media.
"You have to understand and recognize the accomplishment and the achievement that we had last year," Swanson said.
After three games against the Reds, they will play another three games at home when they host the Washington Nationals.

     Opening Day for Atlanta Braves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Share with friendsIt was a tumultuous off-season for the World Series reigning champions, but the 2022 MLB season is finally here, and the Atlanta Braves will take the field at Truist Park to square off against the Cincinnati Reds in the season/home opener at 8 pm.
Once the victory parade was complete after winning the World Series last October, the Braves went into the off-season with several questions hanging over their heads.
It was the ninth time the two sides had clashed and created a work stoppage, and postponed the start of the 2022 season.
In the following weeks, the Braves roster made some changes, the biggest being the signing of Matt Olson to play first base, with former Braves favorite, Freddie Freeman, taking his talents to the West Coast.
The Braves will use a starting pitching rotation of six, as they donâ€™t have a day off for the first two weeks of the season, with Max Fried taking the mound tonight.

Exactly 156 days after the Atlanta Braves won last season's World Series, they showed off a new year on their lengthy collection of red, white and blue pennants Thursday night.
The four red ones denote each of the Braves' World Series wins in franchise history, dating back to their time in Boston.
Just after the banner was revealed, two members of the Braves' 1995 World Series winning team -- the franchise's previous champion -- were welcomed onto the field.
Positioned on a podium in the infield grass just behind Jones was the trophy from last fall's World Series win.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Reds struck first in the first game of this, the 2022 Major League Baseball season that finally, mercifully got around to getting started.
That proved to be a lead the Reds would never relinquish.
The inningâ€™s initial out came on a Stephenson sac-fly into RF that allowed Aristides Aquino to trot home, and it was a 3-0 lead for the Reds behind a cruising Tyler Mahle.
That cruise ended in the Bottom of the 3rd, however, as Mahle ran into a bout of wildness.
The Reds finally chased Max Fried in the Top of the 6th, and did so after the Reds had again blooped their way into a pair of baserunners.
