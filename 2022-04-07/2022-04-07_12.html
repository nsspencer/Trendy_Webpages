     Opening Day 2022: Houston Astros Three Biggest Weaknesses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Opening Day finally here, the Astros enter the 2022 season as the favorites to win the American League West.
But like every team in the majors, no roster is perfect.
Everyone is always looking for that extra piece that could help get them over the edge, but sometimes it’s hard to tell pre-season what that will be.
It only becomes more clear as the first half of the season lurches on and player performances no longer become small sample sizes but true reflections of what they are capable of.
With that said, here are the three spots on the Houston Astros team that you could see struggle to perform and may need to be addressed during the season to improve the team.

     Summary: Many teams tried it out during spring training games and came away with mixed reviews.
The Astros pointed a center-field camera at the catcher, decoded his signs, and relayed them to hitters by banging a trash can.
I think it’s going to serve a good purpose for what it’s supposed to do.”Odorizzi is one of the only Astros pitchers who experimented with PitchCom in spring training.
“I think it’s more so the catchers getting comfortable with it as opposed to the pitchers,” Odorizzi said.
Odorizzi had no problem hearing it during his bullpen session — but that was on a back field at an empty spring training complex.

     The Starting Nine’s Predictions and X-Factors for the Astros’ 2022 Season.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Probably the best team the Astros have fielded during this time is the 2019 squad, and since then the Astros have lost superstars George Springer, Gerritt Cole, Zack Greinke, and of course, Carlos Correa.
But for what it’s worth, he was one of the team’s top producers in this year’s shortened Spring season.
I am cautiously optimistic that one or more young pitchers in the minors will help the Astros address bullpen issues.
X-Factor: As I said days ago, the starting rotation will play a huge role for the Astros in 2022.
Robert Flores was on the Locked On Astros podcast and he thinks that Bregman and Lance McCullers could be the keys to the 2022 season.
