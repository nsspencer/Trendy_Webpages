    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Columbus Clippers 1, Lehigh Valley IronPigs 6Box Score · Clippers fall to 0-2There wasn’t much to celebrate offensively for this game as the Clippers collected just two hits in the entire game.
The first hit was a first-pitch single from Gabriel Arias, who promptly stole second base.
A rehabbing Josh Naylor walked, then Arias scored on a fielding error to put Columbus up 1-0 in the first inning.
Richard Palacios added a double later in the game and Naylor walked again to account for pretty much every baserunner.
His final line was 4.2 innings pitched, three runs allowed on six hits with three strikeouts and one walk.

     Norman Powell leads Clippers to win in return from injury, says LA can be 'really dangerous' in postseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His return came just three games before the Clippers are set to play in next week's play-in as the eighth-placed team in the West.
"I think we can be really dangerous," Powell told ESPN after the Clippers' third straight win.
With this being their first game together, George and Powell combined for 43 points, including going 18-for-21 together from the free throw line.
But Powell is getting some 2018-19 Toronto Raptors vibes from this Clippers team with the veteran defensive versatility and offensive firepower on the roster.
"The foot has been feeling good," Powell said.

     Norman Powell’s return has Clippers feeling deep, dangerous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even without Powell – and All-Stars Kawhi Leonard and, until last week, Paul George – the Clippers stayed in play-in position.
Now, with two regular-season games left, Tuesday’s play-in game bearing down and George and Powell are back, the Clippers (40-40) like what they see when they look in the mirror.
It helps, Powell and Lue agreed, that Portland utilized many of the same plays and schemes under former Clipper assistant Chauncey Billups.
Still, as patient as the Clippers might be, Powell was not: “I hate missing games,” he said.
“Should just be a one-game thing, I think,” Lue said, with an eye on Saturday’s game against Sacramento.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the end of a season filled with lengthy injury reports, the Clippers are at their healthiest at the most important time.
“Norm always can get to the free-throw line.”It’s one reason George said he wanted to play off the ball during his first minutes with Powell, to help Powell acclimate himself.
Saturday’s game against Sacramento will feature one lineup of Marcus Morris, Nicolas Batum, George, Powell and Covington, Lue said.
Clippers Return of Paul George sparks defensive uptick for Clippers In the three games Paul George has played since returning from an elbow injury, coach Tyronn Lue has noticed an uptick in the Clippers’ defensive mentality.
Healthy again, Powell said he sees an intriguing future for the Clippers, a glimpse of which will begin with next week’s play-in tournament.
