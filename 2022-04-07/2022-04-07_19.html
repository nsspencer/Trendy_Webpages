     Mets Give Update on Jacob deGrom’s Injury Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets placed starting pitcher Jacob deGrom on the 10-day injured list Thursday ahead of their Opening Day tilt with the Nationals.
The New York ace suffered a stress reaction in his right scapula toward the end of spring training, so his appearance on the injured list to begin the year does not come as a surprise.
Despite only being on the 10-day injured list to start the year, deGrom won’t resume throwing for at least a month, the team announced on April 1.
As for deGrom, the stress reaction in his shoulder is the latest injury to affect his availability at the top of the New York rotation.
He missed the second half of last season after spraining his right throwing arm in early July.

     Ace Max Scherzer (hamstring) says he's 'good to go' for New York Mets on Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON -- Max Scherzer declared himself "good to go" for his New York Mets debut in Friday's second game of the season against the Washington Nationals, the club he helped win the 2019 World Series.
But Scherzer said he came through some fielding work just fine at Nationals Park before Thursday's game on opening day.
Scherzer became a free agent and signed a three-year, $130 million contract with the Mets, part of a big-spending offseason for owner Steve Cohen.
Loud applause greeted Scherzer when he came out of the dugout for pregame introductions before Game 1 on Thursday night.
There always will be good memories here," Scherzer said.
