    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel appears to be incredibly frustrated with the San Francisco 49ers.
Samuel has made several big changes to his Instagram profile.

That may be the biggest holdup for a Deebo Samuel extension.

     Deebo Samuel Unfollows 49ers on Instagram, Changes Profile Picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And on Thursday, it was noticed that 49ers star Deebo Samuel may be unhappy in his current situation.
But after McAfee pointed this out, Samuel removed the profile picture of himself in a San Francisco uniform and left the space blank.
And Buffalo‚Äôs Stefon Diggs signed a four-year extension worth up to $104 million, with $70 million guaranteed on Thursday.
Samuel is certainly worth similar money, and this may have been him gently reminding the 49ers that he‚Äôs not to be played with.

     49ers' Deebo Samuel removes pictures, unfollows team on social media; WR entering final year of rookie deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both moves had to do with money, and there are other star wide receivers looking for new deals who could be on the move next.
Samuel is entering the final year of his rookie deal, along with other star receivers like DK Metcalf, Terry McLaurin and A.J.
Samuel is coming off of a career year, in which he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns.
If you recall, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray also did one of these social media scrubs earlier this offseason.
The star wideout surely wants a new deal, but with all of the movement we have seen this offseason, it's best to be on your toes.

     Deebo Samuel sure seems pissed at 49ers after social media actions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having removed 49ers references on his social media, Deebo Samuel certainly seems to be at odds with his employer amid what are likely contract talks.
At any rate, it sure appears as if All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel and the San Francisco 49ers are going through a bit of a fight right now.
Why is Deebo Samuel scrubbing 49ers off his social media?
And let‚Äôs state the obvious: It‚Äôs his social media, and he can do whatever he wants with it.
Also, there‚Äôs the possibility (albeit unlikely) Samuel clearing all Niners stuff off his social media has nothing major to do with football-related situations.
