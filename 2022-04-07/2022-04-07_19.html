     49ers' Deebo Samuel deletes team from his Instagram
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leon Halip/Getty ImagesThere's understandable panic among San Francisco 49ers fans on Thursday after onlookers noticed that star receiver Deebo Samuel has removed nearly all connection to the Niners from his Instagram, including removing the team from his bio and changing his profile picture to an all-black image.
Samuel was expected to receive a contract extension with the team this offseason as he enters the final year of his rookie deal.
That hasn't transpired, and Samuel's IG antics seem to be in direct contrast to any sort of progress on the contract front.
That being said, as Ari Meirov of Pro Football Focus noted, there’s always the possibility that this means absolutely nothing.
Regardless, it happened, and it's notable.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAs more and more receivers get paid, others who are due to get paid will expect to get paid.
49ers receiver Deebo Samuel has removed all traces of the 49ers from his Instagram page.
Samuel became a Pro Bowler and a first-team All Pro during his third season, with 1,405 receiving yards and 365 rushing yards.
Of course, if they were to trade or release quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, they’d instantly pick up another $25 million, instantly.
That would come in handy, given that the 49ers need to get new deals done both with Samuel and defensive end Nick Bosa.

     Deebo Samuel Unfollows 49ers on Instagram, Changes Profile Picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And on Thursday, it was noticed that 49ers star Deebo Samuel may be unhappy in his current situation.
But after McAfee pointed this out, Samuel removed the profile picture of himself in a San Francisco uniform and left the space blank.
And Buffalo’s Stefon Diggs signed a four-year extension worth up to $104 million, with $70 million guaranteed on Thursday.
Samuel is certainly worth similar money, and this may have been him gently reminding the 49ers that he’s not to be played with.

     49ers' Deebo Samuel removes pictures, unfollows team on social media; WR entering final year of rookie deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both moves had to do with money, and there are other star wide receivers looking for new deals who could be on the move next.
Samuel is entering the final year of his rookie deal, along with other star receivers like DK Metcalf, Terry McLaurin and A.J.
Samuel is coming off of a career year, in which he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns.
If you recall, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray also did one of these social media scrubs earlier this offseason.
The star wideout surely wants a new deal, but with all of the movement we have seen this offseason, it's best to be on your toes.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having removed 49ers references on his social media, Deebo Samuel certainly seems to be at odds with his employer amid what are likely contract talks.
At any rate, it sure appears as if All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel and the San Francisco 49ers are going through a bit of a fight right now.
Why is Deebo Samuel scrubbing 49ers off his social media?
And let’s state the obvious: It’s his social media, and he can do whatever he wants with it.
Also, there’s the possibility (albeit unlikely) Samuel clearing all Niners stuff off his social media has nothing major to do with football-related situations.

     Deebo Samuel's Instagram scrub not major, but not nothing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel, in the midst of the first offseason where he’s eligible for an extension, scrubbed his Instagram of virtually anything 49ers related.
First, Samuel’s positional value is impossible to determine because of his dual contributions as a wide receiver and running back.
Third, the 49ers might have some reservations about Samuel’s ability to stay healthy if he’s catching four passes per game and running it seven times.
That brings us to Samuel’s Instagram account.
The IG alterations are likely a result of negotiations which is worth paying attention to, but the panic button on whether he’ll be with the team next season shouldn’t be dusted off just yet.
