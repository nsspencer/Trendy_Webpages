     Ezra Miller's future projects with DC reportedly put on hold following his arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Miller's upcoming films face an uncertain future following the actor's arrest in Hawaii.
Reports suggest that the actor's arrest could jeopardise his projects with Warner Bros and DC.
Miller plays superhero Flash in DC Universe films.
His scheduled public appearances to support the DC Cinematic Universe too have been put on hold.
Miller then reportedly “began yelling obscenities and at one point grabbed the microphone from a 23-year-old woman singing karaoke…and later lunged at a 32-year-old man playing darts.”

     Actor's Days as the Flash in the DCEU Might Be Limited
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's everything you need to know about Miller's arrest, the Warner Bros. meeting, and what it all means for the future of the DCEU.
This was all enough, according to Rolling Stone, for Warner Bros. executives to hold a meeting about Miller's future with the franchise.
The meeting reportedly happened on March 30, with the executives deciding to pause Miller's future projects with the studio.
Plus, fans have been blasting social media with calls to replace the big-screen Flash (Miller) with the small-screen Flash (Gustin), so maybe that's the fan-friendly fix here.
Since The Flash doesn't hit theaters until June 23, 2023, this situation is surely far from its end, whether it means Warner Bros. keeping or replacing Miller.

     Replacing Ezra Miller With Grant Gustin In ‘The Flash’ Is Too Weird To Work
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if Warner Bros. is not moving forward with Miller, fans have a very specific idea of who could replace them.
Fans are rallying to say Gustin deserves a chance to shine on the big screen with a real, non-CW budget.
SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 26: In this handout photo provided by Warner Bros, Grant Gustin of "The Flash" ... [+] attends Comic-Con International 2014 on July 26, 2014 in San Diego, California.
Seeing Grant Gustin alone zapped into the DCEU to play a different version of a character he’s already played for eight years and a hundred hours is just extremely weird to process.
It’s much easier to imagine replacing Miller with another young actor for a fresh start.
