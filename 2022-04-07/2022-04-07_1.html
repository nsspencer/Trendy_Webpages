     Europa League Live Result Updates: Barcelona vs Frankfurt and West Ham vs Lyon end in 1-1 draws, Ruiz goal gives Braga win over Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A crucial goal from Jarrod Bowen helped West Ham battle to a 1-1 draw at home to Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals, having played the entire second-half with 10 men.
In a fiery encounter at The London Stadium, drama struck right at the end of the first-half, when Aaron Cresswell was given a straight red card for bringing down Moussa Dembele on the edge of the West Ham box.
Bowen scored a fortuitous goal at the start of the second period to put West Ham in front, but on-loan Tottenham man Tanguy Ndombele equalised from close range 15 minutes later.
An own goal from Davide Zappacosta following a missed penalty from Andre Silva saw that game end 1-1 as well.
Abel Ruiz scored the decisive goal after the hosts had a goal disallowed by VAR.

     Xavi: Barcelona “didn’t play a good game” in Europa League draw with Frankfurt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona manager Xavi was not happy with his team’s performance in their 1-1 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.
The former Barcelona midfielder said that his players must “criticise themselves” after they “didn’t play a good game”.
Despite the criticism of his team’s performance, Xavi also said: “We leave satisfied with the result.”The hosts took the lead early in the second half after a wondrous long-range shot by Ansgar Knauff.
Barcelona had the chance to capitalise when Frankfurt went down to 10 men with 12 minutes left to play.
The winner of the second leg will meet either West Ham or Lyon in the semi-finals.

     Summary: The West Ham manager was more interested in talking about how his side restricted Lyon.
It will stand West Ham in good stead when this Europa League quarter-final resumes at Stade de Gerland next week.
They are an experienced team and were quicker to settle than West Ham, who were in their first European quarter-final since 1981.
West Ham deserved better.
West Ham had finally cracked.

     Summary: A goal right after halftime from Ansgar Knauff was canceled out by Ferran Torres scoring from a lovely build-up play.
While Creswell won't be available for the second leg in France, West Ham have shown before that they can't be counted out of any match.
Match of the day: Feyenoord 3, Slavia Praha 3This one game nearly produced as many goals as all four Europa League games combined.
Four chances created, a wonderful assist and an absolute stunner of a goal gave his side a one-goal advantage heading into the second leg at PAOK.
Biggest disappointment: RangersLosing 1-0 to Braga isn't great when you consider that Rangers' most likely route to the Champions League is by winning the Europa League.
