     Summary: Seiya Suzuki connected for his first big-league hit on a single to left field and showed his awareness with heads-up base running.
A pop up off Jason Heyward’s bat fell for a hit when the Brewers couldn’t make a play on it near the second base hole.
Suzuki hustled from first-to-third on the play and scored the Cubs’ first run on Patrick Wisdom’s sacrifice fly.

     Cubs Set Balanced Opening Day Roster, Mills to IL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have set their Opening Day 28-man roster, but they didn’t make any cuts to get down from 31.
Instead, three players have been placed on the 10-day injured list, all retroactive to April 4.
We already knew Wade Miley (left elbow inflammation) and Andrelton Simmons (right shoulder inflammation) would be in that group, but Alec Mills (low back strain) was unexpected.
That opens the door for Keegan Thompson to take a spot in the rotation for at least the first turn.
Alfonso Rivas has made the roster as well and will provide a lefty bat at first.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opening Day is finally here and the Red Sox/Yankees game being postponed means Cubs are playing the first game of the MLB season.
Rafael Ortega will lead off as the DH, followed by Nick Madrigal batting and playing second, then Willson Contreras behind the plate.
Kyle Hendricks is on the mound to make his third consecutive Opening Day start, the best of which came against the Brewers back in 2020.
Hendricks looked as sharp as ever en route to a complete-game shutout that got the season off to an incredible start.
He’s had difficulty finding his groove early in games, which is where the weather and the Brewers lineup might help.

Their fortunes turned with ex-Brewer Daniel Norris on the mound, as he allowed a leadoff double to Cain and then walked Mike Brosseau.
Cain followed with a grounder to first base that Frank Schwindel didn't handle cleanly, allowing McCutchen to score.
Burnes then worked around a leadoff double and a walk in the second before recovering to strike out the side in the third.
Hendricks exited in the fifth after allowing a leadoff single to Rowdy Tellez and getting Renfroe to pop out with Narváez due up.
