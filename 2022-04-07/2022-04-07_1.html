    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA, Ga. — The sun emerged through a narrow opening in a cloud-filled sky as Tiger Woods approached the first tee on Thursday at the Masters Tournament.
Roughly five hours later, Woods marched up the 18th fairway to resounding applause, not only an acknowledgment of his successful return to competitive golf, but also recognition that he had done so at a more-than-commendable level.
In his first professional round in 17 months, Woods shot a gritty, plucky one-under-par 71 with three birdies and two bogeys.
To be sure, he looked rusty, and many of his usually dependable iron shots came up short of easily reachable greens.
He was erratic off the tee with his driver and played Augusta National’s par 3s in two under and the par 5s in even par, the reverse of his usual pattern.

     Summary: It’s a tradition unlike any other: players dressing to impress at the Masters.
Augusta National may be old-fashioned, but that doesn’t mean that the pros will tone down their outfit choices at the biggest event of the year.
It makes perfect sense — millions of golf fans and non-golf fans tune in to the first major of the year, so why wouldn’t golf brands want to make a splash with an eye-catching shirt or pair of shoes?

     Summary: The effort required just to get to this point, Michael Rosenberg writes, was extensive for Tiger Woods.
Adam Cairns-Augusta Chronicle/USA TodayAUGUSTA, Ga. – If you were wondering whether you would see that old Tiger Woods magic or an old, limping Tiger Woods, the answer was yes.
In his first true competitive round since November 2020, Woods shot 71, which was, incredibly, right on his previous average for a Masters round (70.87).
1, he was Tiger Woods and this was Augusta National and nothing else mattered.
That is the difference between a future World Golf Hall of Famer and Tiger Woods.

     Summary: In between his last round of competitive golf at the Masters in November 2020 and this first round of the 2022 Masters, Woods had yet another back surgery and nearly lost his leg.
After five consecutive pars to start his round, Tiger nearly stared an ace into the hole at No.
They've seen the pictures, and they've come over to the house and they've seen it," said Woods after his round.
It would certainly have been easier for Woods to sit at home with his family to watch this Masters and text J.T.
But if you witnessed or watched Woods' round, you'll remember it as one that was bigger than the day and the week.
