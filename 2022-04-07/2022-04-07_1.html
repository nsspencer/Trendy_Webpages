     Summary: “It doesn’t matter who you suit up against, every team has as an opportunity to beat you and every team feels like they’re going into the season with a chance to win,” Ross said.
“So I don’t want to undersell any one team or oversell one team.
We have to go out and play our best brand of baseball.
One thing I know about baseball is any team can win any day, and we want to go in and whether it’s in our division or outside of it, we’re going to try to win all of them.”

     Summary: Seiya Suzuki connected for his first big-league hit on a single to left field and showed his awareness with heads-up base running.
A pop up off Jason Heyward’s bat fell for a hit when the Brewers couldn’t make a play on it near the second base hole.
Suzuki hustled from first-to-third on the play and scored the Cubs’ first run on Patrick Wisdom’s sacrifice fly.

     Cubs Set Balanced Opening Day Roster, Mills to IL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have set their Opening Day 28-man roster, but they didn’t make any cuts to get down from 31.
Instead, three players have been placed on the 10-day injured list, all retroactive to April 4.
We already knew Wade Miley (left elbow inflammation) and Andrelton Simmons (right shoulder inflammation) would be in that group, but Alec Mills (low back strain) was unexpected.
That opens the door for Keegan Thompson to take a spot in the rotation for at least the first turn.
Alfonso Rivas has made the roster as well and will provide a lefty bat at first.

     Summary: Opening Day is finally here and the Red Sox/Yankees game being postponed means Cubs are playing the first game of the MLB season.
Rafael Ortega will lead off as the DH, followed by Nick Madrigal batting and playing second, then Willson Contreras behind the plate.
Kyle Hendricks is on the mound to make his third consecutive Opening Day start, the best of which came against the Brewers back in 2020.
Hendricks looked as sharp as ever en route to a complete-game shutout that got the season off to an incredible start.
He’s had difficulty finding his groove early in games, which is where the weather and the Brewers lineup might help.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs hosted the Milwaukee Brewers for the first game of a season delayed a week by the Major League Baseball lockout.
It’s been quite some time since the trio has been to Opening Day as a pack.
In advance of the early start, Cubs fans were imbibing plenty in the face of the cold.
Cubs fans could drink up to 10 bottles of Malört on an inclement day, and roughly half that if the weather gets better.
The Gman Tavern, 3740 N. Clark St., opened early Thursday and was packed with Cubs fans before the game.
