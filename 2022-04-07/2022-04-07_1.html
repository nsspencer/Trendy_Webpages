     Two Guys Allegedly Posed As Federal Agents And Tricked The Secret Service
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two men were arrested in Washington, DC, on Wednesday after they allegedly tricked Secret Service agents, including one on the first lady's security detail, into believing that they were members of the Department of Homeland Security.
They were said to have provided four Secret Service agents and at least one DHS employee with iPhones, a drone, a flat-screen TV, a generator, a gun case, and rent-free apartments worth more than $40,000 per year.
Per court documents, they also let the federal agents use a black GMX SUV that they falsely said was an "official government vehicle."
Taherzadeh was said to have offered to purchase a $2,000 assault rifle for a Secret Service agent on Jill Biden's security detail.
Taherzadeh also sent selfies and photos of himself wearing police tactical gear to actual federal agents.

     Summary: WASHINGTON - At least four U.S. Secret Service employees have been placed on leave related to their association with two men and a scheme to provide the federal officers with tens of thousands of dollars in rent-free apartments and other gratuities.
Federal authorities alleged that Taherzadeh provided Secret Service members and a Homeland Security employee with more than $40,000 in rent-free apartments at an up-scale D.C. complex, smartphones, surveillance systems, a flat-screen television and assorted law enforcement paraphernalia.
In one case, Taherzadeh allegedly offered to purchase a $2,000 assault rifle for a Secret Service agent assigned to the protective detail of first lady Jill Biden.
In a brief statement Thursday, the Secret Service said it was cooperating with the "ongoing investigation."
"All personnel involved in this matter are on administrative leave and are restricted from accessing Secret Service facilities, equipment, and systems," the agency said.
