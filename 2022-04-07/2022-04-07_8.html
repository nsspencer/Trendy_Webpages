     New Season, New Mets: ‘We Just Want to Play Great Baseball.’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When healthy — a challenge right now — the Mets have two of the best pitchers in baseball in the right-handers Jacob deGrom, 33, and Max Scherzer, 37, each of whom have won multiple Cy Young Awards.
And thankfully for the Mets, they swung a trade with the Oakland Athletics in March for the right-handed starting pitcher Chris Bassitt, a 2021 All-Star.
To further overhaul the team heading into this season, the Mets spent a combined $254.5 million on outfielder Starling Marte, the outfielder and first baseman Mark Canha, infielder Eduardo Escobar and Scherzer.
“We just want to play great baseball,” Scherzer, who won the 2019 World Series with the Nationals, said before Thursday’s game.
It’s up to us to come together as a team and as a clubhouse and play well as a team and do the best we can.

     Max Scherzer 'good to go' for Mets debut at Nationals Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APWASHINGTON (AP) — Max Scherzer declared himself “good to go” for his New York Mets debut in Friday's second game of the season against the Washington Nationals, the club he helped win the 2019 World Series.
But Scherzer said he came through some fielding work just fine at Nationals Park before Thursday's game on opening day.
Scherzer became a free agent and signed a three-year, $130 million contract with the Mets, part of a big-spending offseason for owner Steve Cohen.
Loud applause greeted Scherzer when he came out of the dugout for pregame introductions before Game 1 on Thursday night.
A video tribute was shown on the outfield scoreboard, featuring clips from the news conference when he signed with the Nationals and game highlights.

     Mets' Tylor Megill Shatters Expectations In Opening Day Victory Over Nationals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The right-hander took the mound as the Mets' starting pitcher on Opening Day as an improbable replacement for injured ace Jacob deGrom.
Megill and Nationals left-handed starter Patrick Corbin matched each other with zeroes through four.
Robinson Cano drew a walk, which then saw Mark Canha line an RBI single into left center to put the Mets up 3-0.
Jeff McNeil went back-to-back with Canha for an RBI single of his own, which scored another run for the Mets.
Davis led off with a double, before Francisco Lindor drove him home with an RBI single to the opposite field.
