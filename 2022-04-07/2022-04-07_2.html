Hoerner and Nick Madrigal have an opportunity to show they are important pieces to the future.
They bring a contact-hitting element that was missing too often last season.
Both players will need to overcome their injury history and be a regular presence in the lineup.

     Summary: But Thursday was his first time on an Opening Day roster.
As the Cubs announced their roster, they also placed three players on the 10-day injured list.
Carrying 14 position players, the Cubs broke camp with all six outfielders who were vying for spots on the roster.
In the infield, Rivas takes Simmons’ active roster spot, providing depth at first base and even outfield if needed.
“To be honest, I really believe in the group that we have right now,” Cubs catcher Willson Contreras said, despite low external expectations for the club.

Lorenzo Cain drove in a pair of runs and even newcomer Victor Caratini contributed a double in his first Brewers at-bat.
The Brewers fell to 28-25-1 on opening day, 16-16-1 opening on the road and 12-12-1 since joining the NL in 1998.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have set their Opening Day 28-man roster, but they didn’t make any cuts to get down from 31.
Instead, three players have been placed on the 10-day injured list, all retroactive to April 4.
We already knew Wade Miley (left elbow inflammation) and Andrelton Simmons (right shoulder inflammation) would be in that group, but Alec Mills (low back strain) was unexpected.
That opens the door for Keegan Thompson to take a spot in the rotation for at least the first turn.
Alfonso Rivas has made the roster as well and will provide a lefty bat at first.

     Summary: It might turn out to be something like 2013 or 2014, he said, when the Cubs stunk but Kris Bryant kept Cubs fans’ hearts warm by tearing up minor-league pitching.
If it walks like a rebuild and talks like a rebuild, it’s probably going to tank like a rebuild.
Nothing disguises a teardown like a victory in the opener, so the Cubs’ 5-4 victory over the Brewers and reigning National League Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes was something Cubs fans could cheer about in the moment.
When former Cubs president Theo Epstein unveiled his goal of “sustained success’’ in October, 2011, we thought he meant long-term success.
I think we have a roster that we can do that.’’Stay strong, Cubs fans.
