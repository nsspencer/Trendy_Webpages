     DC fans push to have Grant Gustin replace Ezra Miller as The Flash in the DCEU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Miller will appear in the upcoming blockbuster “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” but their future as The Flash seems uncertain.
Last month, Miller was arrested, and also charged with both harassment and disorderly conduct in Hilo, Hawaii, Variety reported.
Now DC fans are once again petitioning to have Grant Gustin — who plays The CW’s Arrowverse version of the character in “The Flash” (2014 TV series) — replace Miller.
Miller has played the character briefly in the DC Extended Universe’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” (2016).
The news of Miller’s uncertain future as The Flash got Grant Gustin trending on Twitter, with fans once again advocating for the actor to replace them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans are moving as fast as the speed of lightning to call for “The Flash” star Grant Gustin to replace embattled Ezra Miller in the upcoming WB film adaption of the DC superhero.
Gustin, 32, has portrayed Barry Allen/The Flash on the CW series of the same name since 2014, and the show was recently renewed for a ninth season.
“Give [the role] to grant gustin please god that man is so good he deserves better than a show with a $5 budget,” someone joked, comparing the CW show to the bigger-budget WB film.
They should recast Ezra Miller with ‘Grant Gustin’ #GrantIsTheFlash#DC,” a fan exclaimed, while another called Gustin an “obvious” replacement.
“Grant Gustin is an obvious choice to replace Ezra Miller,” the user tweeted.

     Summary: Here's everything you need to know about Miller's arrest, the Warner Bros. meeting, and what it all means for the future of the DCEU.
This was all enough, according to Rolling Stone, for Warner Bros. executives to hold a meeting about Miller's future with the franchise.
The meeting reportedly happened on March 30, with the executives deciding to pause Miller's future projects with the studio.
Plus, fans have been blasting social media with calls to replace the big-screen Flash (Miller) with the small-screen Flash (Gustin), so maybe that's the fan-friendly fix here.
Since The Flash doesn't hit theaters until June 23, 2023, this situation is surely far from its end, whether it means Warner Bros. keeping or replacing Miller.

     Replacing Ezra Miller With Grant Gustin In ‘The Flash’ Is Too Weird To Work
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And if Warner Bros. is not moving forward with Miller, fans have a very specific idea of who could replace them.
Fans are rallying to say Gustin deserves a chance to shine on the big screen with a real, non-CW budget.
SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 26: In this handout photo provided by Warner Bros, Grant Gustin of "The Flash" ... [+] attends Comic-Con International 2014 on July 26, 2014 in San Diego, California.
Seeing Grant Gustin alone zapped into the DCEU to play a different version of a character he’s already played for eight years and a hundred hours is just extremely weird to process.
It’s much easier to imagine replacing Miller with another young actor for a fresh start.
