     MLB Opening Day 2022: Seats available at most games, while weather will delay others
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welcome to Opening Day.
The Atlanta Braves, the defending World Series champions, have standing room only tickets available for both Thursday’s opener and Friday and Saturday’s games against Cincinnati.
Nationals-Mets in Washington still offered thousands of available tickets in roughly 95 of 100 sections, and the upper sections of Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City featured thousands of available seats.
Another sign this is an Opening Day like no other: Quiet streets in Cincinnati.
Days later, the allotment was sold out, showing a delayed Opening Day is certainly better than none at all.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 MLB season begins at 1:20 with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Chicago Cubs.
A total of six former Tigers are on Opening Day rosters.
Bregman was limited to just 91 games last season which is the fewest games he’s played in a non-rookie or COVID-shortened season.
While Alex Lange got the call up last season and appeared in 36 games for the other Tigers, he’s earned a spot in Detroit’s opening day roster and will work out of the bullpen.
The Nola brothers met last season in San Diego and Aaron got the better of Austin, striking him out in three pitches.

     Summary: And here's the pitch ... MLB season officially begins todayEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Hoffmann/AP Reed Hoffmann/APMajor League Baseball's opening day is finally here.
It was the first time MLB games were cancelled as a result of a work stoppage since the 1994-95 players strike.
During the weird 2020 season MLB temporarily installed the universal designated hitter, but the National League reverted to its original rules in 2021.
Now both leagues will feature a universal designated hitter for 2022.
In response, the MLB and MLB Players Association agreed to tweak the universal designated hitter, allowing teams that assign their pitcher as the designated hitter to continue to hit even if pulled from the mound.

     Summary: Here’s a breakdown of the changes, courtesy of the new CBA:Bigger playoffsThe postseason field is expanding from 10 to 12 teams, meaning there will be an extra wild card in each league and no more one-game playoffs.
1 seed will then play the winner of the top two wild cards and the No.
2 seed will play the winner of the third division champ and third wild card, each in a best-of-five series, just as the division round has been in the past.
Tiebreakers will be used to determine playoff teams, if necessary, instead of an extra showdown on the field.
Pitchers hang up their batsAside from two-way star Shohei Ohtani, pitchers won’t be hitting anymore as the universal designated hitter has arrived.
