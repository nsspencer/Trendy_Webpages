     Summary: The 2022 MLB season begins at 1:20 with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Chicago Cubs.
A total of six former Tigers are on Opening Day rosters.
Bregman was limited to just 91 games last season which is the fewest games he’s played in a non-rookie or COVID-shortened season.
While Alex Lange got the call up last season and appeared in 36 games for the other Tigers, he’s earned a spot in Detroit’s opening day roster and will work out of the bullpen.
The Nola brothers met last season in San Diego and Aaron got the better of Austin, striking him out in three pitches.

     Summary: And here's the pitch ... MLB season officially begins todayEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Hoffmann/AP Reed Hoffmann/APMajor League Baseball's opening day is finally here.
It was the first time MLB games were cancelled as a result of a work stoppage since the 1994-95 players strike.
During the weird 2020 season MLB temporarily installed the universal designated hitter, but the National League reverted to its original rules in 2021.
Now both leagues will feature a universal designated hitter for 2022.
In response, the MLB and MLB Players Association agreed to tweak the universal designated hitter, allowing teams that assign their pitcher as the designated hitter to continue to hit even if pulled from the mound.

     MLB, Peacock Announce 18-Game Slate As League Leans into Streaming Platforms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NBC hasn’t carried Major League Baseball games in decades — but that’s changing this year.
On the eve of Opening Day, MLB announced it had finalized a deal with the broadcaster to stream 18 games on Peacock and create an inaugural slate of “Sunday Morning Baseball” games.
The deal furthers MLB’s trend of putting more games on streaming platforms — in early March, the league announced a partnership with Apple TV+ to stream games on Friday evenings.
MLB Chief Revenue Officer Noah Garden said in a statement that it was important to provide cord-cutters with more opportunities to watch games.
The last time NBC aired a MLB game was in 1989, according to the Wall Street Journal.
