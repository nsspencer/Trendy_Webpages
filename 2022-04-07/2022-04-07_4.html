     Summary: Optimism exists on a scale, of course, but the MLB Hope-O-Meter required a binary answer: yes or no.
More than 12,000 readers participated, picking one answer or the other, and over half took the optional step of explaining their answer.
I read each of the 6,634 written responses, ranging from one-word exclamations to a 14-paragraph essay about the Blue Jays (I read it all, Alexi).
So, rather than me feeding you another bite-sized preview of your team for opening day, why not open the floor to our readers?
I collected a few representative reader replies for each team and condensed them to fit into a 1-30 fan-optimism ranking.

     Eight Tigers on MLB Opening Day Rosters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 MLB season begins at 1:20 with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Chicago Cubs.
A total of six former Tigers are on Opening Day rosters.
Bregman was limited to just 91 games last season which is the fewest games he’s played in a non-rookie or COVID-shortened season.
While Alex Lange got the call up last season and appeared in 36 games for the other Tigers, he’s earned a spot in Detroit’s opening day roster and will work out of the bullpen.
The Nola brothers met last season in San Diego and Aaron got the better of Austin, striking him out in three pitches.

     Summary: And here's the pitch ... MLB season officially begins todayEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Hoffmann/AP Reed Hoffmann/APMajor League Baseball's opening day is finally here.
It was the first time MLB games were cancelled as a result of a work stoppage since the 1994-95 players strike.
During the weird 2020 season MLB temporarily installed the universal designated hitter, but the National League reverted to its original rules in 2021.
Now both leagues will feature a universal designated hitter for 2022.
In response, the MLB and MLB Players Association agreed to tweak the universal designated hitter, allowing teams that assign their pitcher as the designated hitter to continue to hit even if pulled from the mound.

     Summary: Welcome to Opening Day.
The Atlanta Braves, the defending World Series champions, have standing room only tickets available for both Thursday’s opener and Friday and Saturday’s games against Cincinnati.
Nationals-Mets in Washington still offered thousands of available tickets in roughly 95 of 100 sections, and the upper sections of Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City featured thousands of available seats.
Another sign this is an Opening Day like no other: Quiet streets in Cincinnati.
Days later, the allotment was sold out, showing a delayed Opening Day is certainly better than none at all.

He is a husband and father and begins his 12th major league season.
I look fastball and just react to the off-speed.”Trout, however, has folded some technology into his game since his rookie season.
Hunter, a nine-time Gold Glove winning center fielder, had moved over to right field by the time he and Trout played together when Trout was a rookie.
