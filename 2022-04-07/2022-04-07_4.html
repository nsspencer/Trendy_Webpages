     Eight Tigers on MLB Opening Day Rosters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 MLB season begins at 1:20 with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Chicago Cubs.
A total of six former Tigers are on Opening Day rosters.
Bregman was limited to just 91 games last season which is the fewest games he’s played in a non-rookie or COVID-shortened season.
While Alex Lange got the call up last season and appeared in 36 games for the other Tigers, he’s earned a spot in Detroit’s opening day roster and will work out of the bullpen.
The Nola brothers met last season in San Diego and Aaron got the better of Austin, striking him out in three pitches.

     Summary: And here's the pitch ... MLB season officially begins todayEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Hoffmann/AP Reed Hoffmann/APMajor League Baseball's opening day is finally here.
It was the first time MLB games were cancelled as a result of a work stoppage since the 1994-95 players strike.
During the weird 2020 season MLB temporarily installed the universal designated hitter, but the National League reverted to its original rules in 2021.
Now both leagues will feature a universal designated hitter for 2022.
In response, the MLB and MLB Players Association agreed to tweak the universal designated hitter, allowing teams that assign their pitcher as the designated hitter to continue to hit even if pulled from the mound.

Almost no one outside the Padres organization sees San Diego pulling off a similar upset this summer.
Some on the inside acknowledge a wild-card berth is the most realistic goal.
The spotlight, which shone so brightly to begin 2021, has apparently moved on.

I look fastball and just react to the off-speed.”Trout, however, has folded some technology into his game since his rookie season.
