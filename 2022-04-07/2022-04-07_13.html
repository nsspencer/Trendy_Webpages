     Summary: The Cleveland Guardians announced that they’ve traded Bradley Zimmer to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitcher Anthony Castro.
The move comes mere hours after Cleveland dropped their season opener to the Royals.
A game in which rookie outfielder Steven Kwan drew a pair of walks, recorded a hit, and just generally looked like a major-leaguer.
Zimmer concludes his Guardians career with a .225/.310/.347 slash and 19 home runs in 263 games.
The Guardians received 26-year-old right-handed reliever Anthony Castro in return for Zimmer.

     Can The Cleveland Guardians Muster More Offense Than The Cleveland Indians?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Guardians and third baseman Jose Ramirez, who belted 36 home runs and had 103 RBI last ... [+] season, have reached an agreement on a five-year $124 million contract extension.
It was a critical extension for the Guardians, who need Ramirez's big bat in a lineup that struggled to score runs last year, and on opening day this year.
Thursday, on opening day in Kansas City, the Cleveland Guardians made a seamless transition to a new name and a new season while facing an old problem: a lack of hitting.
The 24-year-old left-handed hitting Kwan, who was added to the major league roster during the offseason, hit his way not just onto the opening day roster, but into the opening day lineup with a blistering spring training.
Thus, the Guardians’ biggest need at the end of the 2021 season remains its biggest need at the start of the 2022 season: a lack of productive bats.
