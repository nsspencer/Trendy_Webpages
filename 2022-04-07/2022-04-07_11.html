    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS (AP) — Adam Wainwright pitched six scoreless innings, Tyler O’Neill hit a three-run homer and drove in five, and the St. Louis Cardinals celebrated Albert Pujols’ return with a 9-0 season-opening win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Thursday.
Paul Goldschmidt drew four straight walks, the first player to do that on opening day since Manny Ramírez in 2002.
The 42-year-old played 11 seasons in St. Louis (2001-2011) and helped the Cardinals to a pair of World Series championships before leaving to join the Los Angeles Angels.
Pujols, who signed a one-year deal with St. Louis last month, was 0 for 5.
Wainwright (1-0) allowed five hits in his sixth opening day start and first since 2016.

     Homecoming Kings: After raucous red-coated pomp, Wainwright and O'Neill lead Cardinals' 9-0 romp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cardinals’ opened their 131st season in the National League — Marmol’s first as manager — with a 9-0 romp at Busch Stadium against Pittsburgh.
Paul Goldschmidt set a club record with four walks on opening day.
And Tyler O’Neill’s five RBIs tied a club record for opening day last matched in 1928.
After tenderizing Pirates starter J. T. Brubaker with seven batters in the first inning, the Cardinals pounced with O’Neill’s three-run homer in the second inning.
In the second inning, he got the same sinker he’d missed earlier in the game and, well, didn’t.

The Mets became the first team to get scoreless outings from their starters on opening day in four consecutive seasons.
