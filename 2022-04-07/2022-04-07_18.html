     Report: Padres, Twins Swap Pitchers in Opening Day Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Twins and Padres reached a deal Thursday hours before first pitch on Opening Day, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan.
Minnesota will reportedly receive starting pitcher Chris Paddack and reliever Emilio Pagán in the deal, while reliever Taylor Rogers and outfielder Brent Rooker will go to the Padres.
Paddack, 26, was previously a top prospect for the Padres, though he’s struggled in recent years.
Rooker is expected to serve as a backup outfielder for the Padres.
The Cubs and Brewers will kick off the 2022 season on Thursday afternoon.

     Padres trade Chris Paddack, Emilio Pagan to Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Preller fit one last trade in before the 2022 campaign kicked off Thursday by sending pitchers Chris Paddack and Emilio Pagan to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for reliever Taylor Rogers and reserve outfielder Brent Rooker.
Twins, Padres in agreement on trade that will send Taylor Rogers to San Diego and Chris Paddack and a reliever to Minnesota, sources tell @TheAthletic.
— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) April 7, 2022Paddack, 26, was a target for the Twins for a while and even tried to trade for him at last summer’s Trade Deadline.
The primary piece the Padres get in return for Paddack is Taylor Rogers, an All-Star in 2021.
The other player acquired in the trade, Brent Rooker, has 65 career games under his belt and will likely be used as a backup outfielder in San Diego.

     Twins get Paddack, Pagán from Padres for Rogers, Rooker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Rogers isn't just any reliever.
It is tough for the Minnesota clubhouse to part with Rogers, who is one of the longest-tenured Twins and a clear leader of the pitching group in both his presence and his performance, which made him one of the elite relievers of the game across the last four seasons.
He'll bring a career 3.15 ERA to San Diego, where he'll be in the same division as twin brother Tyler, who pitches for the Giants.

     Padres-Twins trade: Chris Paddack to Minnesota, Taylor Rogers to San Diego in Opening Day swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and San Diego Padres have agreed to a trade that will send right-hander Chris Paddack and Emilio Pagan to the midwest in exchange for multiple players, including reliever Taylor Rogers, the teams announced Thursday (MLB's Opening Day).
Outfielder Brent Rooker and $6.6 million in cash (per The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal) will also head to San Diego.
Paddack comes with three seasons of team control, as he's not eligible for free agency until after the 2024 season.
Pagán's issues with the long ball have plagued him throughout his career, including during his time in San Diego.
Last season, Rogers made his first All-Star appearance.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Twins and Padres have made an Opening Day trade, with San Diego sending right-hander Chris Paddack to Minnesota with reliever Emilio Pagan in exchange for southpaw Taylor Rogers and outfielder Brent Rooker.
And for San Diego, it adds an All-Star arm at the back end of the bullpen who could claim the vacant closer's role.
Instead of a flex starter and struggling reliever, San Diego added an ace reliever and some outfield depth.
San Diego also had only two left-handed relievers in its bullpen in Tim Hill and Drew Pomeranz.
San Diego is fully in win-now mode, and picking up Rogers takes the bullpen up a notch.

     Twins Acquire Chris Paddack, Emilio Pagan From Padres For Taylor Rogers, Brent Rooker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota announced Thursday the acquisition of right-handed starter Chris Paddack and righty reliever Emilio Pagan in exchange for closer Taylor Rogers and first baseman/outfielder Brent Rooker.
Rogers, 31, is set to earn $7.3MM this season in his final year of club control before reaching free agency.
His 2020 campaign resulted in a 4.73 ERA in with a diminished 23.7% strikeout rate.
In 85 1/3 innings with the Friars, he posted a 4.75 ERA with a 26.3% strikeout rate and 7.7% walk rate.
As the Twins are with Paddack, San Diego is clearly banking on the belief that Rogers is healthy and able to bounce back to his typical form.
