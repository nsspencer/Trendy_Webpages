     Summary: WATCH: Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson hit ceremonial opening tee shots at the MastersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailThe 2022 Masters officially started Thursday morning, but not before the ceremonial opening tee shots were struck.
But before the action started, there was one last tradition to observe — the ceremonial opening tee shots.
The ceremonial opening tee shots began in 1963 and have been an annual tradition in the nearly 60 years since.
This year, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player assumed their annual roles in striking ceremonial opening tee shots, while two-time Masters winner Tom Watson joined them for the first time.

     Tom Watson with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player at Masters' 1st tee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Tom Watson didn't think eight major championships, including two green jackets, would be enough to join the company of Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus on the first tee at Augusta National.
Watson took over the honor for Lee Elder, the first Black player at the Masters, who died last fall.
Watson, with 72 next to his name on the standard-bearer at the first tee, took a moment before teeing off and considered how things have come full circle.
Watson couldn't help but have a little fun when he, Player and Nicklaus were asked who put together the longest drive.
"Oh, come on," said Watson, who is considerably younger than the 82-year-old Nicklaus and the 86-year-old Player.

     2022 Masters ceremonial tee shots: Tom Watson debuts as Honorary Starter with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The tee shot was Watson's first as an Honorary Starter alongside Player and Nicklaus as he was asked to join the duo starting this year.
That group of golfers has won a combined 35 major championships with 11 of those coming at Augusta National.
He also pumped his drive past both Nicklaus and Player, much to the chagrin of the latter.
The 2020 Masters was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and featured just Nicklaus and Player after the death of Arnold Palmer.
Last year's Masters -- featuring Nicklaus, Player and the first Black golfer to play in the Masters, Lee Elder -- was not at full capacity.

"I get quite choked when I get on that tee in the morning," Player said.
Player and Nicklaus stood under umbrellas with the Masters logo while Watson didn't seem to mind the rain drops.
"I did them while you were asleep this morning," Player crowed.
"I was up at 4 o'clock this morning," Watson replied.

The good Lord willing the creek don’t rise.”Overnight rain slowed to a steady mist but pushed tee times back half an hour.
