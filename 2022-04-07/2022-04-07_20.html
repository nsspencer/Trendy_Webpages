     New York Mets place 2-time Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom on 10-day IL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON -- Jacob deGrom went on the 10-day injured list Thursday with a stress reaction on his right shoulder blade as the New York Mets set their 28-man active roster for Opening Day.
The two-time National League Cy Young Award winner got hurt late in spring training and won't throw for about a month, meaning he is likely out at least until June.
The right-handed deGrom did not play in a game after July 7 last season, when he was sidelined by an elbow sprain in his pitching arm.
Tylor Megill was given the Game 1 start by new Mets manager Buck Showalter for Thursday night's scheduled opener at the Washington Nationals.
New York's opening roster includes 14 pitchers, two catchers, seven infielders and five outfielders.

     Mets Give Update on Jacob deGrom’s Injury Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets placed starting pitcher Jacob deGrom on the 10-day injured list Thursday ahead of their Opening Day tilt with the Nationals.
The New York ace suffered a stress reaction in his right scapula toward the end of spring training, so his appearance on the injured list to begin the year does not come as a surprise.
Despite only being on the 10-day injured list to start the year, deGrom won’t resume throwing for at least a month, the team announced on April 1.
As for deGrom, the stress reaction in his shoulder is the latest injury to affect his availability at the top of the New York rotation.
He missed the second half of last season after spraining his right throwing arm in early July.

     Summary: APWASHINGTON (AP) — Max Scherzer declared himself “good to go” for his New York Mets debut in Friday's second game of the season against the Washington Nationals, the club he helped win the 2019 World Series.

Scherzer became a free agent during and signed a three-year, $130 million contract with the Mets, part of a big-spending offseason for owner Steve Cohen.
There always will be good memories here,” Scherzer said.
