     Padres trade Chris Paddack, Emilio Pagan to Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Preller fit one last trade in before the 2022 campaign kicked off Thursday by sending pitchers Chris Paddack and Emilio Pagan to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for reliever Taylor Rogers and reserve outfielder Brent Rooker.
Twins, Padres in agreement on trade that will send Taylor Rogers to San Diego and Chris Paddack and a reliever to Minnesota, sources tell @TheAthletic.
— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) April 7, 2022Paddack, 26, was a target for the Twins for a while and even tried to trade for him at last summer’s Trade Deadline.
The primary piece the Padres get in return for Paddack is Taylor Rogers, an All-Star in 2021.
The other player acquired in the trade, Brent Rooker, has 65 career games under his belt and will likely be used as a backup outfielder in San Diego.

     Summary: Um … maybe left field.
That’s not all that’s noteworthy about Bob Melvin’s first lineup as the Padres manager as catcher Austin Nola draws his first career start in the leadoff spot.
As for Profar, he is the first player to start in left field on opening day in back-to-back seasons since Ryan Klesko from 2004 to 2005.
Profar signed a three-year, $21 million deal after hitting .278/.343/.428 in 2020, when he made 32 starts in left field after taking over for the injured Tommy Pham, now with the Reds.
Profar made 28 starts in left field in 2021, 24 in right, 19 in center, 12 at first base and six at second base.

     Padres send Chris Paddack, Emilio Pagan to Twins for reliever and outfielder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The team completed a trade early Thursday that sent starting pitcher Chris Paddack and reliever Emilio Pagàn to the Minnesota Twins for left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers and corner outfielder Brent Rooker.
The Twins are also sending money in the deal, an amount that is substantial enough that the Padres actually trimmed payroll in the deal.
While the Padres have also been searching for a veteran bat, they spent the spring looking to supplement their bullpen as well.
His twin brother, Tyler, is a reliever for the Giants, who the Padres visit next week.
Rogers is due $7.3 million in 2021, and Rooker will make a prorated portion of the MLB minimum rate of $700,000.

     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and San Diego Padres have agreed to a trade that will send right-hander Chris Paddack and Emilio Pagan to the midwest in exchange for multiple players, including reliever Taylor Rogers, the teams announced Thursday (MLB's Opening Day).

     Smith’s single breaks up Padres’ no-hit bid in 7th inning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona’s Pavin Smith sliced a line-drive single to start the seventh inning, ending an opening day no-hit bid by the San Diego Padres on Thursday night.
Yu Darvish threw the first six innings for San Diego without giving up a hit, but he was pulled before the seventh after throwing 92 pitches.
Left-hander Tim Hill relieved Darvish, matching up against the left-handed Smith to start the seventh, but the hitter responded with a clean single to left.
Darvish — a five-time All-Star — made his third opening day start and second for the Padres.
It’s a rough offensive start for the Diamondbacks, who are trying to bounce back from a 110-loss season.
