     Flight disruptions ease after FAA outage, as officials vow to investigate system failure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travelers as flights are cancelled at Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, Virginia, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023.
Air travel disruptions eased Thursday, a day after a severe pilot safety alert system failure sparked the delay of close to half of U.S. flights.
The FAA said a preliminary review traced the outage to a "damaged database file."
Unable to fix the problem, the FAA rebooted the system, and ordered the ground stop, which it lifted around 9 a.m. on Wednesday.
"When there's a problem with a government system, we're going to own it, we're going to find it and we're going to fix it," he told reporters Wednesday.

     A corrupt file led to the FAA ground stoppage. It was also found in the backup system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) — Officials are still trying to figure out exactly what led to the Federal Aviation Administration system outage on Wednesday but have traced it to a corrupt file, which was first reported by CNN.
FAA officials told reporters early Wednesday that the issues developed in the 3 p.m.
Officials ultimately found a corrupt file in the main NOTAM system, the source told CNN.
During this early morning process, the FAA told reporters that the system was "beginning to come back online," but said it would take time to resolve.
The source said the NOTAM system is an example of aging infrastructure due for an overhaul.
