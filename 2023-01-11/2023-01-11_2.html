"I think the Stratocaster, the particular guitar Stratocaster, lends itself to endless possibilities because of the spring-loaded bridge that it's got.
Beck left the band shortly after, and formed The Jeff Beck Group (along with a then little-known singer named Rod Stewart).
He has been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame twice — once with The Yardbirds and once on his own.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FILE - British guitarist Jeff Beck performs on the Stravinski hall during the 41st Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland, late Sunday, July 15, 2007.
“Jeff was such a nice person and an outstanding iconic, genius guitar player — there will never be another Jeff Beck,” Tony Iommi, guitarist for Black Sabbath wrote on Twitter among the many tributes.
I just saw Cirque du Soleil, and it struck me as complete organized chaos,” he told Guitar World in 2014.
The Jeff Beck Group — with Stewart singing — was later booked to play the 1969 Woodstock music festival but their appearance was canceled.
ADVERTISEMENT“He came along and reset all of the rules in one evening,” Beck told Guitar World.

     Jeff Beck, One of the Guitar Masters of the Rock Era, Dies at 78
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Beck, among the most innovative and certainly the most unpredictable of ’60s guitar heroes, died on Tuesday.
At the turn of the decade, the guitarist founded a new quintet edition of the Jeff Beck Group that leaned heavily on the jazzy keyboard work of Max Middleton.
The set also produced his first Grammy winner, the rock instrumental “Escape.”Afflicted with tinnitus, Beck was sidelined for several years.
He recorded the hard-rocking “Jeff Beck’s Guitar Shop” (1989) with keyboardist Tony Hymas and ex-Frank Zappa drummer Terry Bozzio.
The mainly instrumental collection garnered a second Grammy in the rock instrumental category.
