     How Miami Heat’s Twitter Reacted to the Win Against the Oklahoma City Thunder Tuesday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat were without four of their starters Tuesday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with Kyle Lowry, Tyler Herro, Bam Adebayo and Caleb Martin all sidelined due to injuries.
It left Jimmy Butler as the regular starter in the lineup Tuesday and that’s all Miami needed.
He displayed his clutch nature with a winning shot after being down five points with less than 50 seconds.
On Sunday night against the Nets, Butler was not granted a foul after drawing contact with forward Royce O’Neal.
Not only was Butler denied a potential winning shot but the referees did not deem the play a foul, which gave Brooklyn the victory.

     Former Miami Heat Draft Pick Michael Beasley Gives His Take On The Current NBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since, Michael Beasley has been out of the NBA, the game has changed tremendously.
With the game focused primarily on scoring, he still thinks he could have an impact with his abilities and long wingspan.
When I was in the NBA, 115, 120 was a high scoring game.
He also said he is a fan of Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant.
The next person I think is going to win MVP for the next couple years is Ja Morant.

     NBA: Miami Heat set free-throw record in 112-111 win over Oklahoma City Thunder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jimmy Butler led a record-breaking shooting display from the free-throw line as the Miami Heat claimed a 112-111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Miami made all 40 of their free throws, breaking the record of 39-for-39 made by Utah against Portland in 1982.
"We've been a very good free-throw shooting team all year, but that's crazy," said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra.
Butler then extended his perfect record from the foul line to edge the Heat in front and set an NBA record.
James Harden has the record of most free throws in a game without a miss, scoring 24 for the Houston Rockets in 2019.
