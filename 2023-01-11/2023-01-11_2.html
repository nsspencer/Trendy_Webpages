     Report: WWE sold to Saudi Arabia’s Investment Fund
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The whirlwind day of news surrounding the WWE may have ended with a bombshell.
Steven Muehlhausen of DAZN reported late Tuesday night that the WWE has been sold to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.
The news came just hours after Stephanie McMahon stepped down as Co-CEO of the company, leaving the full-time job to Nick Khan.
Reports of the Saudi Arabia Investment Fund being one of the potential bidders began to surface in the immediate aftermath of McMahon’s return.
As of now, it is unclear if the potential sale will thrust him back into a creative role within the company.

     One WWE Talent "Done" If Company Is Sold To Saudi Arabia – TJR Wrestling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As rumours swirl about WWE potentially being sold to Saudi Arabia, a report suggests that at least one WWE star would be looking to leave if that happened.
January 10th saw major changes to the landscape of WWE as Stephanie McMahon announced her resignation from the company.
Cassidy Haynes of Bodyslam.net and Steve Muehlhausen of DAZN both reported that WWE may well have already been sold to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
However, Fightful Select has noted that while nobody they have spoken to within WWE has heard about the sale, one WWE talent noted that they’d be “done” if such a takeover took place.
Regardless of the alleged sale, it is also noted in the report that there is an “incredible amount of concern” in the company due to the resurgence of Vince McMahon in the company.

     WWE sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. has reportedly been sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
WWE CEO STEPHANIE MCMAHON ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AMID FATHER'S RETURNThe report of the sale comes just hours after CEO Stephanie McMahon, Vince's daughter, announced her resignation from the company.
According to Front Office Sports, WWE has a 10-year agreement to hold two live events per year in the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund reportedly controls about $620 billion in assets, and the kingdom has been stretching its reach into the world of sports in recent years.
Last year, it spent at least $2 billion to fund LIV Golf’s global challenge to the PGA Tour.

     WWE Sold to Saudi Arabian Fund, Says Journalist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (WWE) has been sold to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, according to a tweet by DAZN journalist Steve Muehlhausen.
Muehlhausen tweeted late last night that the WWE had been sold and would return to being a private company.
This news comes on the back of yesterday’s unanimous election of Vince McMahon as Executive Chairman.
Last Friday, when Vince McMahon reinstated himself to the WWE Board of Directors, his comments were largely understood to imply that the board would try to sell the company.
Moreover, it was reported that the company had hired J.P. Morgan (JPM) as advisors on the sale.

    </h2>

     Summary: It read, “WWE has been sold toSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
— Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 11, 2023World Wrestling Entertainment is reportedly being sold to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
The news comes just hours after the bombshell that Stephanie McMahon had resigned from the company after her father Vince McMahon had returned as Chairman of the Board.
WWE, which is the leading professional wrestling company and has broadcasting deals with USA Network, Peacock, and Fox, went public back on August 3, 1999.
As a result of that report, McMahon stepped back from his role as chief executive officer of WWE while the board continued its investigation.

     Saudi Arabia may be buying WWE, Stephanie McMahon resigns as CEO: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Vince McMahon has indeed sold WWE to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, well, that’s something every wrestling fan knew could happen for a while.
Though no deal has yet been officially confirmed or even addressed, it’s always been a distant buzz in the ether.
Rumors of a sale of the company have been louder, though, since Nick Khan came aboard (big deals are what he does).
Tuesday’s news of Stephanie McMahon resigning as co-CEO of WWE barely had time to settle before Twitter went ablaze with rumors that Vince McMahon had already completed a sale of WWE to the Saudi PIF, and the company would again go private.
(Comcast has also been seen as a frontrunner to purchase the company, given the amount it already spends on WWE content.)

     Vince McMahon’s WWE Sale Would Body Slam UFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Vince McMahon not-quite-voluntary resigned from WWE last summer, Wall Street began suggesting World Wrestling Entertainment should be sold.
Instead, it seems McMahon is looking to force a sale—and probably place an exclamation mark on WWE’s supremacy over UFC.
Already, McMahon’s return to “maximize shareholder value” has rallied shares up 30% this year, after a superb 2022 that saw WWE stock advance 40%.
Founded in 1993 and not even half the age of WWE, UFC is now about even on two major metrics: social media followers (WWE 60.4 million; UFC 59.5 million) and revenue (for 2021: WWE $974 million; UFC roughly $1 billion*).
To be fair, by another metric, Endeavor and UFC are more valuable than WWE.
