     Suns update: Saben Lee signs 10-day as Phoenix plays Denver in second of road back-to-back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER – The Phoenix Suns' injury report didn’t change from Tuesday.
Booker will be re-evaluated the last full week of January as he suffered his groin strain in Phoenix’s Christmas loss at Denver.
Booker had missed three games with groin soreness, returned at Denver and had the groin strain within the first five minutes of the first quarter against the Nuggets.
The Suns signed Saben Lee to a 10-day Wednesday as he's with the team.
The 6-3 guard played his first two NBA seasons with Detroit and played two games with Philadelphia this season.

     Shorthanded Suns Scorched in Loss to Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After defeating the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, the Phoenix Suns couldn't carry any momentum in their Wednesday night loss to the Denver Nuggets.
The Phoenix Suns fell to the Denver Nuggets in 126-97 fashion on Wednesday.
After seeing a handful of role players step up in major fashion vs. Golden State, every Suns starter finished with a +/- of -20 or worse on Wednesday.
The Suns were outmatched in each quarter, as the Nuggets pieced together point totals of 34, 36 and 30 in the first three periods of play.
The Suns now hope to rebound in a Friday night showdown with the Minnesota Timberwolves.

     Cam Johnson’s return from knee injury for Phoenix Suns should be ‘soon’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns’ season was in a completely different state the last time Cam Johnson played.
Since then, a torn right meniscus for Johnson was the start of a plethora of injuries hitting the Suns.
Despite that, Phoenix found a high point through a spectacular shorthanded win over the Golden State Warriors trending them back in the right direction.
All that together has Phoenix at a record of 21-21 entering Wednesday’s matchup with the Denver Nuggets as they are hoping for some reinforcements soon.
The reported timeline on Johnson’s absence was one-to-two months, per ESPN’s Brain Windhorst, a timeline that passed on Jan 3.

     Phoenix Suns run into formidable test, fall to Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns came in with the same approach on Wednesday night as they did in their last game, a stunning 125-113 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday.
Their opponent, though, the Denver Nuggets, did not have commonalities with the Warriors.
The Nuggets (28-13) presented a playoff level of execution defensively, using a pressure variation to force the Suns (21-22) into making difficult passes.
A 24-8 surge to begin the second quarter had Denver up 22 after Phoenix had done well to hang around.
The Suns signed guard Saben Lee to a 10-day contract on Wednesday and he got some run in the second half.

     Saben Lee returns to Phoenix Suns on a 10-day contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Tuesday’s upset by the shorthanded Phoenix Suns over the defending champion Golden State Warriors, The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported on Wednesday morning that Phoenix would sign guard Saben Lee to a 10-day contract.
Lee signed a two-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers in November, along with former Summer Sun Louis King.
For the Sixers’ affiliate, Delaware Blue Coats, Lee played in eight games, averaging 24.6 points (51/41/75 shooting), 5.8 rebounds, and 6.6 assists (3.0 turnovers) in 34.5 minutes.
Lee has a reputation for rim pressure, which Phoenix has been missing direly in the absences of Devin Booker and Cam Payne, especially.
For reference, only Josh Okogie (.452) and Bismack Biyombo (.444) are above .400 on the Suns this season; Booker is at .304.
