     Celtics' Jaylen Brown could miss 'a week or so' with injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics will be without Jaylen Brown for Thursday's game vs. the Brooklyn Nets and potentially longer.
Brown was ruled out for Thursday night due to right adductor tightness, which bothered him at the end of Wednesday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans.
After his 41-point performance, Brown revealed the injury to NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin and said he would get it looked at.
C's interim head coach Joe Mazzulla provided an update on Brown shortly after the team ruled him out against Brooklyn.
Mazzulla added that he expects a short recovery timeline for Brown, who's likely to miss at least a couple of games.

(2:08)NEW YORK -- Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown missed Thursday night's 109-98 Celtics win over the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center with a right adductor strain, an injury that could cause him to miss "a week or two," per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.
Mazzulla said Brown tried to warm up to play Thursday but was deemed unable to go.
Mazzulla said he thought there was a plan for Brown to get imaging done on the injury.
"Everybody is expected to do more and everybody has to step up," Brown's co-star in Boston, Jayson Tatum, said postgame.

     Summary: NEW YORK — The Celtics were shorthanded Thursday night against the Nets, as Jaylen Brown was downgraded to out because of adductor tightness.
With Brown out, expect the Celtics to spread out his minutes to Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick White and perhaps Payton Pritchard.
Robert Williams III (left knee injury rehabilitation) was back in the lineup after sitting out Wednesday’s game for precautionary reasons.
The next fan voting update is on Jan. 19 and voting will conclude on Jan. 21.
Brown also trails Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving and Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell in fan voting.

     Summary: Celtics ‘Comfort will kill you’: The Celtics are showing they’re hungry for more than the NBA’s best record Halfway through the season, Boston's record is the NBA's best.
But, this year’s Celtics team isn’t like most.
They’re uncommon, in the sense that they’re one of the few teams that has a legitimate shot at winning the NBA Finals.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said after scoring a team-high 41 points.
Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.
