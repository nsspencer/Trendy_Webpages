    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Written by Scottie Andrew, CNNTatjana Patitz, who rose to fashion fame in the '90s as an animal-loving supermodel with a piercing gaze, has died, her agent confirmed to CNN.
The German-born model appeared on dozens of covers for Vogue and countless other fashion magazines beginning in the 1980s.
Patitz appeared on more than 130 magazine covers in her life, according to Elite.
Patitz told Milenio she preferred to live a lower-key life than her fellow supermodels and enjoyed "being surrounded by nature, away from concrete and noise" with her son and their animals.
"She was far less visible than her peers -- more mysterious, more grown-up, more unattainable -- and that had its own appeal," Wintour told Vogue.
