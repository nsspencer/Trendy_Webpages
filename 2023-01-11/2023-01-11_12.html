     Summary: Justin Roiland, who co-created the animated series Rick and Morty and provides the voices of the two title characters, is awaiting trial on charges of felony domestic violence against a former girlfriend.
Emails seeking comment from Roiland’s attorney and representatives for Cartoon Network, which airs Rick and Morty, were not immediately returned.

It has aired for six seasons on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim night-time programming block, and has been renewed for a seventh.
Roiland also created the video game High on Life, described as a comedy alien shooter taking place in a science fiction world.

     'Rick and Morty' Future in Doubt as Justin Roiland Faces Years in Prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justin Roiland, the co-creator and voice behind Rick and Morty, is facing several years in prison after being charged with multiple domestic violence offenses.
Roiland co-created Rick and Morty with Community creator Dan Harmon, and he provides the voice for many characters including the titular two, Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith.
Roiland created the premise of Rick and Morty in a cartoon short years before the actual show made it to air.
He spoke to Newsweek twice in 2022 to discuss Season 6 of Rick and Morty, which ended on December 12.
This guarantee was given before the news broke about the charges facing Roiland, and it would very likely have serious consequences for Rick and Morty's continued output.

     ‘Rick &amp; Morty’s Justin Roiland Battling Domestic Violence Charges; Faces Up To Seven Years Behind Bars If Found Guilty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Updated with Roiland lawyer statement) Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland is facing some serious incarceration time over domestic violence charges.
The incident in question against a Jane Doe allegedly occurred in January 2020, according to a May 2020 complaint (read it here).
Having plead not guilty to the charges in October 2020, Roiland was present for today’s hearing today.
As well as the immensely successful Rick and Morty, Roiland co-created and performs in Hulu’s Solar Opposites, which was renewed for a fifth season last October.
While very serious, the charges against Roiland are not the first time Rick and Morty has had to weather off-screen controversy.
