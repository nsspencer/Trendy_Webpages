     Shareholder files a lawsuit against Vince McMahon over his return to power in WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CategoriesNEWS TICKER WWE NewsBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)WWE shareholder Scott Fellows has filed a lawsuit against Vince McMahon over the way he returned to the company.
The lawsuit filed in Delaware’s Chancery Court and accuses McMahon of using his 81 percent voting control “to out three board members, replace them with loyalists, and push through bylaw changes that would ‘impose his will on the board and WWE,'” according to a story published by Bloomberglaw.com.
Powell’s POV: Fellows is seeking to have the bylaw changes invalidated and a reimbursement for costs and fees.
I view the situation exactly as the lawsuit describes it, but whether it leads to any change remains to be seen.

     Vince McMahon’s Return to WWE Helm Draws Investor Litigation (1)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE Inc. chief Vince McMahon—who returned to the company in early January after resigning amid a wave of sexual harassment allegations—is facing investor litigation over claims that he pushed aside the board to illegally install himself as chairman.
McMahon’s recent moves have reinserted him as the head of a WWE royal family he spent decades leading, both behind the scenes and on screen.
His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, who resigned as co-CEO and chairwoman Tuesday, is married to another top executive, former WWE champion Paul “Triple H” Levesque.
Potential Class Size: Thousands of holders of 43.3 million WWE shares, according to the complaint.
Attorneys: The investor leading the case, Scott Fellows, is represented by Labaton Sucharow LLP, Friedlander &amp; Gorris PA, Friedman Oster &amp; Tejtel PLLC, and Kaskela Law LLC.

     Vince McMahon returns to WWE as executive chairman; daughter Stephanie McMahon steps down as co-CEO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Cena visits young fan who had to flee Ukraine after Russian invasionVince McMahon has returned to WWE as executive chairman, while his daughter Stephanie McMahon will step down as co-CEO, she announced Tuesday.
In a statement, Stephanie McMahon said her father has come back to the company, months after he retired as CEO and chairman amid a misconduct probe.
"Our Founder, Vince McMahon, has returned as Executive Chair and is leading an exciting process regarding strategic alternatives," she wrote.
With Vince McMahon returning, speculation fueled on social media that the publicly traded company would turn private and be sold to Saudi Arabia's Private Investment Fund.
McMahon, who turned WWE from a small company into a worldwide entertainment business, stepped back temporarily as CEO and chairman in mid-June and then retired a month later.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Vince McMahon not-quite-voluntary resigned from WWE last summer, Wall Street began suggesting World Wrestling Entertainment should be sold.
Instead, it seems McMahon is looking to force a sale—and probably place an exclamation mark on WWE’s supremacy over UFC.
Already, McMahon’s return to “maximize shareholder value” has rallied shares up 30% this year, after a superb 2022 that saw WWE stock advance 40%.
Founded in 1993 and not even half the age of WWE, UFC is now about even on two major metrics: social media followers (WWE 60.4 million; UFC 59.5 million) and revenue (for 2021: WWE $974 million; UFC roughly $1 billion*).
By another metric, Endeavor and UFC are more valuable than WWE.
