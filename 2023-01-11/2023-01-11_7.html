     Mega Millions jackpot jumps to $1.35 billion for the next drawing. Here's the tax bill if there's a winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You may face long odds of hitting the Mega Millions jackpot — now worth $1.35 billion — but the taxman is always guaranteed a slice when there's a winner.
The jackpot jumped again after no ticket matched all six numbers drawn Tuesday night to land the grand prize.
If won in the next drawing — set for Friday night — it would mark the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot ever and the fourth-largest lottery prize in history.
Most winners, however, choose the lump sum cash option, which for this jackpot is $707.9 million.
Yet because the top marginal income tax rate of 37% applies to income above $578,125 for individual tax filers and $693,750 for married couples, you could count on owing more to the IRS at tax time.
