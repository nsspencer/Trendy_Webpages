     Jennifer Coolidge’s Golden Globes speech gave a glimpse into Hollywood’s brutal battle for survival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jennifer Coolidge is fast becoming America’s sweetheart thanks to her award-winning performance in The White Lotus—but it hasn’t always been that way.
But it seems the White Lotus star has now been welcomed into the Hollywood elite, presenting at the Golden Globes in California last night and then taking home the prize for best actress in a limited series.
Coolidge used her acceptance speech to highlight her battle to scrape a living in the brutal world of Hollywood, which eventually resulted in her landing a Golden Globe.
“Jennifer Coolidge’s speech is testament to someone that is embracing their motivators.
She has total clarity around what drives her, and every role is taking her one step closer to her goal.

     Summary: Prior to being cast in The White Lotus, Coolidge was best known for bit-parts in comedies like American Pie and Legally Blonde, but the critical acclaim she has garnered in The White Lotus means that the actress is more culturally relevant at 61 than ever before.
Rich Polk/NBC // Getty Images"If you don't know Mike White, this is what you should know," she continued.
"He's worried about the world.
He's worried about people.
He's worried about friends of his who aren't doing well... he's always worried about people.

     Jennifer Coolidge's Hilarious, Profanity-Laced Acceptance Speech at Golden Globes
    </h2>

     Summary: Play video content NBCJennifer Coolidge was very thankful to win a Golden Globe Tuesday night -- so much so, in fact, that she drops a few F-bombs and some other fun words to get her point across.
Ditto for JC, who immediately got some laughs after putting the Globe down on the ground ... and then going on a profanity-laced spiel that went left, right and everywhere in between.
You could tell how much the win meant for her ... and it's well-deserved.
Jen ended with a heap of praise on 'White Lotus' creator Mike White ... and a few more expletives for good measure.
The music started to play her off, and she got a big applause.
