     Lakers' LeBron James: Big line tempered by poor shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James posted 24 points (9-28 FG, 0-7 3Pt, 6-10 FT), 16 rebounds, nine assists and two steals across 47 minutes during Thursday's 119-115 double-overtime loss to the Mavericks.
James has long been the type of player who can put up huge stats even on his least effective days, and that was the case Thursday as the 38-year-old fell just one assist shy of a triple-double.
However, James also shot just 9-for-28 from the field, including 0-for-7 from three-point range, and failed to make a field goal during either overtime period.
His rough shooting night may be partly the result of a sore left ankle that he has been recently battling, though James was able to give the Lakers a season-high 47 minutes in the loss.
Los Angeles doesn't play again until Sunday, so James will have two days to recuperate after Thursday's heavy workload.

     Lakers Vs. Mavericks Preview: LeBron James &amp; Luka Doncic Square Off In L.A.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers saw their five-game win streak snapped on Monday against the Denver Nuggets.
Now back home, they look to start up another streak and get some revenge for what happened on Christmas Day against the Dallas Mavericks.
Dallas outscored the Lakers 51-to-21 in the third quarter, completely flipping the contest and leading to an easy win for the Mavericks.
The Lakers have won 6-of-8 games since that night, however, while the Mavericks have lost three of their last four since their seven-game win streak was snapped.
Containing Luka Doncic is basically impossible, but the Lakers can not allow both Tim Hardaway Jr. and Christian Wood to go off once again.

     Latest NBA All-Star Voting Results Have LeBron James, Kevin Durant Leading The Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, the NBA released the numbers for the second wave of fan voting for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game with Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant leading the Western Conference and Eastern Conference, respectively, in voting.
The 2023 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled to take place on Sunday, February 19 in Salt Lake City and on Thursday, the NBA released the results in the second fan returns of All-Star voting.
As laid out, 50 percent of the fan vote will decide the 2023 NBA All-Star Game starters, as NBA players and a select media panel will account for 25 percent of the vote each.
In the Eastern Conference, Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant is the leading vote-getter with 4,509,238 total votes and he ranks second behind James in total votes league-wide.
However, it is highly unlikely that either player makes the All-Star Game due to the players and media voting.

     Summary: The NBA released the second update in its fan voting for the 2023 All-Star Game and there’s little change from the first reveal.
Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant continue to lead the fan vote.
As a reminder, the two players with the highest vote total in their respective conferences will serve as the captains for the All-Star Game.
James has served as a captain every year, while Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo have both been captains for the East.
The real battle will be in the East, where Durant being sidelined opens the door for Antetokounmpo to surpass him.
