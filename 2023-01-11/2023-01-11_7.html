     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article SharePARIS — Lionel Messi scored in his first game since leading Argentina to the World Cup title as French league leader Paris Saint-Germain beat Angers 2-0 on Wednesday.
Nearly four weeks after the final against France in Qatar, Messi needed only five minutes to make an impact.
But PSG was asleep for stretches of the game and Angers had two good chances before Messi’s goal.
The Brazilian great who won a record three World Cups, died in late December at the age of 82.
Central defender Chancel Mbemba put Marseille ahead in the 10th after France midfielder Mattéo Guendouzi headed on a cross.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nordi Mukiele provided both assists and eventually saw his second awarded after Messi completed a cute passing move 18 minutes from time.
Those three absences and some largely disinterested displays contributed towards the growing feeling of concern in the capital that Les Parisiens are well off their expected level one month out from the return of the UEFA Champions League.
It was not to be, but PSG and Messi must improve in the coming weeks if they are to be ready to face Bayern Munich.
The league loss to RC Lens does not appear to have sufficiently woken the champions from their slumber just yet.
You can catch PSG vs. Bayern Munich and other round of 16 games when the UEFA Champions League returns on Paramount+.

     PSG vs Angers score, result: Messi gets goal on return as PSG top hapless basement-dwellers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 49th min: Angers have been the ones to control possession early, but the offside flag stops a pair of attacks.
35th min: Lionel Messi is hacked to the ground by Batista Mendy, and it earns a dangerous free-kick from about 23 yards out.
Lionel Messi attempts to dribble down the opponent's throat but he's surrounded by three red shirts and is dispossessed.
Lionel Messi is obviously a huge draw globally but locally the absence of Kylian Mbappe likely hurts the expected attendance overall.
PSG confirmed starting lineup (4-3-3): Donnarumma (GK) — Mukiele, Ramos, Marquinhos, Bernat — Fabian, Danilo, Vitinha — Neymar, Messi, Ekitike.
