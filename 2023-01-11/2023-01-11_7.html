     Summary: The Miami Heat sank 40 free throws in a row, setting a new NBA recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/APThere's no doubt the Miami Heat were on fire Tuesday night.
And that wasn't all: His final basket also meant that the Heat broke an NBA record — for the most successful free throws in a row in one game — by going 40-for-40 from the line.
Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters he didn't know the team hadn't missed any free throws until after the game.
Butler scored 23 of the Heat's free throws — which puts him in a tie for No.
2 in consecutive successful free throws — and the team broke the record despite having multiple players out with injuries.

     Judge terminates FTX naming-rights agreement for Miami Heat's arena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal bankruptcy judge ruled on Wednesday that the naming-rights agreement between Miami-Dade County and the FTX cryptocurrency exchange has been terminated, according to the Miami Herald.
The dissolution of the agreement ends a two-year partnership in which the Miami Heat were playing in FTX Arena.
According to the order, Miami-Dade County will immediately stop using FTX branding and remove all mentions of the FTX brand from the Heat's home arena.
On Wednesday, Judge John Dorsey approved the termination of the deal between FTX and Miami-Dade County.
On Nov. 22, 2022, Miami-Dade County petitioned a federal bankruptcy court to immediately terminate its naming-right agreements with FTX and remove its branding from the Heat's arena.

     FTX bankruptcy judge terminates Miami Heat arena naming rights deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal bankruptcy judge approved a deal Wednesday to take FTX's name off FTX Arena, home of the NBA's Miami Heat, court documents say.
The failed cryptocurrency exchange inked a 19-year, $135 million name rights agreement in June 2021 with Miami-Dade County that paid the Heat $2 million a year.
The county filed a motion asking the judge presiding over FTX's bankruptcy to approve a stipulation ending the naming rights agreement.
FTX HAS RECOVERED $5B IN LIQUID ASSETS, BANKRUPTCY LAWYER SAYSThe stipulation is retroactive to Dec. 30, 2022.
It terminates all licenses and other rights granted by FTX to Miami-Dade County pursuant to the agreement (and all sublicenses and other rights granted by Miami-Dade County to third parties under such licenses and rights) under any trademarks or trade names, including any naming rights partner marks and arena marks.

     Miami-Dade County wins right to strip FTX name off Heat arena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI (AP) — The naming rights deal between FTX and Miami-Dade County was terminated Wednesday by a federal bankruptcy court, a move that allows the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange’s brand to be stripped from the arena where the NBA’s Miami Heat play.
The order means that before long — and probably starting very soon — all FTX signage and advertising at the arena will be removed.
Terminating the rights deal “shall be effective immediately upon entry of this order,” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John T. Dorsey wrote.
The county owns the arena and negotiated what was to be a 19-year, $135 million naming rights deal with FTX.
The Heat were to receive $2 million annually as part of that deal, which went into effect in June 2021.

     40 for 40 from the free-throw line: Miami Heat break NBA record, capped by Jimmy Butler's game-winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat would've taken a win on Tuesday night any way they could get it.
It required a historic free-throw effort, but Miami got it done with a 112-111 victory over the visiting Thunder.
Jimmy Butler was the hero, finishing with 35 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks.
Indeed, that game-winning free throw by Butler made the Heat an NBA record 40 for 40 from the charity stripe for the game.
It is quite impressive, nonetheless, particularly for a Miami team that came in averaging 22.4 free throws per game, the sixth-lowest mark in the league.

     Summary: The jumbotron at what used to be called FTX Arena in Miami, Florida, on Monday, October 4, 2021, features the FTX logo.
dvarela@miamiherald.comThe FTX Arena era officially ended Wednesday when Miami-Dade County won a court order striking its 2021 agreement with the disgraced and bankrupt crypto exchange.
“It’s going to be referred to as ‘the Arena’,” said Natalia Jaramillo, deputy communications director for Mayor Daniella Levine Cava.
Wednesday’s order may not end the court fights over the 2021 arena deal.
FTX paid $20 million from the original agreement, and the 2023 rent of $5.5 million was due Jan. 1.

     Summary: The Miami Heat were without four of their starters Tuesday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with Kyle Lowry, Tyler Herro, Bam Adebayo and Caleb Martin all sidelined due to injuries.
It left Jimmy Butler as the regular starter in the lineup Tuesday and that’s all Miami needed.
He displayed his clutch nature with a winning shot after being down five points with less than 50 seconds.
On Sunday night against the Nets, Butler was not granted a foul after drawing contact with forward Royce O’Neal.
Not only was Butler denied a potential winning shot but the referees did not deem the play a foul, which gave Brooklyn the victory.
