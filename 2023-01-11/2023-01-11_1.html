     WWE Rumors: Vince McMahon sells to Saudi Arabia Invest Fund
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While no official information has been released by the company for obvious reasons, Muehlhausen isn’t alone in his reporting.
Update, here is what I’ve put together so far: The deal isn’t completely finalized because WWE must provide notice to shareholders &amp; other parties.
There are legalities to go through, as the company is publicly traded.
But, again, I’m told a deal has been agreed to in principle.
Needless to say, this is a developing story.

     WWE sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. has reportedly been sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
WWE CEO STEPHANIE MCMAHON ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AMID FATHER'S RETURNThe report of the sale comes just hours after CEO Stephanie McMahon, Vince's daughter, announced her resignation from the company.
According to Front Office Sports, WWE has a 10-year agreement to hold two live events per year in the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund reportedly controls about $620 billion in assets, and the kingdom has been stretching its reach into the world of sports in recent years.

The news comes just hours after the bombshell that Stephanie McMahon had resigned from the company after her father Vince McMahon had returned as Chairman of the Board.
Unknown if Vince McMahon will return to head of creative but it is expected by some people.
News of a sale isn’t completely shocking as McMahon made it clear that he intended to return in order to sell the company.
As a result of that report, McMahon stepped back from his role as chief executive officer of WWE while the board continued its investigation.

     Report: WWE sold to Saudi Arabia’s Investment Fund
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The whirlwind day of news surrounding the WWE may have ended with a bombshell.
Steven Muehlhausen of DAZN reported late Tuesday night that the WWE has been sold to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.
The news came just hours after Stephanie McMahon stepped down as Co-CEO of the company, leaving the full-time job to Nick Khan.
Reports of the Saudi Arabia Investment Fund being one of the potential bidders began to surface in the immediate aftermath of McMahon’s return.
As of now, it is unclear if the potential sale will thrust him back into a creative role within the company.

     Summary: If Vince McMahon has indeed sold WWE to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, well, that’s something every wrestling fan knew could happen for a while.
Tuesday’s news of Stephanie McMahon resigning as co-CEO of WWE barely had time to settle before Twitter went ablaze with rumors that Vince McMahon had already completed a sale of WWE to the Saudi PIF, and the company would again go private.
Stephanie McMahon is out.
Nick Khan is now the CEO of the company by himself, having previously shared the title with Stephanie.
McMahon, as the majority shareholder, reportedly threatened to roadblock any sale or new TV deal unless he was reinstated to the board.
