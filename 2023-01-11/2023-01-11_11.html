     Jennifer Coolidge’s Golden Globes speech gave a glimpse into Hollywood’s brutal battle for survival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jennifer Coolidge is fast becoming America’s sweetheart thanks to her award-winning performance in The White Lotus—but it hasn’t always been that way.
But it seems the White Lotus star has now been welcomed into the Hollywood elite, presenting at the Golden Globes in California last night and then taking home the prize for best actress in a limited series.
Coolidge used her acceptance speech to highlight her battle to scrape a living in the brutal world of Hollywood, which eventually resulted in her landing a Golden Globe.
“Jennifer Coolidge’s speech is testament to someone that is embracing their motivators.
She has total clarity around what drives her, and every role is taking her one step closer to her goal.

His light touch kept the audience laughing while neither dismissing the seriousness of the Globes’ troubles nor suggesting its problems had been solved.

It felt like a truly dangerous moment rather than the faux danger of the Gervais era.
