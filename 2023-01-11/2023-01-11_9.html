     Demi Lovato Poster Banned In UK For Being Offensive To Christians
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to the report published by the ASA on Wednesday, the complainants “challenged whether the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offense.” Others suggested the poster was “irresponsibly placed” at six different locations around London where children could see it.
A poster promoting Demi Lovato’s album has caused controversy for linking bondage sex to the crucifix.
Commentator Alice Grant says the "demonic" poster should be banned.
Julia: "Just because you're offended by something, you don't have the right to take it down.

     Summary: Island RecordsDemi Lovato‘s posters advertising their Holy Fvck album are now banned in the United Kingdom because they apparently offended Christians.
BBC reports the six posters, which depicted the album’s artwork, were taken down because they are said to have combined sexuality with religion.
The ASA said the posters were erected where children could see them.
Despite getting the green light, the six posters were removed four days after the complaints were made.
Universal Music Operations Ltd. has since been warned by the ASA to not cause offense in the future.

     Demi Lovato album poster banned U.K.: Christians offended by bondage outfit and crucifix bed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Singer Demi Lovato’s posters advertising her new album have been banned in the U.K. after they were branded as “offensive to Christians” by the advertising watchdog.
Lovato released Holy Fvck in August last year and the cover pictures the singer lying on what appears to be a crucifix dressed in bondage gear with her legs tied down.
The lyrics deal with “demons, death, sex” and refer to alcohol abuse, drug addiction, and the singer’s struggles with mental health.
According to the ASA’s ruling, Demi Lovato’s poster is banned in its original form unless it appears in appropriate locations.
The 1989 music video for Madonna’s “Like A Prayer,” which features the singer dancing in front of burning crosses inside a church and kissing a Black religious figure, was condemned by the Vatican.

     Summary: A promotional poster for Demi Lovato’s latest album ‘Holy Fvck’ has reportedly been banned due to blasphemy.
The album artwork shows Lovato posing in a bondage-style outfit, looking at the camera while atop a cushioned crucifix.
AdvertisementNow, it seems that the promotional poster has been banned by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in part because it was “likely to cause offence to Christians”.
A raunchy poster for @ddlovato's upcoming album Holy Fvck gets banned by ad regulator.
However, Humanist UK have hit out at the ruling, calling it “a de facto ban on blasphemy” in a new statement.

     Summary: Demi Lovato's album poster banned by regulator for being offensive to ChristiansA regulator in the United Kingdom has banned a poster of singer, songwriter and actress Demi Lovato after several complaints that the banner's display of a graphic image of the star adorned in a bondage-style outfit lying on a large, cushioned crucifix-shaped bed was offensive.
To promote her new album, Lovato's poster displayed her record's cover with a headline that stated "DEMI LOVATO" and "HOLY FV**," which is the album's title.
"We considered the ad likely to result in serious and widespread offense and had been targeted irresponsibly."
In August 2022, her latest album HOLY FV** was chosen as No.
ASA "told Universal Music Operations Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause serious or widespread offense in the future."

     Demi Lovato poster banned by UK advertising regulator for being offensive to Christians
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London CNN —Britain’s advertising regulator has banned a poster promoting Demi Lovato’s most recent album for being “likely to cause serious offence to Christians.”The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched an investigation into the poster, which was seen at multiple sites across London in August, after receiving complaints from four members of the public.
The poster featured an image of the album cover under the headline “HOLY FVCK,” which is also the name of the album.
The image showed Lovato sprawled across a large cushioned crucifix in a leather bondage-style outfit.
Under the UK’s code for non-broadcast advertising, ads must be prepared with a “sense of responsibility” and must not contain anything likely to cause serious or widespread offense.
The watchdog investigated and upheld both aspects of the complaints, finding that both the language and the imagery used were likely to cause serious offense.
