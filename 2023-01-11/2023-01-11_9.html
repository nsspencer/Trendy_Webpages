     Nets: Kyrie Irving stern take after falling flat without Kevin Durant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That wasn’t the case for the Brooklyn Nets in their first game since their star was sidelined with injury, falling to the Boston Celtics on Thursday.
The defensive focus shifted completely to Kyrie Irving, who managed to put up 24 points but largely struggled from the field.
The Nets guard shot 9 of 24 from the field and went 3 of 11 from beyond the arc.
Irving spoke out on his takeaways from the loss after the game:“I think I took from it is just not to be discouraged,” said Kyrie Irving after the Nets loss.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn was vocal on not wanting to add any additional pressure on Kyrie Irving to produce in KD’s absence, but it’s clear that they’re going to need him to step up in order to stay afloat.

The mood around the Nets has been a confident one with no sliver of confidence being visibly hindered.
If we know you don’t play harder than the dude that’s next to you, you will get embarrassed.
I’m excited to see our group compete.”While Durant will be watching the Nets from the bench, Kyrie Irving will return as the No.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics took care of business in Brooklyn as they defeated the Nets for their fifth consecutive win, 109-98.
It was a close game throughout as the C's entered the fourth quarter with a two-point lead.
There were 11 lead changes before Boston took control in the fourth quarter and escaped Barclays Center with an 11-point victory.
Kornet also brought down five rebounds, including three offensive boards.
He had a season-high 13 assists, including 10 in the first half, but his refusal to score was a major factor in his team's demise.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving has a tough job ahead of him for at least the next month.
In Thursday’s 109-98 loss to the Boston Celtics, Irving scored 24 points, but it came on 9-of-24 shooting from the field and 3-of-11 shooting from behind the three-point line.
Irving started the game well as he was able to string successful offensive possessions together, but in the second half, Boston’s defense was too much for Irving and the Nets to overcome.
So, they (the Celtics) won the race to get the fourth quarter started off aggressive.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- Kevin Durant is sidelined with a sprained MCL, just like he was last January, but it's not exactly a same-story, different-year situation.
This time, on the night that Durant got hurt, the Brooklyn Nets had a clean injury report.
The same guys who have been playing most of the minutes will continue to play most of the minutes, Brooklyn coach Jacque Vaughn said after practice Wednesday.
Without Durant, the Nets want to cut down their fouls, limit their turnovers and improve their rebounding.
Vaughn said that the Nets' priority is to keep Warren healthy for the rest of the season, so he will not be playing 40 minutes.

Asked afterward about his play, Simmons said Durant’s absence wasn’t necessarily a reason to be more aggressive.
