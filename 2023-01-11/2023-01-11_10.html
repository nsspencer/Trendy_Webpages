    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a story about a former NFL player named Charles Johnson.
A report released on Monday from the state medical examiner's office ruled that Johnson had died by suicide.
It would be unfair to draw a direct correlation between football and Johnson taking his own life.
The report said Johnson had “acute oxycodone, hydrocodone and mirtazapine toxicity” after his death.
Johnson was an NFL player and like so many others, deserves a moment of your time beyond what happens on the field.
