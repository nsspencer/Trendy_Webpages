     Summary: The Miami Heat sank 40 free throws in a row, setting a new NBA recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/APThere's no doubt the Miami Heat were on fire Tuesday night.
And that wasn't all: His final basket also meant that the Heat broke an NBA record — for the most successful free throws in a row in one game — by going 40-for-40 from the line.
Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters he didn't know the team hadn't missed any free throws until after the game.
Butler scored 23 of the Heat's free throws — which puts him in a tie for No.
2 in consecutive successful free throws — and the team broke the record despite having multiple players out with injuries.

     FTX bankruptcy judge terminates Miami Heat arena naming rights deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal bankruptcy judge approved a deal Wednesday to take FTX's name off FTX Arena, home of the NBA's Miami Heat, court documents say.
The failed cryptocurrency exchange inked a 19-year, $135 million name rights agreement in June 2021 with Miami-Dade County that paid the Heat $2 million a year.
The county filed a motion asking the judge presiding over FTX's bankruptcy to approve a stipulation ending the naming rights agreement.
FTX HAS RECOVERED $5B IN LIQUID ASSETS, BANKRUPTCY LAWYER SAYSThe stipulation is retroactive to Dec. 30, 2022.
It terminates all licenses and other rights granted by FTX to Miami-Dade County pursuant to the agreement (and all sublicenses and other rights granted by Miami-Dade County to third parties under such licenses and rights) under any trademarks or trade names, including any naming rights partner marks and arena marks.

     Miami Heat Set NBA Record, Go 40-for-40 from Free Throw Line
    </h2>

     Summary: The Miami Heat (22-20) set an NBA record Tuesday, going a perfect 40-for-40 from the free throw line as Erik Spoelstra’s group edged the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-111.
Miami’s final free throw came on a three-point play by forward Jimmy Butler with 12.9 seconds remaining.
“We’ve been a very good free-throw shooting team all year, but that’s crazy,” said coach Spoelstra postgame.
“It’s just a normal Tuesday night for the Miami Heat.
That’s the team I like.”Miami bested the previous mark set by the Utah Jazz, who went 39-for-39 against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 7, 1982.

     40 for 40 from the free-throw line: Miami Heat break NBA record, capped by Jimmy Butler's game-winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat would've taken a win on Tuesday night any way they could get it.
It required a historic free-throw effort, but Miami got it done with a 112-111 victory over the visiting Thunder.
Jimmy Butler was the hero, finishing with 35 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks.
Indeed, that game-winning free throw by Butler made the Heat an NBA record 40 for 40 from the charity stripe for the game.
It is quite impressive, nonetheless, particularly for a Miami team that came in averaging 22.4 free throws per game, the sixth-lowest mark in the league.
