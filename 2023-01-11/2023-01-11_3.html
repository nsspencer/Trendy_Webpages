     Meyers Leonard to work out with Los Angeles Lakers on Friday: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent center Meyers Leonard will work out for the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, league sources told The Athletic on Thursday.
The Lakers have searched for potential shooting and size, with Leonard and DeMarcus Cousins set for free-agent workouts Friday.
Leonard and Cousins, both of whom Los Angeles will work out on Friday, address needs as stretch-5s that can soak up minutes in the paint.
Leonard (39.0 percent career 3-point shooter) can both pick-and-pop and spot up beyond the arc.
Sterling Brown is currently on a 10-day contract with Los Angeles.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luka Doncic posts 35 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Mavericks past the Lakers in double overtime.
James and Brown immediately expressed their frustration with the outcome of the play to referee Suyah Mehta, who was the closest official to the action.
Brown was asked about the no-call in the postgame locker room and offered a diplomatic response.
"No, it's a f---ing foul," James said strongly for everyone in the room to hear.
But it just looked clear as day like it was a foul," Ham said.

     Lakers, Mavericks both gripe about officiating in controversial double-overtime slugfest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ball fell short, but Brown would have three chances to win the game at the line -- right?
The Lakers and Mavericks went to overtime.
"It looked clear as day that it was a foul," coach Darvin Ham said after the game.
It was hardly the only controversial call to go against the Lakers, but in the grand scheme of things, you could argue that they still ultimately benefitted from the officiating.
The officials seemingly lost control of the game and allowed it to get far more physical than it should have been.

“We knew we weren’t out of it,” said Tim Hardaway Jr., who had 22 points and eight rebounds.
“I'm more tired now,” said Doncic, who rested for only 9 seconds in the final 40 minutes of play.
“I was a little bit surprised (because) I thought they were going to foul, honestly,” Doncic said.
The Lakers pressured Doncic again in the first overtime, and Westbrook was called for a flagrant foul midway through the period.

     Lakers News: Controversial Veteran Big Man To Work Out For LA This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources inform Shams Charania of The Athletic that nine-year veteran center Meyers Leonard is going to audition for LA this Friday.
Leonard will be the second confirmed center that the Lakers are set to work out tomorrow, as it was also announced earlier today that LA is also taking a look at former four-time All-Star five DeMarcus Cousins.
That was more a consequence of off-court issues than it was a reflection of his on-court play, though he dealt with major injury problems during his last NBA season in 2020-21.
Leonard quickly apologized for the incident (unlike some other hypothetical future Lakers), and was enrolled in a cultural diversity program by the NBA.
Leonard boasts a sparkling 39% three-pointer conversion rate on 1.9 tries a night over the duration of his career.

     Lakers: Luka Doncic, Christian Wood Overpower LA In Physical Double-OT Dallas Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight, at a sold-out Crypto.com Arena, your Los Angeles Lakers managed to grind their way back from a 19-point Dallas Mavericks lead to push the Dallas Mavericks to not one, but two overtime periods... before ultimately running out of steam late against, frankly, a better club.
Mavericks All-Star guard Luka Doncic, starting center Christian Wood, and possible trade target small forward Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way for Dallas with nine points apiece.
A terrible free-throw shooting night for the Lakers (63% on 17-of-27 shooting) was salvaged only by an even worse free-throw shooting night for the Mavericks, on significantly lower volume (52.9% on 9-of-17 shooting).
The Lakers' shooting from the floor in general (39.3%) was significantly worse than the Mavericks' (50%).
Luka Doncic notched a high-scoring triple-double 35 points on 14-of-28 shooting from the floor, pulling down 14 boards, and dished out 13 dimes.

     Summary: But according to media reports, the players the Lakers are considering next are going to raise a few more eyebrows.
DeMarcus Cousins, 32, and Meyers Leonard, 30, are expected to work out for the team on Friday, according to Bleacher Report and The Athletic respectively.
Cousins was a Laker before, getting injured prior to the 2019-20 season during a summer workout.
In Leonard’s last full NBA season, he averaged 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 41.4% from 3-point range.
Leonard faced the Lakers in the NBA Finals with the Heat, but only played in two of the six games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Basketball Association Lakers will work out DeMarcus Cousins, Meyers Leonard on Friday 12 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThe Los Angeles Lakers will hold free-agent workouts for four-time NBA All-Star DeMarcus Cousins and veteran center Meyers Leonard on Friday, according to reports.
Sterling Brown, who played for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2021-22 season, signed a 10-day contract with the Lakers on Jan. 6.
On paper, it doesn't make much sense for the Lakers to sign another center, as they currently employ three in Anthony Davis, Thomas Bryant and Damian Jones.
That opens the door for Cousins or Leonard to be the Lakers' true backup center.
Neither Cousins nor Leonard have played in the NBA this season.
