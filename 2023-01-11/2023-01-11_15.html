     Odell Beckham Jr.’s police airplane footage revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free agent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is still waiting to be signed by an NFL team, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been busy off the field.
Back in November, Beckham Jr. made headlines when he was escorted off of a flight at Miami International Airport.
Body camera footage, obtained by WPLG in Miami, shows the moment when Odell Beckham Jr. is met by local authorities, and later led off the plane after exchanges with flight crew and fellow passengers.
When the crew expressed worry about his safety, Beckham Jr. said he didn’t wake up because he was sleeping hard and tired from traveling.
Beckham Jr. was finally led off of the plane by police, who said he seemed sick.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The body cam footage of free agent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. being removed from a plane at Miami International Airport in November was released.
Odell Beckham Jr. had to be escorted off a plane in Miami the Sunday after Thanksgiving and now we have video of how it all went down.
Bodcam footage shows the moments before Odell Beckham Jr was kicked off the airplane in Miami Odell got angry with passengers after they kept looking at him &amp; telling him to get off the flight pic.twitter.com/U9xNdWmJCL — Shannonnn sharpes Burner (PARODY Account) (@shannonsharpeee) January 11, 2023The video shows officers arriving and evaluating Beckham Jr. medically.
“You gonna wait 40 minutes and I’ll be on a private plane home.”Basically, Beckham comes off as a jerk.
Ultimately, this incident isn’t a good look for Beckham Jr. but it’s hard to believe it’ll have much of an impact on his free agency as he searches for a new team.

     Summary: Odell Beckham Jr. was escorted off a flight from Miami to Los Angeles prior to takeoff last Thanksgiving weekend.

He was asked a few questions, which included if he knew where he was, and officers came away satisfied with his responses.

Beckham’s attorney Daniel Davilier explained his client is accustomed to sleeping with a blanket over his head for long flights.
