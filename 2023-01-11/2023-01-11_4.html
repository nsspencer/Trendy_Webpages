     Staff reportedly ‘scared’ and threatening to quit following rumors WWE sold to Saudi Arabia PIF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The move came just days after the revelation that her father, WWE founder, and former CEO Vince McMahon, had installed himself into the top spot on the organization’s board of directors.
Most expected that process to take months, however, late last night rumors came down that WWE was sold to the Saudi Arabia PIF, which is an actual arm of their government and the owners of LIV Golf.
Well, it seems that the news of a WWE sale has sent shock waves of worry and anger throughout the company.
Sami Zayn is one of the company’s performers that has had personal reasons for not appearing at WWE’s yearly Crown Jewel events in Saudi Arabia.
There is also a great deal of concern for many on the roster, and with fans, since this particular deal could mean Vince McMahon returning to his role heading up the content WWE produces.

     WWE sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: World Wrestling Entertainment has reportedly been sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
WWE CEO STEPHANIE MCMAHON ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AMID FATHER'S RETURNThe report of the sale comes just hours after CEO Stephanie McMahon, Vince's daughter, announced her resignation from the company.
According to Front Office Sports, WWE has a 10-year agreement to hold two live events per year in the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund reportedly controls about $620 billion in assets, and the kingdom has been stretching its reach into the world of sports in recent years.
Last year, it spent at least $2 billion to fund LIV Golf’s global challenge to the PGA Tour.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noted combat journalist Ariel Helwani is reporting no deal is in place and WWE is still exploring all options.
Contrary to reports stating otherwise last night, there is no deal in place at this precise moment for WWE to be sold to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund or any entity, sources say.
Steven Muehlhausen of DAZN reported late Tuesday night that the WWE has been sold to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.
Reports of the Saudi Arabia Investment Fund being one of the potential bidders began to surface in the immediate aftermath of McMahon’s return.
As of now, it is unclear if the potential sale will thrust him back into a creative role within the company.

     Report: WWE Doesn't Have Deal to Sell to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesDespite rumors making the rounds on social media late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, there is reportedly not a deal in place to sell WWE to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
Cassidy Haynes of BodySlam.net later reported that while WWE and Saudi Arabia have agreed to a deal in principle, it hasn't been finalized.
The agreement has been a lucrative one for WWE, as each Saudi Arabia event nets WWE between $50 million and $55 million, per Thurston.
In addition to owning PGA Tour competitor LIV Golf, the Saudi Public Investment Fund owns 80 percent of English Premier League soccer club Newcastle United, and the country of Saudi Arabia has hosted several significant sporting events.
WWE would be a huge addition to the Public Investment Fund's portfolio, but it appears all reports of a deal being in place were premature.

     WWE Sources Say Company Not Sold to Saudi Arabia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE has not been sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund ... this according to sources familiar with the situation.
TMZ Sports is told ... a deal has not been made between the two sides, despite widespread rumors saying otherwise.
The reports started to circulate Tuesday night ... claiming Vince McMahon secured a massive payday for handing over the company reins to Saudi Arabia, which would take the WWE private once again.
Hours before the reported Saudi Arabia deal, Vince's daughter, Stephanie, announced her departure from WWE ... giving up her role as Co-CEO.
A sale to Saudi Arabia would certainly cause backlash with WWE fans ... especially considering the country's history of human rights violations.
