     Raiders Evaluating Trade Market for QB Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has likely played his final snap in Silver and Black.
According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, the Raiders “will begin the process of evaluating the trade market” for the veteran quarterback.
Sources: The #Raiders will begin the process of evaluating the trade market for QB Derek Carr, as they prepare for a decision on their QB for the future.
Carr particularly struggled down the stretch, tossing nine interceptions over his final five games as Las Vegas failed to qualify for the postseason.
Selected 36th overall in the 2014 draft, Carr has spent his entire nine-year NFL career with the Raiders.

     QB Derek Carr says goodbye to Raider Nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Derek Carr said farewell to the Las Vegas Raiders over social media on Thursday.
"Raider Nation it breaks my heart I didn't get an opportunity to say goodbye in person," Carr wrote on Twitter.
"I once said that if I'm not a Raider I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way," Carr wrote.
The Raiders are expected to attempt to trade Carr, who has a no-trade clause in the three-year, $121.5 million extension he signed in April.
Carr was benched for the final two games of the season and stepped away from the team during that time.

     Summary: Dan Orlovsky commends Derek Carr on his leadership and breaks down how his skill set should ensure a starting QB position in the future.
(1:36)HENDERSON, Nev. -- Two weeks and a day after being benched by the Las Vegas Raiders, quarterback Derek Carr broke his silence and bade farewell to the team's fans in a statement on social media Thursday.
Carr had been the Raiders' starting quarterback since being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.
In his latest statement, Carr acknowledged those feelings but said he looked forward to playing for another NFL team.
The Raiders finished 6-11, and Carr finished with 3,522 passing yards, 24 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 15 games.

     Derek Carr landing spots in 2023: Six potential trade fits for three-time Pro Bowl QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jets have to be considered among the favorites to land Carr.
Owner Woody Johnson said on Thursday that he "absolutely" is willing to pay for a veteran passer this year.
But if there are concerns about Garoppolo’s injury history or potential contract demands, Carr could be a legitimate, bird-in-the-hand option.
After Zach Wilson’s struggles, one must wonder how interested the Jets would be in drafting another passer high this spring.
The Jets have a good defense, some decent offensive line pieces, good running backs and some talented, young receivers.

     Derek Carr pens goodbye letter to Raiders, should Washington pursue?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas quarterback Derek Carr unofficially confirmed the end of his Raiders' tenure on Thursday, sharing a heartfelt goodbye letter to the only franchise he's ever played for.
In what has seemed to become an annual tradition, the Washington Commanders are back in the market for a quarterback after the Carson Wentz experiment failed.
For the Commanders, Carr is the best veteran available that's also a realistic option.
Washington defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio spent three years as the Raiders coach from 2015-2017; Carr was his starting quarterback in each of those seasons.
Despite all the talent the Raiders surrounded Carr with, he turned in one of his worst professional seasons to date.

     Summary: “So I look forward to a new city and a new team who, no matter the circumstance, will get everything I have.
Oh, and Jets Coach Robert Saleh chimed in Thursday by asserting that Gang Green will be “as aggressive as heck when it comes to quarterback play” this offseason.
Having been benched by McDaniels, might Carr want to lead the Raiders coach’s former team back to the promised land?
It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that for all of his years in the NFL, Carr is still just 31.
One can certainly imagine an NFL team convincing itself of that, and acting accordingly.
