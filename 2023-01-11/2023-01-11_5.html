     Shareholder files a lawsuit against Vince McMahon over his return to power in WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CategoriesNEWS TICKER WWE NewsBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)WWE shareholder Scott Fellows has filed a lawsuit against Vince McMahon over the way he returned to the company.
The lawsuit filed in Delaware’s Chancery Court and accuses McMahon of using his 81 percent voting control “to out three board members, replace them with loyalists, and push through bylaw changes that would ‘impose his will on the board and WWE,'” according to a story published by Bloomberglaw.com.
Powell’s POV: Fellows is seeking to have the bylaw changes invalidated and a reimbursement for costs and fees.
I view the situation exactly as the lawsuit describes it, but whether it leads to any change remains to be seen.

Due to allegations of sexual assault, McMahon resigned from his position as CEO and chairman of WWE last year, but McMahon said in a statement that he was rejoining the board of directors to assist in the sale of the WWE.
It is also worth noting the deletion of the initial Muehlhausen report detailing the transaction.

     Summary: WWE Inc. chief Vince McMahon—who returned to the company in early January after resigning amid a wave of sexual harassment allegations—is facing investor litigation over claims that he pushed aside the board to illegally install himself as chairman.

His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, who resigned as co-CEO and chairwoman Tuesday, is married to another top executive, former WWE champion Paul “Triple H” Levesque.
Potential Class Size: Thousands of holders of 43.3 million WWE shares, according to the complaint.
Attorneys: The investor leading the case, Scott Fellows, is represented by Labaton Sucharow LLP, Friedlander &amp; Gorris PA, Friedman Oster &amp; Tejtel PLLC, and Kaskela Law LLC.

     Vince McMahon’s WWE Sale Would Body Slam UFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Vince McMahon not-quite-voluntary resigned from WWE last summer, Wall Street began suggesting World Wrestling Entertainment should be sold.
Instead, it seems McMahon is looking to force a sale—and probably place an exclamation mark on WWE’s supremacy over UFC.
Already, McMahon’s return to “maximize shareholder value” has rallied shares up 30% this year, after a superb 2022 that saw WWE stock advance 40%.
Founded in 1993 and not even half the age of WWE, UFC is now about even on two major metrics: social media followers (WWE 60.4 million; UFC 59.5 million) and revenue (for 2021: WWE $974 million; UFC roughly $1 billion*).
By another metric, Endeavor and UFC are more valuable than WWE.
