     Phoenix Suns remain shorthanded Wednesday against Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns will continue to battle shorthanded on Wednesday with the second leg of a road back-to-back against the Denver Nuggets.
Wing Cam Johnson (right meniscus tear), Deandre Ayton (ankle sprain) and forward Jae Crowder (not with team) all remain out.
Guards Damion Lee and Washington combined for 43 points in Tuesday’s win and will be asked to shoulder much of the ball-handling load again Wednesday.
Phoenix (21-21) will only have two games over the next seven days after the contest against the Nuggets, meaning the team can rest and await returns of its regulars.
The Suns travel to the Nuggets at 8 p.m. on 98.7, the Arizona Sports app and ArizonaSports.com.

     Suns update: Saben Lee signs 10-day as Phoenix plays Denver in second of road back-to-back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER – The Phoenix Suns' injury report didn’t change from Tuesday.
Booker will be re-evaluated the last full week of January as he suffered his groin strain in Phoenix’s Christmas loss at Denver.
Booker had missed three games with groin soreness, returned at Denver and had the groin strain within the first five minutes of the first quarter against the Nuggets.
The Suns signed Saben Lee to a 10-day Wednesday as he's with the team.
The 6-3 guard played his first two NBA seasons with Detroit and played two games with Philadelphia this season.

     Cam Johnson’s return from knee injury for Phoenix Suns should be ‘soon’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns’ season was in a completely different state the last time Cam Johnson played.
Since then, a torn right meniscus for Johnson was the start of a plethora of injuries hitting the Suns.
Despite that, Phoenix found a high point through a spectacular shorthanded win over the Golden State Warriors trending them back in the right direction.
All that together has Phoenix at a record of 21-21 entering Wednesday’s matchup with the Denver Nuggets as they are hoping for some reinforcements soon.
The reported timeline on Johnson’s absence was one-to-two months, per ESPN’s Brain Windhorst, a timeline that passed on Jan 3.

     Saben Lee returns to Phoenix Suns on a 10-day contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Tuesday’s upset by the shorthanded Phoenix Suns over the defending champion Golden State Warriors, The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported on Wednesday morning that Phoenix would sign guard Saben Lee to a 10-day contract.
Lee signed a two-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers in November, along with former Summer Sun Louis King.
For the Sixers’ affiliate, Delaware Blue Coats, Lee played in eight games, averaging 24.6 points (51/41/75 shooting), 5.8 rebounds, and 6.6 assists (3.0 turnovers) in 34.5 minutes.
Lee has a reputation for rim pressure, which Phoenix has been missing direly in the absences of Devin Booker and Cam Payne, especially.
For reference, only Josh Okogie (.452) and Bismack Biyombo (.444) are above .400 on the Suns this season; Booker is at .304.
