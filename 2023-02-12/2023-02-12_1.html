     Summary: "We played really well for 80 minutes, we gave it our all.
We had some big chances, in the second half especially.
They had one chance and you can't give a player who's got that much confidence so much time in the box.
We can be proud in a week that's been tricky for the club.
Skoobs and his staff have done brilliantly, let's see what next week brings.
