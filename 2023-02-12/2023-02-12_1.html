     Megan Fox Deleted MGK Off Her Instagram and Captioned Her Post With a Lyric From Beyoncé's “Lemonade”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Megan Fox’s latest Instagram activity points arrows toward a breakup with her fiancé Machine Gun Kelly.
The 36-year-old actress posted her glam from Super Bowl Weekend in Scottsdale, Arizona along with a bonfire where she burns what appears to be a letter and some kind of apparel.
She captioned the post, “You can taste the dishonesty/It’s all over your breath,” lyrics from Beyonce’s “Pray You Catch Me” about her husband’s alleged affair.
It also appears she’s deleted photos of MGK off of her Instagram.
The pair appeared together only hours before Megan’s post at Drake’s Super Bowl party.

     Instagram Drama Implies Troubling Developments With Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All signs point to discord in the private lives of actress Megan Fox and musician Machine Gun Kelly.
As a caption, Fox wrote, “You can taste the dishonesty/ it’s all over your breath.” This is a lyric from Beyoncé’s song “Pray You Catch Me" from the 2016 album Lemonade, widely accepted to be commentary on her husband Jay-Z’s infidelity.
Lastly, Fox, who has 21 million followers, made some adjustments to the list of people she was following.
The pics of the maybe-not-so-much-engaged-anymore couple show Fox in the same alluring dress that was later seen on Instagram.
Weirdly enough, earlier that same Friday, Kelly was performing at the preposterously named “Waste Management Phoenix Open” (a golf tournament that also includes rap-rockers?

     Megan Fox Might Be Taking Off That Thorny Engagement Ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyNot the type of fumble you thought you’d be hearing about on Super Bowl Sunday, huh?
It looks like Machine Gun Kelly may have cheated on his fiancée, Megan Fox.
Fox, who was the poster girl in MGK’s teenage bedroom, previously announced her engagement to the musician in January 2022.
The pair frequently referred to their relationship as a “dark fairytale,” so naturally, her engagement ring had to match the tone.
So if she tries to take it off, it hurts,” MGK told Vogue.
