More infoPatrick Mahomes will look to break a 24-year standing NFL curse at Super Bowl LVII when he takes his team to Arizona to face the Philadelphia Eagles.
Mahomes' incredible season comes somewhat as a comeback, after his most difficult year of his career in 2021 when he made a number of mistakes and threw more interceptions than he ever has.
But that mattered little to the 27-year-old, who continued to perform at an elite level.
