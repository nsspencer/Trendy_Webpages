     Instagram Drama Implies Troubling Developments With Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All signs point to discord in the private lives of actress Megan Fox and musician Machine Gun Kelly.
As a caption, Fox wrote, “You can taste the dishonesty/ it’s all over your breath.” This is a lyric from Beyoncé’s song “Pray You Catch Me" from the 2016 album Lemonade, widely accepted to be commentary on her husband Jay-Z’s infidelity.
Lastly, Fox, who has 21 million followers, made some adjustments to the list of people she was following.
The pics of the maybe-not-so-much-engaged-anymore couple show Fox in the same alluring dress that was later seen on Instagram.
Weirdly enough, earlier that same Friday, Kelly was performing at the preposterously named “Waste Management Phoenix Open” (a golf tournament that also includes rap-rockers?

     Megan Fox Sparks Machine Gun Kelly Breakup Rumors After Deleting Their Photos &amp; Quoting Beyonce’s ‘Lemonade’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Are Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox calling it quits?
Rumors about a possible breakup between the pop-punk star and actress are swirling after Fox posted a cryptic message to her Instagram on Sunday (Feb. 12) quoting lyrics from Beyonce‘s 2016 Lemonade song “Pray You Catch Me.” Hours after the post, Fox deactivated her Instagram account altogether.
To further ignite the split rumors, Fox also deleted all photos and videos of herself with Kelly on Instagram, including their engagement announcement from January 2022.
Kelly’s Instagram still featured photos of himself with Fox at press time.
Kelly and Fox first met in spring 2020 while they were filming the movie Midnight in the Switchgrass in Puerto Rico.

     Megan Fox Might Be Taking Off That Thorny Engagement Ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like Machine Gun Kelly may have cheated on his fiancée, Megan Fox.
Alright, so she didn’t outright accuse him of infidelity, but she’s done the social-media equivalent of that.
She hasn’t confirmed anything, but quoting a song like “Pray You Catch Me” and then taking a break from social media?
Fox, who was the poster girl in MGK’s teenage bedroom, previously announced her engagement to the musician in January 2022.
The pair frequently referred to their relationship as a “dark fairytale,” so naturally, her engagement ring had to match the tone.
