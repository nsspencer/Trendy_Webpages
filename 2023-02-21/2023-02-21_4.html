     Summary: A guide to Ash Wednesday and Lent Published 10:28 am Tuesday, February 21, 2023St. Francis of Assisi in Brookhaven will have Ash Wednesday Mass at 12:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
But many may not know what Ash Wednesday is, and why Lincoln County residents may be seen with ash on their foreheads in the shape of a cross.
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent.
Friar John Paul Mary, a presenter on the Catholic cable channel EWTN, suggests Catholics visit the confessional close to Ash Wednesday rather than well into or at the end of Lent.
Though its origins are unclear, the practice of Lent was formalized at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D.
