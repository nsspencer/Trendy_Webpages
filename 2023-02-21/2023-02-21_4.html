    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Western elites aren’t trying to conceal their goals, to inflict a ‘strategic defeat’ to Russia,” Putin said in the speech broadcast by all state TV channels.
Many observers predicted it would also address Moscow’s fallout with the West — and Putin began with strong words for those countries.
And we are using force to end it,” Putin said before an audience of lawmakers, state officials and soldiers who have fought in Ukraine.
Putin said Tuesday in a major address that Russia was not fully withdrawing from the treaty yet.
The Russian president had postponed the state-of-the-nation address before: In 2017, the speech was rescheduled for early 2018.

     Vladimir Putin is Escalating Nuclear Brinkmanship as the Ukraine War Enters its Second Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vladimir Putin marked the one-year mark of his brutal war of aggression with some nuclear saber-rattling.
It’s unclear what, exactly, that will mean, especially considering Russia has already been defying key provisions of the accord.
But it is unquestionably yet another dangerous escalation by Putin, at a point in his Ukraine offensive when nuclear concerns are high.
If Ukraine stops fighting and the United States and the coalition stops helping them fight, Ukraine disappears from the map.
“He thought he could outlast us,” Biden said of Putin Monday.

The U.S. has previously accused Russia of violating the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the two countries.
Within days, Putin sent Russian troops ostensibly to defend Moscow's new allies under a quickly signed security agreement.

In a nearly two-hour speech to both houses of the Russian Parliament, Putin said he was suspending Moscow's participation in New START –a strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia.
"In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty," he said.

     Summary: MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Tuesday that Moscow was suspending its participation in the New START treaty — the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the United States — sharply upping the ante amid tensions with Washington over the fighting in Ukraine.
Explaining his decision to suspend Russia’s obligations under the 2010 New START treaty, Putin accused the U.S. and its NATO allies of openly declaring the goal of Russia’s defeat in Ukraine.
Hours after his address, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the caps on nuclear weapons set under the treaty.

“In this situation, Rosatom (Russia’s state nuclear corporation) and the Defense Ministry must ensure readiness for Russian nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said.

“I want to repeat: it was they who unleashed the war,” Putin said.

Stoltenberg also stressed that Russia was the aggressor, and said Putin had made it clear he was preparing for more war.
He said support for Ukraine must continue and expressed concerns China was planning to back Russia in the war, according to Reuters.
