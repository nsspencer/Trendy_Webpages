     Man Claims He Is LL Cool J’s ‘Hidden’ Biological Son
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now it seems LL Cool J can be included in the same category.
Over the weekend, a video of rapper LoveBenji began to circulate online, where the rapper claimed that he is the “hidden son” of LL Cool J, though he’s only aware of his dad by his government name, James Todd Smith.
LL Cool J has not publicly responded to the allegations, and it is unclear if there is any truth to LoveBenji’s claims.
But many of you probably know him as LL Cool J,” he said.
He claimed that LL blocked him on socials, though he sends him $200 every once in a while.
