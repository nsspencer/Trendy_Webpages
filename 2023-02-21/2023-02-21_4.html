     Bread Dough King Cake Recipe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead of making a bread dough, we’re taking some bread dough rolls from the freezer to make this King Cake.
Let the bread dough thaw out on the counter.
Spread that over the bread dough, and roll it up like cinnamon rolls.
Once cooked, combine 1.5 cups of powdered sugar with 3 tablespoons of milk and some vanilla extract.
That makes an icing you put on the King Cake, then sprinkle with green, purple, and gold colored sugar or sprinkles.
