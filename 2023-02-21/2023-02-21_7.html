     Summary: A guide to Ash Wednesday and Lent Published 10:28 am Tuesday, February 21, 2023St. Francis of Assisi in Brookhaven will have Ash Wednesday Mass at 12:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
But many may not know what Ash Wednesday is, and why Lincoln County residents may be seen with ash on their foreheads in the shape of a cross.
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent.
Friar John Paul Mary, a presenter on the Catholic cable channel EWTN, suggests Catholics visit the confessional close to Ash Wednesday rather than well into or at the end of Lent.
Though its origins are unclear, the practice of Lent was formalized at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D.

     Summary: Which is why I usually find myself in church on Ash Wednesday, even if I don‚Äôt go on Easter or Christmas.
This shouldn‚Äôt bother anyone in the mental health field.
Christians are likelier to understand themselves as embodied souls, whereas psychology might grant that we are ensouled bodies.
Mental health depends on freeing the mind of delusions and asserting the will while disavowing repression and excessive guilt.
But Ash Wednesday is when this collision of values, concepts and solutions presents itself to me most poignantly.
