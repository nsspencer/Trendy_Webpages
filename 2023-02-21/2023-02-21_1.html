     Six killed after fresh earthquake hits Turkey-Syria border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: People sit as others search amid the rubble in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey February 14, 2023.
Six people were killed in the latest earthquake to strike the border region of Turkey and Syria, authorities said on Tuesday, two weeks after a massive tremor killed more than 47,000 people and damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes.
Monday's quake of magnitude 6.4 was centered near the Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.
"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet," said Muna Al Omar, holding her seven-year-old son.
Erdogan, in power for two decades, faces presidential and parliamentary elections in May, although the disaster could prompt a delay.

     New 6.4 earthquake hits Turkey and Syria, killing at least six
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A NEW 6.4 magnitude earthquake killed at least six people and injured hundreds more on Monday in parts of Turkey and Syria already laid waste two weeks ago by a massive quake that killed tens of thousands, authorities said.
The shock from the quake was felt as far away as Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, and was followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 tremor.
Initially Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said that three people had been killed and 213 injured.
In the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets into their cars.
The February 6 quake killed nearly 45,000 people in both countries, the vast majority of them in Turkey, where more than a million-and-a-half people are now in temporary shelters.
