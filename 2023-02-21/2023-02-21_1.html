     Summary: It shipped 188 tonnes of gold worth 10.1 billion Swiss francs last year to Turkey, up from only 11 tonnes in 2021.
Switzerland's gold exports to Turkey have never previously exceeded 34 tonnes in a single month, Swiss data shows.
India and China are the two biggest gold consumer markets and demand often rises when gold prices are low and falls when gold prices increase.
Gold prices rocketed from a low of $1,615.59 an ounce in early November to as high as $1,959.60 on Feb. 2 before slipping back to around $1,840 by Tuesday.
