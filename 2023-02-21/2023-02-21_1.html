     Summary: People sit as others search amid the rubble in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey February 14, 2023.
Six people were killed in the latest earthquake to strike the border region of Turkey and Syria, authorities said on Tuesday, two weeks after a massive tremor killed more than 47,000 people and damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes.
Monday's quake of magnitude 6.4 was centered near the Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.
"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet," said Muna Al Omar, holding her seven-year-old son.
Erdogan, in power for two decades, faces presidential and parliamentary elections in May, although the disaster could prompt a delay.

     Death toll from latest earthquakes in Turkey reaches eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Millions of people who fled ruined cities across southern Turkey and northern Syria, which were both shaken violently by the two tremors on Monday evening, now fear for their lives in temporary shelters.
The first 6.3-magnitude quake struck near the Turkish city of Antakya, which was all but destroyed by the 6 February quake and is largely uninhabitable.
The second hit near the Mediterranean coast, reverberating deep into the Levant and underscoring the geological impact of one of the century’s biggest earthquakes.
In southern Turkey’s disaster zone, two weeks of quakes and aftershocks have scythed a haphazard path, destroying some communities while seemingly sparing others.
“But the evidence of the recent catastrophic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria shows only too well that the principle is not the practice.
