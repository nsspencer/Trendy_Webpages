     'They started the war': Russia's Putin blames West and Ukraine for provoking conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday used a highly anticipated speech to deny responsibility for the war in Ukraine and lash out at his adversaries.
His comments come despite repeated rejections of Putin's narrative surrounding the war by Western nations and Ukraine.
Feb. 24 will mark one year since Russia mounted a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, beginning a ground war in Europe that Putin still refers to as a "special military operation."
Stoltenberg also stressed that Russia was the aggressor, and said Putin had made it clear he was preparing for more war.
Putin further warned in his speech Russia could resume nuclear tests.

     Summary: Biden was scheduled to deliver an address from Poland on his view of Russia's war in Ukraine as the conflict approaches the one-year mark.
In his nearly two-hour speech to both houses of the Russian Parliament, Putin said he was suspending Moscow's participation in New START – a strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia.
"In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty," he said.

     Putin: Russia to suspend participation in last remaining nuclear treaty with U.S.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual state of the nation address at the Gostiny Dvor conference centre in central Moscow.
Photo: Dmitry Astakhov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on Monday that Russia was suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms control treaty — the last remaining arms control agreement between Washington and Moscow.
Catch up quick: The U.S. earlier this year accused Russia of violating the terms of the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) pact by refusing to allow on-site inspections.
The New START treaty, which entered into force in 2011 and had been extended through February 2026, seeks to limit the long-range nuclear weapons programs of the U.S. and Russia.
But when the U.S. sought to resume them last August, Russia rebuffed the efforts, the State Department said.

The U.S. has previously accused Russia of violating the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the two countries.
Within days, Putin sent Russian troops ostensibly to defend Moscow's new allies under a quickly signed security agreement.

     Summary: “Western elites aren’t trying to conceal their goals, to inflict a ‘strategic defeat’ to Russia,” Putin said in the speech broadcast by all state TV channels.
Many observers predicted it would also address Moscow’s fallout with the West — and Putin began with strong words for those countries.
And we are using force to end it,” Putin said before an audience of lawmakers, state officials and soldiers who have fought in Ukraine.
Putin said Tuesday in a major address that Russia was not fully withdrawing from the treaty yet.
The Russian president had postponed the state-of-the-nation address before: In 2017, the speech was rescheduled for early 2018.

In his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast his country — and Ukraine — as victims of Western double-dealing and said it was Russia, not Ukraine, fighting for its very existence.
“We aren’t fighting the Ukrainian people,” Putin said in a speech days before the war’s first anniversary on Friday.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and made a dash toward Kyiv, apparently expecting to quickly overrun the capital.
Analysts expected Putin's speech would be tough in the wake of Biden's visit to Kyiv on Monday.

Russia's defence ministry and nuclear corporation should therefore be ready to test Russian nuclear weapons if necessary, he said.

Putin made the declaration in his much-delayed annual state of the nation address to Russia’s National Assembly on Tuesday.
The treaty puts limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons that both the US and Russia can have.
Under the key nuclear arms control treaty, both the United States and Russia are permitted to conduct inspections of each other’s weapons sites, though inspections had been halted since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,” the spokesperson said.
