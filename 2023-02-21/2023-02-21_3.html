     Summary: Biden was scheduled to deliver an address from Poland on his view of Russia's war in Ukraine as the conflict approaches the one-year mark.
In his nearly two-hour speech to both houses of the Russian Parliament, Putin said he was suspending Moscow's participation in New START – a strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia.
"In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty," he said.

     'They started the war': Russia's Putin blames West and Ukraine for provoking conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday used a highly anticipated speech to deny responsibility for the war in Ukraine and lash out at his adversaries.
His comments come despite repeated rejections of Putin's narrative surrounding the war by Western nations and Ukraine.
Feb. 24 will mark one year since Russia mounted a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, beginning a ground war in Europe that Putin still refers to as a "special military operation."
Stoltenberg also stressed that Russia was the aggressor, and said Putin had made it clear he was preparing for more war.
Putin further warned in his speech Russia could resume nuclear tests.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Western elites aren’t trying to conceal their goals, to inflict a ‘strategic defeat’ to Russia,” Putin said in the speech broadcast by all state TV channels.
Many observers predicted it would also address Moscow’s fallout with the West — and Putin began with strong words for those countries.
And we are using force to end it,” Putin said before an audience of lawmakers, state officials and soldiers who have fought in Ukraine.
Putin said Tuesday in a major address that Russia was not fully withdrawing from the treaty yet.
The Russian president had postponed the state-of-the-nation address before: In 2017, the speech was rescheduled for early 2018.

     New START: Putin halts Russia's role in last nuclear reduction pact with the US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is suspending his country’s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, imperiling the last remaining pact that regulates the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals.
Putin made the declaration in his much-delayed annual state of the nation address to Russia’s National Assembly on Tuesday.
The treaty puts limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons that both the US and Russia can have.
Under the key nuclear arms control treaty, both the United States and Russia are permitted to conduct inspections of each other’s weapons sites, though inspections had been halted since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,” the spokesperson said.
