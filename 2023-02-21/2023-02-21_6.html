     Gavrikov Trade to Bruins Reportedly Getting Close
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins have just $33k in deadline cap space and a hair over $1 million in LTIR relief to make this deal work.
With only 21 players on the roster, they can’t really demote anyone to the AHL to make room, thus a cap-clearing trade would likely have to be made to fit Gavrikov in at all.
This is, of course, assuming there isn’t a ton of salary retention going on and a third-party broker doesn’t get involved here.
If the price for Gavrikov is a first and third, it’s no surprise it has taken some time to get this deal done.
That’s a solid return for the Blue Jackets.

     NHL rumors: Bruins have 'framework' of a trade for Vladislav Gavrikov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins are inching closer and closer to acquiring Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, according to the latest reports.
(2/2) — David Pagnotta (@TheFourthPeriod) February 21, 2023Gavrikov has been linked to the Bruins in several rumors over the last few weeks.
Gavrikov could end up being the Bruins' sixth or seventh defenseman.
He's best used as a defensive defenseman who eats up 20-plus minutes per game, kills penalties and blocks shots.
Gavrikov leads the Blue Jackets at 22:10 of ice time per game, and he ranks fifth in the league in shorthanded time on ice per game (3:31).

If the season continues to go this well, the Bruins will start their playoff journey in mid-April.
Editor’s note: This story was corrected to show that the Bruins play the Seattle Kraken away on Thursday, not the Buffalo Sabres at home.

     Bruins, Blue Jackets working on Gavrikov trade — The Fourth Period
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins and Columbus Blue Jackets have been in trade discussions about defenceman Vladislav Gavrikov and a deal could be coming to fruition.
As TFP’s David Pagnotta reported on Tuesday, the Blue Jackets and Bruins are believed to have agreed to the framework of a Gavrikov trade, but Boston needs to complete another trade to free up cap space.
According to Pagnotta, the Bruins are currently trying to move froward Craig Smith, who is in the final year of his contract and comes with a $3.1 million salary cap hit.
Gavrikov, 27, is also scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent July 1.
He owns a $2.8 million cap hit.

     Source: Blue Jackets ‘Really Like’ Bruins Prospect Lohrei
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports continued to percolate this past weekend that the Boston Bruins are frontrunners in the NHL trade sweepstakes for Columbus Blue Jackets and pending unrestricted free agent defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov.
On Tuesday, a trusted NHL source confirmed to Boston Hockey Now that there is indeed serious interest in Lohrei from the Blue Jackets.
“One of the reasons that Gavrikov was given the trade-related sit out is because the Boston Bruins are in on him.
I really do think they like Gavrikov from Columbus, and I think Gavrikov was pulled from the games is because I think they were talking to Boston.
Also, there has been plenty of NHL trade chatter that the Blue Jackets will follow up a Gavrikov trade and acquire Chychrun.

     Bruins reportedly close to acquiring Vladislav Gavrikov from Blue Jackets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- With the NHL's trade deadline nearing, there's been some smoke surrounding the Bruins and Columbus defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov.
That smoke intensified on Tuesday, with David Pagnotta reporting that the Bruins are getting awfully close to acquiring Gavrikov from the Blue Jackets.
Pagnotta noted that the Blue Jackets "won't wait forever," so it's up to the Bruins to clear the necessary cap space in an expeditious manner.

Smith, an impending unrestricted free agent, is carrying a $3.1 million cap hit this season.
