     Karl Rove lauds Ron DeSantis' Ukraine position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The man once known as George W. Bush’s brain is lauding Ron DeSantis for smart moves on Ukraine.
I don’t think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons.
I think Russia has been really, really wounded here, and I don’t think that they are the same threat to our country, even though they’re hostile,” DeSantis added.
“I don’t think they’re on the same level as a China.
Rove has taken a pro-DeSantis turn in the nascent 2024 GOP Presidential Primary, bemoaning former President Donald Trump for “childish attacks” on DeSantis.

     The problem(s) with Ron DeSantis’ flawed foreign policy vision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An unfortunate group of Republicans were a little too quick to complain yesterday about President Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv.
As a governor, the Florida Republican generally doesn’t have to focus much of his attention on foreign policy and international affairs.
Ron DeSantis (R) called out President Biden for his “blank-check policy” on Ukraine after the president traveled to Kyiv for an unannounced visit shortly before the one-year mark of Putin’s assault.
DeSantis seems to think the best way to advance his ambitions is to criticize existing U.S. support for our Ukrainian allies.
That says a lot about DeSantis’ assumptions about what GOP voters want to hear, but it also sends a striking signal abroad.

     Summary: The hosts wanted to know if it was a “good move” for Biden to visit Ukraine, and that’s when DeSantis blamed Biden for not appropriately focusing on domestic priorities.
After questioning the supposed “objective” in Ukraine, DeSantis then downplayed the threat of Russian aggression.
I don’t think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons, so I think Russia has been really, really wounded here.
And I don’t think that they are the same threat to our country, even though they’re hostile.

     Ron DeSantis Goes Full Trump on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the most significant unanswered questions of the Republican presidential nominating contest has been what posture Ron DeSantis would take on foreign policy in general, and the Russia-Ukraine war in particular.
During his remarks, DeSantis repeated the main themes used by conservative opponents of aiding Ukraine.
The accommodations the party’s hawks will make to DeSantis are already being previewed in the conservative media.
National Review’s Dan McLaughlin, a proud Reaganite, recently praised DeSantis for steering clear of the Trumpist line on Ukraine.
Putin’s main hope has rested on Donald Trump returning to office in 2025.
