     Summary: A guide to Ash Wednesday and Lent Published 10:28 am Tuesday, February 21, 2023St. Francis of Assisi in Brookhaven will have Ash Wednesday Mass at 12:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
But many may not know what Ash Wednesday is, and why Lincoln County residents may be seen with ash on their foreheads in the shape of a cross.

Though its origins are unclear, the practice of Lent was formalized at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D.
