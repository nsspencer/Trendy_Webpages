     Alabama star freshman Brandon Miller brought gun used in fatal shooting to Darius Miles, per police testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star freshman Brandon Miller brought the gun that teammate Darius Miles allegedly used in a January killing in Tuscaloosa, according to police testimony cited by AL.com.
Miller's role, which was not revealed publicly until Tuesday's law enforcement testimony, has not resulted in charges or known punishment from within the team.
Citing the testimony of Tuscaloosa Violent Crimes Unit officer Branden Culpepper, the Tuscaloosa News reported that the gun belonged to Miles and Miller provided the weapon upon Miles' request.
Alabama coach Nate Oats told reporters that his star forward "hasn't been in any type of trouble nor is he in any type of trouble in this case."
We were informed by law enforcement of other student-athletes being in the vicinity, and law enforcement has repeatedly told us that no other student-athletes were suspects—they were witnesses only.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama basketball star Brandon Miller allegedly provided the handgun that was used to kill a woman last month, according to police in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Paula Whitley, Tuscaloosa chief deputy district attorney, told AL.com on Tuesday that "there's nothing we could charge [Miller] with."
Miles, who has since been removed from the Crimson Tide program, and Davis were charged with capital murder last month.
"We knew about that," Oats said when asked about Miller allegedly bringing the gun to Miles.
A defense lawyer, meanwhile, suggested during Tuesday's hearing that Miles was reacting defensively when he told Davis where the gun was located.

If anything, everyone involved … Davis, Miles, Miller, the entire University of Alabama are lucky that only one person died that evening on The Strip.
Maybe Miller keeps playing or maybe he doesn’t.
Maybe Alabama wins the national title or maybe it all falls apart.
