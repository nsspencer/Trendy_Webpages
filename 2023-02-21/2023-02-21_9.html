     Patrick Beverley claims he picked Bulls over Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a sign that the buyout market may not save the Warriors this year, Golden State was reportedly close to adding irritant Patrick Beverley, according to the guard himself.
Beverley ended up with the Chicago Bulls after the Los Angeles Lakers traded him and the Orlando Magic bought him out.
The 34-year-old said the Warriors encouraged him to take a better offer, and by his own admission, it's not clear the Warriors even made an offer of their own.
If this is an opportunity you want to take, go ahead, we respect it, we know there’s a lot of teams after you,’” Beverley said.
Beverley’s career has been characterized by his determination, hard-nosed defense and nonstop trash talk, including of the Warriors.

     Can Patrick Beverley help save the Chicago Bulls’ season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free agent Patrick Beverley is expected to sign with the Chicago Bulls, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.
And can a player picked up this late in the game really change the course of a team’s season?
One of the few bright spots in the Bulls’ season has been their defense.
On the season, he’s in the 19th percentile in steal percentage for his position (per Cleaning the Glass).
His arrival will not reincarnate the Chicago team that shocked the world by starting last season 27-11.
