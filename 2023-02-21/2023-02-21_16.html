    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO (CBS) -- The Chicago Bulls announced Tuesday that point guard Lonzo Ball will miss the rest of the season, as he continues a lengthy recovery process from a meniscus tear in his left knee.
"Despite making significant increases in strength and function over the past several months, Bulls guard Lonzo Ball continues to experience performance limiting discomfort during participation in high level basketball-related activities," Bulls executive vice president Arturas Karnisovas said in a statement.
"Considering the required time period to achieve the necessary level of fitness to return-to-play and the current stage of the NBA season, Ball will not return this season.
When healthy last season, Chicago was one of the most entertaining and successful teams to watch, and that was because of Ball's presence.
For the time being, that's good enough for a Bulls team that still has a shot at a play-in spot after the All-Star break.
