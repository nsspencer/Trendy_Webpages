     The Real Reason Why Mardi Gras is Called Fat Tuesday—Experts Explain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mardi Gras HistoryThe origins of the festival trace back to 17th century European carnivals.
In 1718, New Orleans was established near the area known as "Pointe du Mardi Gras," and by the 1730s, the city held yearly Mardi Gras parades and masquerade balls.
Why is Mardi Gras Called 'Fat Tuesday'?
The celebration and carnival, will take place on February 21 this year, but why is it called "Fat Tuesday"?
Lundi Gras is a relatively recently name for a series of Shrove Monday events that take place during the Mardi Gras.

     Podcast: The subversive history of Black Mardi Gras
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maybe you’ve wondered whether Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, is even a Catholic holiday given the day’s deluge of decadence.
So tells Nekisha Elise Williams, the author of Mardi Gras Indians, and today’s guest on The Gloria Purvis Podcast.
“There are really two Mardi Gras,” says Nekisha, “and where Black people party and have Mardi Gras is not always the same as where white people party and have Mardi Gras.” For a long time, the segregation between white and Black Mardi Gras was policed by Jim Crow laws.
And while there is growing curiosity about what happens at “Black Mardi Gras,” Nekisha says the impact of white supremacy culture still reinforces this historical segregation.
One vibrant and distinct tradition that white mainstream Mardi Gras often misses is that of the Mardi Gras Indians, otherwise known as the Black-Masking Indians.

     Fat Tuesday: Learn the history of Mardi Gras in St. Louis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mardi Gras in St. LouisJust like Mardi Gras, the City of St. Louis has French roots.
St. Louis was founded as a fur trading post in 1764 by Pierre Laclede and Auguste Chouteau, and the pair began to construct the settlement, named "St. Louis" in honor of the king of France at that time.
Over 200 years later, Mardi Gras in St. Louis' Soulard neighborhood began in 1979 with a house party among five friends in search of a theme, according to Mardi Gras, Inc., the organization behind the annual St. Louis festivities.
The dozens of events that span the Mardi Gras season in Soulard draw thousands of visitors each year and generate more than $20 million in economic activity for the St. Louis region, according to Mardi Gras, Inc.
This year, the Mardi Gras season in St. Louis spans from Twelfth Night, Jan. 6., through Fat Tuesday, Feb. 21.

     What You Should Know About the Mardi Gras Indians
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Excluded from mainstream Carnival celebrations, New Orleans’ Black community cultivated its own traditions, including the Mardi Gras Indians.
Jazz pianist Ferdinand “Jelly Roll” Morton and R&amp;B group the Neville Brothers are among the famous musicians who have masked as Mardi Gras Indians.
Hulin says the Mardi Gras Indians employ visual, musical and theatrical arts.
“Everybody has their different opinions about the Mardi Gras Indians,” Hulin adds.
Are the Mardi Gras Indians best defined as a community, a tradition, a brotherhood and sisterhood, or an example of living history?
