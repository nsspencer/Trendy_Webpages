    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It’s Mardi Gras — or Fat Tuesday (Feb. 23, 2023) in New Orleans — and the annual, ebullient climax of the city’s Carnival season comes this year with some political intrigue.
Mild weather is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of tourists and locals to city streets, many of them in costume, to mark the raucous end of Carnival season.
Among the revelers will be opponents of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who are gathering last-minute signatures ahead of a Wednesday deadline to force a recall election.
There’s also an undercurrent of worry about recurring violent crime.
One person was killed and four wounded when gunfire broke out during a Sunday night parade.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS — A teenager died and a 4-year-old girl was among the wounded when gunfire broke out along the route of a celebrated New Orleans Mardi Gras parade, police Superintendent Michelle Woodfork said Monday.
Carnival season, which began Jan. 6, is in its final raucous days in New Orleans heading into Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, the day before Lent begins.
A shorthanded New Orleans police force is getting help from other Louisiana law enforcement agencies to help keep the peace.
She and other city officials noted that the shooting marred what had largely been a peaceful Carnival celebration this year.
However, sporadic, sometimes fatal violence is a recurring problem during Mardi Gras parades.

The Krewe of Bacchus parade, which is an annual Mardi Gras tradition, was temporarily halted as police roped off part of the area and canvassed for evidence.
Happy Mardi Gras.

The city has been enjoying a safe and healthy Carnival and is looking forward to continuing the celebration on Lundi Gras and Mardi Gras.'
