     'Out of Time' Video: The Weeknd and HoYeon Jung Riff on 'Lost in Translation'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The singer’s latest, for the single “Out of Time” off his album Dawn FM, riffs on Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, and the Scarlett Johansson to his Bill Murray happens to be none other than HoYeon Jung.
The South Korean actor, former model, and breakout star of Squid Game’s appearance is exciting enough for Jim Carrey to get second billing.
The clips opens with HoYeon and The Weeknd bumping into each other at a hotel, first in the elevator and then again at a karaoke bar.
Enter Dr. Jim Carrey, who announces his presence by reciting a menacing monologue.
You may even forget your own name.” By the end of the video, he’s once again gotten himself a new face.

     The Weeknd Does His Own Song at Karaoke, Jim Carrey Cameos in New ‘Out of Time’ Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Weeknd gets caught up in a whirlwind romance with a stranger and a karaoke machine in the new music video for “Out of Time.”The clip boasts some serious Lost in Translation vibes as the Weeknd finds himself all alone in a hotel, singing his own song at karaoke.
He then meets a woman, the sparks fly, and they carry the karaoke machine around with them, wherever they go, even belting “Out of Time” in an elevator.
But because this is the Weeknd, this charming love story doesn’t exactly have a happy ending.
The clip’s final moments are chopped up with some striking visuals of dripping blood, an eerily sterile doctor’s office, and quick shots of the older version of the Weeknd that’s popped up throughout the Dawn FM era.
The Weeknd released Dawn FM back in January, with the album following his 2020 smash LP, After Hours.

     Jim Carrey Performs Creepy Doctor Cameo in The Weeknd’s ‘Out of Time’ Music Video — Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Squid Game" breakout Jung Ho-yeon also stars in The Weeknd's newest video.
The “Mask” alum has a spooky cameo in The Weeknd’s latest music video for the song “Out of Time,” which debuted as part of his fifth studio album “Dawn FM” in January.
The video, out April 5, follows The Weeknd singing karaoke alongside his onscreen love interest, “Squid Game” star Jung Ho-yeon.

     Summary: The Weeknd’s new “Out of Time” video, which dropped this Tuesday, starts with a set of plausible scenarios.
But then the dulcet, ’80s-inspired beats of “Out of Time” warp and slow down, signifying that the video is about to devolve into something much more sinister.
Enter Jim Carrey, starring as the sleep-paralysis demon you see in the corner of your room at night.
In an even darker, twistier parody of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Carrey delivers an eerie voice-over that alludes to wiping the Weeknd’s memories.
The album is full of spoken-word appearances from Carrey, Quincy Jones, and even Josh Safdie.
