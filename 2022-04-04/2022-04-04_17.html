The rapper received the accolade for his sixth studio album Call Me If You Get Lost.
Tyler beat out Kanye West, Drake, J. Cole, and Nas for the honor of Best Rap Album.
Tyler embodied the ethos of Call Me If You Get Lost by going live in front of a grassy field with bikes laying in the background.

I arrived at the Oakland Arena on Friday three hours before doors opened for the American rapper and hip-hop artist’s “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST” show.
If there is any artist worthy of such a cult following, though, it would be Tyler, the Creator.
Originally a member of the Los Angeles–based collective Odd Future, Tyler has gone on to form his own musical universe.
