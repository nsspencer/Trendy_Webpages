     Ken Burns discusses his series on Benjamin Franklin plus dissects filmmaking
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ken Burns has been a documentary filmmaker for 45 years and his latest series is a four-hour PBS special about Benjamin Franklin airing on PBS Stations April 4 and 5.
He discusses, with guest host Emily Votaw, the complexities and brilliance of Franklin and the many different venues in which he excelled.
Some call Franklin a genius of his age.
Burns describes how he traverses the complexities and nuances of history for his films and how he ferrets out stories and facts previously untold.
Burns also explains how he has given voices, in his films, to marginalized groups of people and tells historic stories often through the eyes and emotions of “ordinary people” and not just major historical figures.

     Review: ‘Benjamin Franklin’ Is Most Engaging When It’s Trying to Solve a Puzzle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How did such a staunch monarchist become a leader of the American Revolution?
This question is the driving force in Ken Burns’ latest documentary on revered Founding Father and celebrated inventor Benjamin Franklin.
The four-hour event is most engaging whenever it’s endeavoring to solve that puzzle.
But Tuesday’s conclusion of Benjamin Franklin, “An American,” benefits from a far more specific focus on the commencement of the Revolution.

     'Benjamin Franklin' offers Ken Burns' latest deep dive into US history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) There's something comforting about Ken Burns' PBS documentaries dealing with subjects that predate video, since the filmmaker, unlike most of the industry, eschews dramatic reenactments in favor of a low-tech approach.
Enter "Benjamin Franklin," four hours devoted to the Founding Father, capturing all the facets of a man described as "the most famous American in the world" during his time.
As Joseph Ellis sums it up, Franklin was "a Nobel-caliber scientist, the greatest prose stylist of his generation, and probably the greatest diplomat in American history."
Burns has remained remarkably prolific, including last year's multipart productions about Ernest Hemingway and Muhammad Ali .
Yet "Benjamin Franklin" hews toward his earlier works by emphasizing sound over sight, 32 years after Burns' groundbreaking "The Civil War" established the template.

     Ken Burns on Benjamin Franklin &amp; our nation's flawed identity: "Race is the central question" of US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Founding Father is the subject of Ken Burns' latest docuseries on PBS, airing across two nights.
"I think he invents a classic form of American writing," said Isaacson at the press conference.
"And to think that if Franklin hadn't realized the necessity of compromise, we would not have had a Constitution.
Capturing that context of why Franklin may have had to act against his own beliefs is part of Burns' challenge as a documentarian.
The four-hour "Benjamin Franklin" airs over Monday and Tuesday, April 4-5 at 8 p.m. on PBS.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (And he’s been a figure in at least two musicals, “Ben Franklin in Paris” and “1776,” so he has Broadway cred as well.)
Left to right: John Jay, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Laurens and William Temple Franklin.
William, Franklin’s beloved son (with a woman not his wife), who had assisted him in his electrical experiments and accompanied him to London, had become the governor of New Jersey.
“Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” Franklin was asked, upon leaving the Constitutional Convention.
“If you can keep it.”The question remains open, making “Benjamin Franklin” all the more valuable.

     Ken Burns' New Documentary Shows Benjamin Franklin in All His Contradictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heralded as the “most famous American in the world,” even before the Revolution, Franklin is one of the most important figures in U.S. history.
Franklin will be recast yet again on PBS, thanks to Ken Burns’ latest documentary, Benjamin Franklin.
Franklin influenced American society in ways unique even for the other founders.
Unlike most on-screen depictions of the founder, Burns’ Franklin is very serious (perhaps the one overarching flaw in the documentary).
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Stacy Schiff calls Franklin the “only founder who evidently had a sense of humor [and] a sex life.” We really don’t see this light-hearted Franklin in Burns’ film.
