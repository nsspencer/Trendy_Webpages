     Summary: "They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their bodies," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces.
Zelenskyy said the civilian death toll may actually be much higher in cities that have been liberated from Russian control.
Zelenskyy said Russia is guilty of war crimes.
Western nations expelled dozens more of Moscow’s diplomats Tuesday and weighed further sanctions as they expressed their revulsion at what they say are war crimes.

     Summary: Where are those guarantees that the United Nations needs to guarantee?” he said.
In Russia, he said, “we are dealing with a state that is turning the veto [of] the U.N. Security Council into the right to die.
This undermines the whole architecture of our global security.”If the U.N. is unprepared to address the Russian threat, “the United Nations can be simply closed,” Zelenskyy said.
If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”The Charter of the United Nations — the intergovernmental organization’s founding document, signed in San Francisco in 1945 — “must be restored immediately,” Zelenskyy said, and the broader “U.N.
system must be reformed immediately, so that the veto is not the right to die.”Zelenskyy went on to present the Security Council with two choices to help facilitate peace in Ukraine.

     Zelenskyy calls for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes in a speech before the United Nations Security Council.
"The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine," Zelenskyy said in his nearly 20-minute speech on Tuesday.
Zelenskyy's appearance before the U.N. Security Council follows Ukrainian claims that at least 300 civilians were tortured and killed in Bucha by Russian troops.
Zelenskyy described the aftermath in Bucha, which he saw firsthand on Monday, as a "genocide" and accused Russia of war crimes.
"Based on the currently available information, the United States has assessed that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine," Thomas-Greenfield said on Tuesday.

     Summary: Zelenskyy urges U.N. Security Council to boot Russia or dissolve for the world's sakeEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesEditor's note: This story contains descriptions of violence that some may find disturbing.
Zelenskyy doubts the council's ability to hold Russia accountableIt's difficult for the Security Council — the U.N.'s most powerful body — to hold Russia accountable for its war in Ukraine because it is a permanent council member with veto power.
"Where is the security that the Security Council was supposed to guarantee?"
Zelenskyy also highlighted the unlikelihood of the U.N. to take action in light of Russia's permanent seat on the Security Council and its veto power.
He compared their actions to those of terrorist groups such as ISIS, with the only difference being that Russia sits on the Security Council.

     Zelenskyy challenges UN to punish Russia or 'simply close' its doors: ANALYSIS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But it was also a searing indictment of the U.N. system itself, created in the ashes of World War II to ensure international peace and security.
But none of that has stopped Russian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal campaign to topple the Ukrainian government and subjugate the country,"Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?"
He called for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council or for it to be reformed at a global conference, including ending the veto power.
An expulsion from the U.N. requires a recommendation from the Security Council itself -- where Russia wields that veto power -- and then a vote by the General Assembly.
Instead of fully expelling Russia, the U.S. is pushing with its allies and partners, including Ukraine, to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.
