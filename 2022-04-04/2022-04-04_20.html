     Norton Statement on the Passing of Bruce Johnson, Storied D.C. Anchor and Reporter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C. ‚Äî Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) expressed her sorrow today over the passing of longtime District of Columbia reporter, anchor, and friend Bruce Johnson.
‚ÄúI worked with Bruce from when I was first elected to Congress, in 1990, until he retired, in 2020,‚Äù Norton said.
He won 22 Emmys, deservedly held a spot in the Society of Professional Journalists Hall of Fame, and broke local and federal stories that mattered in the daily lives of D.C. residents.
Having been on his show many times to discuss issues that affect D.C. residents, I grew to consider Bruce a friend.
D.C. has missed Bruce and his down-to-earth, relatable storytelling since he retired, and I will greatly miss his friendship.

     Remembering Bruce Johnson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Like so many Washingtonians, I was shocked Sunday night to learn of Bruce Johnson's passing.
As a kid in Vienna, I grew up watching Johnson anchor on Channel 9, and as a Black D.C. journalist, I'll always be indebted to him.
I was lucky to connect with Johnson just last week, as it happens.
My mother had attended an event where Johnson was signing copies of his latest book, "Surviving Deep Waters," and asked him to inscribe a copy for me.
Watching the social media tributes hail Johnson as a mentor who supported young Black journos in particular, I know I would‚Äôve taken notes on every word.
