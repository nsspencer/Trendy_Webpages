     Summary: Meanwhile, other traditional Masters pairings seem to be lining up, most notable the defending champion (Hideki Matsuyama) playing in the same threesome as the reigning U.S.
Amateur champion (James Piot).
The question though is might Augusta National officials add a second amateur to the group, bringing in World No.
1 Keita Nakajima to play with his Japanese countryman.
If he’s not in that threesome, expect Nakajima to be paired with another former green jacket winners.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He decided to give it a go because he wanted to give this tournament a run.
Which, as many golf fans pointed out, are scores markedly higher than the par 67 DeChambeau claimed he viewed Augusta National as in 2020.
But on Monday DeChambeau asserted his inconsistency here lies not with the short game but his swing.
I've had maybe a good wedge day; I've had a good putting day; I've had maybe good iron play day, a good driving day one day,” DeChambeau said.
He’s had to recalibrate his methods and noted he’s no longer “21,” which is true but somewhat concerning given he’s only 28.

     Golf-Five storylines to follow at this week’s Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – Five storylines to follow as the best players in the world descend upon Augusta National Golf Club this week for the April 7-10 Masters.
Woods announced on Sunday he was headed to Augusta National but that it would be a “game-time” decision whether he tees it up in Thursday’s opening round of the Masters.
If Woods decides to play, it would mark his first event on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Masters, which was held in November that year due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The 46-year-old Woods was at Augusta National last Tuesday and played 18 holes on a layout that is considered one of the more taxing walks on the PGA Tour given its undulating terrain.
BETTING FAVOURITE RAHMU.S. Open champion Jon Rahm is the betting favourite this week at Augusta National, where he has been one of the most consistent competitors since making his Masters debut in 2017.

If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.

     Bryson DeChambeau Says His Health is at 80% Heading Into Masters

     Summary: DeChambeau has struggled in his two events leading into the Masters, while his body continues to recover from a series of early-season injuries.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- It wasn’t long ago that Bryson DeChambeau was the number one needle-mover on the PGA Tour, with his prodigious length that was awe-inspiring.
Yet, many believed his body -- in fact, no body -- could consistently sustain ball speed of over 200 mph.
DeChambeau reached 219 mph at the 2021 World Long Drive Championship and consistently exceeded 200 mph on Tour.
That drive was the single most popular shot of 2021, but that was then and just over a year since then DeChambeau has struggled with his health and his game.

     Golf-Mickelson-less Masters leaves Augusta without familiar face
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Frank Pingue(Reuters) – Phil Mickelson has been as much a part of the Masters as the vibrant azaleas at Augusta National and his absence this week after incendiary remarks about a Saudi-funded golf league will leave the year’s first major without a long-time fan favourite.
Three-times champion Mickelson has made 29 career starts at the Masters and this week marks his first absence since he sat out the 1994 edition while recovering from a broken leg suffered in a skiing accident.
During that time, Mickelson’s happy-go-lucky personality, remarkable short game and go-for-broke nature produced some of the most memorable moments in Masters history and along the way has been adored by the tournament’s patrons.
Saudi Arabia’s government has denied accusations of human rights abuses and Mickelson apologised for the comments, which he claimed were off the record.
While Mickelson will not be spotted on the famed Augusta National layout with the game’s top players, he will likely be a hot topic in the media, specifically at Augusta National Chairman Fred Ridley’s pre-tournament news conference on Wednesday.

I had no clue which putt (O’Meara) had to win the Masters,” Morikawa said with a laugh.
So he spent his first two Masters trying to work the ball right to left even though his preferred shot is a cut that starts left and drifts back to the right.
Augusta is hard enough as it is without overthinking things, which is exactly what Morikawa felt he was doing repeatedly during his first two trips to the Masters.
“And yeah, it works one week, works this other week.
