    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Objects shimmered in and out of view.
Here, on the near side, was R.J. Davis, dribbling to the right of the 3-point arc with two defenders near him, no available shot, no clear outlet or teammate nearby.
Somewhere out there, on the other side of the floor, in the kaleidoscopic cloud of stress, was Brady Manek , cleverly slipping his defender, Paolo Banchero , and sprinting across the baseline.
Manek found a spot in the corner, turned his body and swiveled his hips, and took a short pass from Davis as he did so.
Banchero flew to get back in front, but Manek’s release was too fast, too pure.
