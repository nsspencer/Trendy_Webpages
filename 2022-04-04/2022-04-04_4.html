    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tiger Woods and The Masters.
While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Summary: Meanwhile, other traditional Masters pairings seem to be lining up, most notable the defending champion (Hideki Matsuyama) playing in the same threesome as the reigning U.S.
Amateur champion (James Piot).
The question though is might Augusta National officials add a second amateur to the group, bringing in World No.
1 Keita Nakajima to play with his Japanese countryman.
If he’s not in that threesome, expect Nakajima to be paired with another former green jacket winners.

After Bellestores was eliminated on Hole 10, Mize and Norman entered Amen Corner looking to make history.
This remains one of the greatest shots in Masters history as it etched Mize’s name in the history books with the greats of the game.

     2022 Masters: Ranking the six amateur golfers attempting to challenge a strong field at Augusta National
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's fairly rare that you get a repeat amateur at this event, and the Masters not only has that with the No.
1-ranked amateur in the world will also tee it up this week, and those two are joined by the finalists from the U.S.
Amateur, Greaser is probably the better overall golfer and has a better chance to play all four rounds at this Masters.
Aaron Jarvis (827): The UNLV freshman is the most improbable of the six to qualify for the Masters.
He won the Latin America Amateur Championship earlier this year while ranked outside the top 1,000 in the world (not the Official World Golf Rankings, but the World Amateur Golf Rankings).

     Golf-Five storylines to follow at this week’s Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – Five storylines to follow as the best players in the world descend upon Augusta National Golf Club this week for the April 7-10 Masters.
Woods announced on Sunday he was headed to Augusta National but that it would be a “game-time” decision whether he tees it up in Thursday’s opening round of the Masters.
If Woods decides to play, it would mark his first event on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Masters, which was held in November that year due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The 46-year-old Woods was at Augusta National last Tuesday and played 18 holes on a layout that is considered one of the more taxing walks on the PGA Tour given its undulating terrain.
BETTING FAVOURITE RAHMU.S. Open champion Jon Rahm is the betting favourite this week at Augusta National, where he has been one of the most consistent competitors since making his Masters debut in 2017.
