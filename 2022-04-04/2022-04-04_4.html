     WWE legend Mick Foley laughs at 'worst stunner ever' as Vince McMahon takes finisher from Stone Cold Steve Austin at Wrestlemania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE legend Mick Foley struggled to contain his laughter when watching his old boss Vince McMahon take a Stunner from Stone Cold Steve Austin.
The 76-year-old was in the ring at Wrestlemania for his first match at the prestigious pay-per-view event in 12 years.
They shared a few beers and then the Texas Rattlesnake produced The Stunner – Austin’s legendary finisher – on McMahon.
WWE was losing for 82 weeks straight until Austin caught fire and took over the industry in 1998.
Mike Tyson took part at WrestleMania that year was a big help, too.

     Pat McAfee Fights Vince McMahon After WrestleMania Win, Gets Stunned By Stone Cold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pat McAfee had a crazy night -- the former NFL punter won his debut match against Austin Theory, fought WWE boss Vince McMahon, and got a "stunner" by "Stone Cold" Steve Austin ... all while wowing the crowd with his athleticism at WrestleMania 38!!
Vince then got in on the action ... and the 76-year-old challenged Pat to another match in front of the raucous crowd.
Theory blindsided Pat by attacking him from behind ... giving McMahon the upper hand in his impromptu bout with the commentator.
In vintage Austin fashion, the Texas Rattlesnake hit Theory with a Stone Cold stunner and hit Vince with a stunner, as well ... after sharing a beer with his old nemesis.
Steve asked Pat to join him in some celebratory beers for his incredible WM performance -- and the two chugged some cold ones before Stone Cold hit McAfee with a stunner of his own -- and Pat sold it well.
