     Kansas' Ochai Agbaji named NCAA Tournament's most outstanding player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Orleans — Kansas guard Ochai Agbaji was named the most outstanding player of the NCAA Tournament on Monday following the Jayhawks' 72-69 victory over North Carolina in the national championship game.
Agbaji, a senior from Kansas City, Missouri, earned the honor after he had 12 points in 37 minutes as Kansas claimed its sixth national championship and first since 2008.
A consensus first-team All-American and the unanimous Big 12 Player of the Year this season, Agbaji averaged 17.8 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting 30-for-65 (46.1%) during the six-game NCAA Tournament run.
Born, who won it in 1953, and Chamberlain, the winner in 1957, earned the honor despite not winning the national championship.
"I don't really care because we won the national championship," Agbaji said.

     NBA Draft: Can Kansas Guard Ochai Agbaji Become a Blazer Next Season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I understand that I’m biased when it comes to Kansas Basketball players, but there is no doubt in my mind that Agbaji is worth a late lottery pick.
Agbaji has grown a lot in his four years at Kansas and is the leading scorer for a team in the National Championship.
He wants the ball in big moments because he knows he’s the best player on the floor.
Is there an NBA player he reminds you of?
Agbaji seems like a guy that starts the majority of games on the bench early in his career.

     Summary: Kansas senior guard Ochai Agbaji has achieved Jayhawks basketball immortality.
Agbaji, who hit 4-of-9 shots (1-of-4 from three and 3-of-8 from the line) and had three rebounds in 37 minutes, won the Most Outstanding Player award for the Final Four.
Coach Bill Self reiterated after the title game victory that Agbaji had the best season at KU since Danny Manning, who led the Jayhawks to the 1988 NCAA title.
Agbaji was the AP and coaches’ Big 12 player of the year, the Big 12 Tournament MVP and a consensus first-team All-American.
“But winning the most outstanding player of this, I don’t really care because we won the national championship.

     Why Ochai Agbaji fell into his parents’ arms, crying, after Kansas Jayhawks’ title win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Agbaji knew it would all come flowing out at some point, he’d later say, but he didn’t know when.
It grew confounding, even frustrating, to some who termed it the best example of Kansas City high school basketball being overlooked.
That’s right — not just the 334th-best high school player, the 334th-best senior.
He didn’t want to return to the NBA Draft process as the same player he’d entered it once before.
While playing basketball with grade-school kids at a summer camp at Kansas, Agbaji played alongside Remy Martin for the first time.
