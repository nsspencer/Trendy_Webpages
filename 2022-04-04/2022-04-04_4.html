While appearing on Hannity, Penn revealed he had previously spoken with Zelensky on Zoom, but said they met in the flesh on a momentous day.
"I met him face to face for the first time the day before the invasion, and then spent time with him, which we document in the film, during the invasion, on the day of the invasion," Penn said.
Revealing his personal timeline in Ukraine, Penn said he first arrived to shoot his documentary in November when he spent time in Mariupol.
He then left and arrived a week before the invasion in February, before meeting Zelensky on February 23.
