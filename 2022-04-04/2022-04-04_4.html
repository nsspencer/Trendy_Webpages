     Soccer-Arsenal top-four hopes suffer blow with 3-0 defeat at Palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) ‚Äì Arsenal‚Äôs hopes of securing a top-four Premier League finish this season were dealt a blow as they suffered a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday.
Arsenal were put to the sword in the first half by the clinical hosts, with goals from forwards Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew giving Palace a deserved 2-0 interval lead.
Arsenal improved after the break, with Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard missing big chances to get their team back into the match.
Their wastefulness proved costly as Wilfried Zaha put the game to bed with a penalty 16 minutes from time.
The scoreline at Selhurst Park did not flatter an impressive Palace, who continue to improve under former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira, with the victory moving them up to ninth.

     Summary: Crystal Palace blew Arsenal away with a 3-0 victory that put a dent in the north London club‚Äôs hopes of finishing inside the Premier League‚Äôs top four.

After a slow start to the game, it was Palace who struck first.
Joachim Andersen headed a free-kick back across goal and Mateta scored his fifth of the season from close range.
Zaha confidently scored his penalty to lift his team up to ninth in the Premier League table.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal's hopes of securing a top-four Premier League finish this season were dealt a blow as the below-par visitors suffered a 3-0 defeat against rampant Crystal Palace on Monday.
Arsenal had been in fine form on the road in the Premier League prior to their trip across London on Monday.
"Congratulations to Palace for the game they played but we made it impossible for ourselves with the way we competed," Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports.
Arsenal's Champions League hopes took a hit due to a loss at Crystal Palace.
Fifth-placed Arsenal are level on 54 points with Spurs and three points ahead of West Ham United and Manchester United, albeit with all their top-four rivals having played more games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And last Thursday, following the return of his players from international duty, Arteta stressed the importance of getting their heads back in Arsenal‚Äôs particular game.
‚ÄúFor some of them, it was their first international, so emotionally for them as well it‚Äôs very draining.
And make sure that everyone is fine and look forward to the challenge that we have ahead.‚ÄùWith 10 challenges ahead for Arsenal before the end of the season, the first will be negotiated tonight at Selhurst Park, where the potential for Arteta and his players to Arsenal things up looks eminently possible.
‚ÄúWhen a match gets to 90 minutes and there‚Äôs five additional minutes, we all say the game was 95 minutes long.
That way the players won‚Äôt be able to hear the hoarse boos and rasping gasps of dismay‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Malone.

     Summary: The only surprise when Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring was that it had not come sooner than the 14th minute.
pic.twitter.com/lQfuF6l7si ‚Äî Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) April 4, 2022Rather than jolt Arsenal into life, the goal simply invigorated an already energised Palace.
The game was up for Arsenal but a combination of dogged Palace defending and misfortune denied them a late consolation.
‚ÄúWe tried in the second half, we had three or four big chances but the only half chance they had they got a penalty.
It‚Äôs important they don‚Äôt panic.‚ÄùHe added: ‚ÄúThe first half from Arsenal reminded me of their second half in the defeat earlier in the season at Everton.
