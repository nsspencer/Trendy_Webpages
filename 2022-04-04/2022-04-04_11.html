     Jury Selection Underway to Decide Fate of Parkland Shooter Nikolas Cruz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jury selection for the sentencing trial of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz began Monday.
Cruz opened fire on the school on February 14, 2018, fatally shooting 14 students and three staff members.
The selection process will take several weeks, with about 240 people to be screened each Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the judge told WPBF.
The candidates will be asked if they can rule on the case fairly despite any ill feelings toward Cruz.
Debbi Hixon, the wife of Chris Hixon, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas athletic director who died in the shooting, told WPBF on Sunday that the continued delays were making the grieving process more difficult.

     Summary: Jurors will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty.
In such a high-profile case, it may be hard to find jurors anywhere in the state who don't already have opinions.
After shooting dozens of people, Cruz left his weapon behind and escaped as part of the crowd evacuating the school.
The jury will see videos recorded by students of some of their classmates' last moments.
The jury will also hear statements from the families of those who were killed.

     Jury to decide if Parkland school shooter, who confessed to killing 17, should be put to death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The jury selection process begins Monday in the sentencing trial for Cruz, who faces the death penalty after pleading guilty to 17 counts of first-degree murder in October.
Florida is one of 28 states – including Texas, Louisiana and Georgia – that still have a death penalty, according to the national nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.
Cruz' penalty trial is rare because many school shooters take their own life during or after the shooting.
Around Thanksgiving, James and Kimberly Snead, whose son was a fellow Stoneman Douglas student, took Cruz in to their home and gave him his own room.
On the morning of the shooting, Cruz told them he didn't need a ride to school.

     Summary: Jurors also could hear victim impact statements from survivors and victims' families.
After the shooting, Cruz put down his weapon, the remaining magazines and his tactical vest and fled, blending in at 2:27 p.m. with other students, Satz said.
Millions awarded to victims' families in civil casesThe shooting's impacts reached far beyond Parkland, a small Florida city about 50 miles north of Miami.
But school shootings have continued, with some 130 recorded at US campuses with K-12 students since Parkland, according to CNN's tally.
The FBI acknowledged after the shooting it failed to act on a tip about "the potential of (Cruz) conducting a school shooting," among other concerns.

     Day one of Cruz case underlines why finding a willing jury will take time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Testimony in the sentencing case of Nikolas Cruz is expected to begin on May 31, Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer told the prospective jurors on Monday.
Jury selection began Monday in the Nikolas Cruz death-penalty trial, and many in the first group of potential jurors told the judge that serving at least four months would strain their livelihoods.
Selecting a jury is tedious and difficult in any lengthy criminal case, let alone one for the worst school shooting in Florida history.
The 12-person jury will only be deciding whether Cruz is sentenced to death by execution, or life in prison.
Others worried how jury selection would affect others in their family — one man has a wife who is 37 weeks pregnant, several others were key caregivers for grandchildren or ailing relatives.
