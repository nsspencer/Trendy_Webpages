     Two More Republicans Back Jackson as Senate Moves Toward Confirmation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: opposition to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson cracked slightly on Monday as two more Senate Republicans said they would side with Democrats in supporting her, paving the way for her confirmation as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.
Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined a third Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, in lending their support to Judge Jackson, defying deep resistance in their party to the nominee.
opposition was underscored anew on Monday when all 11 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted against the nomination.
That prompted Democrats to use an unusual procedure to force the nomination out of the deadlocked panel with a vote of the full Senate, which agreed to the move by a vote of 53 to 47.
The three Republicans gave President Biden at least a modicum of the bipartisan backing he had hoped for ahead of a confirmation vote now expected as early as Thursday.

Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney announced Monday evening they'll vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court.
All 50 Senate Democrats, including the two independents who caucus with them, are expected to vote for Jackson's confirmation.
If confirmed, she would also be the first Supreme Court justice since Thurgood Marshall to have represented indigent criminal defendants.
That popularity is in contrast to recently confirmed Supreme Court justices.

     Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation moves forward after tie vote in Judiciary Committee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court moved one step closer Monday.
With Democrats and three Republicans backing the nomination, Jackson appears to have enough votes to be confirmed without Harris' help.
Monday's committee vote was delayed by one such factor outside the Senate's control: a passenger's medical emergency on Democratic committee member Alex Padilla's flight back to Washington from California Sunday night.
Cruz, who went to school with Jackson, said, "I've known Judge Jackson for 30 years, I've always liked her personally."
"Rise, sister Jackson; rise, Judge Jackson, all the way to the highest court in the land."

     Senate moves to full vote on Jackson's nomination as two more Republicans announce support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The support from the three GOP senators ensures Jackson will become the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court.
"After reviewing Judge Jackson's record and testimony, I have concluded that she is a well-qualified jurist and a person of honor," Romney said.
The motion to discharge Jackson's nomination out of committee passed by a vote of 53 to 47 in the full Senate, after the Judiciary Committee split along party lines.
But at 51 years old, she would be the second-youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades.
The vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee, coupled with the Senate's procedural vote, marks another hurdle in the confirmation process.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But it was sufficient to keep Jackson’s nomination moving.
Monday’s floor vote discharged Jackson from the panel and set up a final confirmation vote to take place as soon as Thursday.
“The historic nature of Judge Jackson’s nomination reinforces the progress our country has made.
“I thought that Judge Jackson was going to be the messenger of good news that the Senate Judiciary Committee was changing,” Durbin said.
When Padilla arrived about three hours later, Durbin gaveled the panel back into session and quickly called the vote on Jackson.

     Ketanji Brown Jackson expected to be confirmed this week after bipartisan procedural vote Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is expected to be confirmed as the first Black woman Supreme Court justice this week, after a bipartisan group of senators voted on Monday to advance her nomination.
So far, only three Senate Republicans – Collins, Romney and Murkowski – have said they would support Jackson.
One potential Republican vote for Jackson was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who supported Jackson a year ago for her current job.
An in-depth CNN review of the child pornography cases showed that Jackson had mostly followed common judicial sentencing practices.
“I think all indications are that Judge Jackson is going to be a liberal activist from the bench,” said Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell on Fox last week.
