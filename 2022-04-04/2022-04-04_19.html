     Grammy for Best Reggae Album Goes to a Bunch of White Guys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A partial answer to that last one emerged before the official broadcast started when a troupe of statement hats marched onstage to collect the award for Best Reggae Album — stirring chagrin and confusion among many reggae fans.
According to DancehallMag, last night’s ceremony marked the third time a non-Jamaican artist has won Best Reggae Album.
SOJA won the Grammy for its seventh studio album, Beauty in the Silence.
Soja winnin best Reggae album is a fucking insult,” as one Twitter user put it — but considering the Grammys’ long history of snubbing Black artists, that is maybe not the most surprising element of the SOJA upset.
