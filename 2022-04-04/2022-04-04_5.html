     Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion Recreate This Grammys Moment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may not have been Thursday, but Megan Thee Stallion and Dua Lipa threw it back to 1998.
"I was told I had the exclusive," Dua Lipa, who walked the Versace runway in September, replied.
The transformation left Dua with a chic mini skirt and Megan in a thigh-high midi slit, singlehandedly saving the women from a fashion faux pas.
The staged mishap was a call-back to the 1998 Grammy Awards, where Mariah and Whitney presented together in matching Vera Wang wrap dresses.
Upon seeing Whitney, Mariah simply said, "Nice dress."

     Megan Thee Stallion and Dua Lipa recreate infamous on-stage moment between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston
    </h2>

     Summary: "Not you stealing my look," said Megan Thee Stallion.
"I was told I had the exclusive," replied Dua Lipa, "I'm going to have to have a talk with Donatella."
Let's do this," she said as she revealed Dua Lipa's barely-there mini hem and left Megan Thee Stallion with a dramatic thigh-high midi split.
At the 1998 Video Music Awards, musical legends Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston used fashion to make light of their alleged professional rivalry.
Both Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston wore the same brown Vera Wang dress as part of a planned skit at the 1998 VMAs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Katy Perry and Dua Lipa are reportedly set to collaborate together on a new track.
Elsewhere, the ‘Levitating’ singer wanted Perry to contribute to ‘Ball &amp; Chain’ – an unreleased ‘Future Nostalgia’ song – but the latter artist is believed to have been too busy at the time of recording.
AdvertisementSpeaking to The Sun (via Music-News.COM), a source explained that Lipa and Perry “are both fans of each other” and are hoping to finally join forces at some point soon.
“So far it’s been an issue of schedules and that Dua was determined to keep ‘Future Nostalgia’ collab-free,” they said.
I’m always going to make pop music, but it has its own unique sound, which is exciting and something that feels like a movement from ‘Future Nostalgia’.”

     Summary: On Sunday, April 3, Dua Lipa joined collaborator Megan Thee Stallion on stage in Las Vegas to present the award for Best New Artist — and ended up twinning.
The “Sweetest Pie” stars donned the same Versace safety pin dresses, with Lipa wearing elbow-length latex gloves and a long blond wig.
The moment was a tribute to a very similar “diva-off” between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.
Carey and Houston faced off in Vera Wang in 1998.
