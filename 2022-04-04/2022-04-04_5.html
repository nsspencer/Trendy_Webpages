     Injured Bryson DeChambeau enjoying lower profile before 2022 Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryson DeChambeau has always done things his own way but even he is taking it a little far at this year’s Masters.
“Coming here in the fall for that Masters, a lot of eyes were on me, and it was a different expectation level and definitely uncomfortable for me because I had never experienced that,” DeChambeau said.
Woods’ gallery is so big that DeChambeau says the atmosphere surrounding everyone else almost feels relaxing in comparison.
His results here have been underwhelming since he finished 21st on his debut in 2016, when he was the low amateur.
It would be a hell of an achievement if he does better than 21st this week.

Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked a bit after a Monday afternoon media session with Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods.
What's next on Tiger's status: Woods is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m.

While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Bryson DeChambeau Says His Health is at 80% Heading Into Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeChambeau has struggled in his two events leading into the Masters, while his body continues to recover from a series of early-season injuries.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- It wasn’t long ago that Bryson DeChambeau was the number one needle-mover on the PGA Tour, with his prodigious length that was awe-inspiring.
Yet, many believed his body -- in fact, no body -- could consistently sustain ball speed of over 200 mph.
DeChambeau reached 219 mph at the 2021 World Long Drive Championship and consistently exceeded 200 mph on Tour.
That drive was the single most popular shot of 2021, but that was then and just over a year since then DeChambeau has struggled with his health and his game.

    </h2>

     Summary: It's fairly rare that you get a repeat amateur at this event, and the Masters not only has that with the No.
1-ranked amateur in the world will also tee it up this week, and those two are joined by the finalists from the U.S.
Amateur, Greaser is probably the better overall golfer and has a better chance to play all four rounds at this Masters.
Aaron Jarvis (827): The UNLV freshman is the most improbable of the six to qualify for the Masters.
He won the Latin America Amateur Championship earlier this year while ranked outside the top 1,000 in the world (not the Official World Golf Rankings, but the World Amateur Golf Rankings).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He decided to give it a go because he wanted to give this tournament a run.
Which, as many golf fans pointed out, are scores markedly higher than the par 67 DeChambeau claimed he viewed Augusta National as in 2020.
But on Monday DeChambeau asserted his inconsistency here lies not with the short game but his swing.
I've had maybe a good wedge day; I've had a good putting day; I've had maybe good iron play day, a good driving day one day,” DeChambeau said.
He’s had to recalibrate his methods and noted he’s no longer “21,” which is true but somewhat concerning given he’s only 28.

     Summary: Woods consumes attention at every Masters he plays.
Woods has said it would be a “game-time” decision whether his battered right leg and ankle can handle walking and competing over 18 holes at Augusta National.
“Different situation than Tiger, obviously, but it was definitely a day-by-day process of figuring out if I could do this,” he said.
Koepka had surgery on his right knee three weeks before the Masters last year and still was determined to play.
He is more concerned with his own game that what Woods has going on, though Koepka can appreciate the walk Woods is facing better than most players.

     Summary: While no player looks less like a Masters champion than Cameron Smith, the young Aussie with The Mullet (yes, it deserves its own capital letters), no player’s game looks more like it belongs to a Masters champion than Smith’s.
In fact, no player without a major championship already on the resume is a more obvious Masters pick than Smith, ranked sixth in the world.
1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.
1 in the UWMR—Unofficial World Mullet Rankings.
