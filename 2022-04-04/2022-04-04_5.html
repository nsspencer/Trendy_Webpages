     Orban's victory puts Hungary on collision course with EU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses supporters after the announcement of the partial results of parliamentary election in Budapest, Hungary, April 3, 2022.
"We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon, but definitely from Brussels," he said.
Looks like the end of whatever dreams one might have had of democracy in Hungary," an EU official said.
Others said Orban's positioning on Ukraine, accusing the opposition of risking Hungary being dragged into the war by seeking to allow arms shipments through its territory, played into their choice.
"I think it is due to how the parties reacted to the war, perhaps the ... opposition made people uncertain."

     Hungary's nationalist, pro-Putin PM Orban wins 4th term by unexpectedly large margin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, gestures at the Fidesz campaign headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, on April 3, 2022.
He scored a crushing election victory to clinch a fourth consecutive term, overcoming criticism about democratic backsliding, his lukewarm support for war-ravaged Ukraine and close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Diplomatically, Orban fell in line with EU support for Kyiv despite his long-standing closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin congratulated Orban on his victory and said he hoped to further build ties, the Kremlin said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has singled Orban out for criticism over his reticence to take a tougher stance against Russia.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, seeks a fourth straight term in office, a coalition of opposition parties are framing the election as a referendum on Hungary's future in the West.
We are telling Europe that this is not the past, this is the future, our common European future,” Orban said.
But while Orban's party won 53% of the vote in Hungary, convincing Europe to get on board won't be so easy.
During Hungary's election campaign, a Western-looking coalition of opposition parties challenging Orban called for Hungary to support its embattled neighbor and act in lockstep with its EU and NATO partners.
But speaking to Polish public radio in the week before Hungary's vote, ruling party leader and Orban ally Jaroslaw Kaczynski said he was displeased with Orban’s stance on Russia.

     Summary: So he tells us exactly who his enemies are – and friend Putin has hastened to congratulate him on his famous victory.
And it would have set about the difficult process of turning Hungary back into a proper liberal democracy.
Faced with the latest evidence of the barbaric behaviour of Russian troops in Ukraine, Europe needs to step up its sanctions against Putin.
Self-styled “realists” may argue that Brussels has to stay soft on Hungary in order to keep Orbán on board for a common front over Ukraine.
Europe should now get tough on both the Russian enemy without and the Hungarian enemy within.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) After weeks of failing to divide Europe over his war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin enjoyed two small diplomatic victories this weekend.
On Sunday night, during his victory speech, Orban goaded not only the EU but Ukraine.
The reality is, Orban was expected to win and the EU has been working around his leadership for years.
Poland and Hungary have lately had a pact of sorts, effectively both wielding their EU vetoes to protect the other.
Although Serbia backed two United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions against Moscow, Reuters reported.

     Hungary’s referendum on LGBTQ law invalidated over lack of quorum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Budapest, Apr 4 (EFE).- Hungary’s referendum on a law concerning LGBTQ issues especially concerning minors – criticized as homophobic both within and outside the country – has failed to reach a minimum quorum of 50 percent of valid votes, the National Election Office said Monday.
Besides the valid votes, another 20 percent were not counted because over incorrect markings or protest messages, as demanded by LGBT rights organizations and the opposition.
The referendum sought popular endorsement of a law that was initially introduced to fight child abuse.
The failure of the referendum will not affect the LGBTQ law in question, which continues to be in force, and which the government has so far shown no intention to modify.
The referendum conained four questions worded in such a way as to make it difficult for many Hungarians to oppose the law.
