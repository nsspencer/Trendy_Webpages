     Masters 2022 tee times: Starting times and pairings for the first and second round at Augusta National
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, other traditional Masters pairings seem to be lining up, most notable the defending champion (Hideki Matsuyama) playing in the same threesome as the reigning U.S.
Amateur champion (James Piot).
The question though is might Augusta National officials add a second amateur to the group, bringing in World No.
1 Keita Nakajima to play with his Japanese countryman.
If he’s not in that threesome, expect Nakajima to be paired with another former green jacket winners.

     Summary: The countdown to The Masters is on, and that includes a Tiger Woods countdown as well.
Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked a bit after a Monday afternoon media session with Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods.
What's next on Tiger's status: Woods is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m.
What's below and how to watch: We'll have news updates, buzz from the course, and follow Tiger shot for shot if he plays.

     Summary: Tiger Woods and The Masters.
While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Masters is all about Tiger Woods, even with so many subplots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods consumes attention at every Masters he plays.
Woods has said it would be a “game-time” decision whether his battered right leg and ankle can handle walking and competing over 18 holes at Augusta National.
“Different situation than Tiger, obviously, but it was definitely a day-by-day process of figuring out if I could do this,” he said.
Koepka had surgery on his right knee three weeks before the Masters last year and still was determined to play.
He is more concerned with his own game that what Woods has going on, though Koepka can appreciate the walk Woods is facing better than most players.

    </h2>

     Summary: While no player looks less like a Masters champion than Cameron Smith, the young Aussie with The Mullet (yes, it deserves its own capital letters), no player’s game looks more like it belongs to a Masters champion than Smith’s.
In fact, no player without a major championship already on the resume is a more obvious Masters pick than Smith, ranked sixth in the world.
1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.
1 in the UWMR—Unofficial World Mullet Rankings.

     Summary: “You show up for your first time and that’s what happens with a lot of people,” Morikawa said, who will be playing in his third Masters.
I had no clue which putt (O’Meara) had to win the Masters,” Morikawa said with a laugh.
So he spent his first two Masters trying to work the ball right to left even though his preferred shot is a cut that starts left and drifts back to the right.
Augusta is hard enough as it is without overthinking things, which is exactly what Morikawa felt he was doing repeatedly during his first two trips to the Masters.
“And yeah, it works one week, works this other week.
