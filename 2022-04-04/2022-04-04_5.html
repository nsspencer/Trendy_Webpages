     Hungary's nationalist leader Orban criticizes Ukraine's Zelenskyy in election victory speech

     Summary: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban delivers a speech on stage next to members of the Fidesz party at their election base, 'Balna' building on the bank of the Danube River of Budapest, on April 3, 2022.
- Nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed a "great victory" in general election, as partial results gave his Fidesz party the lead.
(Photo by Attila KISBENEDEK / AFP) (Photo by ATTILA KISBENEDEK/AFP via Getty Images)Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, on Sunday evening dubbed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one of his opponents, following a landslide election victory for the nationalist leader.
Orban and his right-wing Fidesz party won a comfortable majority over the opposition United for Hungary alliance on Sunday, despite expectations for a tight race.
Fifty-eight-year-old Orban has often boasted of his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that link became a major challenge for the electoral campaign of his ruling Fidesz party.

     Hungary election: PM Orbán slams Ukraine's Zelensky after win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he claimed victory in the country's elections on Sunday night, per the BBC.
Context: Zelensky has repeatedly criticized Orbán's policies, notably referring to Hungary's government as a "Russian branch in Europe" while urging EU leaders to "stop listening to the excuses of Budapest."
Orbán's close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin came under scrutiny in the final stretch of Hungary's election campaign, Axios' Zachary Basu reports.
What they're saying: Opposition leaders called the election campaign "unfair and impossible circumstances," with state media largely ignoring opposition parties, according to AFP.
By the numbers: Preliminary results show Orbán's Fidesz party won 53.1% of votes, with 98% of ballots counted, electing him to a fourth term, per the BBC.

     Pro-Putin leaders win Hungary and Serbia votes, reminding Kremlin it has friends in high places
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) After weeks of failing to divide Europe over his war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin enjoyed two small diplomatic victories this weekend.
On Sunday night, during his victory speech, Orban goaded not only the EU but Ukraine.
The reality is, Orban was expected to win and the EU has been working around his leadership for years.
Poland and Hungary have lately had a pact of sorts, effectively both wielding their EU vetoes to protect the other.
Although Serbia backed two United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions against Moscow, Reuters reported.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, gestures at the Fidesz campaign headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, on April 3, 2022.
He scored a crushing election victory to clinch a fourth consecutive term, overcoming criticism about democratic backsliding, his lukewarm support for war-ravaged Ukraine and close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Diplomatically, Orban fell in line with EU support for Kyiv despite his long-standing closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin congratulated Orban on his victory and said he hoped to further build ties, the Kremlin said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has singled Orban out for criticism over his reticence to take a tougher stance against Russia.

     Hungary’s Orban popular at home, isolated abroad after win | Durham Herald Sun
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, seeks a fourth straight term in office, a coalition of opposition parties are framing the election as a referendum on Hungary's future in the West.
We are telling Europe that this is not the past, this is the future, our common European future,” Orban said.
But while Orban's party won 53% of the vote in Hungary, convincing Europe to get on board won't be so easy.
During Hungary's election campaign, a Western-looking coalition of opposition parties challenging Orban called for Hungary to support its embattled neighbor and act in lockstep with its EU and NATO partners.
But speaking to Polish public radio in the week before Hungary's vote, ruling party leader and Orban ally Jaroslaw Kaczynski said he was displeased with Orban’s stance on Russia.

     Hungary’s referendum on LGBTQ law invalidated over lack of quorum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Budapest, Apr 4 (EFE).- Hungary’s referendum on a law concerning LGBTQ issues especially concerning minors – criticized as homophobic both within and outside the country – has failed to reach a minimum quorum of 50 percent of valid votes, the National Election Office said Monday.
Besides the valid votes, another 20 percent were not counted because over incorrect markings or protest messages, as demanded by LGBT rights organizations and the opposition.
The referendum sought popular endorsement of a law that was initially introduced to fight child abuse.
The failure of the referendum will not affect the LGBTQ law in question, which continues to be in force, and which the government has so far shown no intention to modify.
The referendum conained four questions worded in such a way as to make it difficult for many Hungarians to oppose the law.
