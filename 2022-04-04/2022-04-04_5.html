     Summary: The countdown to The Masters is on, and that includes a Tiger Woods countdown as well.
Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked a bit after a Monday afternoon media session with Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods.
What's next on Tiger's status: Woods is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m.
What's below and how to watch: We'll have news updates, buzz from the course, and follow Tiger shot for shot if he plays.

     Masters 2022: Optimism that Tiger will play grows after Monday practice round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA Ga. — After a few hellos to the boys and a measured walk to the short-game area, Tiger Woods entered his comfort zone: three bags of balls, two wedges to alternate between and a bentgrass canvas to work with.
Flanked by caddie Joe LaCava and right-hand man Rob McNamara, Woods hardly said a word as he flashed his full arsenal of short-game magic on Monday at the Augusta National practice area.
He drew chips to climb up slopes and then he cut chips to spin down them.
He hit a number of 4-iron bumps, a new shot he’s grooving to use around some of Augusta National’s reworked greens—like No.
3, where the false front has been steepened even further.

     Summary: Tiger Woods and The Masters.
While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Bryson DeChambeau Says His Health is at 80% Heading Into Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeChambeau has struggled in his two events leading into the Masters, while his body continues to recover from a series of early-season injuries.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- It wasn’t long ago that Bryson DeChambeau was the number one needle-mover on the PGA Tour, with his prodigious length that was awe-inspiring.
Yet, many believed his body -- in fact, no body -- could consistently sustain ball speed of over 200 mph.
DeChambeau reached 219 mph at the 2021 World Long Drive Championship and consistently exceeded 200 mph on Tour.
That drive was the single most popular shot of 2021, but that was then and just over a year since then DeChambeau has struggled with his health and his game.

     Summary: It's fairly rare that you get a repeat amateur at this event, and the Masters not only has that with the No.
1-ranked amateur in the world will also tee it up this week, and those two are joined by the finalists from the U.S.
Amateur, Greaser is probably the better overall golfer and has a better chance to play all four rounds at this Masters.
Aaron Jarvis (827): The UNLV freshman is the most improbable of the six to qualify for the Masters.
He won the Latin America Amateur Championship earlier this year while ranked outside the top 1,000 in the world (not the Official World Golf Rankings, but the World Amateur Golf Rankings).

     Golf-Mickelson-less Masters leaves Augusta without familiar face
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Frank Pingue(Reuters) – Phil Mickelson has been as much a part of the Masters as the vibrant azaleas at Augusta National and his absence this week after incendiary remarks about a Saudi-funded golf league will leave the year’s first major without a long-time fan favourite.
Three-times champion Mickelson has made 29 career starts at the Masters and this week marks his first absence since he sat out the 1994 edition while recovering from a broken leg suffered in a skiing accident.
During that time, Mickelson’s happy-go-lucky personality, remarkable short game and go-for-broke nature produced some of the most memorable moments in Masters history and along the way has been adored by the tournament’s patrons.
Saudi Arabia’s government has denied accusations of human rights abuses and Mickelson apologised for the comments, which he claimed were off the record.
While Mickelson will not be spotted on the famed Augusta National layout with the game’s top players, he will likely be a hot topic in the media, specifically at Augusta National Chairman Fred Ridley’s pre-tournament news conference on Wednesday.

     Summary: It's not difficult to prognosticate that Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm are going to play quality golf at Augusta National at the 86th edition of this tournament.
Those are the players we'll try to select based on either recent form or past history at Augusta National.
Si Woo Kim (100-1): I'm irrationally high on Kim for a few reasons.
Shane Lowry (45-1): Over his last 50 rounds, he's been a better ball-striker than Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele.
That's absolutely worth a flyer at 125-1.Who will win the Masters, and which long shots will stun the golfing world?

     Summary: He decided to give it a go because he wanted to give this tournament a run.
Which, as many golf fans pointed out, are scores markedly higher than the par 67 DeChambeau claimed he viewed Augusta National as in 2020.
But on Monday DeChambeau asserted his inconsistency here lies not with the short game but his swing.
I've had maybe a good wedge day; I've had a good putting day; I've had maybe good iron play day, a good driving day one day,” DeChambeau said.
He’s had to recalibrate his methods and noted he’s no longer “21,” which is true but somewhat concerning given he’s only 28.

Piot already has a memory like few others at Augusta National: He basically got to play an empty course Saturday.
He went out after the Augusta National Women’s Amateur ended and hardly saw another soul.
It was the craziest thing in the world having Augusta National to yourself.
I mean, being an amateur and being able to be out at Augusta National alone, it was a memory I’ll never forget.
