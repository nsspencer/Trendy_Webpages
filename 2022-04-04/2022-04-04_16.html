     Summary: Having built a six-shot lead entering the final round, Kupcho needed a couple of clutch moments over the final nine to secure victory.
A birdie putt of 20-plus feet fell at the 11th and she made a much-needed seven-footer for par on the following hole.
After a couple of stumbles at 13 and 14, she stuffed a short-iron approach at the par-4 15th for a tap-in birdie that brought the lead back to four, which basically assured her the title.

     Jennifer Kupcho claims her first title at the Chevron Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Jennifer Kupcho won the Chevron Championship by two strokes, claiming her first victory on the LPGA Tour and the first major of her career.
Kupcho's victory celebrations began when she leaped into Poppie's Pond, as is tradition, accompanied by her husband, caddy, and cheers from the crowd.
The tradition was started by Amy Alcott in 1983 and has been observed by every winner since.
"To be a major winner is really special and to be the last person here at Mission Hills to jump into Poppie's Pond, it's all really special."
Next year, the tournament is moving from the Mission Hills Country Club to Houston under a deal with current sponsors, Chevron.

     Now a major champion at Chevron, Jennifer Kupcho wonders why she is asked about Augusta win three years later
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But that victory by Kupcho at Augusta National kept coming up again and again at Mission Hills during tournament week.
“I think that's the biggest thing about it all, why was I (always) getting asked about this Augusta three years later.
I've really wanted to -- not that Augusta is not special, but now I'm a major champion.
But Augusta National’s standing in the golf world is so towering that Kupcho will likely be asked about Augusta National the rest of her career.
1 player in the world did everything opposite of what was expected of her at the Chevron Championship this year.

     Summary: Winning is never easy, especially when it is your first LPGA Tour win, and a major at that.
But for Jennifer Kupcho, capturing the Chevron Championship was no doubt made easier by having the memories of winning at every level, from junior to amateur to college to pro.As an amateur, the native of Westminster, Colo. dominated in her home state, winning three Colorado Women's Golf Association (CWGA) titles, including one by 13 shots .
She became first player in state history to be named both the CWGA Player of the Year and Junior Player of the Year in the same season.She refined that winning habit at Wake Forest, racking up nine individual titles including the NCAA Women's Championship in 2018 .
The awards followed, including being named a First-Team WGCA All-American, and winning the 2018 McCormack Medal as year-end No.
Kupcho went five under on her final six holes to outduel Maria Fassi and become the first woman to ever win at Augusta National.How fitting it was that her first major professional win was the same week that the ANWA was being held, three years after her memorable win there.Here are a few of the stories from our coverage of Jennifer Kupcho the amateur:
