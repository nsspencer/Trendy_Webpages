     Summary: Two more Republicans say they'll vote to confirm Jackson's Supreme Court nominationEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesRepublican Sens.
Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney announced Monday evening they'll vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court.
All 50 Senate Democrats, including the two independents who caucus with them, are expected to vote for Jackson's confirmation.
If confirmed, she would also be the first Supreme Court justice since Thurgood Marshall to have represented indigent criminal defendants.
That popularity is in contrast to recently confirmed Supreme Court justices.

     Sen. Chuck Grassley votes 'no' on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court

     Summary: U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley voted against Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's U.S. Supreme Court nomination Monday, saying she is soft on crime and has a history of judicial overreach.
Democrats can still advance Jackson's nomination procedurally, and a vote of the full Senate is expected this week before lawmakers leave for their upcoming recess.

     Jackson secures more bipartisan backing for Supreme Court nomination as 3 Republicans endorse her in procedural vote
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Senate paved the way for a final confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson after the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on advancing her nomination Monday.
The outcome reflects what is likely to be the final tally for her confirmation vote, which is expected later in the week.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., aims to hold the confirmation vote as early as Thursday.
Murkowski, speaking with reporters after the procedural vote, called the Supreme Court confirmation process "just awful," and acknowledged that her vote might lead to political repercussions in the primary for her re-election bid this year.
"Ketanji Brown Jackson is highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and her voice is more important now than ever."

     Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation moves forward after tie vote in Judiciary Committee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court moved one step closer Monday.
With Democrats and three Republicans backing the nomination, Jackson appears to have enough votes to be confirmed without Harris' help.
Monday's committee vote was delayed by one such factor outside the Senate's control: a passenger's medical emergency on Democratic committee member Alex Padilla's flight back to Washington from California Sunday night.
Cruz, who went to school with Jackson, said, "I've known Judge Jackson for 30 years, I've always liked her personally."
"Rise, sister Jackson; rise, Judge Jackson, all the way to the highest court in the land."

     Senate moves to full vote on Jackson's nomination as two more Republicans announce support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The support from the three GOP senators ensures Jackson will become the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court.
"After reviewing Judge Jackson's record and testimony, I have concluded that she is a well-qualified jurist and a person of honor," Romney said.
The motion to discharge Jackson's nomination out of committee passed by a vote of 53 to 47 in the full Senate, after the Judiciary Committee split along party lines.
But at 51 years old, she would be the second-youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades.
The vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee, coupled with the Senate's procedural vote, marks another hurdle in the confirmation process.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson, 51, was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit less than a year ago, after about eight years as a federal trial court judge in Washington.
But it was sufficient to keep Jackson’s nomination moving.
Monday’s floor vote discharged Jackson from the panel and set up a final confirmation vote to take place as soon as Thursday.
Story continues below advertisement“I thought that Judge Jackson was going to be the messenger of good news that the Senate Judiciary Committee was changing,” Durbin said.
When Padilla arrived about three hours later, Durbin gaveled the panel back into session and quickly called the vote on Jackson.
