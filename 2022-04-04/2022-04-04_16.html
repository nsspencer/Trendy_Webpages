     Summary: Kanye West has pulled out of his headlining show at Coachella 2022 days before the two-weekend event, TMZ and Variety report.
ADVERTISEMENTIt's unclear what prompted West's withdrawal from the festival.
The rapper was scheduled to perform the closing night of each weekend at Coachella, which takes place April 15-17 and April 22-24.
In February, West stated his intention to bring out Travis Scott during his now-canceled Coachella spot.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West has pulled out of Coachella, TMZ, Variety, and Billboard report.
While the reasons remain unclear, West suggested in February that he would cancel his set if fellow headliner Billie Eilish did not apologize to Travis Scott.
West believed that Eilish had insulted Scott—whom West intended to bring out at Coachella—when she paused a show to help a fan, not long after the Astroworld tragedy.
Eilish said she “literally never said a thing about travis” and “was just helping a fan.”Pitchfork has emailed representatives for West and Coachella.
In addition to Friday night headliner Harry Styles, Variety notes that the original Coachella poster bills Swedish House Mafia in an unspecified slot—notably, in headliner-sized font.
