     Twitter Stock Soars After Tesla's Elon Musk Buys a Big Stake. What's Next.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a major interest in Twitter less than two weeks after criticizing the social media platform on free-speech grounds — and Twitter stock is soaring.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) stock was up nearly 25% Monday after Musk purchased 9.2% of the social-media company’s stock, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Tesla stock was up 3.4%.
The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%.

     Elon Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of Mr. Musk’s ideas, like moving Twitter to an open-source network, have earned support of Twitter’s co-founder, Mr. Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive late last year.
“The choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone,” Mr. Dorsey said last month in response to a tweet from Mr. Musk advocating an open-source algorithm for the platform.
Mr. Dorsey, who is friendly with Mr. Musk, is expected to leave the Twitter board in May.
It is unclear what Mr. Musk’s plans are beyond the large shareholder position and whether he’ll ask — or be invited — to join Twitter’s board.
Mr. Musk filed a securities document indicating that he planned for the investment to be passive, meaning he does not intend to pursue control of the company.

     Twitter shares soar more than 26% after Elon Musk takes 9% stake in social media company
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Musk owns 73,486,938 shares of Twitter, which represents a 9.2% passive stake in the company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 13G filing released Monday.
"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy," Musk tweeted.
Late last month, Musk also said he was considering building a new social media platform.
Twitter stock surged more than 26% in the afternoon.
"This makes sense given what Musk has at least been talking about, at least from a social media perspective," Ives said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in Twitter Inc. to become the platform’s biggest shareholder, a week after hinting he might shake up the social media industry.
Twitter shares surged as much as 27% after Musk’s purchase was revealed Monday in a regulatory filing.
The gain marked the stock’s biggest intraday increase since its first day of trading following the company’s 2013 initial public offering.
The stake is worth about $2.89 billion, based on Friday’s market close.

     Twitter stock rockets toward record gain after Elon Musk takes stake valued at nearly $3.7 billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Twitter Inc. rocketed toward their biggest-ever gain Monday, after it was disclosed that Technoking of Tesla Elon Musk had acquired a large stake in the social media company.
At Friday’s closing price for Twitter shares of $39.31, Musk’s stake would be worth $2.89 billion.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said it has been thought that given his “long-standing critical view of Twitter and social media platforms,” it was believed that Musk could look to build a competitor to Twitter and other social media platforms.
Musk’s investment comes as Twitter’s stock has started to recover recently after a tough 2021, relative to its peer group and the broader stock market.
Twitter’s stock has now gained 15.6% year to date, and was trading 54.1% above its 20-month closing low of $32.42 on March 7.
