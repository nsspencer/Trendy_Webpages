     Summary: WASHINGTON D.C. — A D.C. rapper’s corpse was reportedly propped up and on display at a nightclub for the performer’s “last show” on Sunday, according to TMZ.
Rap artist Markelle Morrow, known as Goonew, was reportedly shot to death in a parking lot in District Heights on March 18.
TMZ shared video and photos from the nightclub funeral, named the Final Show, where dancers and club-goers share mixed reactions as the rapper’s so-called “embalmed corpse” is propped up before the crowd of revelers, wearing a crown and standing next to fireworks.

    </h2>

     Summary: A nightclub has sparked outrage after hosting a 'funeral' featuring what appeared to be the embalmed corpse of an up-and-coming rapper who was shot dead during a robbery two weeks ago.
Fans of rapper Goonew were aghast when cellphone recordings emerged from the event, dubbed The Final Show, which was held at club Bliss in Washington DC on Sunday night.
The 24-year-old rapper, whose real name was Markelle Morrow, was shot dead on March 18 in the 3400 block of Walters Lane in the District Heights neighborhood.
Others, however, defended having Morrow's body up on stage, saying it was what his family wanted.
'Bliss was contacted by a local funeral home to rent out our venue for Goonew's home-going celebration,' the message read.
