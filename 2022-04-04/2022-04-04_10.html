     Kanye West No Longer Playing Coachella 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West has pulled out of Coachella, TMZ, Variety, and Billboard report.
While the reasons remain unclear, West suggested in February that he would cancel his set if fellow headliner Billie Eilish did not apologize to Travis Scott.
West believed that Eilish had insulted Scott—whom West intended to bring out at Coachella—when she paused a show to help a fan, not long after the Astroworld tragedy.
Eilish said she “literally never said a thing about travis” and “was just helping a fan.”Pitchfork has emailed representatives for West and Coachella.
In addition to Friday night headliner Harry Styles, Variety notes that the original Coachella poster bills Swedish House Mafia in an unspecified slot—notably, in headliner-sized font.

     Summary: Kanye West Drops Out of Coachella 2022 Headlining SlotJust one week ahead of his headling set at Coachella, Kanye West has reportedly pulled out from the event entirely.
West and Coachella have yet to make public announcements.
Earlier this year, West threatened to drop out of the festival after perceiving that fellow headliner Billie Ellish “dissed” Travis Scott.
Was just helping a fan.”As one may infer, Scott along with West will not also be performing at Coachella.
The petition which has nearly 50,000 signatures reads: “We have watched Kanye harass, manipulate, and hurt Kim, Pete, and others for over a year now.

     Bird scooters to arrive in Indio in time for Coachella 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Indio will become the second city in the Coachella Valley to offer Bird electric scooters on Wednesday.
City Council approved Bird scooters last month, but had not established an official date, only saying they would be available "this spring."
The scooters are now set to arrive a few days before the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival starts on April 15.
Riders in the valley can see where the electric scooters are available in real time by using a free Bird app.

     The Weeknd, Red Hot Chili Peppers: Who could replace Kanye West at Coachella 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given recent headlines, it isn’t a shock that Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, is reportedly no longer performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival later this month.
But with less than two weeks left before the festival starts, there's an obvious question: Who will step in to replace him?
Red Hot Chili PeppersThe Red Hot Chili Peppers are certainly not a rap group, but they could still be a crowd-pleaser, having already performed at Coachella several times.
Rage Against the Machine plans to go on tour later this year, starting in July, according to the band’s website.
In perhaps an unintentional ode to Ye's penchant for cryptic tweets, the Canadian artist also tweeted the side-eye emoji Monday, after the news about West broke.

He also has worked with Coachella promoter Goldenvoice on his own festival, the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival.
Lil Nas X was originally on the lineup for Coachella and Stagecoach in 2020, but dropped off when the 2022 lineups came out.
So maybe Goldenvoice can call Montero and get him on stage.
