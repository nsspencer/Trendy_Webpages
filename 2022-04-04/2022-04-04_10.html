     Joe Henderson: No matter what, Nikolas Cruz will never leave prison alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This will be Florida’s highest-profile capital punishment case since Ted Bundy, exposing again the depths to which evil can fall in human beings.
Well, if we’re going to have the death penalty, it was certainly made for cases like this.
It’s easy to say the death penalty is barbaric and has no place in a civilized society.
When Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges in October, he had hoped prosecutors would take the death penalty off the table.
Historically, Florida is one of the most aggressive states in administering the death penalty, but not so much lately.

     Cruz jurors can visit bullet-riddled site at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jurors will be allowed to tour the shuttered, bullet-riddled freshman building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High where Nikolas Cruz fatally killed 17 people and wounded 17 more.
The building has been locked but kept largely intact since the massacre on Valentine’s Day of 2018.
The jury visit will clear the way for the 1200 building — a horrible reminder of Florida’s deadliest school shooting — to be demolished by the school district.
Testimony in the trial is set to begin on May 31, with jury selection expected to last nearly two months.
The jurors “don’t need to see all of those horrible things,” defense lawyer Melisa McNeill told the judge.

     Summary: Jurors will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty.
In such a high-profile case, it may be hard to find jurors anywhere in the state who don't already have opinions.
After shooting dozens of people, Cruz left his weapon behind and escaped as part of the crowd evacuating the school.
The jury will see videos recorded by students of some of their classmates' last moments.
The jury will also hear statements from the families of those who were killed.

     Jury to decide if Parkland school shooter, who confessed to killing 17, should be put to death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The jury selection process begins Monday in the sentencing trial for Cruz, who faces the death penalty after pleading guilty to 17 counts of first-degree murder in October.
Florida is one of 28 states – including Texas, Louisiana and Georgia – that still have a death penalty, according to the national nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.
Cruz' penalty trial is rare because many school shooters take their own life during or after the shooting.
Around Thanksgiving, James and Kimberly Snead, whose son was a fellow Stoneman Douglas student, took Cruz in to their home and gave him his own room.
On the morning of the shooting, Cruz told them he didn't need a ride to school.

Millions awarded to victims' families in civil casesThe shooting's impacts reached far beyond Parkland, a small Florida city about 50 miles north of Miami.
But school shootings have continued, with some 130 recorded at US campuses with K-12 students since Parkland, according to CNN's tally.
The FBI acknowledged after the shooting it failed to act on a tip about "the potential of (Cruz) conducting a school shooting," among other concerns.
