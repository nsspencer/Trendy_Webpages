     Twitter Stock Soars After Tesla's Elon Musk Buys a Big Stake. What's Next.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a major interest in Twitter less than two weeks after criticizing the social media platform on free-speech grounds — and Twitter stock is soaring.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) stock was up nearly 25% Monday after Musk purchased 9.2% of the social-media company’s stock, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Tesla stock was up 3.4%.
The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%.

     Elon Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Elon Musk mulled taking Tesla private in 2018, he posted on Twitter to tell the world about it.
And when he challenged President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to one-on-one combat last month, he broadcast it on Twitter.
Now Mr. Musk is putting his money where he mouths off.
The purchase appears to make Mr. Musk Twitter’s largest shareholder, ahead of the 8.8 percent stake owned by the mutual-fund company Vanguard and dwarfing the 2.3 percent stake of Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s former chief executive.
But by the end of Monday, after news of his buy-in sent Twitter’s share price soaring more than 27 percent, it was worth about $3.7 billion.

     Summary: (The Hill) — Twitter shares rose over 20 percent Monday morning on news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired a 9.2 percent stake in the social media platform.
Musk is now the largest outside shareholder with 73,486,938 shares, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Monday.
The Tesla chief is a very active Twitter user with a committed fan base.
Over 70 percent responded “No,” prompting Musk to ask whether a new platform is needed.
The deal to acquire a stake in Twitter comes months after long time CEO Jack Dorsey departed the company.

https://t.co/aPS9ycji37 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 26, 2022Musk sold billions worth of Tesla shares last year, making some of his wealth liquid for the first time.
It would not the first time Twitter will have faced criticism from activist shareholders, if Musk takes that tactic.

The joke nonetheless caused Tesla shares to skyrocket, and Musk and Tesla were each fined $20 million.
