     Summary: "Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy," Musk tweeted.
Late last month, Musk also said he was considering building a new social media platform.
Twitter stock surged more than 29% in the afternoon.
"This makes sense given what Musk has at least been talking about, at least from a social media perspective," Ives said.
On Aug. 7, 2018, Musk tweeted he had "funding secured" to take Tesla private at $420 per share.

     Summary: Elon Musk just became Twitter's largest shareholderEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/APTesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a 9% stake in Twitter to become its largest shareholder after raising questions about the social media platform's dedication to free speech.
Yet in recent weeks Musk, who has 80 million Twitter followers and posts there often, has questioned free speech on Twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy.
The regulatory filing Monday describes Musk as a long-term investor looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares.
His Twitter stock purchase comes as Musk is locked into a bitter dispute with U.S. securities regulators over his ability to post on Twitter.
But some of the money could have been used to buy the Twitter stake.

     Twitter stock rockets toward record gain after Elon Musk takes stake valued at nearly $3.7 billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Twitter Inc. rocketed toward their biggest-ever gain Monday, after it was disclosed that Technoking of Tesla Elon Musk had acquired a large stake in the social media company.
At Friday’s closing price for Twitter shares of $39.31, Musk’s stake would be worth $2.89 billion.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said it has been thought that given his “long-standing critical view of Twitter and social media platforms,” it was believed that Musk could look to build a competitor to Twitter and other social media platforms.
Musk’s investment comes as Twitter’s stock has started to recover recently after a tough 2021, relative to its peer group and the broader stock market.
Twitter’s stock has now gained 15.6% year to date, and was trading 54.1% above its 20-month closing low of $32.42 on March 7.
