     Why Twitter Stock Exploded Higher Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happenedShares of Twitter ( TWTR 27.12% ) charged sharply higher to start the week, surging as much as 26.6%.
The catalyst that sent the social media stock higher was word that Tesla ( TSLA 5.61% ) CEO Elon Musk had taken a surprisingly large stake.
So whatA regulatory filing that dropped Monday morning revealed that Musk had acquired more than 73 million shares of Twitter stock, which amounted to a 9.2% stake, making him the company's largest shareholder.
In a post from late last month, Musk polled his 80.2 million Twitter followers, saying:Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.
The regulatory filing reveals that Musk began acquiring Twitter shares on March 14, 2022, well before his illuminating user poll.

     Summary: Oh hi lol — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 4, 2022Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said Musk’s passive stake could be just the beginning.
https://t.co/aPS9ycji37 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 26, 2022Musk sold billions worth of Tesla shares last year, making some of his wealth liquid for the first time.
It would not the first time Twitter will have faced criticism from activist shareholders, if Musk takes that tactic.
