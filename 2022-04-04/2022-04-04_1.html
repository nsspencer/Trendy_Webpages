    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a major interest in Twitter less than two weeks after criticizing the social media platform on free-speech grounds — and Twitter stock is soaring.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) stock was up nearly 25% Monday after Musk purchased 9.2% of the social-media company’s stock, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Tesla stock was up 3.4%.
The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%.

     Twitter just had its best day since its IPO, thanks to Elon Musk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, stands in the foundry of the Tesla Gigafactory during a press event.
Twitter's stock on Monday had its best day since its IPO, with the shares up more than 27%, after an SEC filing revealed Elon Musk acquired a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company.
"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy," Musk tweeted March 26.
Musk was subpoenaed by the SEC in November after he asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock — causing shares to fall.
In February, Musk accused the SEC of "harassment" and making a calculated effort to "chill" his right to free speech.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) — Twitter shares rose over 20 percent Monday morning on news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired a 9.2 percent stake in the social media platform.
Musk is now the largest outside shareholder with 73,486,938 shares, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Monday.
The Tesla chief is a very active Twitter user with a committed fan base.
Over 70 percent responded “No,” prompting Musk to ask whether a new platform is needed.
The deal to acquire a stake in Twitter comes months after long time CEO Jack Dorsey departed the company.

     Why Twitter Stock Exploded Higher Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happenedShares of Twitter ( TWTR 27.12% ) charged sharply higher to start the week, surging as much as 26.6%.
The catalyst that sent the social media stock higher was word that Tesla ( TSLA 5.61% ) CEO Elon Musk had taken a surprisingly large stake.
So whatA regulatory filing that dropped Monday morning revealed that Musk had acquired more than 73 million shares of Twitter stock, which amounted to a 9.2% stake, making him the company's largest shareholder.
In a post from late last month, Musk polled his 80.2 million Twitter followers, saying:Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.
The regulatory filing reveals that Musk began acquiring Twitter shares on March 14, 2022, well before his illuminating user poll.

     Summary: Elon Musk just became Twitter's largest shareholderEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/APTesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a 9% stake in Twitter to become its largest shareholder after raising questions about the social media platform's dedication to free speech.
Yet in recent weeks Musk, who has 80 million Twitter followers and posts there often, has questioned free speech on Twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy.
The regulatory filing Monday describes Musk as a long-term investor looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares.
His Twitter stock purchase comes as Musk is locked into a bitter dispute with U.S. securities regulators over his ability to post on Twitter.
But some of the money could have been used to buy the Twitter stake.

     Summary: Oh hi lol — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 4, 2022Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said Musk’s passive stake could be just the beginning.
Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.
https://t.co/aPS9ycji37 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 26, 2022In late March, Musk questioned whether Twitter “rigorously adheres” to the principles of free speech in a poll to his more than 80 million followers.
The joke nonetheless caused Tesla’s stock to skyrocket, and Musk and Tesla were each fined $20 million.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018“Tesla was a less mature company and the SEC’s action stood to jeopardize the company’s financing,” Musk said in a recent legal filing.
