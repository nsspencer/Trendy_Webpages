     Summary: Pro-Putin leaders in Hungary and Serbia win reelection as Europe grapples with warEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrej Isakovic/AFP via Getty Images Andrej Isakovic/AFP via Getty ImagesTwo far-right political leaders friendly with Russian President Vladimir Putin have won reelection in Europe, even as Moscow's largely unpopular war in Ukraine drags on.
Orban, who has urged peace in Ukraine, also used his victory speech to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy an "opponent" of Hungary.
European leaders have criticized Hungary for attempting to walk a tightrope of neutrality regarding the war.
In Serbia, Vucic has boasted about his personal ties to Putin, the Associated Press reported.
Meanwhile, voters in France who head to the polls on Sunday will see far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour on the ballot.

     Opinion : Europe has tools to stop Hungary’s toxic ruler. It’s time to use them.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Europe, specifically the European Union, has been grappling with the problem of Mr. Orban for years; his victory will give him a fourth consecutive term, and a fifth overall.
His position has infuriated not only Western European governments but also Poland’s populist leadership, which until recently was closely allied with Mr. Orban, as well as neighboring Central European countries such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
Fortunately, Europe has acquired better tools to deal with the problem of Hungary — and of Mr. Orban.
Mr. Orban has convinced many Hungarians of the opposite — that by shying away from condemning Mr. Putin’s aggression, Hungary safeguards its supply of cheap Russian energy.
By continuing to antagonize Europe and subvert European principles, Mr. Orban jeopardizes that cash flow.

     Orban's victory puts Hungary on collision course with EU

     Summary: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses supporters after the announcement of the partial results of parliamentary election in Budapest, Hungary, April 3, 2022.
"We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon, but definitely from Brussels," he said.
Looks like the end of whatever dreams one might have had of democracy in Hungary," an EU official said.
Others said Orban's positioning on Ukraine, accusing the opposition of risking Hungary being dragged into the war by seeking to allow arms shipments through its territory, played into their choice.
"I think it is due to how the parties reacted to the war, perhaps the ... opposition made people uncertain."

     Summary: So he tells us exactly who his enemies are – and friend Putin has hastened to congratulate him on his famous victory.
And it would have set about the difficult process of turning Hungary back into a proper liberal democracy.
Faced with the latest evidence of the barbaric behaviour of Russian troops in Ukraine, Europe needs to step up its sanctions against Putin.
Self-styled “realists” may argue that Brussels has to stay soft on Hungary in order to keep Orbán on board for a common front over Ukraine.
Europe should now get tough on both the Russian enemy without and the Hungarian enemy within.

     Summary: Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, gestures at the Fidesz campaign headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, on April 3, 2022.
He scored a crushing election victory to clinch a fourth consecutive term, overcoming criticism about democratic backsliding, his lukewarm support for war-ravaged Ukraine and close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Diplomatically, Orban fell in line with EU support for Kyiv despite his long-standing closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin congratulated Orban on his victory and said he hoped to further build ties, the Kremlin said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has singled Orban out for criticism over his reticence to take a tougher stance against Russia.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) After weeks of failing to divide Europe over his war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin enjoyed two small diplomatic victories this weekend.
On Sunday night, during his victory speech, Orban goaded not only the EU but Ukraine.
The reality is, Orban was expected to win and the EU has been working around his leadership for years.
Poland and Hungary have lately had a pact of sorts, effectively both wielding their EU vetoes to protect the other.
Although Serbia backed two United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions against Moscow, Reuters reported.
