     Sarah Palin’s Identity Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There’s no mystery to who she is now,” said Steve Schmidt, who managed McCain’s 2008 campaign, once championed Palin’s vice presidential selection but has since expressed regret for over it and vociferously criticized her.
If elected, Palin would join a “freakshow caucus” comprised of firebrands like Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Madison Cawthorn, Schmidt said.
She would be there “to wage war on half the country, to create outrage and grievance,” he added.
The question is whether Alaskans want to add another face to that crowd.
Michael Carey, a columnist for The Anchorage Daily News, told The New York Times after Young’s death that Alaskans would want the congressman to be succeeded by “someone who will go to Washington, give the bureaucrats hell and bring home the pork.”

     Sarah Palin Knows How to Get Attention. Can She Actually Win?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But six years after they shared that stage in Iowa, both Trump and Palin are somewhat diminished figures.
Palin, meanwhile, has been left to lament, during her libel trial against The New York Times, how she lost her TV gigs and her national political platform.
In October, the last time anyone tried to gauge her popularity in Alaska, Palin’s approval rating was just 31 percent, according to the Alaska pollster Ivan Moore.
So the question must be asked: Can Donald Trump help Sarah Palin win?
She was a popular governor, though by the end of her tenure, her approval rating had slunk from the low 90s to the mid-50s.

     Trump endorses Sarah Palin in run for Alaska's congressional seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington — Former President Donald Trump on Sunday endorsed Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, in her bid for the state's lone seat in the U.S. House.
"Sarah has been a champion for Alaska values, Alaska energy, Alaska jobs, and the great people of Alaska."
Trump went on to call Palin "tough and smart," and he called for Republicans to unite behind her.
Palin endorsed Trump in January 2016.
A special election to finish the rest of Young's term, which ends in January 2023, will be held this summer.

     Summary: Donald Trump has endorsed the former governor and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin for the vacant congressional seat in Alaska.
Sarah has been a champion for Alaska values, Alaska energy, Alaska jobs and the great people of Alaska.”In 2016, Palin was the first current or former state office holder to endorse Trump.
The Alaska House seat is open after the death of Don Young, the Republican who held it for nearly 50 years.
The Alaska governor proved popular with the Republican base but struggled with the demands of the role and a fierce media spotlight.
Sarah Palin is tough and smart and will never back down.”

     Summary: Palin was among the first -- and highest-profile -- Republican figures to back Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.
On its face, Trump's endorsement is then returning the favor.
She was, in many ways, Trump before Trump.
"Sarah lifted the McCain presidential campaign out of the dumps despite the fact that she had to endure some very evil, stupid, and jealous people within the campaign itself," he said .
There's a tendency to see Trump and his successful 2016 campaign as sui generis.

     Summary: Palin gives Trump a key endorsement in 2016.
Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP/Shutterstock/Mary Altaffer/AP/ShutterstockThe past few days have been a whirlwind for Sarah Palin.
Sarah has been a champion for Alaska values, Alaska energy, Alaska jobs, and the great people of Alaska.
Now, it’s my turn!”If this really is payback for Palin’s pre-Iowa 2016 endorsement of Trump, he took his sweet time getting around to it.
It’s possible Trump is rewarding Palin for a more recent favor: her willingness to promote his election fables.
