     Appeals court upholds $25M judgment against Oberlin College
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND (AP) — An Ohio appeals court has upheld a $25 million judgment against Oberlin College awarded to a local business that successfully claimed it was libeled by the school in the aftermath of a shoplifting incident.
The 9th District Court of Appeals on Thursday rejected all of the historic liberal arts college's arguments and upheld a $6.2 million payment in attorney fees.
Oberlin students and staff protested outside Gibson's Bakery and Food Mart after the shoplifting incident in November 2016.
In a statement to the Associated Press, the college said it was disappointed in the judges ruling.
Protests occurred outside the bakery after the arrests, with flyers being passed out some by an Oberlin College vice president and dean of students, accusing the bakery owners of being racist, the AP reported.

     Oberlin College loses appeal against $25 million libel judgment from suit filed by local bakery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a statement, Oberlin College officials said they were disappointed by the ruling.
Store owners Allyn Gibson and his son, David Gibson, sued Oberlin College in November 2017 claiming they had been libeled by the school and their business had been harmed.
The arrests triggered protests outside Gibson's Bakery where flyers were handed out, some by an Oberlin College vice president and dean of students, accusing the Gibsons of being racist.
Oberlin College officials ordered its campus food provider to stop buying bakery items from Gibson's.
A Lorain County jury awarded the Gibsons $44 million in compensatory and punitive damages in June 2019 after a five week trial.

     Court Orders College In Ohio To Pay Bakery Over Racism Accusations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An appeals court has upheld a verdict that says a Ohio college must pay the bakery it labeled as racist up to $31 million.
The bakery was labeled as racist by the college in Ohio when in 2016, the family business' owner confronted three Black Oberlin College students who stole wine from the store.
The three Black students were arrested, but then other students from Oberlin College began protesting the 135-year old family bakery.
However, Oberlin College students retaliated by refusing to purchase baked goods from Gibson's bakery for a month after the incidents.
Oberlin College is a small liberal arts college in northern Ohio and has been known for its left-wing politics.

     Ohio's Oberlin College Loses Appeal Against Bakery Where Black Students Were Accused Of Shoplifting

     Summary: Oberlin College must pay a $25 million judgment to a local bakery over a 2016 racially-charged shoplifting incident.
On Thursday (March 31), the 9th District Court of Appeals in Akron, Ohio rejected the college’s challenge of a lower court’s ruling in favor of Gibson’s Bakery and Food Mart, the Associated Press reports.
The bakery had successfully sued the Cleveland-area liberal arts school for libel.
The arrests prompted protests outside the bakery by Oberlin students, a vice president, and a dean of students who accused the Gibsons of racism, according to the AP.
A year after the incident, the Gibsons sued Oberlin, alleging libel and harm to their business.

Oberlin's attorneys later appealed the judgment and the case was heard before the appeals court in November of 2020.
David Gibson and "Grandpa" Allyn W. Gibson, the two lead plaintiffs in the case, did not live to see the appeals court verdict.
Oberlin Director Of Media Relations Scott Wargo told Legal Insurrection the college "is obviously disappointed that the appeals court affirmed the judgment in its ruling earlier today.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Ohio appeals court upheld a decision that will cost Oberlin College millions of dollars in a long-running legal battle between the college and a local bakery that students accused of racist actions.
Gibson’s Bakery sued the college in 2017 after Allyn D. Gibson—an employee whose father and grandfather owned the bakery—confronted three Black Oberlin students, one of whom was caught stealing wine.
Gibson’s Bakery claimed initial success in the courts on counts of libel, intentional interference with a business relationship and intentional infliction of emotional distress by Oberlin College.
Upholding the original verdict, the appeals court shot down three issues raised by Oberlin College and one by the Gibson family.
After all, enabling student speech may be more costly for colleges than simply stifling it.

     College owes $31 million after students called Ohio bakery racist, appeals court says

     Summary: FILE - In this Nov. 22, 2017 file photo, pedestrians pass the storefront of Gibson’s Bakery in Oberlin, Ohio.
The 9th District Court of Appeals upheld a $31 million judgment against Oberlin College that had been awarded to the bakery that successfully claimed it was libeled by the school after a shoplifting incident.
A three-judge panel in Ohio’s 9th District Court of Appeals rejected Oberlin College’s arguments in a 50-page opinion published on Thursday, March 31.
In doing so, the appeals court upheld a lower court decision that awarded Gibson’s Bakery $25 million in damages and $6 million in legal fees, the Associated Press reported.
In the midst of the tension, Raimondo also reportedly told the supplier of Oberlin’s dining halls not to use food from Gibson’s Bakery.
