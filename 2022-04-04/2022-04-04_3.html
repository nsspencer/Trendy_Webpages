     Mikel Arteta calls Arsenal performance against Crystal Palace ‘unacceptable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta rued the consequences of an “unacceptable” performance from his Arsenal side at Crystal Palace and admitted he had not anticipated anything like the 3-0 defeat that raises serious question marks about their top four hopes.
“We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play.
We put our hands up, apologise, regroup.”Asked whether he had seen the defeat coming, Arteta said Arsenal had failed to heed his warnings before the game.
“We discussed it just before kick-off, the way you win here is when you compete the way you should.
Patrick Vieira was delighted with the way his team played against Arsenal, his old club.

     Crystal Palace 3-0 Arsenal live score and result updates: Hosts secure shock Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Crystal Palace blew Arsenal away with a 3-0 victory that put a dent in the north London club’s hopes of finishing inside the Premier League’s top four.
First-half goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew at Selhurst Park gave Mikel Arteta’s side a mountain to climb before Wilfried Zaha’s 74th-minute penalty sealed an impressive victory.
After a slow start to the game, it was Palace who struck first.
Joachim Andersen headed a free-kick back across goal and Mateta scored his fifth of the season from close range.
Zaha confidently scored his penalty to lift his team up to ninth in the Premier League table.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal's hopes of securing a top-four Premier League finish this season were dealt a blow as the below-par visitors suffered a 3-0 defeat against rampant Crystal Palace on Monday.
The scoreline at Selhurst Park did not flatter an impressive Palace, who continue to improve under former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira, with the victory moving them up to ninth.
Arsenal had been in fine form on the road in the Premier League prior to their trip across London on Monday.
"Congratulations to Palace for the game they played but we made it impossible for ourselves with the way we competed," Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports.
Arsenal could not create any openings of note in the first half, with Mateta going close to adding a third for Palace before the interval.

     Summary: The only surprise when Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring was that it had not come sooner than the 14th minute.
pic.twitter.com/lQfuF6l7si — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) April 4, 2022Rather than jolt Arsenal into life, the goal simply invigorated an already energised Palace.
The game was up for Arsenal but a combination of dogged Palace defending and misfortune denied them a late consolation.
“We tried in the second half, we had three or four big chances but the only half chance they had they got a penalty.
It’s important they don’t panic.”He added: “The first half from Arsenal reminded me of their second half in the defeat earlier in the season at Everton.
