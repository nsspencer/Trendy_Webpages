     A History Unlike Any Other: North Carolina vs. Kansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Carolina and Kansas will face off in Monday evening's national championship game, and the matchup offers a history that not even the UNC vs. Duke rivalry can live up to.
Let me remind you of the context:First-ever meeting of North Carolina and Duke in the NCAA Tournament in any round.
The North Carolina vs. Duke game was one type of history.
The North Carolina vs. Kansas matchup is historic because this specific game and these two programs trace their roots to the very beginnings of basketball.
Coach Allen’s protégé then went on to be the head coach at the University of North Carolina for 36 seasons (1961-1997).
