     Mikel Arteta calls Arsenal performance against Crystal Palace ‘unacceptable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta rued the consequences of an “unacceptable” performance from his Arsenal side at Crystal Palace and admitted he had not anticipated anything like the 3-0 defeat that raises serious question marks about their top four hopes.
“We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play.
We put our hands up, apologise, regroup.”Asked whether he had seen the defeat coming, Arteta said Arsenal had failed to heed his warnings before the game.
“We discussed it just before kick-off, the way you win here is when you compete the way you should.
Patrick Vieira was delighted with the way his team played against Arsenal, his old club.

     Crystal Palace 3-0 Arsenal live score and result updates: Hosts secure shock Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Crystal Palace blew Arsenal away with a 3-0 victory that put a dent in the north London club’s hopes of finishing inside the Premier League’s top four.
First-half goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew at Selhurst Park gave Mikel Arteta’s side a mountain to climb before Wilfried Zaha’s 74th-minute penalty sealed an impressive victory.
After a slow start to the game, it was Palace who struck first.
Joachim Andersen headed a free-kick back across goal and Mateta scored his fifth of the season from close range.
Zaha confidently scored his penalty to lift his team up to ninth in the Premier League table.

     Arsenal top-four hopes suffer blow with 3-0 defeat at Palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Arsenal's hopes of securing a top-four Premier League finish this season were dealt a blow as the below-par visitors suffered a 3-0 defeat against rampant Crystal Palace on Monday.
Arsenal had been in fine form on the road in the Premier League prior to their trip to south London on Monday.
"Congratulations to Palace for the game they played but we made it impossible for ourselves with the way we competed," Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports.
NO RHYTHMArsenal's 1-0 win at Aston Villa last time out was their fifth away league victory in a row - the first time they had been on such a run since May 2015.
Fifth-placed Arsenal are level on 54 points with Spurs and three points ahead of West Ham United and Manchester United, albeit with all their top-four rivals having played more games.

     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Arsenal’s hopes of securing a top-four Premier League finish this season were dealt a blow as they suffered a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday.
Arsenal were put to the sword in the first half by the clinical hosts, with goals from forwards Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew giving Palace a deserved 2-0 interval lead.
Arsenal improved after the break, with Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard missing big chances to get their team back into the match.
Their wastefulness proved costly as Wilfried Zaha put the game to bed with a penalty 16 minutes from time.
The scoreline at Selhurst Park did not flatter an impressive Palace, who continue to improve under former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira, with the victory moving them up to ninth.
