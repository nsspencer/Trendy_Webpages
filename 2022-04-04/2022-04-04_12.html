     Summary: Itâ€™s easy to see how North Carolina Tar Heels sophomore Puff Johnson is the younger brother of the Phoenix Sunsâ€™ Cam Johnson not only by how similar they look but how they play basketball.
Puff, like his brother Cam, has a knack for making plays in multiple facets of the game and it showed in the NCAA National Championship against Kansas on Monday.
Johnson had only scored 47 total points entering the NCAA Tournament before a breakout performance in the title game.
He tied his career high of six rebounds and added 11 points as UNCâ€™s lone bench player in the game.
Johnson capped the Tar Heelsâ€™ big first half with a putback.
