     Local high schools celebrate KU's Christian Braun and Ochai Agbaji
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Monday's NCAA championship game is especially exciting for a few local high schools who have alumni playing for the University of Kansas.
At Oak Park High School, students and staff are celebrating "Och Park Day" for former Oak Park basketball player and current KU player Ochai Agbaji.
She's also known as "Rock Chalk Robin" and calls herself a die-hard KU basketball fan.
For students like Rylan Bishop, a senior basketball player, watching Ochai go for the NCAA title is just as inspiring as it is exciting.
KU shooting guard Christian Braun played basketball for the school and helped take the team to win the 2019 state championship.

     NBA Draft: Can Kansas Guard Ochai Agbaji Become a Blazer Next Season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I understand that I’m biased when it comes to Kansas Basketball players, but there is no doubt in my mind that Agbaji is worth a late lottery pick.
Agbaji has grown a lot in his four years at Kansas and is the leading scorer for a team in the National Championship.
He wants the ball in big moments because he knows he’s the best player on the floor.
Is there an NBA player he reminds you of?
Agbaji seems like a guy that starts the majority of games on the bench early in his career.

     2022 Final Four: Ochai Agbaji wins Most Outstanding Player, but was he the most deserving Kansas star?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kansas All-American Ochai Agbaji was named the 2022 Final Four Most Outstanding Player on Monday night following the Jayhawks' record-breaking comeback to top North Carolina 72-69 in the national championship game.
Agbaji scored 33 points over the two games, including a near-perfect shooting performance against Villanova in the Final Four.
Against North Carolina, Agbaji finished with 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting, but he led the Jayhawks in scoring in the first half with eight points when Kansas couldn't buy a bucket.
Then there's David McCormack, who clubbed Villanova with a 25-point, nine-rebound effort, then had 15 points and 10 rebounds against North Carolina, including Kansas' final four points.
The winner's jersey would have gone promptly to the Allen Fieldhouse rafters, joining 2008 Final Four Most Outstanding Player Mario Chalmers.

     Ochai Agbaji NBA scouting report: Kansas star has evolved into a 2022 lottery pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's rare to see a senior projected to go in the lottery of the NBA Draft these days, but Kansas star Ochai Agbaji has evolved his game into becoming one of the top prospects in the 2022 draft class.
World-renowned NBA scout Mike Schmitz even went as far as to say that Agbaji "could play 25+ minutes in an NBA game tomorrow."
Agbaji's measurables, 3-point shooting and high motor will have him ready to make an impact at the NBA level immediately.
Ochai Agbaji's weaknessesThe biggest knock on Agbaji's game is that he isn't much of a shot creator.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He looked only upward, motioning with his hand to call to his family to come down to see him.
“You’re a champion,’’ she said, her voice rising with the final word, equal parts elation and disbelief.
Only then did Agbaji reluctantly separate himself from his family, his own eyes wet with tears.
Now four years and two months later, Agbaji paraded under the basket as his teammates took their turns cutting down the net, not just a national champion but the Final Four Most Outstanding Player.
Later his coach would rank him as the most accomplished Kansas player since Danny Manning.

     Ochai Agbaji adds a NCAA Tournament MVP to his awards haul with Kansas Jayhawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kansas senior guard Ochai Agbaji has achieved Jayhawks basketball immortality.
Agbaji, who hit 4-of-9 shots (1-of-4 from three and 3-of-8 from the line) and had three rebounds in 37 minutes, won the Most Outstanding Player award for the NCAA Tournament.
Agbaji was the AP and coaches’ Big 12 player of the year, the Big 12 Tournament MVP and a consensus first-team All-American.
“But winning the most outstanding player of this, I don’t really care because we won the national championship.
But he added: “I almost wish Dave got it so his jersey could hang (as most outstanding player of postseason; Agbaji’s already will hang by virtue of his first-team All-America status).
