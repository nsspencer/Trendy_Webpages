     Ivanka Trump Testifies to House Panel Investigating Jan. 6 Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Ivanka Trump, former President Donald J. Trump’s eldest daughter, who served as one of his senior advisers, testified for about eight hours on Tuesday before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, according to people familiar with the matter.
It was not immediately clear how revelatory her testimony was for the committee, but those familiar with the interview said Ms. Trump did not seek to invoke any privilege — such as executive privilege or the Fifth Amendment, as other witnesses have done — and broadly, if not garrulously, answered the panel’s questions.
Ms. Trump was one of several aides who tried to persuade the president to call off the violence that ultimately injured more than 150 police officers and sent lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence fleeing for safety, according to evidence gathered by the committee.
She is not known to have been associated with the more extreme supporters of the former president who spread lies about widespread fraud after the 2020 election and planned efforts to try to keep him in power.
Her testimony came days after her husband, Jared Kushner, who was also a top adviser to Mr. Trump, sat for an interview and provided what one member of the panel described as “valuable” and “helpful” information.

     Ivanka Trump ends 8 hours of testimony to House committee investigating Jan. 6 Capitol riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I mean, you know, not in broad, chatty terms, but she's answering questions," Thompson told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Ivanka Trump testified for around eight hours Tuesday to the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that began after her father, former President Donald Trump , spent weeks falsely claiming he was being deprived of a second White House term because of widespread ballot fraud.
Ivanka Trump testified five days after her husband Jared Kushner himself answered questions from the committee for more than six hours.
Kushner also was a senior advisor in the Trump White House and is the only other family relative to have testified before the committee other than his wife.
Asked by reporters if Ivanka Trump had provided "any new information ... new insights" in her testimony, Thompson quipped in reply: "Good try."

     Summary: Ivanka Trump voluntarily testified before the January 6 select committee for eight hours on Tuesday.
Committee chair Bennie Thompson told CNN that the voluntary interview with Trump's eldest daughter started in the morning.
In January, Trump, the eldest daughter of former President Donald Trump, was asked to cooperate with the Capitol riot probe voluntarily.
"We write to request your voluntary cooperation with our investigation on a range of critical topics," Thompson wrote in a letter to Ivanka Trump.
Former President Trump had previously criticized the committee for calling on Ivanka to testify, labeling it a "very unfair" request.

     House expected to vote Wednesday on referrals for two former Trump advisers to Justice Department for contempt of Congress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The House is expected to vote Wednesday to recommend two former advisers to former President Donald Trump be referred to the Department of Justice on criminal contempt of Congress charges.
"My position remains this is not my Executive Privilege to waive and the Committee should negotiate this matter with President Trump," Navarro said in a statement.
If both referrals pass out of the House, they will be sent to the Department of Justice, which will decide if there is enough evidence to prosecute.
The first referral from the House, for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, was picked up by the Justice Department and has led to an indictment of Bannon.
The Justice Department is still reviewing the contempt referral of former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, which the full House voted on in December.
