Al-Khelaifi also raised the prospect of new venues and expansions into new markets to make the Champions League even more accessible to the U.S. and Asian audiences via even bigger international television rights deals.
The Champions League will already expand in 2024 with PSG in a fight along with Ligue 1 to remain part of the continental top five over the next two years to remain one of the leading domestic competitions in Europe.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: City and Atlético go head-to-head in the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday — a first competitive meeting between the teams, if not the men leading them.
The most recent was in the Champions League in 2016, when Atlético eliminated Guardiola’s highly fancied Bayern Munich team on away goals after a pair of tightly contested legs in the semifinals.
It’s one of Guardiola’s many painful exits in the Champions League since his last title, in 2011.
The only other time Guardiola and Simeone faced each other was in February 2012, a few months before Guardiola quit Barcelona.
Not that it will stop him from doing so again when Simeone and Atlético come to Manchester.
