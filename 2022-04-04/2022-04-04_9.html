     Spurs' postseason push hits big challenge in Denver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs made the playoffs 22 straight times under coach Gregg Popovich but have been absent from the postseason the last two seasons.
The first challenge is Tuesday night when the Spurs (33-45) visit the Denver Nuggets (47-32).
San Antonio won the game without starters Dejounte Murray (non-COVID illness) and Jakob Poeltl (back) but hope to have both available for Tuesday night.
Murray has missed two straight games while Poeltl was a late scratch in the 113-92 win over the Trail Blazers.
San Antonio is 17-21 on the road, where it will play three of its final four games, and 16-24 at home.

     What we learned from the Spurs win over the Trail Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mini-series ‚Äî or consecutive games against the same opponent ‚Äî are tricky for a variety of reasons.
Teams are used to playing one game before moving on to studying the next team, so repetitiveness and complacency can become an issue.
Similarly, repeated games give each opponent the chance to make adjustments, and the other side may or may not be prepared, etc.
In 10 total mini-series, they only went 4-16: nowhere close to breaking even and without winning a single series.
There were only two such series this season: a home-and-home against the Denver Nuggets in December, where the Spurs split the outcome, and the just-finished home-and-home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday and Sunday ‚Äî both wins.

     Spurs fan goes viral for passionate rendition of Kelly Clarkson song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Spurs topped the Trail Blazers 113-92 Sunday night, but a singing San Antonio fan stole the spotlight.
During the game, a Spurs fan got up and put on a passionate performance of Kelly Clarkson‚Äôs song, ‚ÄúSince U Been Gone,‚Äù and the crowd at AT&amp;T Center ate it up.
One fan tweeted that the apparent impromptu performance was ‚Äúthe only highlight of the Spurs season.‚ÄùThe dancing fan got up from her seat and used her empty beverage cup as a microphone while pointing to the camera.
Jumbotron cameras caught the fan singing as part of a presumed interactive skit.
Some people on Twitter speculated that the performance was ‚Äústaged,‚Äù but one fan at the game tweeted, ‚ÄúI met her &amp; she said it was NOT staged.

     Play-in berth well within Spurs‚Äô grasp: ‚ÄòWe all smell it.‚Äô
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER ‚Äî Spurs guard Josh Richardson‚Äôs postgame ritual includes catching up on what happened elsewhere in the NBA that night.
With Keldon Johnson scoring 28 points and Collins tormenting his former team by collecting his first career double-double, the Spurs overcame an early 13-point deficit to pummel injury-depleted Portland 113-92 on Sunday and place a Western Conference play-in berth in their grasp.
‚ÄúWe all smell it,‚Äù said Collins, who matched his career high with 18 points and set a career best with 13 rebounds.
The Spurs' Murray is second with 13.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for them to play in pressure games early in their careers because there is real pressure on these games right now,‚Äù Richardson said.
