     Masters 2022: Optimism that Tiger will play grows after Monday practice round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA Ga. — After a few hellos to the boys and a measured walk to the short-game area, Tiger Woods entered his comfort zone: three bags of balls, two wedges to alternate between and a bentgrass canvas to work with.
Flanked by caddie Joe LaCava and right-hand man Rob McNamara, Woods hardly said a word as he flashed his full arsenal of short-game magic on Monday at the Augusta National practice area.
He drew chips to climb up slopes and then he cut chips to spin down them.
He hit a number of 4-iron bumps, a new shot he’s grooving to use around some of Augusta National’s reworked greens—like No.
3, where the false front has been steepened even further.

     Injured Bryson DeChambeau enjoying lower profile before 2022 Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryson DeChambeau has always done things his own way but even he is taking it a little far at this year’s Masters.
“Coming here in the fall for that Masters, a lot of eyes were on me, and it was a different expectation level and definitely uncomfortable for me because I had never experienced that,” DeChambeau said.
Woods’ gallery is so big that DeChambeau says the atmosphere surrounding everyone else almost feels relaxing in comparison.
His results here have been underwhelming since he finished 21st on his debut in 2016, when he was the low amateur.
It would be a hell of an achievement if he does better than 21st this week.

Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked a bit after a Monday afternoon media session with Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods.
What's next on Tiger's status: Woods is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m.

While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Summary: It's not difficult to prognosticate that Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm are going to play quality golf at Augusta National at the 86th edition of this tournament.
Those are the players we'll try to select based on either recent form or past history at Augusta National.
Si Woo Kim (100-1): I'm irrationally high on Kim for a few reasons.
Shane Lowry (45-1): Over his last 50 rounds, he's been a better ball-striker than Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele.
That's absolutely worth a flyer at 125-1.Who will win the Masters, and which long shots will stun the golfing world?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods consumes attention at every Masters he plays.
Woods has said it would be a “game-time” decision whether his battered right leg and ankle can handle walking and competing over 18 holes at Augusta National.
“Different situation than Tiger, obviously, but it was definitely a day-by-day process of figuring out if I could do this,” he said.
Koepka had surgery on his right knee three weeks before the Masters last year and still was determined to play.
He is more concerned with his own game that what Woods has going on, though Koepka can appreciate the walk Woods is facing better than most players.

     Summary: DeChambeau has struggled in his two events leading into the Masters, while his body continues to recover from a series of early-season injuries.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- It wasn’t long ago that Bryson DeChambeau was the number one needle-mover on the PGA Tour, with his prodigious length that was awe-inspiring.
Yet, many believed his body -- in fact, no body -- could consistently sustain ball speed of over 200 mph.
DeChambeau reached 219 mph at the 2021 World Long Drive Championship and consistently exceeded 200 mph on Tour.
That drive was the single most popular shot of 2021, but that was then and just over a year since then DeChambeau has struggled with his health and his game.
