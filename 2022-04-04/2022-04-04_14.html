     Katy Perry and Dua Lipa reportedly still set to collaborate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Katy Perry and Dua Lipa are reportedly set to collaborate together on a new track.
Elsewhere, the ‘Levitating’ singer wanted Perry to contribute to ‘Ball &amp; Chain’ – an unreleased ‘Future Nostalgia’ song – but the latter artist is believed to have been too busy at the time of recording.
AdvertisementSpeaking to The Sun (via Music-News.COM), a source explained that Lipa and Perry “are both fans of each other” and are hoping to finally join forces at some point soon.
“So far it’s been an issue of schedules and that Dua was determined to keep ‘Future Nostalgia’ collab-free,” they said.
I’m always going to make pop music, but it has its own unique sound, which is exciting and something that feels like a movement from ‘Future Nostalgia’.”

     Dua Lipa Nails the Lingerie-as-Outerwear Trend in a Lace Slip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dua Lipa made the Grammys a stylish affair, walking the red carpet in a 1992 Versace dress that came with a mesh corseted bodice and strappy harness.
By the end of the night, Lipa had traded Versace for Balenciaga, heading out to explore Las Vegas — where the award ceremony took place — in a spring/summer 2022 design.
Lipa's stylist, Lorenzo Posocco, joined her crew and posted photos from the evening, where the Balenciaga set was on full display.
Consisting of opera-length gloves, a balconette-corset dress adorned with a mini bow, and tights, the lace-embroidered jacquard set was essentially Balenciaga designer Demna's take on lingerie-as-outerwear.
She's one of the many stars who showed her love for the opera-length glove trend, which was spotted everywhere from the Grammys red carpet to the stage.
