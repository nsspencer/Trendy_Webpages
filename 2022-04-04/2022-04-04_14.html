     Kansas' Ochai Agbaji named NCAA Tournament's most outstanding player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Orleans — Kansas guard Ochai Agbaji was named the most outstanding player of the NCAA Tournament on Monday following the Jayhawks' 72-69 victory over North Carolina in the national championship game.
Agbaji, a senior from Kansas City, Missouri, earned the honor after he had 12 points in 37 minutes as Kansas claimed its sixth national championship and first since 2008.
A consensus first-team All-American and the unanimous Big 12 Player of the Year this season, Agbaji averaged 17.8 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting 30-for-65 (46.1%) during the six-game NCAA Tournament run.
Born, who won it in 1953, and Chamberlain, the winner in 1957, earned the honor despite not winning the national championship.
"I don't really care because we won the national championship," Agbaji said.

     NBA Draft: Can Kansas Guard Ochai Agbaji Become a Blazer Next Season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I understand that I’m biased when it comes to Kansas Basketball players, but there is no doubt in my mind that Agbaji is worth a late lottery pick.
Agbaji has grown a lot in his four years at Kansas and is the leading scorer for a team in the National Championship.
He wants the ball in big moments because he knows he’s the best player on the floor.
Is there an NBA player he reminds you of?
Agbaji seems like a guy that starts the majority of games on the bench early in his career.

     Summary: — Monday's NCAA championship game is especially exciting for a few local high schools who have alumni playing for the University of Kansas.
At Oak Park High School, students and staff are celebrating "Och Park Day" for former Oak Park basketball player and current KU player Ochai Agbaji.
She's also known as "Rock Chalk Robin" and calls herself a die-hard KU basketball fan.
For students like Rylan Bishop, a senior basketball player, watching Ochai go for the NCAA title is just as inspiring as it is exciting.

     Ochai Agbaji NBA scouting report: Kansas star has evolved into a 2022 lottery pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's rare to see a senior projected to go in the lottery of the NBA Draft these days, but Kansas star Ochai Agbaji has evolved his game into becoming one of the top prospects in the 2022 draft class.
World-renowned NBA scout Mike Schmitz even went as far as to say that Agbaji "could play 25+ minutes in an NBA game tomorrow."
Agbaji's measurables, 3-point shooting and high motor will have him ready to make an impact at the NBA level immediately.
Ochai Agbaji's weaknessesThe biggest knock on Agbaji's game is that he isn't much of a shot creator.
