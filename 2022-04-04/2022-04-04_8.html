    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has called on UEFA to make the Champions League final more like the Super Bowl.
The UEFA Champions League final is a significantly bigger event than the Super Bowl in terms of its global audience.
As well as imitating the Super Bowl's celebrity glitz around the final, Al-Khelaifi is proposing that each season's Champions League tournament should begin with a bang.
"I can't understand how the Super Bowl can feel bigger than the Champions League final.
PSG and Al-Khelaifi were vocal in their opposition to the proposed breakaway tournament, which was seen as a serious threat to the Champions League.

     Summary: (0:38)Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said the Champions League final should be a bigger spectacle than the Super Bowl and that it needs to evolve to capture a bigger audience.
He told The Athletic he "can't understand how the Super Bowl can feel bigger than the Champions League final," despite the fact that the 2021 Champions League final drew 700 million viewers and the 2022 Super Bowl only had 112 million viewers.
The Champions League final tends to draw between 380 million-400 million spectators outside of the venue.

They (Atletico Madrid) are a team that is so used to playing these types of games.
Despite repetitive Champions League setbacks since Guardiola's arrival to the Etihad Stadium, Silva believes that the squad will be relishing the pressure-packed situation in Europe.

     Style clash as Guardiola, Simeone meet in Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: City and Atlético go head-to-head in the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday — a first competitive meeting between the teams, if not the men leading them.
The most recent was in the Champions League in 2016, when Atlético eliminated Guardiola’s highly fancied Bayern Munich team on away goals after a pair of tightly contested legs in the semifinals.
It’s one of Guardiola’s many painful exits in the Champions League since his last title, in 2011.
The only other time Guardiola and Simeone faced each other was in February 2012, a few months before Guardiola quit Barcelona.
Not that it will stop him from doing so again when Simeone and Atlético come to Manchester.
