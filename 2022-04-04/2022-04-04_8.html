     Summary: Meanwhile, other traditional Masters pairings seem to be lining up, most notable the defending champion (Hideki Matsuyama) playing in the same threesome as the reigning U.S.
Amateur champion (James Piot).
The question though is might Augusta National officials add a second amateur to the group, bringing in World No.
1 Keita Nakajima to play with his Japanese countryman.
If he’s not in that threesome, expect Nakajima to be paired with another former green jacket winners.

     Summary: The countdown to The Masters is on, and that includes a Tiger Woods countdown as well.
Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked a bit after a Monday afternoon media session with Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods.
What's next on Tiger's status: Woods is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m.

     Summary: Tiger Woods and The Masters.
While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not difficult to prognosticate that Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm are going to play quality golf at Augusta National at the 86th edition of this tournament.
Those are the players we'll try to select based on either recent form or past history at Augusta National.
Si Woo Kim (100-1): I'm irrationally high on Kim for a few reasons.
Shane Lowry (45-1): Over his last 50 rounds, he's been a better ball-striker than Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele.
That's absolutely worth a flyer at 125-1.Who will win the Masters, and which long shots will stun the golfing world?

     Masters: Winners' bags and golf equipment since 2010 at Augusta National
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Very few golf tournaments test a player’s equipment as does Augusta National each year during the Masters.
When they go to the Masters, they often take more just to be sure they have everything they could possibly need.
A pro’s work with equipment company representatives and technicians is different at the Masters than most weeks on the PGA Tour.
Equipment vans usually are parked close to the driving range at PGA Tour events, but during Masters week they do not park on property at Augusta National.
Below is a list of all the clubs that Masters champions since 2010 have used to win their green jacket.

     Summary: While no player looks less like a Masters champion than Cameron Smith, the young Aussie with The Mullet (yes, it deserves its own capital letters), no player’s game looks more like it belongs to a Masters champion than Smith’s.
In fact, no player without a major championship already on the resume is a more obvious Masters pick than Smith, ranked sixth in the world.
1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.

Tiger Woods tees off on the sixth hole during a practice round for the Masters golf tournament with plenty of fans on hand.
For Collin Morikawa, ranked third in the world, his first Masters memory was watching Woods win the tournament for the first time in 1997.
And Morikawa’s favorite such memory was watching Woods win his fifth green jacket, in 2019.
I mean, that Sunday was booked out to do nothing other than watch TV.”Fred Couples, left, Justin Thomas and Tiger Woods walk down the sixth fairway during a practice round for the Masters.
