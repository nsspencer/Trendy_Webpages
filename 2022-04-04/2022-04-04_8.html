Discussing his relationship with cinema in an interview from 1992, Cobain revealed his love for the Wim Wender’s classic whilst also stating, “I’d like to be something artistic I guess.

     Remembering Kurt Cobain: Watch Nirvana Debut ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Smells Like Teen Spirit” is the lead single and opening track on Nirvana’s landmark 1991 album Nevermind.
The journey to Nevermind, however, began in early 1990 as the band began prepping the follow up to their 1989 debut, Bleach.
Also falling into place around this time was a new song Kurt began working on which would become “Smells Like Teen Spirit,’ the title for which came from Bikini Kills’s Kathleen Hanna who wrote “Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit” on his wall.
Hanna and Cobain’s then-girfriend Tobi Vail had seen the deodorant Teen Spirit in the grocery store recently.

     Stigma failed Kurt Cobain nearly 30 years ago and continues to fail people in addiction now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And, like so many others in addiction, Cobain lost many opportunities to feel better because of stigma and outmoded drug laws — both of which continue today.
It’s not clear from Cobain’s biographies exactly how consistent his buprenorphine treatment was.
A few days later, Cobain entered abstinence-based treatment for the final time.

The goal of addiction treatment should be to ensure wellness and safety, not abstinence from any and all substances — Kurt Cobain tried that, multiple times, and it failed him.
