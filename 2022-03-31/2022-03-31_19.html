     Summary: In a game that featured 17 lead changes, Xavier interim basketball coach Jonas Hayes couldn’t describe his emotions after the No.
“I’m at a lost of words,” Hayes told ESPN's sideline reporter Myron Medcalf at the end of the game.
Hayes took over as interim coach after the program curiously parted ways with coach Travis Steele during the tournament.
In what could have been the last NIT game at Madison Square Garden for the foreseeable future, the championship game ended in dramatic fashion.
Jones led the Musketeers in scoring with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists, followed by Dwon Odom with 18 and Nunge with 15 points.

     Summary: Xavier is in contention for a national postseason tournament title for the first time since 1958.
This NIT final is the first final Xavier has appeared in since then.
The Musketeers have appeared in only three national semifinals (NAIA- 1948, NIT- 1958, NIT- 1999) in their history.
Their desire has transferred to Xavier Nation, which has responded in with a wave of support for the team.
Odom and Kunkel need to be especially wary of Tyrece Radford, who loves to slide in amongst the trees on the offensive glass.
