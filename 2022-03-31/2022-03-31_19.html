     Summary: Jack Nunge drains a big-time hook shot to give Xavier the lead before Tyrece Radford's near make in the NIT championship's final seconds.
(0:34)NEW YORK -- If this was the last NIT championship game at Madison Square Garden, it certainly was a thriller.
It was a surprising snub by the selection committee that drew criticism from Texas A&amp;M coach Buzz Williams and others.
"What has happened in their program over the last two weeks is historical and any AD that has a job opening should hire the undefeated head coach at Xavier, Coach Hayes,'' Williams said.
His layup evened it 26-all and he capped a 7-0 spurt with a 3-pointer that extended the Aggies' lead to 31-26.
