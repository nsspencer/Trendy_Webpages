     The World Cup Draw Is Friday. Here’s How It Works.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The World Cup field is almost complete.
On Friday, soccer teams will learn the answer to the critical question they and their fans want to know: Who will they play when the tournament opens in November in Qatar?
The World Cup draw — part gala, part pep rally, part math seminar — will deliver intriguing clashes of styles, testy political collisions and, if past events are any guide, a few uncomfortable moments.
But given the stakes of the draw, it is also one of the biggest events on the global sports calendar.
Here is a look at how it works.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that the World Cup draw pots are set, the descending hours before the official draw is where the fun truly lies.
After all, Serbia did go undefeated in World Cup qualifying and won its group over Portugal.
But at the World Cup, it won’t have the intimidation factor that is home games at Red Star Stadium.
That’s a lot of anxiety in the seven-month wait between the draw and the start of the World Cup.
The North African side was unimpressive in World Cup qualifying, sneaking past Mali by an aggregate score of 1–0 in the qualifying playoff last week, and has never made it past the World Cup group stage.
