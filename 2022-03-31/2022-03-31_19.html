     Kevin Durant says Warriors Should Retire his Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant is one of the greatest NBA players of all-time.
As such, he believes both the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder should retire his jersey.
In an interview with The Ringer, Durant gave his candid thoughts about the Warriors retiring his jersey.
Even though Kevin Durant wasn't with the Golden State Warriors as long as he was with the Thunder, he was still tremendously accomplished.
As a Warrior, Durant was 2x NBA Champion, 2x NBA Finals MVP, 3x All-Star, and a 1x All-NBA First team member.

     OKC Thunder quotes: Kevin Durant believes the Thunder have to retire his jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In The Ringer’s latest article, Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant disclosed his thoughts on the conversation about whether the Oklahoma City Thunder should retire his jersey No.
“‘OKC has to retire my jersey,’ he continues.
'”Considering Durant is a top-15 player of all time and spent the first nine seasons of his career with the Thunder franchise, it goes without saying that the team will likely retire his jersey in the future.
Even if there are still hard feelings between the fan base and Durant.
The only caveat I’ve seen Thunder fans make regarding retiring Durant’s jersey is that it has to happen after Russell Westbrook gets his number zero retired.

     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets star is never afraid to fire back at someone’s opinion, whether it is shared online or during a press conference.
During his time with the Golden State Warriors, Durant squared off with media members constantly.
There were several testy moments between Durant and the reporters covering the Warriors.
The narratives drawn about the team didn’t seem to favor Durant and instead made Stephen Curry out to be the main guy.
While Golden State looks to keep contending, Durant and the Nets, the team he is very happy with, are looking to finally reach the Finals.

     Summary: OKLAHOMA CITY — Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant isn't slowing down in his 15th NBA season, but he's sounding like he's preparing for when it happens.
In a profile by The Ringer's Logan Murdock, Durant reflected on several parts of his Hall of Fame-worthy career including his legacy in Oklahoma City and Golden State.
If you don’t want me to be a part of your program when I’m done playing, then that’s personal."
Durant left the Thunder in 2016 to join the Warriors where he won two NBA championships in three seasons before leaving for the Nets.
I’m still doing what I’m doing here in Brooklyn, but if I continue on what I’m doing four or five years, then I’ll feel the same way about this program.

     Kevin Durant: It's Bad for Basketball If Thunder, Warriors Don't Retire My Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Durant told Logan Murdock of The Ringer that it would be bad for the game of basketball if the Oklahoma City Thunder or Golden State Warriors chose not to retire his number over bad blood from his departure from the two franchises.
The Seattle SuperSonics left a bustling market with a loyal fanbase to carve out owner Clay Bennett's vision to bring NBA basketball to Oklahoma City.
The 2016-17 Warriors are arguably the greatest basketball team ever assembled.
Durant was the best player on the best team in NBA history; that alone is enough to merit his jersey hanging forever.
Like his OKC exit, Durant's departure from Golden State polarized the fanbase, but time has a way of healing wounds.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors achieved a lot of success during Kevin Durant’s time with the organization.
Despite all of the results Durant and the Warriors achieved together, they were far from being free of controversy.
In an interview with The Ringer, Durant explained how he feels the media coverage he received as a member of the Warriors was “unfair” by constantly receiving questions about his free agency plans.
“I thought it was unfair to me and the whole group to even think about anything that was going to happen after the year.
In the end, Durant opted to depart the Warriors to team up with Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets using a sign-and-trade in 2019.
