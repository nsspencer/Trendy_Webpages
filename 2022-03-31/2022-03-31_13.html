     About Title 42, the Pandemic Order Biden May Relax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What is Title 42?
It’s a provision included in the 1944 Public Health Service Act to permit federal health officials to ban people and goods from entering the country in the case of a pandemic.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already terminated Title 42 for unaccompanied minors as of March 12.
Title 42 was also used to expel asylum-seekers from Mexico, Brazil and other countries.
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, more than 1.6 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since March 2020.

     Summary: "We are expecting to get wrecked," one Border Patrol agent told Fox News.
"We feel abandoned, we feel frustrated, we’re devastated," National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told Fox News Digital.
Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said this week that the U.S. will hit one million border encounters this fiscal year in the coming days.
There are also believed to be a considerable number of migrants waiting in Mexican cities waiting for Title 42 to drop.
Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema have warned the administration against ending Title 42 without a plan in place.

“Title 42 has been an utter failure by all measures,” Reichlin-Melnick told Al Jazeera.
Haiti has been reeling from rising gang violence and political instability, but the US quickly emptied the camp and expelled the vast majority of people under Title 42.

     White House bracing for ‘three-fold’ increase in migration once Title 42 lifted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The Biden administration is making contingency plans to deal with a three-fold increase in migration upon lifting of the Title 42 public health order, a California congresswoman says.
The challenges stem from the expected termination of Title 42 as early as May 23, which could reopen the borders to asylum-seekers.
While Title 42 has been in force, asylum-seekers haven’t been allowed to petition for asylum at U.S. ports of entry.
Chu and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, said they welcome the end of Title 42 despite whatever temporary challenges the change in policy may bring.
Solange Gould, a 25-year public health veteran, agrees that asylum-seekers should be treated better at processing centers.

     Title 42 and the border: Why what we're seeing now is different
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —More migrants are coming to the US-Mexico border, and officials say they expect the number to grow.
The policy is known as Title 42 for the US code invoked in its implementation, and its days may be numbered.
“We have every expectation that when the CDC ultimately decides it’s appropriate to lift Title 42, there will be an influx of people to the border,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have been lambasting the Biden administration for even considering lifting Title 42.
But Pinheiro told CNN last week she was concerned administration officials haven’t done more to include advocates in their plans.
