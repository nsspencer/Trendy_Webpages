     Khloé Kardashian Defends Rob Kardashian, Tyga After Blac Chyna Said She Gets No Child Support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For some context, Tyga and Chyna dated from around 2011 to 2014 and share their 9-year-old son, King Cairo.
After the pair broke up, Tyga started dating Kylie Jenner, prompting Chyna to distance herself from the Kar-Jenner bunch — all of whom she’d been really close with.

     Tyga Seeks Financial Advice From Rob Kardashian Amid Blac Chyna Child Support Claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyga and Rob Kardashian did their part in attempting to snatch the public’s attention away from the barrage of Will Smith and Chris Rock headlines crowding the internet on Wednesday (March 30).
Rob Kardashian joined Tyga to clear it the child support discrepancies 👀😫 https://t.co/VyP7AKZHhi pic.twitter.com/suQmkTdqjG — TheShadeRoom (@TheShadeRoom) March 30, 2022Blac Chyna didn’t offer up much of a response publicly outside of a simple “lol” on Twitter.
It looked as if Tyga and Rob may have coordinated their replies at first, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
T-Raww even tried to warn Rob K. about what he was going to have to deal with when it came to Blac Chyna while they were dating in 2017.
T-Raww and Rob Kardashian both have one kid with Blac Chyna in King Stevenson (9 years old) and Dream Kardashian (5 years old).
