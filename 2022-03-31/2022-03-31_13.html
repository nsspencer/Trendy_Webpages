    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An announcement by Bruce Willis’s family that the actor is retiring because of an aphasia diagnosis has shone a spotlight on the communication disorder, which can affect how someone understands or expresses written or spoken language.
About 2 million Americans have aphasia, making it more common than Parkinson’s disease or cerebral palsy.
Willis’s family has not specified what type of aphasia he has, what caused it or whether he has any other impairments.

     Bruce Willis and aphasia: University of Louisville doctors explain the disorder and causes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With actor Bruce Willis stepping away from his career over an aphasia diagnosis, University of Louisville doctors explained Thursday the condition impacts millions of Americans and is caused, primarily, by stroke.

People with aphasia "have problems understanding words, expressing words or both comprehension and expression," Remmel said.
The most common cause for aphasia is stroke, Remmel said, though head trauma and brain tumors can also cause the condition.

     Bruce Willis’ Aphasia: A Look at This Condition With an Uncertain Cause
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis’ decision to step out of the spotlight this week after his diagnosis of aphasia is not surprising.
It’s perhaps the worst medical condition for an actor.
The condition affects more than 2 million Americans and occurs when there is damage to the language centers of the brain, Fisher explained.
“Most forms of aphasia come on suddenly, but it can also result from deterioration of brain tissue over time such as with dementia and, more specifically, primary progressive aphasia,” Fisher said.
Progressive aphasia will likely not show improvement, although patients can acquire new communication strategies through speech therapy, she said.

     Matthew Perry sends love to longtime pal Bruce Willis after aphasia diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Dear Bruce Willis, I’m so sorry to hear what you are going through, but you’re still the coolest man I’ve met in my entire life,” Perry, 52, tweeted on Thursday.
“You will remain in my prayers for a long long time.”The “Friends” star ended his sweet post with a reference to the 2004 crime comedy, “The Whole Ten Yards,” in which the actors co-starred.
In the film, Perry played a dentist while the “Die Hard” star, now 67, was cast as a contract killer.
Willis’ publicist later confirmed that the actor donated his entire “Friends” paycheck (the amount was not disclosed) to five charities.
Willis’ family revealed on Wednesday that he has aphasia.

     The Razzies Take Back Bruce Willis’s Award Following Public Aphasia Diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Ian West/PA Images via Getty ImagesThe Razzies have decided to rescind their award to Bruce Willis following his family’s announcement on March 30 that he would be stepping away from his acting career due to aphasia.
Willis was given his own category at the awards ceremony on March 25, Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie, with the eight titles he starred in throughout the year.
The Razzies also rescinded a Worst Actress nomination for Shelley Duvall, who played shell-shocked mother Wendy Torrance in The Shining.
In a February Vulture interview, the founders expressed regret over Duvall’s 1981 nomination in response to Kubrick’s treatment toward her on set.
“We would like to take this opportunity to rescind that nomination as well.”

     What to Know About Aphasia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aphasia, which affects an estimated 2 million Americans, is a language disorder that impacts someone’s ability to communicate with others.
Brain injuries, brain tumors, infections, or neurodegenerative diseases can also cause aphasia if any part of the brain that processes language is affected.
Depending on what area of the brain is damaged, aphasia will take different forms, the most common of which are Wernicke’s aphasia and Broca’s aphasia.
Because the frontal lobe also regulates motor movement, people with Broca’s aphasia often experience weakness or paralysis in their right arm or leg.
Depending on the cause, aphasia can develop at different rates.
