     Ukraine says all Russian forces have left Chernobyl power plant

     Summary: “There are no longer any outsiders on the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, said on Facebook.
The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, also confirmed that it had been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces handed control of the power plant and “moved convoys of troops”.
#Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 Feb have, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops.
https://t.co/DkBXEJpDu8 pic.twitter.com/guITblxwXP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 31, 2022Earlier on Thursday, Energoatom said those workers had flagged that Russian forces were planning to leave the territory.
Earlier on Thursday, the head of Energoatom urged the UN nuclear watchdog to help ensure Russian nuclear officials do not interfere in the operation of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which is also occupied by Russian soldiers.

     Russians fleeing Chernobyl over radiation fears ‘take Ukraine soldiers with them’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian troops have largely withdrawn from the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power station but have taken an unspecified number of Ukrainian service personnel with them, officials have said.
But the UN agency said it could not independently confirm the claim that the Russian soldiers, whose capture of the plant on 24 February, the first day of the invasion, raised fears of increased radiological risks, had been exposed to radiation.
Energoatom did not say how many soldiers were involved and gave no details of how they had been affected.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, also said Russian troops were exposed to radiation after digging tenches in the forest.
Some Ukrainian reports have suggested the soldiers were taken to a special medical facility in nearby Belarus after driving tanks through the exclusion zone, kicking up radioactive dust.

     Ukraine power company says Russians are leaving Chernobyl site after radiation exposure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said Thursday as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts.
The area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing.
In the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel.
Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu have given assurances that conscripts will not take part in the war in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, however, the Russian military admitted that a number of conscripts ended up in Ukraine and were captured there.

     Russian troops leaving Chernobyl after radiation exposure, Ukraine says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FILE IMAGE - Maxar satellite imagery closeup of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine on March 10, 2022.
Twelve Ukrainian trucks were able to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, but they were all seized by Russian troops, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said late Thursday.
The last Russian troops left the Chernobyl plant early Friday, the Ukrainian government agency responsible for the exclusion zone said.
There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, and the IAEA said it had not been able to confirm the reports of Russian troops receiving high doses.
The Donbas is the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial region where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014.
