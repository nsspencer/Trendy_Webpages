     ‘Morbius’ Review: The Other Bat, Man
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the revelations of “Morbius” — the latest movie to take a marginal Marvel character out of mothballs for his blockbuster close-up — is that regular blood smoothies do wonders for the skin.
Still, the bigger surprise about “Morbius” is that it doesn’t suck, at least as a movie.
As usual, it opens with some temporal scrambling in the present-day Costa Rica, where the adult Morbius (Leto) swoops in on a helicopter, a darkly romantic vision with a curtain of jet-black hair, billowing clothes and hired guns.
There, he embarks on a close encounter with vampire bats, as one does when swimming with dolphins has become too pedestrian.
After a leisurely flashback to his sad childhood, Morbius is back in his New York lab, experimenting and knitting brows alongside a colleague, Monica (Adria Arjona).

     Michael Keaton's Morbius moment is everything terrible about Hollywood's IP decline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As indicated by the trailer, this is what happens in Morbius.
That is until after the film finishes, and we get the first post-credits scene.
There's another post-credits sting, naturally — and this time, we find Morbius driving very fast on a dimly-lit highway.
Bear in mind that for most of the film, Morbius has been sold as a sympathetic anti-hero at worst, if not a somewhat flawed, virtuous protagonist.
That is, after all, why the egregious mining of intellectual property has become Hollywood's default over the last decade and a half.

     Review: 'Morbius'? More like moribund. This is just batty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let me try again: He's a daywalking vampire, but, no, not that cool cat Blade.
“Morbius” is a forgettable, often laughable, entry in Sony’s attempt to fill its own Spider-Man-adjacent cinematic universe, a poorly edited, derivative time suck — pun intended.
What's astonishing is that despite a whole movie, we know very little about Morbius.
At one point, Morbius loses focus as the main guy when Smith's rival character hijacks the film entirely.
“Morbius,” a Sony Pictures release slated for theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language.” Running time: 104 minutes.

     The Morbius movie wants what Venom has
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And a movie that apes Venom without an unpredictable performance at the center, it turns out, is a pretty lousy time.
Like Venom, Morbius spins off a Spider-Man villain into a story that makes him the anti-hero of his own little corner of the world.
Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) is a brilliant scientist with a rare, debilitating blood disease, one that leaves him frail, unable to walk without support, and in regular need of blood transfusions.
Anyone wondering about the specifics of Morbius’ disease or superpowers is better off not trying to parse the film’s thin explanations.
Morbius is what happens when there’s a studio desire for another Venom, but without much thought as to how Venom connected with anyone.

     'Morbius' review: Jared Leto tries bringing Marvel's vampire to life in another Spider-Man villain origin story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —As Marvel movies go, “Morbius” is more a sip than a gulp, a relatively small-boned Jekyll-and-Hyde tale that moves another Spider-Man villain into the spotlight.
Working with another scientist, Martine (Adria Arjona), Morbius has concocted a serum that draws upon the blood of vampire bats.
(Another Spider-Man foe, the Lizard, shares virtually the exact same back story.)
In that context, “Morbius” clears the admittedly low bar for these solo stories.
“Morbius” premieres in US theaters on April 1.

     Morbius is one long quick time event about battling bad habits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, most everything about Morbius, from its plot and pacing to its lead actors’ performances, feels ill-conceived.
And the movie as a whole calls into question Sony’s grand project of building an entire cinematic universe on Spider-Man’s back.
Morbius dives headfirst into the already-in-progress origin story of its titular ghoul, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brilliant scientist and lifelong sufferer of a chronic blood disorder.
All Morbius wants is for you to understand that, batshit as it seems, Morbius’ idea works — at first, just with animal test subjects, but soon, with him as well.
For a time, Morbius attempts to style itself as a horror about a mad scientist battling against the monster of his own making that lives inside him.

     Review: Marvel’s misbegotten ‘Morbius’ is a colossal snore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s no secret the desperate lengths contemporary movies, especially of the comic book variety, rely on VFX to do a film’s emotional heavy lifting.
Daniel Espinosa’s “Morbius,” a misbegotten, artistically bankrupt bid by writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to fuse a gothic horror edge to the MCU, is the nadir of comic book cinema.
AdvertisementUnlike other elongated comic book movies, Espinosa’s flick, clocking in at 108 minutes, features a compact run time.
The problem: Every few hours he needs blood or he’ll revert back to his past state.
