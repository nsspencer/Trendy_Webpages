     ‘Morbius’ Review: The Other Bat, Man
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the revelations of “Morbius” — the latest movie to take a marginal Marvel character out of mothballs for his blockbuster close-up — is that regular blood smoothies do wonders for the skin.
Still, the bigger surprise about “Morbius” is that it doesn’t suck, at least as a movie.
As usual, it opens with some temporal scrambling in the present-day Costa Rica, where the adult Morbius (Leto) swoops in on a helicopter, a darkly romantic vision with a curtain of jet-black hair, billowing clothes and hired guns.
There, he embarks on a close encounter with vampire bats, as one does when swimming with dolphins has become too pedestrian.
After a leisurely flashback to his sad childhood, Morbius is back in his New York lab, experimenting and knitting brows alongside a colleague, Monica (Adria Arjona).

     Morbius Post-Credits Scenes Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Morbius, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is experimenting with a serum derived from vampire bat DNA to cure a rare blood disorder that he suffers from.
Morbius battles Milo under the streets of New York City and eventually kills him, with the heavily-edited film ending rather abruptly at that point and the credits rolling.
In the first scene, we see the skies above New York City crack open with the now-familiar purple light indicating a breach between the universes.
A newscast then announces that he is apparently being set free because in this universe, Toomes has not been charged with any crimes.
In the second scene, we see Morbius driving out to the desert somewhere (obviously he’s not in New York City any longer) and coming to a desolate spot where he gets out and waits.

     Summary: Jared Leto is Marvel's bat-man in the vampiric 'Morbius'Enlarge this image toggle caption Sony Pictures Sony PicturesMarvel Cinematic Universe's latest superhero is not, in the conventional sense, either "super" or a "hero," but he does have an unorthodox ailment and a weird skill-set to separate him from mere mortals.
But Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is looking to capture smaller game as he approaches the mouth of a cave, hobbling with difficulty on two crutch-like canes.
Born with a rare blood disease, Michael Morbius has spent his entire life working on two things — a cure, and origami paper-folding.
One other thing: he now needs to drink human blood every six hours.
Oscar winner Jared Leto transforms into Dr. Michael Morbius.

     Morbius links up with a Spider-Man foe in his movie’s two credits scenes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Morbius has two credits scenes, one for every year that the movie was delayed!
The two scenes are mid-credits scenes — one starts when the movie ends and the other shortly after.
Morbius’s first credits scene features the purple time rift seen in Spider-Man: No Way Home.
We could get our answer about Morbius, Vulture, and their future together soon enough.
We’ll know for sure if a Morbius sequel is announced, but might hear more even sooner if we stick around for the next credits scene concerning one of Spider-Man’s pals.

     Morbius post-credits explained: How Sony's Spider-Man spinoff mangles Marvel's multiverse [Spoilers]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, Morbius has two credits scenes.
The first credits scene begins in the Morbius universe (apparently shared with Venom), but during the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home.
Morbius (Jared Leto) meets Michael Keaton’s MCU Vulture in the end credits scenes of Morbius.
Sony PicturesWhat do the Morbius credits scenes mean for Spider-Man in the MCU?
There’s also the fact that Morbius probably won’t ignite fans, so it’s probable Sony will readjust its “Sony Marvel Universe” depending on the box office of Morbius.

     Morbius is one long quick time event about battling bad habits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, most everything about Morbius, from its plot and pacing to its lead actors’ performances, feels ill-conceived.
And the movie as a whole calls into question Sony’s grand project of building an entire cinematic universe on Spider-Man’s back.
Morbius dives headfirst into the already-in-progress origin story of its titular ghoul, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brilliant scientist and lifelong sufferer of a chronic blood disorder.
All Morbius wants is for you to understand that, batshit as it seems, Morbius’ idea works — at first, just with animal test subjects, but soon, with him as well.
For a time, Morbius attempts to style itself as a horror about a mad scientist battling against the monster of his own making that lives inside him.
