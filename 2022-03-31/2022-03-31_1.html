     'Morbius' is better than 'Venom,' but the villain origin story is still a little anemic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) As Marvel movies go, "Morbius" is more a sip than a gulp, a relatively small-boned Jekyll-and-Hyde tale that moves another Spider-Man villain into the spotlight.
Significantly better than "Venom" but still somewhat lacking in bite, this origin story perhaps inevitably grows more pallid toward the end but until then proves just tasty enough to merit the giving it a shot.
Working with another scientist, Martine (Adria Arjona), Morbius has concocted a serum that draws upon the blood of vampire bats.
But while the human trial gives him extraordinary strength and vitality, it also creates an unquenchable thirst for blood, one that his artificial creation only goes so far in satisfying.
"It's a curse," Morbius says soberly, but it doesn't look that way to his childhood friend Milo ("The Crown's" Matt Smith), who suffers from the same affliction and covets the serum, side effects be damned.

     Summary: When Will 'Morbius' Be Available on Streaming?
This means that the earliest Morbius will be available to stream is probably going to be November 2022.
Will 'Morbius' Be Available on Disney+?
Given Morbius is originally a Marvel character, fans might be wondering if the film will be available to stream on Disney+, the home of Marvel content.
With that being said, Sony's Spider-Man films will eventually be released on Disney's streaming platform.

     Morbius Review: Beware The Bat, Man
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thankfully, the Marvel elements of the film elevate it above your standard vampire flick.
Say what you will about "Morbius," but at least its origins — a Marvel character first published in 1971 with 50 years of storylines — gives this particular vampire some depth.
The Milo character is horribly underwritten — what is his motivation, really, other than to simply be his best self?
Half the time he's onscreen, it seems he's doing some sort of gleeful dance.
It likely isn't his fault ("Morbius" feels like it was edited rather than directed), even if he is credited as an executive producer on the film.

     Review: 'Morbius'? More like moribund. This is just batty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let me try again: He's a daywalking vampire, but, no, not that cool cat Blade.
“Morbius” is a forgettable, often laughable, entry in Sony’s attempt to fill its own Spider-Man-adjacent cinematic universe, a poorly edited, derivative time suck — pun intended.
What's astonishing is that despite a whole movie, we know very little about Morbius.
At one point, Morbius loses focus as the main guy when Smith's rival character hijacks the film entirely.
“Morbius,” a Sony Pictures release slated for theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language.” Running time: 104 minutes.

     ‘Morbius’ Post Credits Scenes Reek Of Desperation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans who have managed to watch the two scenes are not impressed, as the post-credit scenes attempt to merge Sony’s sputtering cinematic universe with the MCU, creating several plot holes along the way.
Anyway, Vulture suggests he and Morbius team up to “do some good,” and implies that they’re going after Spider-Man, for some reason.
Morbius also has no reason to dislike Spider-Man - in fact, it’s not clear if Spidey even exists in this universe.
The multiverse, already a complicated concept, is being muddied by Sony’s desperation to build a rival cinematic universe.
Morbius, however, was always going to be a tougher sell, and casting charisma vacuum Jared Leto as the titular character certainly didn’t help.

     Review: Marvel’s misbegotten ‘Morbius’ is a colossal snore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s no secret the desperate lengths contemporary movies, especially of the comic book variety, rely on VFX to do a film’s emotional heavy lifting.
Daniel Espinosa’s “Morbius,” a misbegotten, artistically bankrupt bid by writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to fuse a gothic horror edge to the MCU, is the nadir of comic book cinema.
AdvertisementUnlike other elongated comic book movies, Espinosa’s flick, clocking in at 108 minutes, features a compact run time.
The problem: Every few hours he needs blood or he’ll revert back to his past state.
