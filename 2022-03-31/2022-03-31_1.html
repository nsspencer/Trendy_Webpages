     'Morbius' is better than 'Venom,' but the villain origin story is still a little anemic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) As Marvel movies go, "Morbius" is more a sip than a gulp, a relatively small-boned Jekyll-and-Hyde tale that moves another Spider-Man villain into the spotlight.
Significantly better than "Venom" but still somewhat lacking in bite, this origin story perhaps inevitably grows more pallid toward the end but until then proves just tasty enough to merit the giving it a shot.
Working with another scientist, Martine (Adria Arjona), Morbius has concocted a serum that draws upon the blood of vampire bats.
But while the human trial gives him extraordinary strength and vitality, it also creates an unquenchable thirst for blood, one that his artificial creation only goes so far in satisfying.
"It's a curse," Morbius says soberly, but it doesn't look that way to his childhood friend Milo ("The Crown's" Matt Smith), who suffers from the same affliction and covets the serum, side effects be damned.

Let me try again: He's a daywalking vampire, but, no, not that cool cat Blade.
“Morbius” is a forgettable, often laughable, entry in Sony’s attempt to fill its own Spider-Man-adjacent cinematic universe, a poorly edited, derivative time suck — pun intended.
What's astonishing is that despite a whole movie, we know very little about Morbius.
At one point, Morbius loses focus as the main guy when Smith's rival character hijacks the film entirely.

     Morbius' Release Won't Be Streaming on Netflix Same Day as Theaters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Confusion around this same-day streaming practice has led to some misguided hope among moviegoers when any new movie hits theaters.
But Morbius is being released exclusively in theaters Friday, without a subscription streaming option.
When is Morbius' streaming release date?
Neither Netflix nor Sony has confirmed a streaming release date for Morbius yet.
So if Sony and Netflix stick with this kind of timeline for Morbius, the movie would start streaming on Netflix sometime between October and the end of this year.

     ‘Morbius’ Is One Of The Worst-Reviewed Superhero Movies Of All Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Morbius SonyI’m not sure anyone expected Jared Leto’s Morbius to be some sort of MCU-level critical hit, but now that the reviews are in for the blockbuster, Morbius is actually one of the worst reviewed superhero movies of the modern era, and down there with some of the lowest scores of all time.
Morbius has a 21% on Rotten Tomatoes, up from a 16% which I saw last night, but still miles below most superhero movies to come out in the last decade, save a few.
Morbius SonyIf you’re wondering why Sony made a Morbius movie in the first place, and are making a bunch of weird Spider-adjacent movies like Kraven and Madame Web, it’s this twisted rights issue where Sony essentially has to keep pumping out Spider-Man IP movies or lose the rights to Marvel.
), Morbius may be a sign of a slate of pretty awful movies to come, unless they can figure out a way to make these relatively obscure villains work onscreen.
Between this and his Joker, I’m not sure many people are going to be recruiting Jared Leto for more superhero movie roles any time soon.

     Review: Marvel’s misbegotten ‘Morbius’ is a colossal snore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s no secret the desperate lengths contemporary movies, especially of the comic book variety, rely on VFX to do a film’s emotional heavy lifting.
Daniel Espinosa’s “Morbius,” a misbegotten, artistically bankrupt bid by writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to fuse a gothic horror edge to the MCU, is the nadir of comic book cinema.
AdvertisementUnlike other elongated comic book movies, Espinosa’s flick, clocking in at 108 minutes, features a compact run time.
The problem: Every few hours he needs blood or he’ll revert back to his past state.

     Summary: Morbius ending explained(Image credit: Sony Pictures Releasing)Morbius sees the titular doctor, Michael Morbius, suffering from a rare blood disease.
Back on land, Morbius' childhood friend, Milo, who also has the same disease, sees Morbius' newfound strength and wants what Morbius has.
Morbius and Milo fight and, eventually, a swarm of bats head Morbius' call, and hold Milo down so Morbius can administer the antibody.
