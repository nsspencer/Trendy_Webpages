     Summary: After previously canceling its in-person E3 2022 event, the ESA has now informed its partners that there will be no digital event equivalent this year either - meaning E3 2022 has fully been canceled.
The news broke via a tweet from Razer PR lead Will Powers, who said that an email had been sent out announcing the cancellation of a digital E3 event.
However, this was canceled in January, with the ESA at the time unable to make a public statement on whether or not there would be a digital equivalent.
"We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer.
The ESA adds that the 2022 showcase has been cancelled so the organization can "focus its resources" on the 2023 show.

     E3 2022 Has Reportedly Been Cancelled
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Update: The ESA has confirmed the cancelation of E3 2022 but has stated that the show will return physically and digitally in 2023.
E3 has been waning in popularity ever since publishers realized they could showcase their games themselves for a fraction of the effort and price.
A few publishers have supported the event, but many have decided that the death of E3 will be sooner rather than later.
This news comes from PR Lead Will Powers who has apparently received an email from the ESA that this year's digital E3 event has been canceled entirely.
This is all conjecture, but the cancellation of E3 this year could be the end of E3 altogether.

     Summary: In a tweet, Will Powers, PR for gaming peripheral manufacturer Razer, said that he received an email stating the digital event was canceled.
It's official, E3 digital is official cancelled for 2022.
However, in January, E3 was once again shifted from an in-person event to an online-only exhibition due to the pandemic.
Now, it seems that the digital event has been completely canceled.
Last week, a number of video game industry professionals reported testing positive for COVID-19 after attending the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

     Summary: The cancellation makes 2022 just the second year in over two-and-a-half decades that an E3 has not taken place.
Sony skipped E3 2021, for instance, and in recent years EA has been hosting EA Play Live around E3 week, but not as part of E3.
We'll be back this year: The 2022 PC Gaming Show is scheduled for this June.
Aside from producing and hosting the yearly Game Awards, Geoff Keighley has also become a big presence during E3 week with the Summer Game Fest.

     Summary: E3 2022 cancelled confirmed.
There will be neither an onsite or digital E3 event this year, as confirmed by Razer PR Lead Will Powers.
Just got an email… It's official, E3 digital is official cancelled for 2022.
E3 2022 has reportedly been cancelled by Will Powers, PR Lead for Razer.
Now, with E3 2022 reportedly cancelled this year, it’s very likely that this is also an end of an era – E3 might never even return again.

     Summary: Pour one out for the “world reveals” and “world exclusives.” E3 won’t happen at all this summer, the Entertainment Software Association said in a statement to Kotaku.
“We previously announced that E3 would not be held in person in 2022 due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19.
Today, we announce that there will also be no digital E3 showcase in 2022,” the ESA said today.
Rumors swirled as early as January that E3 wouldn’t happen this year.
The Summer Game Fest Twitter account, meanwhile, reassured followers that its event will kick off with a live showcase, with details to come.

[Original: Thu 31st Mar, 2022 20:15 BST]It's not hugely surprising, but it seems like E3 is cancelled this year for good.
Not just cancelled as in "we'll do it digital instead", but cancelled cancelled, as in, "no E3 this year at all".
