     ‘Moonshot’ Review: Found in Space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The man is Walt (Cole Sprouse), a guileless, accident-prone barista who yearns to visit Mars, and the woman is Sophie (Lana Condor), an anxious Ph.D. candidate en route to Mars herself.
When Walt stows away on Sophie’s space shuttle, he assumes the identity of her longtime boyfriend Calvin (Mason Gooding), and manages to embroil her in the deception.
Sprouse and Condor’s fraught, teasing dynamic — Sprouse the bumbling doofus with rakish charisma, Condor the irritable perfectionist begrudgingly charmed by him — draws out their natural chemistry.
Sprouse plays it a touch broad, veering sometimes from endearing to goofy.
But Condor is note-perfect, and Winterbauer directs with a light, playful touch, giving the movie an energy that’s nimble and vibrantly sexy.

     Moonshot movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite its charms, “Moonshot” can only offer glimmers: the possibility of its adventure, or that its slightly off-kilter sense of humor that might carry us away.
Sprouse and Condor are the main reason to watch this movie, for their chemistry that also leaves you wanting more.
Sprouse is a little too cozy with his character’s post-Ryan Reynolds motormouth ways, charming any character by forcing his presence upon them.
Condor, meanwhile, is endearing and earnest with her character’s dedication to goals, not realizing they are her boyfriend’s.
An emotional subplot about Sophie feeling a sense of loyalty to her boyfriend, and his family (it’s a long story) doesn’t blossom.

     Review: ‘Moonshot’ Takes Star-crossed Lovers Trope to the Actual Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even with its somewhat trite plot, the film presents Sprouse and Condor in roles that sit just beyond their usual wheelhouses, which is refreshing.
Because Walt and Sophie are personality foils, there is already some inherent will-they-won’t-they tension between the two.
While Condor fits comfortably into every scene, Sprouse unquestionably has more of a talent for the lighthearted moments (everyone say, “Thank you, ‘Suite Life of Zack and Cody’”).
In one beautifully shot scene, Walt and Sophie sit cross-legged in a dimly lit room, poring over a holographic galaxy map with bursts of white, red and blue light overlaying their faces.
“Moonshot” won’t let you forget it takes place in space, and it works—its most compelling quality is the setting.

     ‘Moonshot’ Review: Lana Condor and Cole Sprouse Lead a Sweet Rom-Com that Asks if There’s Love on Mars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A penniless stowaway meets an uptight rich girl aboard a spaceship to Mars in this retro-futuristic YA throwback to classic rom-coms.
﻿Sophie, on the other hand, is smart as can be, but she refuses to color outside the lines.
You can’t even text during takeoff aboard a Southwest Airlines flight that’s wheezing its way out of Reno!
A dramatic spacewalk notwithstanding, most of the trip is adorably quaint in its adherence to basic rom-com conventions.
Of course Sophie and Walt are going to realize that love is the greatest adventure of all, and yet the movie never forces the issue.

     'Moonshot' review: This isn't the out-of-this-world rom-com we hoped for
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite some charming genre-bending, though, Moonshot unfortunately does not deliver on its potential as a bold new future for the modern-day romantic comedy.
What really makes Moonshot a failure to launch in this new era of romantic comedies, though, is its total lack of imagination.
What really makes Moonshot a failure to launch in this new era of romantic comedies, though, is its total lack of imagination.
Aside from its subpar genre-bent twist, Moonshot also rehashes the same tired old rom-com formulas.
Honestly, the most futuristic thing about Moonshot is the inescapable feeling that its script was algorithmically generated by an AI trained on romcoms.
