     Russian troops leaving Chernobyl, Ukrainian nuclear operator says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailRussian troops occupying Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant have begun to leave and move toward Belarus, Ukraine's nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said in a Telegram post Thursday.
Driving the news: Russian troops seized control of the Chernobyl power plant, located about 80 miles north of Kyiv, late last month, in the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that a small fraction of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and the cities of Chernihiv and Sumy were beginning to reposition themselves, with some moving toward Belarus.
The big picture: Energoatom said Russian troops are leaving the Chernobyl plant and other facilities in the Exclusion Zone — the Chernobyl plant's surrounding lands that have high levels of radiation — and only a "small number" of Russians remain at the station.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation.
The IAEA said it was preparing to send its first “assistance and support mission” to Chernobyl in northern Ukraine in the next few days.
In a separate post, Energoatom said the Russian side had formally agreed to hand back to Ukraine the responsibility for protecting Chernobyl.
Ukraine has repeatedly expressed safety concerns about Chernobyl and demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops, whose presence prevented the rotation of personnel for a time.
Asked to comment on the accounts from Chernobyl staff, Russia’s defence ministry did not respond.

     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said Thursday as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts.
The area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing.
In the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel.
Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu have given assurances that conscripts will not take part in the war in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, however, the Russian military admitted that a number of conscripts ended up in Ukraine and were captured there.

The power company, called Energoatom, said in a statement posted to Telegram Thursday that groups of Russian soldiers left the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the satellite city of Slavutych.
"This morning, the invaders announced their intentions to leave the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to Ukrainian station personnel."
According to the company's statement on Telegram, the Russian soldiers "received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness."
The 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant spewed clouds of radioactive material over the surrounding area and emitted 400 times the radioactivity as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
