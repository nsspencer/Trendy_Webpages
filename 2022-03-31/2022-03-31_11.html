     El Paso congressional leaders divided over end of Title 42 border expulsion policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: El Paso-area congressional leaders reacted with divergent opinions to recent reports that the Biden administration is preparing to lift Title 42, a provision of public health law that has been used since 2020 as a way to rapidly expel asylum seekers at the border.
Gonzales’ congressional district stretches over 800 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, from El Paso to Del Rio.
Human Rights First has tracked nearly 10,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape and other violent attacks against people who have been expelled to Northern Mexico under Title 42.
“The use of Title 42, introduced by the Trump Administration, effectively eliminated access to legal asylum in our country,” Escobar said in a press release Thursday.
The El Paso migrant shelter Annunciation House has already begun preparations to receive more migrants in anticipation of the lifting of Title 42, the El Paso Times reported Monday.

     Summary: A former top ICE official is sounding the alarm on the potential end of Title 42, a COVID-era border policy, warning its end could yield additional "chaos" and send a dangerous message to the rest of the world.
WHITE HOUSE ADMITS ENDING TITLE 42 WILL BRING ‘INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THE BORDER'Former Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Ron Vitiello warned on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Thursday the already-high migrant encounters are likely to spike if the policy is rescinded.
"This is going to cause more chaos at our border," Vitiello told co-hosts Ashley Strohmier and Todd Piro.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO END TITLE 42 BORDER POLICY, DESPITE FEARS OF MASSIVE MIGRANT SURGE: REPORTS"This administration has removed the tools that stopped the last major surge at the border that started in 2019 and ended in late in 2020," Vitiello said.
Just this week, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz warned the U.S. is likely to hit one million encounters this fiscal year, as agents have already encountered migrants from 157 countries.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is urging the Biden administration to rethink plans to rescind Title 42 amid reports the White House plans to unwind the Trump-era policy allowing for rapid expulsions at the border while barring migrants from seeking asylum.
Numerous outlets reported Wednesday that the administration plans to rescind the order in some capacity by May 23 — plans Manchin told reporters at the Capitol Thursday that he thinks they should drop“Oh my goodness.
Manchin had previously expressed his opposition to lifting Title 42 — making him one of just a handful of Democrats to do so as President Biden largely faces pressure from within his party to scrap what many see as an illegal and inhumane policy.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, have offered sharper criticism of Biden for maintaining the policy.
“As we have clearly reminded President Biden, we have a moral imperative to live by our values.”

     White House bracing for ‘three-fold’ increase in migration once Title 42 lifted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The Biden administration is making contingency plans to deal with a three-fold increase in migration upon lifting of the Title 42 public health order, a California congresswoman says.
The challenges stem from the expected termination of Title 42 as early as May 23, which could reopen the borders to asylum-seekers.
While Title 42 has been in force, asylum-seekers haven’t been allowed to petition for asylum at U.S. ports of entry.
Chu and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, said they welcome the end of Title 42 despite whatever temporary challenges the change in policy may bring.
Solange Gould, a 25-year public health veteran, agrees that asylum-seekers should be treated better at processing centers.
