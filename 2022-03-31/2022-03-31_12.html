     Sydney Sweeney Recounts What Her Grandparents Said After Seeing ‘Euphoria’ Nude Scenes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During a recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, 24-year-old Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney was asked about her family’s reactions to the hit HBO show—specifically her racy, topless scenes.
“So for the premiere, I invited my entire family and I didn’t really think about [the nude scenes],” Sweeney told DeGeneres.
You’ve got to come!’ And we were all sitting next to each other and [it was a] giant screen, like ginormous screen.
Though Sweeney’s grandparents were seemingly unfazed by her NSFW scenes, her father was apparently left “scarred” after watching the series premiere.
The Emmy-winning series has been picked up for a third season, but HBO has yet to announce a premiere date.
