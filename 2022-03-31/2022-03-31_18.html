     OKC Thunder quotes: Kevin Durant believes the Thunder have to retire his jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In The Ringer’s latest article, Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant disclosed his thoughts on the conversation about whether the Oklahoma City Thunder should retire his jersey No.
“‘OKC has to retire my jersey,’ he continues.
'”Considering Durant is a top-15 player of all time and spent the first nine seasons of his career with the Thunder franchise, it goes without saying that the team will likely retire his jersey in the future.
Even if there are still hard feelings between the fan base and Durant.
The only caveat I’ve seen Thunder fans make regarding retiring Durant’s jersey is that it has to happen after Russell Westbrook gets his number zero retired.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets star is never afraid to fire back at someone’s opinion, whether it is shared online or during a press conference.
During his time with the Golden State Warriors, Durant squared off with media members constantly.
There were several testy moments between Durant and the reporters covering the Warriors.
The narratives drawn about the team didn’t seem to favor Durant and instead made Stephen Curry out to be the main guy.
While Golden State looks to keep contending, Durant and the Nets, the team he is very happy with, are looking to finally reach the Finals.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors achieved a lot of success during Kevin Durant’s time with the organization.
Despite all of the results Durant and the Warriors achieved together, they were far from being free of controversy.
In an interview with The Ringer, Durant explained how he feels the media coverage he received as a member of the Warriors was “unfair” by constantly receiving questions about his free agency plans.
“I thought it was unfair to me and the whole group to even think about anything that was going to happen after the year.
In the end, Durant opted to depart the Warriors to team up with Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets using a sign-and-trade in 2019.
