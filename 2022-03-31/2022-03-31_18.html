     Fox News hires Caitlyn Jenner as contributor, and she debuts tonight on ‘Hannity’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a failed gubernatorial bid last fall, Caitlyn Jenner has found a new gig: She’s been hired as a Fox News contributor.
Jenner, 72, will make her official debut Thursday night on “Hannity,” on which she has appeared before.
Jenner has remained a prominent voice on Twitter, advocated for the transgender community through her Caitlyn Jenner Foundation and called for federal legislation protecting women’s sports.
The “I Am Cait” alum ultimately lost the recall bid, drawing only about 1% of voters last fall.
The political novice was not embraced by the Republican party in her bid to replace Gov.

     Caitlyn Jenner Is Joining Fox News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Heidi Gutman/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty ImagesThe Kardashians launches next month on Hulu, and it is not expected to include former KUWTK mainstay Caitlyn Jenner.
Jenner recently made her disappointment clear, but it sounds like she has a new TV show of her own: Fox News announced today that she will be joining as an on-air contributor.
Transgender Visibility Day, the network announced its plan to make an already visible trans woman much more visible.
Anyway, seems safe to say this Fox News contributor won’t be getting coffee with Lady Gaga anytime soon.
