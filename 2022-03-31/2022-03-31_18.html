     Fox News names Caitlyn Jenner as contributor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fox News Channel named Caitlyn Jenner, a reality star, former Olympian and one time California gubernatorial candidate as a contributor, just as the cable outlet has been focused on discussions about Disney’s efforts in Florida to oppose the “Don’t Say Gay” bill put into law earlier this week.
Jenner is expected to appear on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Thursday evening.
Known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill among critics, it was approved by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis earlier this week, and Fox personalities including Kayleigh McEnany are among those who have criticized Disney.
According to research from Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog organization, Fox News has mentioned the Disney matter on air at least 250 times since Wednesday morning.
Jenner ran in for governor last year during California recall election, but won just 1% of the vote.

     Fox News Touts Caitlyn Jenner as an 'Inspiration,' Announces She's Hired
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Olympic athlete and unsuccessful California Republican gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner will join Fox News as a contributor, touting her as an "inspiration" and "a trailblazer in the LGBTQ+ community," the network announced on Thursday.
Similarly, Fox News has faced substantial criticism for segments and commentary that many in the LGBTQ+ community view as anti-trans or opposed to their equal treatment in U.S. society.
She married Kris Jenner in 1991.
Kris and Caitlyn Jenner separated in 2013 and finalized their divorce in early 2016.
In its Thursday press release, Fox News described Jenner "as the most famous transgender woman in the world."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Heidi Gutman/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty ImagesThe Kardashians launches next month on Hulu, and it is not expected to include former KUWTK mainstay Caitlyn Jenner.
Jenner recently made her disappointment clear, but it sounds like she has a new TV show of her own: Fox News announced today that she will be joining as an on-air contributor.
Transgender Visibility Day, the network announced its plan to make an already visible trans woman much more visible.
Anyway, seems safe to say this Fox News contributor won’t be getting coffee with Lady Gaga anytime soon.
