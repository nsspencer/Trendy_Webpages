     Fox News names Caitlyn Jenner as contributor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fox News Channel named Caitlyn Jenner, a reality star, former Olympian and one time California gubernatorial candidate as a contributor, just as the cable outlet has been focused on discussions about Disney’s efforts in Florida to oppose the “Don’t Say Gay” bill put into law earlier this week.
Jenner is expected to appear on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Thursday evening.
Known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill among critics, it was approved by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis earlier this week, and Fox personalities including Kayleigh McEnany are among those who have criticized Disney.
According to research from Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog organization, Fox News has mentioned the Disney matter on air at least 250 times since Wednesday morning.
Jenner ran in for governor last year during California recall election, but won just 1% of the vote.

     Fox News hires Caitlyn Jenner as contributor, and she debuts tonight on ‘Hannity’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a failed gubernatorial bid last fall, Caitlyn Jenner has found a new gig: She’s been hired as a Fox News contributor.
Jenner, 72, will make her official debut Thursday night on “Hannity,” on which she has appeared before.
Jenner has remained a prominent voice on Twitter, advocated for the transgender community through her Caitlyn Jenner Foundation and called for federal legislation protecting women’s sports.
The “I Am Cait” alum ultimately lost the recall bid, drawing only about 1% of voters last fall.
The political novice was not embraced by the Republican party in her bid to replace Gov.

     Caitlyn Jenner Is Joining Fox News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Heidi Gutman/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty ImagesThe Kardashians launches next month on Hulu, and it is not expected to include former KUWTK mainstay Caitlyn Jenner.
Jenner recently made her disappointment clear, but it sounds like she has a new TV show of her own: Fox News announced today that she will be joining as an on-air contributor.
Transgender Visibility Day, the network announced its plan to make an already visible trans woman much more visible.
Anyway, seems safe to say this Fox News contributor won’t be getting coffee with Lady Gaga anytime soon.
