     Summary: Bobby Wagner signing with Rams, how does his contract stack up?
originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoThe Los Angeles Rams are once again loading up on star talent.
After losing Von Miller in free agency to the Buffalo Bills, the Rams reportedly will sign linebacker Bobby Wagner to a five-year, $50 million deal worth up to $65 million.
Last season they added Matthew Stafford, Von Miller and Odell Beckham Jr. before winning the Super Bowl.
Los Angeles is betting that Wagner -- an L.A. native -- still has plenty left in the tank after 10 exceptional seasons in Seattle.
