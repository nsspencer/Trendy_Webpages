     Summary: A former top ICE official is sounding the alarm on the potential end of Title 42, a COVID-era border policy, warning its end could yield additional "chaos" and send a dangerous message to the rest of the world.
WHITE HOUSE ADMITS ENDING TITLE 42 WILL BRING ‘INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THE BORDER'Former Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Ron Vitiello warned on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Thursday the already-high migrant encounters are likely to spike if the policy is rescinded.
"This is going to cause more chaos at our border," Vitiello told co-hosts Ashley Strohmier and Todd Piro.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO END TITLE 42 BORDER POLICY, DESPITE FEARS OF MASSIVE MIGRANT SURGE: REPORTS"This administration has removed the tools that stopped the last major surge at the border that started in 2019 and ended in late in 2020," Vitiello said.
Just this week, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz warned the U.S. is likely to hit one million encounters this fiscal year, as agents have already encountered migrants from 157 countries.

     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is urging the Biden administration to rethink plans to rescind Title 42 amid reports the White House plans to unwind the Trump-era policy allowing for rapid expulsions at the border while barring migrants from seeking asylum.
Numerous outlets reported Wednesday that the administration plans to rescind the order in some capacity by May 23 — plans Manchin told reporters at the Capitol Thursday that he thinks they should drop“Oh my goodness.
Manchin had previously expressed his opposition to lifting Title 42 — making him one of just a handful of Democrats to do so as President Biden largely faces pressure from within his party to scrap what many see as an illegal and inhumane policy.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, have offered sharper criticism of Biden for maintaining the policy.
“As we have clearly reminded President Biden, we have a moral imperative to live by our values.”

     We're expecting a big increase in migrants at the US-Mexico border. But this time is different. Here's why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) More migrants are coming to the US-Mexico border, and officials say they expect the number to grow.
The policy is known as Title 42 for the US code invoked in its implementation, and its days may be numbered.
Officials appear to be giving themselves a cushion to plan for the possibility that the number of migrants at the border will significantly increase.
Migrants and asylum seekers march in Tijuana to protest the Title 42 policy on March 21.
But Pinheiro told CNN last week she was concerned administration officials haven't done more to include advocates in their plans.

     Border communities unprepared for end of Title 42, lawmakers say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Title 42 is a public health rule allowing border agents to immediately expel newly arrived migrants deemed inadmissible.
Ted Cruz and John Cornyn – both Republicans – fear that doing away with Title 42 will encourage more illegal migration to the United States.
“We urge that Title 42 remain in place until such time as the number of apprehensions along the Southwest border drops to a manageable level,” the lawmakers wrote.
(photo courtesy U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas)“If the Biden administration does away with title 42 you will see these historic numbers double overnight,” he said.
The administration is also feeling pressure from immigrant advocacy groups, who say there’s no medical basis to keep Title 42 in place anymore, given a worldwide drop in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
