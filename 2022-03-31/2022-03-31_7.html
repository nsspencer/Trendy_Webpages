     Jordan Poole dooms Warriors with premature half-court shot in loss to Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors guard launched a half-court shot while double-teamed with four seconds still to go in Wednesday’s 107-103 loss to the Suns — which left fans wondering why he’d take a Hail Mary shot early on in the possession.
Poole — who recorded a career-high 38 points to go with nine rebounds and seven assists in the Western Conference thriller — explained his shot after the game.
“Probably get three free throws,” Poole said.
There was a guy in the middle and a guy on the half court line.

     Warriors' Jordan Poole drops season-high 38 points vs. Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Steph Curry missing time due to injury, Jordan Poole has continued to answer the bell for the Golden State Warriors’ offense.
On Wednesday against the league-best Phoenix Suns, the third-year guard stayed hot with another impressive performance.
After the Warriors’ offense came out quiet, Poole quickly provided an instant boost with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting from the floor with three triples and two assists in the first quarter alone.
Behind Poole, the Warriors were able to steal an early lead against the defending Western Conference champions.
With his best Curry impression, Poole buried seven triples on 15 attempts from beyond the arc.

     Jordan Poole's half-court heave vs. Suns was right play, wrong result
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Poole's heave had many Warriors fans ringing their hands on social media as Golden State lost their sixth game in seven tries with Steph Curry sidelined.
The Suns rank in the top 10 in free-throw percentage as a team, hitting at an almost 80 percent clip.
As Poole dribbled toward Crowder and Booker, the two Suns baited the Warriors guard into thinking they were going to foul him.
But Poole didn't wait long enough and Booker was able to drop his hands as Poole started the half-court prayer.
Right play, wrong outcome for Poole and the sliding Warriors.
