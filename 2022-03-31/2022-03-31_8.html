     Summary: HARLINGEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — In celebration of César Chávez Day, President Biden continued the fight for the rights and dignity of working people, fulfilling the promise of America for all Americans.
Biden urged congress to pass two bills, aiding in the fight.
Born into poverty and raised by migrant workers, César Chávez dedicated his life to improving conditions for workers across the country.
Chávez drew national attention to the many agricultural workers who experienced inhumane working conditions and unlivable wages when he founded the United Farm Workers of America.
These bills will allow farmworkers to bargain collectively, obtain legal status, and have better working conditions.

     Summary: […] The time has come for the liberation of the poor farm workers.” Cesar Chavez, Plan of DelanoCesar Chavez day has been celebrated as a national holiday since 2014, but many people have misconceptions about what he did and believed.
After initially working for the Community Service Organization and the National Farm Labor Union, in 1963 Cesar Chavez joined with CSO colleague Dolores Huerta.
Together they founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) to organize Mexican American agricultural workers in Kern County and the surrounding area.
Chavez was far from the first Latino-American to play a significant role in the labor movement.
Inspired by the Synanon new-religious movement, Chavez implemented a practice known as “The Game,” which subjected members to purges, as well as intrusive and abusive practices.
