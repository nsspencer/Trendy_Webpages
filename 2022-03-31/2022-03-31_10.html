    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thursday marks three years since the killing of LA rap artist and activist Nipsey Hussle, who was shot March 31, 2019 at age 33 outside his clothing store.
The young star's message and legacy can still be seen throughout LA, where dozens of murals portray his likeness.
As a young man, Douglas had "seen where he was headed -- he was looking for acceptance," which he says often leads to gang involvement.
"I watched him grow from a young man to a man," he said.
The LA County coroner would later find one bullet went into his skull and another into his spine, severing it.
