     Why Chris Pine Pretended to Be Chris Evans at 2022 Oscars Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Chris Pine Dishes on Working With Director Patty Jenkins AgainJust his luck—Chris Pine had an interesting encounter at one of the 2022 Oscars after-parties.
During a March 30 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the Wonder Woman 1984 actor, 41, shared that he was mistaken for a popular ‘90s star at the party on March 27.
"Well, I was at one and I was about to go, and this guy stopped me," he told host Jimmy Kimmel.
"And he's like, ‘Joey Lawrence,'" Chris continued, replying to the man, "'Not quite, but thank you.'
Chris continued.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Pine— America’s best Chris who far surpasses rivals Evans, Pratt, and, of course, Hemsworth —was one of Jimmy Kimmel’s guests last night, and it was pretty damn delightful.
Not that we are surprised in any way (see previous sentence regarding our Chris rankings), but the chat itself revealed some unexpected trivia about the actor’s Hollywood lineage.
Then there’s Pine’s own mom, Gwynne Gilford , who popped up in wonderfully titled schlock such as Beware!
“They’d obviously just discovered zoom [camera shots],” Pine says after watching a clip from the former flick for the first time.

     Chris Pine told a confused Oscars partygoer that he was Chris Evans of 'Captain America'

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Many know Chris Pine as the blue-eyed, Captain Kirk-portraying member of the Hollywood Chrises (other members: Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt).
A partygoer at an Oscars shindig over the weekend knew him as ... Joey Lawrence?
Pine, in a Wednesday appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live," recounted to Kimmel that after the partygoer mistook him for the "Blossom" actor and musician, he eventually fibbed and told him he was in fact Chris Evans, who played Captain America in many a Marvel film.
It's hardly the first time Pine's been called another male celebrity's name, he said.
"I've gotten Ryan Reynolds, [Chris] Pratt, [Chris] Hemsworth, Matt Damon," said Pine, making his bid for "best dressed Chris" in a blush, embroidered button-down, striped maroon-and-white pants and smoking slippers.

     Summary: Cast out from professional employment, a reluctant but desperate man turns to a life of precarious gig work.
This leaves James in the same place as many of his fellow soldiers: in debt, desperate, drug-addicted, and unfit for civilian life.
After the death of a friend, James reunites with Army buddy Mike (Ben Foster), who tries to recruit him into private work.
Rusty, like Mike, assures James the contract work is lucrative, easy, and quick — a two-week job in Berlin.
But that kind of reckoning is only to be found in the margins of “The Contractor”; the rest is percussively-scored chase sequences.
