     Summary: “There are no longer any outsiders on the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, said on Facebook.
The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, also confirmed that it had been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces handed control of the power plant and “moved convoys of troops”.
#Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 Feb have, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops.

Earlier on Thursday, the head of Energoatom urged the UN nuclear watchdog to help ensure Russian nuclear officials do not interfere in the operation of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which is also occupied by Russian soldiers.

     Russians leave Chernobyl; Ukraine braces for renewed attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counterattacks to the east and northeast of Kyiv, the ministry said.
Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies in a dozen buses that were trying to make it to Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.
The last Russian troops left Chernobyl early Friday, the Ukrainian government agency responsible for the exclusion zone said.
Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site in the opening stages of the Feb. 24 invasion, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation.
At a Ukrainian military checkpoint outside Kyiv, soldiers and officers said they don’t believe Russian forces have given up on the capital.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The site of the 1986 nuclear disaster doesn’t have any active reactors, but serves as Ukraine’s nuclear waste facility.
After Russian troops first took charge of Chernobyl in late February, the plant had suffered a five-day-long blackout.
When Russian troops first entered the 30km-wide exclusion zone surrounding Chernobyl, sensors noted a 10-fold rise in gamma radiation.
According to Yaroslav Yemelianenko, who runs tourist trips into the exclusion zone, several Russian soldiers were taken to a hospital in Belarus.
The IAEA said it was unable to confirm reports that Russian soldiers had received high doses of radiation.

     Ukraine power company says Russians are leaving Chernobyl site after radiation exposure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said Thursday as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts.
The area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing.
In the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel.
Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu have given assurances that conscripts will not take part in the war in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, however, the Russian military admitted that a number of conscripts ended up in Ukraine and were captured there.
