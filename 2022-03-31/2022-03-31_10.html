     César Chávez Day: Farmworkers announce they will retrace historic 1966 march
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I don't want to continue seeing people treat farmworkers as if they were inferior.
Gavin Newsom proclaimed March 31, 2022, as César Chávez Day on what would have been the activist's 95th birthday.
On Thursday, many remember Chávez's work and legacy, and they're also taking time to remind Californians that farmworkers deserve equal rights.
If other workers have those rights, farmworkers deserve those rights, too," said Teresa Romero, president of United Farm Workers.
Farmworkers gathered throughout 13 locations including Sacramento and Modesto, to announce that they'll be retracing a march from Delano to Sacramento – the historic trek that Chávez led in 1966 and where the movement for social justice was founded.
