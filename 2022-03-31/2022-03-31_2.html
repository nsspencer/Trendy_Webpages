     Jordan Poole was trying 'Chris Paul trick' on perplexing half-court shot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors found themselves down three with less than 10 seconds left when Jordan Poole brought the ball up the court and launched from half court.
After the loss, head coach Steve Kerr explained that the Suns baited the third-year guard into the shot, believing he was going to be fouled.
"Jordan was trying the Chris Paul trick," Kerr told reporters after the game.
"Where, you know they are going to foul, so as they reach you go up, and they pulled back so they didn't foul him."
"Probabaly get three free throws," Poole continued when asked what his aim was with the shot.

     Summary: The Warriors guard launched a half-court shot while double-teamed with four seconds still to go in Wednesday’s 107-103 loss to the Suns — which left fans wondering why he’d take a Hail Mary shot early on in the possession.

“Probably get three free throws,” Poole said.
There was a guy in the middle and a guy on the half court line.
