     Bobby Wagner contract: All-Pro linebacker agrees to five-year, $50 million deal with Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two weeks after All-Pro linebacker Von Miller signed with the Bills, the Rams appear to have found themselves another one.
Los Angeles has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $50 million deal with linebacker Bobby Wagner, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Wagner has spent his entire 10-year career with the Seahawks after being selected in the second round by Seattle in 2012.
Wagner has earned six first-team All-Pro selections and two second-team nods, with eight Pro Bowl appearances.
He finishes his career with the Seahawks nearly 1,400 tackles, 68 tackles for loss, 11 interceptions and nine fumble recoveries in 151 games.

     BREAKING: Rams Signing LB Bobby Wagner To Five-Year, $50M Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Adam Schefter, the Rams and LB Bobby Wagner have agreed to terms on a five-year deal worth $50 million.
It’s worth mentioning that signing him to a contract won’t impact a team’s 2023 compensatory picks, given that he was released this offseason.
Wagner, 31, is a former second-round pick by the Seahawks out of Utah State in the 2012 NFL Draft.
He was entering the final year of his four-year, $43 million deal and set to earn a base salary of $10.5 million in 2019 when he agreed to a new three-year, $54 million deal.
Wagner was entering the final year of that deal in 2022 and scheduled to make a base salary of $16.35 million when the Seahawks released him.

     Bobby Wagner signing big Rams deal after messy Seahawks split
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner is out of Seattle, but he’s sticking around the NFC West.
The former Seahawks linebacker — who was cut this month after 10 years with the team — is signing a $50 million deal with his former rival, the now-Super Bowl champion Rams.
Wagner, an eight-time Pro Bowler, has agreed to a five-year contract with the Rams that’s worth up to $65 million, ESPN reported Thursday.
Originally drafted by the Seahawks 47th overall in 2012, Wagner earned his first and only Super Bowl victory with the team following their win over the Broncos in Feb. 2014.
Wagner, a Los Angeles native, will now join Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey, among the Rams’ other superstars, as they look for a Super Bowl repeat for 2022.

     Rams shouldn't lose too much sleep if Bobby Wagner signs elsewhere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner’s free agency decision might be imminent, if Richard Sherman’s teasing tweet is to be believed.
He’s drawn interest from the Rams, Ravens and Cowboys since the Seahawks cut him, though Dallas is reportedly out of the running now.
So it would seem to be down to the Rams and Ravens, both of which are good options for the six-time All-Pro linebacker.
The Rams would love to have him in the middle of their defense, with Sean McVay and Les Snead admitting as much.
But they shouldn’t lose too much sleep if he picks the Ravens (or another team).

     Summary: Marcus Williams and the Ravens Are a Perfect Scheme FitSafety Marcus Williams signing with the Ravens was named one of the most interesting scheme fits after the initial wave of free agency by Pro Football Focus' Seth Galina.
… The Ravens have been a high safety team for quite a while under former Defensive Coordinator Don 'Wink' Martindale.
On 50% of their calls they showed a one-high safety look pre-snap and then played a one-high safety defense post-snap.
This is who they've been for so long, and that fit would have been perfect for Marcus Williams.
Where it gets interesting is with new Defensive Coordinator Mike MacDonald in the fold."
