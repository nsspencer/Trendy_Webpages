    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday night, with the Milwaukee Bucks up against another Eastern Conference contender in the Brooklyn Nets, Giannis somehow managed to one-up himself, and once again saved the day.
He finished with 44 points, 14 rebounds and six assists on 14-of-21 from the field and 15-of-19 from the line to lead the Bucks to a 120-119 win in overtime.
Then, in the closing seconds of of overtime, Giannis once again delivered.
Milwaukee has now won four of their last five games, and 12-of-15 overall to improve to 48-28 on the season.
But with Giannis leading the way, and a championship to defend, it's hard to imagine the Bucks care much about who's in their path.

     Summary: “It’s cool,” he acknowledged a few games before he broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s franchise scoring mark Thursday night on a step-back three-pointer over Brooklyn center Andre Drummond with 18 seconds left in the fourth quarter.
It took Antetokounmpo 652 games in nine seasons to surpass Abdul-Jabbar’s mark of 14,211, set in 467 games over six seasons from 1969-1975.
“Geez, that’s insane,” said Bucks center Brook Lopez, who came into the league in 2008 as a post-oriented center.
Unless Giannis can slip in there and win one or two more championships, then he may surface above Kareem!"
“For Giannis to be in the position he is, with this franchise, and Kareem’s record – that’s freakin’ amazing.

     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo loved the fact that he became Milwaukee’s career scoring leader on a 3-pointer, so nobody can say he’s just a dunker anymore.
The defending NBA champions clinched a return to the postseason with the win, in which Antetokounmpo had 44 points, 14 rebounds and six assists.
Kevin Durant had 26 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds for the Nets, but missed a 3-pointer that would have won it.
Antetokounmpo came into the game 39 points behind Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA’s career scoring leader who had 14,211 points after beginning his career in Milwaukee.
The Bucks and Nets could be headed for a first-round matchup this year.

     Summary: But it’s been a funny sort of season for the Milwaukee Bucks thus far.
So what kind of shape are the Milwaukee Bucks in as the season comes to a close?
Can the Milwaukee Bucks regain their defensive prowess?
As it currently stands, the Milwaukee Bucks’ defensive rating of 110.4 points given up per 100 possessions is tied for 13th in the league.
If there’s one takeaway from this stat, it’s that Brook Lopez hasn’t gotten into his final form yet this season.

     Summary: On Tuesday night, the Brooklyn Nets played host to the Detroit Pistons at Barclays Center.
The last time Kyrie Irving saw the Bucks in Barclays Center, he was helping open up a can of whoop ass that had the Bucks as down as 49 points.
The Nets need Irving to regain his shot and in a hurry so they can move up in the standings.
The Bucks are second in pace post All Star break and the Nets have made it a point to play with more pace.
Antetokuonmpo does everything for the Bucks and will look to bulldoze the Nets on the inside.
