     Rams shouldn't lose too much sleep if Bobby Wagner signs elsewhere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner’s free agency decision might be imminent, if Richard Sherman’s teasing tweet is to be believed.
He’s drawn interest from the Rams, Ravens and Cowboys since the Seahawks cut him, though Dallas is reportedly out of the running now.
So it would seem to be down to the Rams and Ravens, both of which are good options for the six-time All-Pro linebacker.
The Rams would love to have him in the middle of their defense, with Sean McVay and Les Snead admitting as much.
But they shouldn’t lose too much sleep if he picks the Ravens (or another team).

    </h2>

     Summary: Marcus Williams and the Ravens Are a Perfect Scheme FitSafety Marcus Williams signing with the Ravens was named one of the most interesting scheme fits after the initial wave of free agency by Pro Football Focus' Seth Galina.
… The Ravens have been a high safety team for quite a while under former Defensive Coordinator Don 'Wink' Martindale.
On 50% of their calls they showed a one-high safety look pre-snap and then played a one-high safety defense post-snap.
This is who they've been for so long, and that fit would have been perfect for Marcus Williams.
Where it gets interesting is with new Defensive Coordinator Mike MacDonald in the fold."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Rams lost pass rusher Von Miller to the Buffalo Bills, Wagner won't be filling that void.
As Miller is a terror off the edge, Wagner remains one of the game's foremost off-ball linebackers, a tackling machine whose production hasn't waned with age.
Wagner, 31, was a Pro Bowler in 2021 as he rattled off a career-high 170 tackles.
A six-time All-Pro in Seattle, Wagner has produced 10 consecutive 100-plus-tackle seasons and has twice led the league.
The GM has discussed an extension for Donald and maintained interest in wide receiver Odell Beckham﻿.

     Rams To Sign LB Bobby Wagner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner has made his decision, and the Rams will add another future Hall of Famer to their defense.
After visiting the Rams last week, Wagner will sign a deal worth $50MM.
Wagner visited both the Rams and Ravens but will stay in the NFC West to join the Super Bowl champions’ Aaron Donald– and Jalen Ramsey-led defense.
Although the Legion of Boom received the most attention on the Seahawks’ Super Bowl defenses, Wagner began his Canton-caliber ascent for those teams.
Wagner’s Rams deal runs closer to the 2015 extension, a four-year, $43MM pact that topped the linebacker market at the time.
