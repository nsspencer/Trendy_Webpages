     Harry Styles, 'As It Was'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles, 'As It Was'YouTubeHarry Styles' "As It Was" bottles sunshine in a song, but with a dreary melancholy.
If you are sorely missing the reign of Tumblr music — think The XX, Passion Pit — then this is absolutely the song for you.
Styles slips in autobiography, too, perhaps the closest he's ever been to directly addressing his love life.
Whereas Fine Line was coy in its references to heavy themes like loss, depression and drug use, this single seems to signal Styles' willingness to confront those topics head on, pretty unapologetically.
If this is Harry Styles inviting us into his metaphorical home, it seems like it's a lot messier and more complicated than he's ever let on.

     Harry Styles Trades Classic Rock for Synth-Pop in New Single and Video, ‘As It Was’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles has used his solo career to lean into the music of bygone decades before, with his first two albums heavily drenched in the rock singer-songwriter stylings of the ’70s.
His new single, too, has a flair for music as it was — but it’s far from a rerun of those previous albums.
“As It Was,” released late Thursday, sounds like it has its roots in the synth-pop of the 1980s.
What may really blind some fans is the “As It Was” music video and its generous offerings of Styles’ torso, in a tank top and eventually without it.
“As It Was” is the first single from “Harry’s House,” which the singer announced only three days prior will be coming with a May 20, 2022 release date.

     Harry Styles’ ‘As It Was’ is Nakedly Vulnerable — and Unlike Anything He’s Done Before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

He sings about facing up to personal transitions, with the chorus “In this world it’s just us/You know it’s not the same as it was.”It’s a daring change-up for Styles, unlike anything he’s done before musically.
It’s the first taste from his astounding new Harry’s House, which is even better than you hope it is.
