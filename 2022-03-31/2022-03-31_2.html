     Movie review: Chris Pine excels as veteran who enters world of private security in ‘The Contractor’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Pine slips into his best spy-wear for Tarik Saleh’s “The Contractor,” a character study (cloaked as a thriller) of a U.S. Army Ranger who tries his hand in the murky world of private security.
When James lands in Berlin, “The Contractor” transforms from an American family drama into a Euro spy thriller.
It’s a well-oiled mission, executed in low voices and quiet movements, but as the mission changes, and the scientist begs for his life and family, James’ eyes start darting around behind his balaclava, doubt creeping in.
There is a bleak poetry to Davis’ script, as the men of this world reckon with the things they’ve done as lifelong warriors.
Every moment Foster is on screen as the unpredictable Mike is electrifying, and the chemistry Pine and Foster create in their wounded, yet loyal brotherhood is undeniable.
