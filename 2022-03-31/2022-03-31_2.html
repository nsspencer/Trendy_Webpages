     Kyrie Irving's Status For Bucks-Nets Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are hosting the Milwaukee Bucks in New York at Barclays Center on Thursday evening, and for the game they will have their superstar Kyrie Irving available.
Irving is not on the injury report (see tweet below), and he is now eligible to play in home games.
The former Duke star had originally began playing this season as a part-time player; only allowed to play in road games.
However, the city of New York lifted their vaccine mandate for performers and pro athletes earlier this month.
Therefore, this will be Irving's third home game of the season.

     Report: Harden told Durant last summer he would sign extension with Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets had put a max extension in front of Harden — three years, $161.1 million — and Durant believed Harden would sign it because Harden told KD he would, reports Logan Murdock at The Ringer.
They went on a trip to Greece this past summer, and the guard twice reassured Durant that he’d sign an extension to stay in Brooklyn long term, according to league sources.
Irving now says he has no plans to leave Durant and the Nets.
Not so much with Harden, although maybe at the time he and Durant talked last summer Harden believed he was staying long term.
None of that is what Durant envisioned when he signed that extension back in August.

So it’s not to downplay the potency of the Nets with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
But I talk about like, the volatility index, right?
But the volatility, if you look at all the teams that we would consider contenders because of their talent, and then you consider all the caveats you would put there, the volatility, the Nets have more volatility than anyone, and have all season, right?
They have been dealing with a Nets team, up until now, that has been two different versions of the Nets.

     James Harden assured Kevin Durant he would re-sign with Nets, per report, contradicting his media-day comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 2021 playoffs, Harden ripped his hamstring 43 seconds into Game 1 of the conference semifinals against the Milwaukee Bucks.
This was a shift, apparently, from what Harden had told Durant last summer after the Nets' elimination.
According to The Ringer, Harden "twice reassured Durant that he'd sign an extension to stay in Brooklyn long term" when traveling together in Greece.
Perhaps the old Durant would've been bitter about Harden going back on what he's reportedly told him.
It worked out for the best for both sides, really, with the Sixers getting the Simmons mess off their plate, so who really cares what Harden told Durant in Greece.

The Nets need Irving to regain his shot and in a hurry so they can move up in the standings.
The Bucks are second in pace post All Star break and the Nets have made it a point to play with more pace.
Antetokuonmpo does everything for the Bucks and will look to bulldoze the Nets on the inside.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Moke HamiltonAll things considered, the Brooklyn Nets should consider themselves fortunate to have gotten a player of Ben Simmons’ caliber in exchange for James Harden.
At some point, the Nets may need to do the responsible and sensible thing and rule the young point guard out for the remainder of the season, for the good of the team and the player.
Since Simmons’ arrival in Brooklyn, the Nets have been cryptic in the information they’ve provided on his availability, or lack thereof.
Knowing that there’s a bigger picture at stake in Brooklyn, the Nets at some point will need to be responsible and rule Simmons out.
When Simmons arrived in Brooklyn, it was thought to signify the beginning of a new era for the Nets.

     Summary: In the final regular season game against a title-contender, the Brooklyn Nets fell just short of a needed win but it was a preview of what could come in the NBA Playoffs.
With 6:37 left, Mills’ triple grew the Nets' lead to 11 (50-39) after an 8-0 burst.
pic.twitter.com/xVU5vdwr1v — Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) April 1, 2022On the night, Milwaukee enjoyed a 57-to-41 advantage on the glass.
Finally, defensive discipline — which admittedly was not an enormous problem in last year’s problem — doomed the Nets against the Bucks.
