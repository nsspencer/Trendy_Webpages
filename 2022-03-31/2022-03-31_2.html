     Jordan Poole dooms Warriors with premature half-court shot in loss to Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors guard launched a half-court shot while double-teamed with four seconds still to go in Wednesday’s 107-103 loss to the Suns — which left fans wondering why he’d take a Hail Mary shot early on in the possession.
Poole — who recorded a career-high 38 points to go with nine rebounds and seven assists in the Western Conference thriller — explained his shot after the game.
“Probably get three free throws,” Poole said.
There was a guy in the middle and a guy on the half court line.

     Warriors get defensive, but lose close one to Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Golden State looked as good as it did when it possessed the league’s best defense earlier this season during its 107-103 loss to the Phoenix Suns at Chase Center.
The Warriors reclaimed their defensive identity, getting nine steals and putting constant pressure on the Suns.
“It was a great performance in terms of our defense and our energy and just the fight from start to finish.
Poole hit four consecutive free throws in two trips to the line in the final minute to give the Warriors a one-point advantage.
But Wednesday’s close loss to the league’s best team was a reminder of just how good this team can be if they put the pieces together.
