     Kyrie Irving's Status For Bucks-Nets Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are hosting the Milwaukee Bucks in New York at Barclays Center on Thursday evening, and for the game they will have their superstar Kyrie Irving available.
Irving is not on the injury report (see tweet below), and he is now eligible to play in home games.
The former Duke star had originally began playing this season as a part-time player; only allowed to play in road games.
However, the city of New York lifted their vaccine mandate for performers and pro athletes earlier this month.
Therefore, this will be Irving's third home game of the season.

     Report: Harden told Durant last summer he would sign extension with Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets had put a max extension in front of Harden — three years, $161.1 million — and Durant believed Harden would sign it because Harden told KD he would, reports Logan Murdock at The Ringer.
They went on a trip to Greece this past summer, and the guard twice reassured Durant that he’d sign an extension to stay in Brooklyn long term, according to league sources.
Irving now says he has no plans to leave Durant and the Nets.
Not so much with Harden, although maybe at the time he and Durant talked last summer Harden believed he was staying long term.
None of that is what Durant envisioned when he signed that extension back in August.

     NBA Live Thread: Brooklyn Nets vs. Milwaukee Bucks, 7:30 PM EST
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’m sure I keep sounding like a broken record at this point, but the Brooklyn Nets need to play each game like it’s a must-win.
WHO: Brooklyn Nets (40-36) vs. Milwaukee Bucks (47-28)WHEN: 7:30 p.m. ESTWHERE: TNT (national), YES (local), WFAN-FM/AM (radio)Game Preview.
As Kevin Durant goes, so goes the Nets.
Durant is impossible to stop so the Bucks hope to play physical and try to get him off his game.
He missed the last Bucks matchup so it’ll be interesting to see how Mike Budenholzer and the Bucks staff adjust to the challenge.

     Summary: Where do you see the Nets right now?
So it’s not to downplay the potency of the Nets with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
But I talk about like, the volatility index, right?
But the volatility, if you look at all the teams that we would consider contenders because of their talent, and then you consider all the caveats you would put there, the volatility, the Nets have more volatility than anyone, and have all season, right?
They have been dealing with a Nets team, up until now, that has been two different versions of the Nets.

     Nets' Bruce Brown hopes to avoid repeat of last year’s anemic playoff effort
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As he hoisted countless jump shots during his offseason training, Bruce Brown kept one motivating thought in the back of his head.
Brook Lopez, who drew Brown during the playoff series, missed that game for the Bucks but was set to play at Barclays Center on Thursday.
NBAE via Getty ImagesBruce Brown was just 2-for-9 from 3 in last year’s playoff series against the Bucks.
But the Nets are not talking like an underdog hoping for a puncher’s chance of making a deep playoff run.
“I think whoever came out of that series was going to win the championship,” Brown said, “and they came out of that series.”

     At Some Point, Nets May Be Wise To Rule Ben Simmons Out For Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Moke HamiltonAll things considered, the Brooklyn Nets should consider themselves fortunate to have gotten a player of Ben Simmons’ caliber in exchange for James Harden.
At some point, the Nets may need to do the responsible and sensible thing and rule the young point guard out for the remainder of the season, for the good of the team and the player.
Since Simmons’ arrival in Brooklyn, the Nets have been cryptic in the information they’ve provided on his availability, or lack thereof.
Knowing that there’s a bigger picture at stake in Brooklyn, the Nets at some point will need to be responsible and rule Simmons out.
When Simmons arrived in Brooklyn, it was thought to signify the beginning of a new era for the Nets.

Fighting to keep pace atop the East, Milwaukee will try to push Brooklyn further down the standings as they jockey for play-in position.
With a back-to-back tomorrow though at home against the Clips (who now have Paul George back), I’m curious how many minutes Bud will ride his starters.
I’m curious if Bud will do the same here...
If Bud takes the same approach, or even if he starts him, I’m curious to see how he responds.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How KD’s Latest Role Is Lifting the Dangerous Nets Down the StretchAmong the many remarkable components of Kevin Durant’s Brooklyn Nets tenure, perhaps chiefly at the top is his pliability.
During this 13-game stretch, he’s averaging 7.0 assists (5.8 pre-injury) and helped guide Brooklyn to the NBA’s second-ranked offense (119.8 offensive rating).
Prior to his injury, the Nets were seventh in offense (109.7 offensive rating).
He’s averaging 30.6 points and 6.3 assists on 66.5% true shooting in his eight March games, and Seth Curry has excelled as a secondary scorer (13.4 points on 64.8% true shooting this month).
Regardless of where, when and how he’s bending defenses, he’s constantly taking advantage to set up teammates.
