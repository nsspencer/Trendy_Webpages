     Jordan Poole dooms Warriors with premature half-court shot in loss to Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors guard launched a half-court shot while double-teamed with four seconds still to go in Wednesday’s 107-103 loss to the Suns — which left fans wondering why he’d take a Hail Mary shot early on in the possession.
Poole — who recorded a career-high 38 points to go with nine rebounds and seven assists in the Western Conference thriller — explained his shot after the game.
“Probably get three free throws,” Poole said.
There was a guy in the middle and a guy on the half court line.
