    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: and Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who have introduced legislation to require the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representative to reinstate mandatory country of original labeling (MCOOL) for beef.
This legislation joins its companion effort already introduced in the Senate, the American Beef Labeling Act of 2021, S. 2716.
“American cattle producers are being unfairly displaced out of their own market,” said R-CALF USA Field Director Karina Jones.
This bill will empower consumers to make informed choices by requiring country of origin labels on beef purchased in grocery stores.
Consumers should be able to choose beef produced under the United States’ stringent production and safety standards, and we trust American consumers will choose beef produced exclusively in America.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hence, a comparative analysis of long-term trends in cancer incidence and mortality is warranted before their adoption.
To provide some answers, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College performed a large-scale comparative study of cancer trends in China and the USA, using open-source data.
In terms of cancer types, lung cancer is the most common in China, and breast cancer in the USA.
The primary contributors to reduced cancer mortality in the USA over the last 30 years have been improved cancer screening methods and newly developed cancer treatments.
The findings from this study paint a picture of converging cancer trends in China and the USA, demonstrating that cancer profiles in China are becoming more like those in the USA.
