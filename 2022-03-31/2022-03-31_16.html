     Human Rights Campaign Celebrates Transgender Day of Visibility 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week, the HRC Foundation, in partnership with Civis Analytics, released Trans Lives &amp; Positive Visibility: How News &amp; Media Can Positively Cover Trans and Non-Binary Stories.
This report gives new insight into how media coverage and broader “visibility” can both affect society’s perception of the transgender community as a whole, as well as transgender individuals.
Transgender and non-binary people continue to face legislative and executive attacks across the United States.
Texas has become a flashpoint in recent months, with lawless, groundless attacks on transgender youth and their families by Texas Gov.

     White House hosts 'Jeopardy!' star Amy Schneider to mark Transgender Day of Visibility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: champion Amy Schneider visited the White House on Thursday to mark the International Transgender Day of Visibility as the Biden administration rolled out a series of measures in support of transgender Americans.
"On this Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor transgender people who are fighting for freedom, equality, dignity, and respect," Biden said in his proclamation Wednesday.
"We also celebrate the parents, teachers, coaches, doctors, and other allies who affirm the identities of their transgender children and help these young people reach their potential."
Justice Department's warningThe administration's efforts come against the backdrop of a larger movement by conservative lawmakers to impose restrictions on the lives of transgender youth in the US.
"Efforts to criminalize supportive medical care for transgender kids, to ban transgender children from playing sports, and to outlaw discussing LGBTQI+ people in schools undermine their humanity and corrode our Nation's values."
