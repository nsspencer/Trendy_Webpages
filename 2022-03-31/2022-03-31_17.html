     Wordle 285: Hints for today’s word puzzle (3/31/22)
    </h2>

     Summary: Wordle is a daily word game owned by the New York Times.
If a word guessed by the user has a letter that is in the word of the day, but not in the right order, the letter box turns yellow.
If any letters are incorrect and not included in the final word, the box turns gray.
But, if any of the letters guessed are in the word and are in the right position, the box turns green.
