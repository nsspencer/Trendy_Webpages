     OKC Thunder quotes: Kevin Durant believes the Thunder have to retire his jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In The Ringer’s latest article, Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant disclosed his thoughts on the conversation about whether the Oklahoma City Thunder should retire his jersey No.
“‘OKC has to retire my jersey,’ he continues.
'”Considering Durant is a top-15 player of all time and spent the first nine seasons of his career with the Thunder franchise, it goes without saying that the team will likely retire his jersey in the future.
Even if there are still hard feelings between the fan base and Durant.
The only caveat I’ve seen Thunder fans make regarding retiring Durant’s jersey is that it has to happen after Russell Westbrook gets his number zero retired.

     Kevin Durant: It's Bad for Basketball If Thunder, Warriors Don't Retire My Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Durant told Logan Murdock of The Ringer that it would be bad for the game of basketball if the Oklahoma City Thunder or Golden State Warriors chose not to retire his number over bad blood from his departure from the two franchises.
The Seattle SuperSonics left a bustling market with a loyal fanbase to carve out owner Clay Bennett's vision to bring NBA basketball to Oklahoma City.
The 2016-17 Warriors are arguably the greatest basketball team ever assembled.
Durant was the best player on the best team in NBA history; that alone is enough to merit his jersey hanging forever.
Like his OKC exit, Durant's departure from Golden State polarized the fanbase, but time has a way of healing wounds.

     Summary: OKLAHOMA CITY — Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant isn't slowing down in his 15th NBA season, but he's sounding like he's preparing for when it happens.
In a profile by The Ringer's Logan Murdock, Durant reflected on several parts of his Hall of Fame-worthy career including his legacy in Oklahoma City and Golden State.
If you don’t want me to be a part of your program when I’m done playing, then that’s personal."
Durant left the Thunder in 2016 to join the Warriors where he won two NBA championships in three seasons before leaving for the Nets.
I’m still doing what I’m doing here in Brooklyn, but if I continue on what I’m doing four or five years, then I’ll feel the same way about this program.

     Kevin Durant Gives Injury Update on Ankle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a scary play at the end of Thursday night's thriller between the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, Nets star Kevin Durant seemed to have hurt his ankle on a three-point attempt.
Having been undercut on the play, receiving three free-throws, Durant stayed on the ground for a little while before stepping up and hitting his free-throws.
The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks never fail to deliver incredible games, going back to their 7-game series in last year's Eastern Conference Semi-Finals.
This game was no exception, with Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo battling it out for a win that would have been huge for either team.
From what Durant said postgame, it seems as if he won't have to miss any time.

     Summary: Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe Brooklyn Nets are going to be good for years to come.
Earlier this month, Kyrie Irving made a verbal commitment to stay on board, ensuring his long-term future with the franchiseTo follow it up, Kevin Durant made his own commitment in a recent conversation with Logan Murdock of The Ringer.
Last August, Durant signed a four-year extension with the Nets that could keep him in Brooklyn until he’s 37.
It’s his longest commitment to a team since he signed his rookie extension in OKC.
With the team finally seeing some peace and stability, they could be poised to surprise a lot of people this season.

     James Harden assured Kevin Durant he would re-sign with Nets, per report, contradicting his media-day comments

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 2021 playoffs, Harden ripped his hamstring 43 seconds into Game 1 of the conference semifinals against the Milwaukee Bucks.
This was a shift, apparently, from what Harden had told Durant last summer after the Nets' elimination.
According to The Ringer, Harden "twice reassured Durant that he'd sign an extension to stay in Brooklyn long term" when traveling together in Greece.
Perhaps the old Durant would've been bitter about Harden going back on what he's reportedly told him.
It worked out for the best for both sides, really, with the Sixers getting the Simmons mess off their plate, so who really cares what Harden told Durant in Greece.

The crew is here to record The ETCs With Kevin Durant, a biweekly podcast in which Durant talks about, well, whatever’s on his mind.
Shortly after his Golden State departure, Durant heard Gonzalez on a podcast ranting about how reasonable it was for Durant to leave the Warriors.
And while Harden and Durant drifted apart, Irving and Durant grew closer.
A few hours after the Memphis game, Durant and Irving struggle to contain their excitement over New York City’s decision.
