     5 Fetuses Removed From Home of Anti-Abortion Activist, Group Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The police said on Thursday that five fetuses had been removed from a home in Washington that, according to an anti-abortion group, belonged to an activist who was charged by the Justice Department this week with blocking access to an abortion clinic in October 2020.
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia would release only the address where the fetuses were found.
“It is her apartment,” Ms. Bukovinac said, adding that the group would have more to say at a news conference on Tuesday.
“We are definitely going to reveal all the details on Tuesday, and they are explosive,” Ms. Bukovinac said.
Handy and Mary Petras, the lawyer representing her in the federal case, did not immediately respond to emails.

     5 Fetuses Found in Home of DC Anti-Abortion Activist Lauren Handy – NBC4 Washington
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington, D.C., officers discovered five fetuses inside the Capitol Hill home where an anti-abortion activist lives, police say.
“My initial reaction is it’s horrifying to hear that there are fetuses in someone’s house,” a neighbor told News4.
Handy is one of nine anti-abortion activists who were charged Wednesday with federal civil rights offenses after they blocked access to a reproductive health center and streamed it on Facebook, federal prosecutors said.
The law also prohibits damaging property at abortion clinics and other reproductive health centers.
In court documents, prosecutors say Handy called the clinic pretending to be a prospective patient and scheduling an appointment.

     'People would freak out when they heard' | 5 fetuses discovered in house where anti-abortion activist was staying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, where Lauren Handy serves as director of activism, said it plans a press conference about the incident next week.
WASHINGTON — DC Police discovered five fetuses at the home of an anti-abortion activist in Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the department has confirmed to WUSA9.
The home was occupied by Lauren Handy, an anti-abortion activist who was indicted along with nine others Wednesday by a federal grand jury.
When I asked anti-abortion activist Lauren Handy what homicide detectives pulled out of her house Wednesday, she only said, “people will freak out when they hear.” @DCPoliceDept now says it found 5 fetuses.
That case stemmed from a March 2019 arrest at the Washington Surgi-Clinic — the same clinic in the indictment Handy now faces.
