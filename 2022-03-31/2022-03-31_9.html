     What causes aphasia, the brain condition prompting Bruce Willis to stop acting?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By CARLA K. JOHNSON, AP Medical WriterA brain disorder that leads to problems with speaking, reading and writing has sidelined actor Bruce Willis and drawn attention to a little-known condition that has many possible causes.
A stroke, tumor, head injury or other damage to the language centers of the brain can cause aphasia.
Willis’ family announced Wednesday that the 67-year-old actor has been diagnosed with aphasia but did not provide any details on a possible cause.
For an actor, aphasia could pose a huge challenge depending on how severe it is, said Johns Hopkins University cognitive scientist Brenda Rapp, who works with people with the condition.
Researchers are looking into new types of speech therapy and noninvasive methods such as a procedure that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate brain cells.

People with aphasia "have problems understanding words, expressing words or both comprehension and expression," Remmel said.
The most common cause for aphasia is stroke, Remmel said, though head trauma and brain tumors can also cause the condition.

     Aphasia: What’s the condition that forced Bruce Willis to quit?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement by American actor Bruce Willis that he will be “stepping away” from the big screen has drawn attention to aphasia, a little-known condition with many causes.
What causes aphasia?
There are many possible causes to aphasia, which affects about two million Americans, according to the National Aphasia Association.
The lack of oxygen and nutrients causes brain cells to die which can lead to difficulty retrieving words.
Others can recover through long-term speech therapy, which can help the brain find new pathways to communicate ideas.

     Difference Between Aphasia, Dementia Explained After Bruce Willis Diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis is stepping away from his acting career following an aphasia diagnosis, according to an Instagram post by his daughter, Rumer Willis.
Willis' diagnosis appears to have prompted Google searches for the difference between aphasia and dementia.
The difference between the two is that aphasia is a symptom—communication difficulty—whereas dementia is a wider umbrella diagnosis for cognitive decline.
Speech and language therapy is also available to help people who are diagnosed with aphasia, and may help them find ways to communicate better.
"For example, after a stroke, speech and language therapy can work with people on exercises that may help recover their language," said Northcott.
