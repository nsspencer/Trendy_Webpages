     Summary: Watch : Chris Pine Dishes on Working With Director Patty Jenkins AgainJust his luck—Chris Pine had an interesting encounter at one of the 2022 Oscars after-parties.
During a March 30 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the Wonder Woman 1984 actor, 41, shared that he was mistaken for a popular ‘90s star at the party on March 27.
"Well, I was at one and I was about to go, and this guy stopped me," he told host Jimmy Kimmel.
"And he's like, ‘Joey Lawrence,'" Chris continued, replying to the man, "'Not quite, but thank you.'
Chris continued.

     Chris Pine told a confused Oscars partygoer that he was Chris Evans of ‘Captain America’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Pine was mistaken for someone else at an Oscar party.
Guess who it isCNN —Many know Chris Pine as the blue-eyed, Captain Kirk-portraying member of the Hollywood Chrises (other members: Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt).
“I’ve gotten Ryan Reynolds, [Chris] Pratt, [Chris] Hemsworth, Matt Damon,” said Pine, making his bid for “best dressed Chris” in a blush, embroidered button-down, striped maroon-and-white pants and smoking slippers.
When Pine finally told the party patron that he was Captain America (again, not true; the only heroic captain Pine has played is Kirk in the “Star Trek” reboot films), the attendee said, “‘That’s my man!’” according to Pine.
Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, father-in-law of Pratt (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Jurassic Park,” “Parks and Recreation”), called Pratt by Evans’ last name, according to People.

Q: Did "All the Old Knives" remind you of any old-school thrillers or romances that you grew up watching?
Q: You executive produced both these movies, along with your 2019 miniseries "I Am the Night" (which Pine co-produced with "Wonder Woman" director Patty Jenkins).

     ‘The Contractor’ Film Review: Chris Pine Enters the Hired-Gun Gig Economy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cast out from professional employment, a reluctant but desperate man turns to a life of precarious gig work.
This leaves James in the same place as many of his fellow soldiers: in debt, desperate, drug-addicted, and unfit for civilian life.
After the death of a friend, James reunites with Army buddy Mike (Ben Foster), who tries to recruit him into private work.
Rusty, like Mike, assures James the contract work is lucrative, easy, and quick — a two-week job in Berlin.
But that kind of reckoning is only to be found in the margins of “The Contractor”; the rest is percussively-scored chase sequences.

     Summary: The saga of actor Chris Pine and his flip phone seems to have ended.
It was a great and triumphant journey and we will miss the energy that Pine had while holding a flip phone in his hand for many, many years.
Fans of the Star Trek actor have long been fascinated by the fact that pine had a flip phone like it was 2003 and would taunt the paparazzi with it.
EXCLUSIVE IMPORTANT CONTENT: Chris Pine has given up his flip phone for an iPhone and now he doesn’t read and hates himself.
Pine’s simmering disdain for an always-connected smartphone is just one of the reasons that Chris Pine is my favorite Chris.
