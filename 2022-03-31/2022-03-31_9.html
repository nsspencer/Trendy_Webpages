     Summary: HARLINGEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — In celebration of César Chávez Day, President Biden continued the fight for the rights and dignity of working people, fulfilling the promise of America for all Americans.
Biden urged congress to pass two bills, aiding in the fight.
Born into poverty and raised by migrant workers, César Chávez dedicated his life to improving conditions for workers across the country.
Chávez drew national attention to the many agricultural workers who experienced inhumane working conditions and unlivable wages when he founded the United Farm Workers of America.
These bills will allow farmworkers to bargain collectively, obtain legal status, and have better working conditions.

     Summary: The house meeting became a fundamental strategy for organizing farmworkers that is still common today.
Higbie: As someone who teaches a longer perspective on history, sometimes students aren’t aware that people have been organizing farmworkers for far longer.
We often hear the phrase “Si Se Puede” when we talk about Chávez, how did that slogan come about?
Higbie: It goes back to what Gaspar was just saying about Si Se Puede.
Rivera-Salgado: By studying the history of organizing farmworkers and the legacy of César Chávez, one can always sense that building a union is always done under adverse circumstances.
