     Union Trails in Amazon Vote in Alabama, With Challenges Pending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The labor board is also counting votes in another high-profile election, at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island.
At the end of the first day of counting on Thursday, 57 percent of the ballots supported being represented by Amazon Labor Union, and 43 percent were opposed.
Workers who supported the union in Bessemer cited frustrations over low pay, inadequate breaks and overly aggressive productivity targets.
Amazon has said its pay — just under $16 per hour for full-time, entry-level workers — is competitive for the area.
Several employees who backed the union said co-workers were generally less afraid to question management or show their union support this year than during last year’s election.

     As counting wraps for the day, mixed results emerge in Amazon union votes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of the close of today’s counting in the Bessemer, Alabama Amazon Union election, “no” votes are ahead 993 to 875.
It’s a positive outcome thus far for Amazon, which has managed to ward off labor organizing in its fulfillment centers for the entirety of its 27-year existence.
This union election continues to show that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union.
As with last year’s original election, today’s results have been closely monitored by both Amazon and the union.
Earlier today, CNBC reported that Amazon had hired Global Strategy Group, a firm with close ties to the Democratic Party, to help combat labor organizing efforts.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The counting is over in the second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama.
Last year, workers voted more than 2-to-1 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a well-established national union.
Meanwhile in a separate Amazon union election on Staten Island in New York, the vote count will continue Friday morning.
Roughly 8,000 workers were eligible to vote on whether to join the Amazon Labor Union, an upstart organization led by former and current Amazon warehouse employees.
With ballots still to count, the union is in the lead, with 1,518 voting yes so far, and 1,154 voting no.

     Summary: Amazon provides the list of eligible workers to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which oversees the process.
According to Appelbaum, the union plans on filing objections with the NLRB to Amazon’s conduct through the rerun union election.
The warehouse in Staten Island employs more than 8,300 workers, who pack and ship supplies to customers based mostly in the north-east.
A second Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, is scheduled to begin a union election on 25 April.
New York is more labor-friendly than Alabama, where the other union election is being held.

     Summary: Labor groups close in on Amazon in 2 tight union electionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Craig Ruttle/AP Craig Ruttle/APNEW YORK — Labor organizers always knew it would be tough to convince Amazon workers to unionize.
Meanwhile, Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, appear to have rejected a union bid but outstanding challenged ballots could change the outcome.
The nascent Amazon Labor Union, which is leading the charge on Staten Island, has no backing from an established union and is powered by former and current warehouse workers.
"I don't think that many people thought that the Amazon Labor Union had much of a chance of winning at all," Logan said.
In Bessemer, Amazon has made some changes to but still kept a controversial U.S.

     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon workers in Alabama appear to have rejected a union bid in a tight race, according to early results on Thursday.
In New York, union supporters have the edge in a count that will continue Friday morning.
The close election marks a sharp contrast to last year, when Amazon workers overwhelmingly rejected the union.
In Bessemer, Amazon has made some changes to but still kept a controversial U.S.
There’s little public transportation, so many of the Amazon workers drive to the facility from as far away as metro Montgomery, nearly 100 miles to the south.

     Summary: An additional 416 ballots were challenged by either Amazon or the union – enough to sway the final vote.
The Bessemer union vote, organized with a more established union, took place by mail over a nearly two-month period ending on Friday.
Thousands of Amazon warehouse employees were eligible to vote in each election.
More than half of those eligible to vote this time were eligible to vote last time, according to the RWDSU.
The Staten Island effort, on the other hand, is being led by a newly established group called Amazon Labor Union (ALU) comprised of current and former Amazon workers.

     Summary: A reporter working for Jacobin and Ricochet went undercover at an Amazon warehouse for almost five months and witnessed firsthand the challenges put to the Teamsters’ union drive.
The union may trade away something you value in order to get something one group of associates or the union itself wants.
Ostensibly, after ninety days of work, employees are eligible to apply for their blue badge, which signifies permanent employment and additional benefits.
“There’s some kind of exploitation at work, but it’s sugarcoated in a way,” he said of Amazon warehouse operations.
Amazon work is not piecework, and the skill required to meet surges in production demand is not remunerated.
