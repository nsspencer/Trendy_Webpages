     Kevin Durant says Warriors Should Retire his Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant is one of the greatest NBA players of all-time.
As such, he believes both the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder should retire his jersey.
In an interview with The Ringer, Durant gave his candid thoughts about the Warriors retiring his jersey.
Even though Kevin Durant wasn't with the Golden State Warriors as long as he was with the Thunder, he was still tremendously accomplished.
As a Warrior, Durant was 2x NBA Champion, 2x NBA Finals MVP, 3x All-Star, and a 1x All-NBA First team member.

     Kevin Durant: It's Bad for Basketball If Thunder, Warriors Don't Retire My Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Durant told Logan Murdock of The Ringer that it would be bad for the game of basketball if the Oklahoma City Thunder or Golden State Warriors chose not to retire his number over bad blood from his departure from the two franchises.
The Seattle SuperSonics left a bustling market with a loyal fanbase to carve out owner Clay Bennett's vision to bring NBA basketball to Oklahoma City.
The 2016-17 Warriors are arguably the greatest basketball team ever assembled.
Durant was the best player on the best team in NBA history; that alone is enough to merit his jersey hanging forever.
Like his OKC exit, Durant's departure from Golden State polarized the fanbase, but time has a way of healing wounds.

     Summary: OKLAHOMA CITY — Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant isn't slowing down in his 15th NBA season, but he's sounding like he's preparing for when it happens.
In a profile by The Ringer's Logan Murdock, Durant reflected on several parts of his Hall of Fame-worthy career including his legacy in Oklahoma City and Golden State.
If you don’t want me to be a part of your program when I’m done playing, then that’s personal."
Durant left the Thunder in 2016 to join the Warriors where he won two NBA championships in three seasons before leaving for the Nets.
I’m still doing what I’m doing here in Brooklyn, but if I continue on what I’m doing four or five years, then I’ll feel the same way about this program.

     Kevin Durant Wants Thunder, Warriors to Retire His Jersey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant would like to see his jersey retired, but not just by one NBA franchise.
After being drafted by the Seattle Supersonics (which turned into the Thunder) he played there for nine seasons and was a seven-time All-Star.
He won two rings with Golden State, and he won the NBA finals MVP both of those years before joining the Nets.
“OKC has to retire my jersey,” Durant said.
I’m still doing what I’m doing here in Brooklyn, but if I continue on what I’m doing four or five years, then I’ll feel the same way about this program.

     Summary: But Kevin Durant isn’t bothered one bit.
Via The Ringer:“Before, I used to worry about expectations, but now, I’m solidified and confident in what I bring,” the Nets star says.
“I just try to focus on me the most as I can, the best I can.”There’s nothing in this game that Kevin Durant hasn’t already achieved.
Or Kevin Durant could come up short until the day he retires.
But at the end of the day, Kevin Durant just wants to play basketball.

     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets star is never afraid to fire back at someone’s opinion, whether it is shared online or during a press conference.
During his time with the Golden State Warriors, Durant squared off with media members constantly.
There were several testy moments between Durant and the reporters covering the Warriors.
The narratives drawn about the team didn’t seem to favor Durant and instead made Stephen Curry out to be the main guy.
While Golden State looks to keep contending, Durant and the Nets, the team he is very happy with, are looking to finally reach the Finals.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors achieved a lot of success during Kevin Durant’s time with the organization.
Despite all of the results Durant and the Warriors achieved together, they were far from being free of controversy.
In an interview with The Ringer, Durant explained how he feels the media coverage he received as a member of the Warriors was “unfair” by constantly receiving questions about his free agency plans.
“I thought it was unfair to me and the whole group to even think about anything that was going to happen after the year.
In the end, Durant opted to depart the Warriors to team up with Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets using a sign-and-trade in 2019.

     James Harden assured Kevin Durant he would re-sign with Nets, per report, contradicting his media-day comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 2021 playoffs, Harden ripped his hamstring 43 seconds into Game 1 of the conference semifinals against the Milwaukee Bucks.
This was a shift, apparently, from what Harden had told Durant last summer after the Nets' elimination.
According to The Ringer, Harden "twice reassured Durant that he'd sign an extension to stay in Brooklyn long term" when traveling together in Greece.
Perhaps the old Durant would've been bitter about Harden going back on what he's reportedly told him.
It worked out for the best for both sides, really, with the Sixers getting the Simmons mess off their plate, so who really cares what Harden told Durant in Greece.

The crew is here to record The ETCs With Kevin Durant, a biweekly podcast in which Durant talks about, well, whatever’s on his mind.
Shortly after his Golden State departure, Durant heard Gonzalez on a podcast ranting about how reasonable it was for Durant to leave the Warriors.
And while Harden and Durant drifted apart, Irving and Durant grew closer.
A few hours after the Memphis game, Durant and Irving struggle to contain their excitement over New York City’s decision.
