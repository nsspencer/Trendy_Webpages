     Summary: Has Chris Pine has found himself on a new plane?
He’s got a few new COVID-era projects making their way out into the world.
All the while, he’s grown out a very Grooming Gods-core salt-and-pepper beard, and has been wearing the sort of outfits that make Twitter wonder: “...have you all seen Chris Pine lately?”We’ve rounded up some of his biggest fits as of late, so you can see for yourself.
Chris Pine is seen on November 20, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.
BG015/Bauer-GriffinMaybe it all began here, with a simple stroll around Los Angeles back in November—double denim, cuffs rolled just right, an uncomplicated loafer.

     ‘The Contractor’ Review: The Pine Identity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Pine often seems too pretty, too nice, decent and, well, intelligent for his movies.
His range elevates action movies like “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,” a 2014 take on the Tom Clancy property.
Like too many of Pine’s movies, it just didn’t stick.
One obvious explanation is that unlike, say, Andrew Garfield or the Marvelites named Chris (Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt), Pine hasn’t slipped on a superhero suit.
Which brings me to Pine’s latest, “The Contractor,” a thriller that yearningly evokes the Bourne series while never approaching its level.

     Summary: Chris Pine— America’s best Chris who far surpasses rivals Evans, Pratt, and, of course, Hemsworth —was one of Jimmy Kimmel’s guests last night, and it was pretty damn delightful.
Not that we are surprised in any way (see previous sentence regarding our Chris rankings), but the chat itself revealed some unexpected trivia about the actor’s Hollywood lineage.
Then there’s Pine’s own mom, Gwynne Gilford , who popped up in wonderfully titled schlock such as Beware!
“They’d obviously just discovered zoom [camera shots],” Pine says after watching a clip from the former flick for the first time.

Q: Did "All the Old Knives" remind you of any old-school thrillers or romances that you grew up watching?
Q: You executive produced both these movies, along with your 2019 miniseries "I Am the Night" (which Pine co-produced with "Wonder Woman" director Patty Jenkins).

     Summary: Chris Pine was mistaken for someone else at an Oscar party.
Guess who it isCNN —Many know Chris Pine as the blue-eyed, Captain Kirk-portraying member of the Hollywood Chrises (other members: Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt).
“I’ve gotten Ryan Reynolds, [Chris] Pratt, [Chris] Hemsworth, Matt Damon,” said Pine, making his bid for “best dressed Chris” in a blush, embroidered button-down, striped maroon-and-white pants and smoking slippers.
When Pine finally told the party patron that he was Captain America (again, not true; the only heroic captain Pine has played is Kirk in the “Star Trek” reboot films), the attendee said, “‘That’s my man!’” according to Pine.
Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, father-in-law of Pratt (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Jurassic Park,” “Parks and Recreation”), called Pratt by Evans’ last name, according to People.

     Summary: Actor Chris Pine comments on whether or not his character Steve Trevor could return in Wonder Woman 3.
Pine first played Trevor in 2017's Wonder Woman, a soldier looking to recruit a team to stop the release of mustard gas during WWI.
Pine's Trevor was killed off at the end of Wonder Woman but reappeared in the sequel, Wonder Woman 1984 when Diana was able to "wish" him back into existence for a short time.
However, most fans feel his absence is necessary at this point, especially after the odd return in Wonder Woman 1984.

Finally, he gave in and introduced himself: "Chris Evans, Captain America," he said, giving the wrong Chris name just for fun.
"And just to top it off," Chris told Jimmy, "… he goes, 'That's my man!'"
Chris, 41, also admitted he's pretty used to being mistaken for other stars, having been dubbed Matt Damon, Ryan Reynolds and more, in addition to Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt and now, Joey Lawrence.
But on TikTok this week, Selena pretty much threw that theory out the window.
