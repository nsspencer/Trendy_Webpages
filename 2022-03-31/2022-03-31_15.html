     Russians fled Chernobyl with radiation sickness, says Ukraine as IAEA investigates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation.
The IAEA said it was preparing to send its first “assistance and support mission” to Chernobyl in northern Ukraine in the next few days.
In a separate post, Energoatom said the Russian side had formally agreed to hand back to Ukraine the responsibility for protecting Chernobyl.
Ukraine has repeatedly expressed safety concerns about Chernobyl and demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops, whose presence prevented the rotation of personnel for a time.
Asked to comment on the accounts from Chernobyl staff, Russia’s defence ministry did not respond.

     Ukraine power company says Russians are leaving Chernobyl site after radiation exposure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said Thursday as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts.
The area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing.
In the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel.
Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu have given assurances that conscripts will not take part in the war in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, however, the Russian military admitted that a number of conscripts ended up in Ukraine and were captured there.

     Summary: Meanwhile in Mariupol, Russian forces blocked a convoy of 45 buses attempting to evacuate people after the Russian military agreed to a limited cease-fire in the area.
Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies in a dozen buses that were trying to make it to Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.
Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site in the opening stages of the Feb. 24 invasion, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation.
Ukrainian forces counterattacked and some Russian withdrawals around the suburb of Brovary to the east, Pavliuk said.
At a Ukrainian military checkpoint outside Kyiv, soldiers and officers said they don’t believe Russian forces have given up on the capital.
