    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UPDATE: Severe thunderstorm warnings issued as strong storms sweep across stateEighteen counties in New Jersey have been placed under a severe thunderstorm watch by the National Weather Service and national Storm Prediction Center because strong storms with damaging winds, drenching downpours and small hail are expected to sweep across the state Thursday evening and Thursday night.
The watch was issued at 4:15 p.m. and will remain effective until midnight in the following counties: Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.
Although a watch is not as urgent as a warning, it alerts the public to be aware of the potential for severe weather.
When a severe thunderstorm watch is issued, people should be aware of the possibility of strong storms on the way.
And the mercury was stuck in the 30s or 40s throughout the day — far colder than normal for late March.
