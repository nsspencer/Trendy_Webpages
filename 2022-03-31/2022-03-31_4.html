     Summary: After taking a little more than a week to weigh his options, Bobby Wagner finally decided on his next team: the Los Angeles Rams.
He agreed to terms on a five-year, $50 million deal Thursday, a contract that’s worth up to $65 million.
For a team that is often said to be in a bad situation with the salary cap, they’ve gone out and made two splashes with Allen Robinson and Bobby Wagner.
They were always in the running for Wagner but the fact that the defending Super Bowl champions landed a future Hall of Famer is still a shock.
Here’s how Twitter reacted to the news, with fans and media members being stunned by the signing.

     Summary: Marcus Williams and the Ravens Are a Perfect Scheme FitSafety Marcus Williams signing with the Ravens was named one of the most interesting scheme fits after the initial wave of free agency by Pro Football Focus' Seth Galina.
… The Ravens have been a high safety team for quite a while under former Defensive Coordinator Don 'Wink' Martindale.
On 50% of their calls they showed a one-high safety look pre-snap and then played a one-high safety defense post-snap.
This is who they've been for so long, and that fit would have been perfect for Marcus Williams.
Where it gets interesting is with new Defensive Coordinator Mike MacDonald in the fold."
