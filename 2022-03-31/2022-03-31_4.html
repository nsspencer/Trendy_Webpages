     Summary: It just so happens with Ben, I get the beauty of both worlds — Someone I like to spend time with who's also one of the finest actors out there.
Sometimes in this business, you can get a little alpha energy amongst dudes, which can make for trickiness.
With he and I, it's what's best for the scene, what's going to work, what's going to make it pop, and whether that's him or me taking the lead, it doesn't really matter so long as it works for the film.
Ben Foster: I have a policy that there's no eye contact on set, and only to call me by other people's character names, not mine.
It goes for any job, you'd rather do it with people you respect and know have your back and go ask some questions together.

    </h2>

     Summary: Cast out from professional employment, a reluctant but desperate man turns to a life of precarious gig work.
This leaves James in the same place as many of his fellow soldiers: in debt, desperate, drug-addicted, and unfit for civilian life.
After the death of a friend, James reunites with Army buddy Mike (Ben Foster), who tries to recruit him into private work.
Rusty, like Mike, assures James the contract work is lucrative, easy, and quick — a two-week job in Berlin.
But that kind of reckoning is only to be found in the margins of “The Contractor”; the rest is percussively-scored chase sequences.
