     5 Fetuses Removed From Home of Anti-Abortion Activist, Group Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The police said on Thursday that five fetuses had been removed from a home in Washington that, according to an anti-abortion group, belonged to an activist who was charged by the Justice Department this week with blocking access to an abortion clinic in October 2020.
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia would release only the address where the fetuses were found.
“It is her apartment,” Ms. Bukovinac said, adding that the group would have more to say at a news conference on Tuesday.
“We are definitely going to reveal all the details on Tuesday, and they are explosive,” Ms. Bukovinac said.
Handy and Mary Petras, the lawyer representing her in the federal case, did not immediately respond to emails.

     Five sets of fetal remains found in anti-abortion activist’s home, DC police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five sets of human fetal remains were recovered from the Washington DC home of an anti-abortion activist after a raid, the capital’s Metropolitan police department confirmed to the Guardian on Thursday.
Handy’s only comment at the time was: “People will freak out when they hear.”Authorities have not disclosed the source of the fetal remains.
Handy also claimed on Twitter to be inspired to “liberate” fetal remains “from med [sic] waste companies and give them a proper burial”.
Handy was separately indicted on Wednesday for forcing entry into a Washington DC abortion clinic in 2020 October.
The university cold room contained brown bags, in which donated fetal remains dating back to the 1960s were stored inside new containers.
