     Tennessee wildfire near Gatlinburg prompts evacuations of 11,000 homes, mayor says
    </h2>

     Summary: (CNN) A wildfire burning near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Sevier County, Tennessee, has grown to more than 3,700 acres and impacted more than 100 structures, County Mayor Larry Waters said in a news conference Thursday.
About 11,000 homes have been evacuated since the Hatcher Mountain Road/Indigo Lane Fire began Wednesday, the mayor said.
Waters did not have an update on the civilian's condition.
Five fire rescue vehicles, including four county vehicles and one state vehicle, were damaged as a result of the fire, Waters said.
There are no reports of fatalities or missing people as a result of the blaze, Waters said, calling the news "answered prayers."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid less hazardous weather, firefighters gained ground against a destructive wildfire in the Gatlinburg, Tennessee, area Thursday.
The Sevier County Emergency Management Agency announced late Thursday afternoon that the size of the main evacuation area was being reduced.
That same storm system finally reached the area early Thursday morning and brought a brief, but much-needed rain.
The fires are just a few miles from the site of the 2016 fires, which burned into Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge proper.
Those fires killed at least 14 people, injured many others and burned more than 2,000 buildings and homes to the ground.
