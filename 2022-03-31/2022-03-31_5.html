     Man finds 'alien' that looks like 'dehaired possum' with claws washed up on Australian beach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man taking a morning walk on an Australian beach stumbled across a creature that he says may be from out of this world.
Tan said it looked like a "dehaired possum" but looked different from anything he had ever encountered.
This isn't the first time a weird creature has been found washed up on a beach or floating in the water.
Last December, a man in California looking for dolphins found a 'mutilated shark alien' fish that looked like it was "bitten in half."
A month before that, a man stumbled upon a rare deep-sea monster called a Pacific football fish on a San Diego beach.

     Man discovers "alien" creature's corpse washed up on Australian beach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man stumbled upon what he called an "alien" creature's corpse during a walk on a beach in Queensland, Australia, last week, sparking hundreds of internet theories about what the strange-looking creature with the "humanlike hands" and "long lizard tail" could be.
He uploaded videos to his Instagram page on Tuesday that showed the creature laying on the beach.
He told Storyful that the animal had "humanlike hands, long lizard tail, nose like a possum and patches of black fur."
Instagram user Alex Tan filmed a mysterious creature's corpse during a walk in Queensland, Australia.
Stephen Johnson, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, told the Courier Mail that the animal was likely a swollen, waterlogged brushtail possum that lost its fur.
