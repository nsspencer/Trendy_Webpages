     Former acting ICE director: Ending COVID-era Title 42 will cause 'more chaos' at border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A former top ICE official is sounding the alarm on the potential end of Title 42, a COVID-era border policy, warning its end could yield additional "chaos" and send a dangerous message to the rest of the world.
WHITE HOUSE ADMITS ENDING TITLE 42 WILL BRING ‘INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THE BORDER'Former Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Ron Vitiello warned on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Thursday the already-high migrant encounters are likely to spike if the policy is rescinded.
"This is going to cause more chaos at our border," Vitiello told co-hosts Ashley Strohmier and Todd Piro.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO END TITLE 42 BORDER POLICY, DESPITE FEARS OF MASSIVE MIGRANT SURGE: REPORTS"This administration has removed the tools that stopped the last major surge at the border that started in 2019 and ended in late in 2020," Vitiello said.
Just this week, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz warned the U.S. is likely to hit one million encounters this fiscal year, as agents have already encountered migrants from 157 countries.

     Manchin opposed to Biden plan to drop Title 42 at border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is urging the Biden administration to rethink plans to rescind Title 42 amid reports the White House plans to unwind the Trump-era policy allowing for rapid expulsions at the border while barring migrants from seeking asylum.
Numerous outlets reported Wednesday that the administration plans to rescind the order in some capacity by May 23 — plans Manchin told reporters at the Capitol Thursday that he thinks they should drop“Oh my goodness.
Manchin had previously expressed his opposition to lifting Title 42 — making him one of just a handful of Democrats to do so as President Biden largely faces pressure from within his party to scrap what many see as an illegal and inhumane policy.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, have offered sharper criticism of Biden for maintaining the policy.
“As we have clearly reminded President Biden, we have a moral imperative to live by our values.”

     The White House Does, in Fact, Have a Post–Title 42 Plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden takes questions from reporters in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., March 28, 2022.
Even some border-state Democrats have asked that Title 42 be kept in place until there’s a plan to deal with the consequences.
The fact sheet on “DHS Preparations for a Potential Increase in Migration” uses the words “processing” or “processed” ten times in a two-page document.
And the key is that the administration set the date for the end of Title 42 only a few days before this new asylum rule goes into effect.
As I wrote on the home page this morning, “Today’s mainstream Left does not believe that the American people have the right to keep anyone out.”

     Border communities unprepared for end of Title 42, lawmakers say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Title 42 is a public health rule allowing border agents to immediately expel newly arrived migrants deemed inadmissible.
Ted Cruz and John Cornyn – both Republicans – fear that doing away with Title 42 will encourage more illegal migration to the United States.
“We urge that Title 42 remain in place until such time as the number of apprehensions along the Southwest border drops to a manageable level,” the lawmakers wrote.
(photo courtesy U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas)“If the Biden administration does away with title 42 you will see these historic numbers double overnight,” he said.
The administration is also feeling pressure from immigrant advocacy groups, who say there’s no medical basis to keep Title 42 in place anymore, given a worldwide drop in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

     Biden administration moves forward with plans to lift Title 42 border restrictions - WEIS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: grandriver/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — The Department of Homeland Security is expected to move forward this week with lifting Title 42 restrictions — the Trump-era order giving the government authority to expel migrants at the southern border under a public health emergency — two government officials told ABC News Wednesday.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he has been “deeply disappointed” in the Biden administration for not ending the Title 42 rapid expulsion protocols and he specifically referenced the risks posed to Ukrainian families.
The agency is continuing its review and has yet to issue a formal decision, the CDC told ABC News in a statement.
A court battle in which the administration faced a deadline to reimpose categorical expulsions of unaccompanied migrant minors or to ask an appellate court to intervene resulted in the administration rescinding the Title 42 policy for unaccompanied children once again earlier this month.
“A lot of these land ports are beyond their useful life and their capacity in many ways and these upgrades that we’re talking about today are long overdue.”The repeal date for Title 42 is slated for May 23, according to several reports.
