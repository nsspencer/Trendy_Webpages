     Bruce Willis’ Aphasia: A Look at This Condition With an Uncertain Cause
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis’ decision to step out of the spotlight this week after his diagnosis of aphasia is not surprising.
It’s perhaps the worst medical condition for an actor.
The condition affects more than 2 million Americans and occurs when there is damage to the language centers of the brain, Fisher explained.
“Most forms of aphasia come on suddenly, but it can also result from deterioration of brain tissue over time such as with dementia and, more specifically, primary progressive aphasia,” Fisher said.
Progressive aphasia will likely not show improvement, although patients can acquire new communication strategies through speech therapy, she said.

The most common cause for aphasia is stroke, Remmel said, though head trauma and brain tumors can also cause the condition.

     Summary: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Kevin Smith feels like an “a–hole” for “petty” comments he once made about Bruce Willis, whose family revealed he has aphasia.
“Long before any of the Cop Out stuff, I was a big Bruce Willis fan – so this is really heartbreaking to read,” Smith tweeted Wednesday in response to the news of Willis’ diagnosis, referencing the 2010 action-comedy that he directed and the actor starred in.
Smith said he feels “like an a–hole” now that Willis’ aphasia diagnosis has been revealed.
Getty ImagesIt is unclear how long the “Pulp Fiction” star has been experiencing symptoms of aphasia, but his family revealed Wednesday that he would be stepping away from his decades-long career due to the medical condition.
It typically occurs after a stroke or head injury, though Willis’ family did not elaborate on his cause.

     Difference Between Aphasia, Dementia Explained After Bruce Willis Diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis is stepping away from his acting career following an aphasia diagnosis, according to an Instagram post by his daughter, Rumer Willis.
Willis' diagnosis appears to have prompted Google searches for the difference between aphasia and dementia.
The difference between the two is that aphasia is a symptom—communication difficulty—whereas dementia is a wider umbrella diagnosis for cognitive decline.
Speech and language therapy is also available to help people who are diagnosed with aphasia, and may help them find ways to communicate better.
"For example, after a stroke, speech and language therapy can work with people on exercises that may help recover their language," said Northcott.

     What is aphasia? An expert explains
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is also a separate form of the condition called primary progressive aphasia.
The medical community doesn’t know what causes primary progressive aphasia.
Right now, we don’t know what proportion of people with aphasia have the primary progressive form of the condition.
With primary progressive aphasia, it is harder to diagnose.
Primary progressive aphasia is degenerative – the patient will deteriorate over time, although the rate of deterioration can be slowed.

     What to Know About Aphasia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aphasia, which affects an estimated 2 million Americans, is a language disorder that impacts someone’s ability to communicate with others.
Brain injuries, brain tumors, infections, or neurodegenerative diseases can also cause aphasia if any part of the brain that processes language is affected.
Depending on what area of the brain is damaged, aphasia will take different forms, the most common of which are Wernicke’s aphasia and Broca’s aphasia.
Because the frontal lobe also regulates motor movement, people with Broca’s aphasia often experience weakness or paralysis in their right arm or leg.
Depending on the cause, aphasia can develop at different rates.
