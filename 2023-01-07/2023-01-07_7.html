The Titans have a 13-7 lead on the Jaguars at halftime in a battle for the AFC South.
Randy Bullock has field goals of 51 and 39 yards, and Dobbs threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Chigoziem Okonkwo.
Derrick Henry has stiff-armed Jaguars and run over them, gaining 71 yards on 17 carries.

     Titans' Joshua Dobbs: Costly turnover in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dobbs completed 20 of 29 passes for 179 yards, one touchdown and one interception in Saturday's 20-16 loss to Jacksonville.
Dobbs drew his second consecutive start, this time with the AFC South title on the line.
He performed admirably for much of the game, highlighted by a 21-yard dart to Chigoziem Okonkwo for a touchdown midway through the second quarter.
However, Dobbs made a vital mistake with only three minutes remaining in the matchup when he fumbled while being sacked, which the Jacksonville defense returned for the game-winning touchdown.
Dobbs spent the majority of the season as the backup quarterback in Cleveland, and he'll likely stick in a similar role in 2023.

     WATCH: Josh Dobbs Delivers Strike For Two-Score Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Few could have predicted the start that the Tennessee Titans have gotten out to tonight.
Quarterback Josh Dobbs got his second career start in a quintessential game for the Titans.
Dobbs threw a touchdown pass to tight end Chigozie Mokonkwo in the middle of the second quarter.
It pushed the lead to 10-0 for the Titans, setting them up well for the rest of the game.
Henry would provide a nice cushion for Dobbs, who has made some nice throws off action-fakes in tonight's contest.

     Summary: Joshua Dobbs Rushing YardsProp Joshua Dobbs Over 16.5 Rushing Yards Matchup Titans vs. Jaguars Day, Time Saturday, 8:15 p.m.
ET Best Book DraftKingsWe whiffed on Dobbs’ rushing over last week at 23.5 rushing yards, but we’re going back to the well this week.
Against the Cowboys in Week 17, Dobbs finished with 12 rushing yards, which was essentially our worst-case scenario.
The Jaguars are a much easier matchup for Dobbs, as well.
He’s a very good rushing QB, and I think he taps into that more in a must-win game.

     Should you start Joshua Dobbs in DFS in Week 18?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dobbs, a six-year pro, made his first NFL start last week in a 27-13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys last Thursday.
Should you start Joshua Dobbs in NFL DFS in Week 18?
Dobbs was given a tough task in his first start, facing the Cowboys and not having the services of some starters, including running back Derrick Henry.
But Dobbs showed he was capable, going 20-for-39 passing for 232 yards and a touchdown.
With Henry back in the lineup this weekend, Dobbs is an interesting, but risky play against the Jaguars' defense.

     QB Joshua Dobbs' path as Titans' starter sets up the biggest game of his career vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video by Turron Davenport (2:00)NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Joshua Dobbs was driving home to Atlanta on Christmas Eve to be with his family when he got a phone call.
Dobbs spent Christmas morning at home, then turned around and drove back to the Titans' facility that afternoon.
Dobbs had never started a regular-season game in his career, and although the Titans fell 27-13, the experience was invaluable.
Titans quarterback Joshua Dobbs will make his second NFL start in a game Tennessee must win to get into the playoffs.
This week, Dobbs will also have the luxury of playing with Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry, who was among six starters held out of last week's game.
