     Setién's Villarreal beats Real Madrid 2-1 in Spanish league
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pulsating Spanish league match at Villarreal’s remodeled Estadio de la Cerámica could have ended with more goals, especially for the all-yellow hosts.
Villarreal, which held Madrid to five consecutive draws at its stadium, took the initiative and forced Madrid’s defenders into sloppy passing.
“We played an extraordinary match against an extraordinary team,” Setién said.
Once back in Spain, Madrid will face another trip to Villarreal in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals.
According to Opta statistics, this was the first time Madrid did not have a Spaniard on the field at kickoff in a Spanish league game in this century.

     Real Madrid slump to 2-1 defeat at Villarreal as Moreno shines
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/3] Soccer Football - LaLiga - Villarreal v Real Madrid - Estadio de la Ceramica, Villarreal, Spain - January 7, 2023 Villarreal's Gerard Moreno scores their second goal from the penalty spot REUTERS/Pablo MoranoJan 7 (Reuters) - Real Madrid suffered a 2-1 defeat at Villarreal on Saturday after a goal and assist from striker Gerard Moreno, giving leaders Barcelona a chance to move ahead in the title race.
Real stay second, level on 38 points with Barca who visit fourth-placed Atletico Madrid on Sunday, while Villarreal's third straight league win moves them up to fifth spot.
Yeremy had the best chance of the first half after he was played through on goal by Moreno, but Thibaut Courtois was quickly off his line to block the shot.
Madrid grew into the game following Villarreal's goal, with Benzema and Vinicius continuing to orchestrate the champions' attacking efforts.
Moreno converted after Madrid's protests had calmed down, sending Courtois the wrong way to put his side back in the lead.

     Summary: It was a tough game, we made it more complicated.
I wanted to put a fresh player in at right back.
They received the ball in between the lines a lot, I don't think we need to work on it, since we've already done a lot about that, but we need to focus on it.
Both penalties were penalties.
A bit, you know, like that, but we have to get used to it because these are the rules.

No Madrid crisis yet, but defeat comes at a bad timeThere's no shame in losing away at Villarreal: after all, Real Madrid haven't won at the La Ceramica stadium since 2017.
Villarreal fully deserved their victory over a tired Real Madrid side that lacked coherence.
Gerard Moreno (Villarreal): His last 2 goals with Villarreal were via penalty kick.
Also, Saturday marked his second career game-winning goal in LaLiga vs. Real Madrid, having previously done it in 2018 with a 93rd minute goal.
