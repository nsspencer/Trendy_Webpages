     Justin Turner gets honest on joining forces with Red Sox’ Rafael Devers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Joey Mistretta · 2 min readJustin Turner recently opened up on joining the Boston Red Sox.
But Turner is a third baseman and the Red Sox happen to have a superstar at the hot corner in Rafael Devers, who recently inked a massive extension.
Nevertheless, Turner admitted that he’s excited to watch Devers patrol the position in Boston, per Ian Browne of MLB.com.
As a result of Rafael Devers’ presence, Justin Turner will likely draw the majority of his starts at designated hitter.
Although Rafael Devers is a star, the Red Sox still need other hitters to step up during the 2023 campaign.

     Dodgers: Justin Turner Admits Former Teammate Was a Big Factor in Signing with Sox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just by looking at guys like Justin Turner and Kike Hernandez, teammates who were a part of the 2020 World Series team together and a pair of guys fans love, it’s easy to see why Turner ended up with the Red Sox.
With the Dodgers and Turner not being able to come up with an agreement on time, Turner ultimately had to decide how he wanted to go about his playing career.
Following the 2020 World Series, Hernandez agreed to a two-year deal with the Red Sox.
As if following suit with Hernandez, Turner signed a two-year deal this off-season with Boston.
They hope to find the same spark again with the Red Sox while both players are nearing the end of their careers.

     How Patriots coach Bill Belichick helped the Red Sox recruit Justin Turner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears the Red Sox called in the big guns to help convince longtime Dodgers infielder Justin Turner to come to Boston.
Sox manager Alex Cora had Patriots head coach Bill Belichick text Turner as part of the recruiting process, according to AM570′s David Vassegh.
It’s unclear exactly what Belichick texted Turner but it surely helped, as Turner left Los Angeles after nine years and signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Red Sox that includes a club option for 2024.
On Friday, after his deal became official, Turner raved about Boston’s full-court press to recruit him.
In Oct. 2021, as the Red Sox were making a surprise run to the ALCS, Cora raved about how Belichick finally texted him.

     Summary: The Boston Red Sox finalized the signing of Justin Turner to a one-year contract with a player option for 2024, which marked the end of his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers after nine seasons.
After his signing with the Red Sox was completed, Turner posted a heartfelt message to reflect on his time with the Dodgers, influence and importance of fans, coaches and other personnel who played a part in revitalizing his career.
In 2016, Justin and Kourtney Turner established the Justin Turner Foundation, with a mission to support homeless veterans, children (and their families) battling life-altering illnesses and diseases, and provide for youth baseball organizations.
Justin Turner wanted to re-sign with DodgersThe Long Beach native hoped to finish his career with the Dodgers, but that probability decreased when they agreed to terms with J.D.
That in turn created an opportunity for Turner with the Red Sox, as he’ll now serve as their primary designated hitter.
