     Derrick Henry stiff-arms Rayshawn Jenkins out of Duval County
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derrick Henry is strong.
The Tennessee Titans running back had momentum going on a running play in the second quarter on Saturday.
Rayshawn Jenkins, not a small person at 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, made the mistake of trying to stop the great Titans RB.
Henry threw a classic stiff arm and the Jacksonville Jaguars DB went flying about 5 yards before landing out of bounds.
The play set up a TD pass from Joshua Dobbs to Chigoziem Okonkwo.

     WATCH: Titans' Derrick Henry hits Jaguars' Rayshawn Jenkins with vicious stiff arm in AFC South title showdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After sitting out the Tennessee Titans' Week 17 game, running back Derrick Henry came into Saturday night's Week 18 finale rested and ready to try and save Tennessee's season and beat the Jacksonville Jaguars in a game that will determine the AFC South title.
And if there was any doubt that King Henry is resolved to protect the Titans' throne, it was viciously dispelled on a critical drive in the first half.
Henry then proceeded to put Jenkins on a poster, throwing a stiff arm that knocked Jenkins down before being stopped by Tyson Campbell.
Henry's play set up a 21-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh Dobbs to tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo that put the Titans up 10-0.
The winner of Week 18's game will win the AFC South and move on to the playoffs, while the loser's season will come to an end.

     Derrick Henry brutally rejects Jaguars defender with stiff-arm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a while since we’ve seen a true, highlight-worthy stiff-arm from Tennessee Titans running back, Derrick Henry.
Well, the wait is now over.
During the Week 18 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Henry took a handoff to the left side, where he was met by cornerback Rayshawn Jenkins.
However, as is the case with most guys who challenge The King down the field, it didn’t end well for Jenkins, whose tackle attempt was brutally rejected via a signature Henry stiff arm that had a little extra gusto.
The run set up quarterback Joshua Dobbs’ beautiful 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo to give the Titans a 10-0 lead.
