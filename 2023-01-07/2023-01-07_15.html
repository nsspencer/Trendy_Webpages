     Raiders RB Josh Jacobs Awaits For NFL Rushing Crown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders running back Josh Jacobs is looking to become the first Raider to bring the rushing title to the Silver and Black since Marcus Allen in 1985.
In doing so, it left the door open for Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb as the lone contender to challenge Jacobs chances of winning the rushing crown.
Chubb, who currently has 1,448 rushing yards, will need 206 yards to surpass Jacobs.
The optimism is real as Chubb has never rushed for over 200 yards in a game and is averaging five yards a carry and 90 rushing yards a game.
