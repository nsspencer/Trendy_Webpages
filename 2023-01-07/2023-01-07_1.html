     Kevin McCarthy elected 55th House speaker, quashes GOP rebellion with major concessions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By a 216-212 vote, McCarthy, first elected in 2006, defeated New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries for the job.
At the end of the 14th ballot, an altercation between frustrated GOP lawmakers almost got physical on the House floor.
President Joe Biden, who had chided House Republicans for most of this week, sounded a collaborative tone after McCarthy's win.
When he spoke before handing the gavel to McCarthy, Jeffries honored former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and lauded the legislation passed under the Democrats the past four years.
House Republicans can also begin to dive into their multiple promised investigations of the Biden administration, the president's son, Hunter, the FBI and other intelligence agencies.

     McCarthy concessions to win Speakership raise eyebrows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was forced to give in to a series of demands from detractors to win the support necessary to win the Speaker’s gavel after a historic week of failed ballots.
How would you like to do this every week?” he said, referring to the internal battle that delayed McCarthy’s Speakership victory for days.
And a provision of the new House rules package requires a separate vote on hiking the debt limit.
“There will be no clean debt ceiling increase, that’s for sure,” echoed Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), another McCarthy opponent who was brought around to support him by the new concessions.
And most Republicans are brushing aside any narrative that McCarthy gave too much up for the gavel in return.

     How McCarthy survived the House chaos to win the speaker’s gavel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stunned after believing he had the votes, McCarthy faced his most embarrassing defeat yet.
In a tense meeting in the basement of the Capitol with the full House GOP Conference, McCarthy and Gaetz got into a screaming match.
Biden’s speech gave the White House – and Senate Republicans – a split screen that laid bare the vast contrast with the House Republican infighting.
Early Saturday morning, following 14 losses and more than 84 hours after the beginning of the 118th Congress, the House clerk finally announced McCarthy was elected House speaker.
Before the chaos over the final vote, McCarthy earlier Friday had sounded an optimistic note that the lengthy fight over the gavel would actually help Republicans.
