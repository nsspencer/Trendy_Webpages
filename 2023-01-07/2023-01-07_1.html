     Chiefs Conjure Up Childhood Memories With ‘Snow Globe’ Play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chiefs coach Andy Reid has long been known for his offensive creativity, particularly when it comes to the red zone.
With Kansas City leading 14–3, Patrick Mahomes and Co. took the field on second-and-3 from the Raiders’ nine-yard line with 1:02 to play in the first half.
While many compared the wild play to age-old nursery rhyme, Mahomes explained after the game that the Chiefs leaned on a different inspiration when crafting the play.
Speaking with ESPN’s Laura Rutledge, Mahomes revealed the team called the play “snow globe” as an homage to the holiday season.
The victory secured a first-round bye for the Chiefs (14–3) who will now enter the postseason as the No.
