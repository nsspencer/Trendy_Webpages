Bears GM Ryan Poles is hoping for better success with the top pick this time around.
The Texans are one of several teams that could be in search of a quarterback early in the draft.
Poles was the Kansas City Chiefs' college scouting coordinator when the team selected Central Michigan OT Eric Fisher with the first overall pick in 2013.
