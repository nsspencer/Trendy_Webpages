     Moment Kevin McCarthy Confronts Matt Gaetz Viewed 1.6 Million Times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video showing the moment that newly elected Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy confronted Republican Representative Matt Gaetz on the House floor has been viewed more than 1.6 million times.
Nonetheless, the conversation appeared to be tense and at one point Gaetz, who was sitting next to Representative Lauren Boebert, seemed to point angrily at McCarthy and one his aides.
At one point, Republican Representative Mike Rogers attempted to approach Gaetz from the aisle and he was restrained from behind by Representative Richard Hudson.
Fox News reported on Friday that Gaetz appeared to mouth the word "committee" during his exchange with McCarthy.
McCarthy was successfully elected on the 15th ballot, when six Republican holdouts, including Gaetz and Boebert, voted "present."

     McCarthy praises vocal critic Matt Gaetz for helping secure speaker win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newly elected Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) praised Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and former President Donald Trump for helping him secure the speaker's gavel in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Gaetz, whose "present" vote helped lower the vote threshold to give McCarthy the speakership, helped get his other five detractors to vote "present" during the final speaker vote instead of voting for someone else, McCarthy said.
SPEAKER SAGA: WINNERS AND LOSERS OF 15-ROUND VOTE“It became a tie and … Matt really wanted to get everybody there.
Trump was a loud backer for McCarthy as the next House speaker all week as Republican infighting delayed the start of the 118th Congress.
He helped McCarthy secure the gavel when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) got on the phone with Trump to try and talk to Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT).

     Summary: Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) praised former President Trump and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for pushing him over the finish line and helping him secure the gavel.
He was with me from the beginning,” McCarthy said of Trump after the House had adjourned for the weekend.
He was the last of the holdouts to cast a ballot, and McCarthy needed his affirmative endorsement — not a “present” vote — to win.
Gaetz cast a “present” vote on the 15th ballot as well, but so did the five other Republican holdouts.
Gaetz, for his part, said he had switched from voting for other candidates to voting “present” because “I ran out of things to ask for.”Asked if he trusts McCarthy, Gaetz suggested he does not.

     Kevin McCarthy Gets Enough House Speaker Votes, Congressman Lunges at Matt Gaetz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It went down late Friday night after the 14th vote for Speaker of the House ... where Kevin McCarthy again failed to get the required number of votes.
Play video content C-SPANRep Mike Rogers (Republican, Alabama), a McCarthy supporter, was watching Matt Gaetz ... who in part spearheaded the opposition to McCarthy and voted no.
Rogers eyeballed Gaetz having a chitchat with McCarthy, and apparently saw Gaetz mouth the word "committee."
It's unclear exactly what the 2 were talking about, but Gaetz was serving on the House Armed Services Committee, which Rogers chairs.
We're guessing -- but seems like a good guess -- Rogers was worried McCarthy was going to give the chairmanship to Gaetz in return for his vote, and that set Rogers off.

     Summary: It was nearing midnight, and he had already lost 13 votes for speaker over four long days.
Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican ally of McCarthy, had angrily confronted Gaetz, telling him he would regret his decision.
While the U.S. House is often raucous, the week’s events were almost surreal: vote after vote, defeat after defeat, and eventual success after picking off seemingly intransigent opponents.
Gaetz said his “present” vote was as far as he was going, Buck said.
ADVERTISEMENTMcCarthy said afterward that Gaetz eventually “got everybody there to the point that nobody voted against me,” persuading some of his fellow colleagues to vote “present” as well.

     Kevin McCarthy finally becomes House Speaker on 15th round of voting; Matt Gaetz loses interest after count enters teens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In return for unspecified concessions, the GOP's far right finally fell into line Friday night and voted for party leader Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker.
Even at the end, though, it took one more round of voting than expected, after Republican members Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert nailed McCarthy's 14th attempt by voting "Present" instead of "Yes"—forcing a 15th and final round which finally saw McCarthy win the seat.
It came after a dramatic pressure campaign played out live on the House floor as party rebel Matt Gaetz was urged to vote for Mr McCarthy.
Earlier, amid heated scenes in the chamber, Mr Gaetz had almost come to blows with Rep Mike Rogers – a supporter of Mr McCarthy.
The Alabama congressman had to be physically restrained by colleagues as he bellowed and jabbed his finger at Mr Gaetz.

His victory followed absolute mayhem on the House floor when Republican Rep. Mike Rogers lunged at Matt Gaetz and had to be held back by his colleagues.
While taking about Rep. Matt Gaetz, McCarthy told CNN, 'At the end of the night, Matt got everybody there from the point that nobody voted against the other way, so it actually helped unite people.'
During vote to adjourn Matt Gaetz talks to Kevin McCarthy.
No House Speaker vote has gone on this long in modern US political history, and it's set Republicans' new majority in the chamber off to a rocky start.

     How McCarthy survived the House chaos to win the speaker’s gavel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stunned after believing he had the votes, McCarthy faced his most embarrassing defeat yet.
In a tense meeting in the basement of the Capitol with the full House GOP Conference, McCarthy and Gaetz got into a screaming match.
Biden’s speech gave the White House – and Senate Republicans – a split screen that laid bare the vast contrast with the House Republican infighting.
Early Saturday morning, following 14 losses and more than 84 hours after the beginning of the 118th Congress, the House clerk finally announced McCarthy was elected House speaker.
Before the chaos over the final vote, McCarthy earlier Friday had sounded an optimistic note that the lengthy fight over the gavel would actually help Republicans.
