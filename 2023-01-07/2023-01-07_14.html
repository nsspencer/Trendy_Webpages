     Travis Scott &amp; Kylie Jenner Reportedly Break Up Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner are purportedly going their separate ways.
Travis Scott was not present.
The last public appearance Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner made together before their alleged break up was in December of 2022 during La Flame’s performance at Art Basel in Miami.
“An uninvited person was sneaking photos on what was supposed to be a closed set while I was directing a video,” Travis Scott wrote.
In October of that same year, Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner reportedly broke up — but La Flame vehemently denied the root of their separation was the result of him being unfaithful to her.

     Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott have split, apparently
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bad news for Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, who have reportedly split after five years in an on-again off-again relationship.
According to new reports, The Kardashian couple spent Christmas apart, with Kylie spending it in Aspen with their four-year-old daughter Stormi Webster, and their son, who is almost one.
As a source told US Weekly, "Kylie and Travis are off again, they were supposed to spend the holidays together, but she went to Aspen to be with her family and friends up there.
Kylie and Travis first got together in summer 2017, shortly after her split from Tyga.
Kylie still loves Travis and this isn’t considered a full break up to either of them.”Getty ImagesSo far, neither Kylie or Travis have spoken out about the split, so these rumours could easily just be that: rumours.
