     Trevor Lawrence 'excited' for first NFL playoff run: Ex-Clemson QB speaks after Jaguars clinch AFC South
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last season, the Jacksonville Jaguars were at an ultimate low with prized rookie Trevor Lawrence at quarterback.
One year later, the Jaguars clinched the AFC South with a 20-16 win Saturday over the Tennessee Titans behind the brilliance of Lawerence, the 2021 draft's No.
Lawrence is in the midst of a breakout season that so many thought he could achieve in year one in Jacksonville.
The Jaguars finished 9-8 and host a playoff game next week.
Below is what Lawrence had to say following Saturday night's win over Tennessee.

     Summary: Troy Aikman critical of Trevor Lawrence over poor playTroy Aikman did not hold back when it came to providing honest analysis during the Week 18 game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans on Saturday.
Early in the third quarter, Jacksonville had a 3rd-and-7 from the Tennessee 8 down 13-7.
He’s just as open as you could be … he’s got 10 yards,” Aikman said.
Aikman was critical of Lawrence for missing the pass attempt.
Aikman went on to point out just how much Lawrence was letting his team down in a big spot.

     Trevor Lawrence breaks Jaguars record for most pass completions in a season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Lawrence has made a huge leap in Year 2 and against the Tennessee Titans in Week 18, he broke the Jacksonville Jaguars’ record for completions by a quarterback with a pass early in the game.
Blake Bortles set the previous record with 368 completions back in 2016, his third season with the team.
Entering the game, Lawrence had 367, so it only took him a couple of completions to set the new record.
After throwing 17 interceptions in 2021, Lawrence has only six this season.
All things considered, it feels like Lawrence breaking Bortles’ record for completion in a season was inevitable given how well he’s played.

     Trevor Tracker 2022: How did Trevor Lawrence's second season compare to 2021? Here's how.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week, Trevor Lawrence gifted 12 offensive lineman luxury watches worth around $5,000 each.
In what can be considered the biggest game of Trevor Lawrence's young career, he certainly didn't have the game he would have liked.
With the Jaguars trailing 10-0, Lawrence threw a beautiful deep pass to Christian Kirk that resulted in a 25-yard touchdown.
An 8-yard pass to Jamal Agnew to begin the second half put him over 4,000 for the season.
Here's how his complete 2022 regular-season stats compare to his full 2021 season.

     Watch: Trevor Lawrence misses wide open Zay Jones in the end zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence started red hot against the Tennessee Titans in the second half of their Week 18 contest, hitting his first five passes of the third quarter.
With Lawrence cooking, the Jaguars were on the verge of a go-ahead touchdown and appeared to have it when wide receiver Zay Jones was running all by himself in the end zone.
Unfortunately for Jacksonville, Lawrence sailed the pass through the back of the end zone.
Earlier in the game, he set the single-season franchise record for completions in a season and he became the third Jaguars quarterback to eclipse 4,000 passing yards in a season.
Still, the sailed pass in the end zone looms large as the Titans held their lead.
