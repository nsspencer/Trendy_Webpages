     Summary: That’s only one more “yes” than the rules require to change rules.
As to the abstentions, one of them reportedly came from one of the teams directly impacted by the rule change.
Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com reports that the Chiefs abstained from voting on the rule change.
The Chiefs, per the report, believed that teams directly impacted by the changes shouldn’t cast a vote.
With 24 yes votes required, anything but yes is no.

     How to Watch Kansas City Chiefs vs. Las Vegas Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs are coming off a Week 17 win against one of their bitter division rivals, and they'll be looking to accomplish that same feat in Week 18 to close out their regular-season slate.
Andy Reid's bunch is on the road this weekend, traveling to Allegiant Stadium for a Saturday matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.
Kansas City (13-3) can clinch the top playoff seed in the AFC with a win, whereas Las Vegas (6-10) is coming off a narrow loss that saw quarterback Jarrett Stidham play much better than many anticipated he would.
The Raiders gave the Chiefs all they could handle, though, losing by just one point in a 30-29 Kansas City victory.
Here's how you can follow along with the Chiefs as they play today.

The Raiders nearly played spoiler against the 49ers with Jarrett Stidham under center.”A 34-20 Chiefs win is the call from NOLA.com’s Jim Derry.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chiefs’ receiving corps could finally be back to full strength if Hardman is active for this game.
He was lifted off injured reserve this week, but the Chiefs may hold him out of game action until the playoffs.
It’s been a disappointing last two weeks for Smith-Schuster, who has just five catches for 48 yards during that span.
He’s a decent flex play this week given the matchup.
He’s still not logging very many snaps, but he makes the most of his opportunities when the ball comes his way.

     Chiefs-Raiders Week 18 predictions from Arrowhead Pride
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going into Week 17, all of Arrowhead Pride’s contributors thought the Kansas City Chiefs would defeat the Denver Broncos.
When the two teams met in Week 14, the staff predicted a 13-point Kansas City victory.
The Chiefs' defense needs to generate some turnovers against a backup quarterback with more career interceptions than touchdowns.
The good news is the Raiders' defense is one of the bottom of the league in points and yards.
I don’t expect the Chiefs' defense to do the same after seeing how capable he is.
