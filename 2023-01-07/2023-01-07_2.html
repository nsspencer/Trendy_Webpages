     WATCH: Chiefs deploy spinning huddle on wild gadget play vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a 31-13 Week 18 rout of the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to do seemingly whatever they wanted on their way to the No.
On a 2nd and 3 in the red zone, the Chiefs ran a spinning huddle that resembled a "Ring Around the Rosie" before assembling on the line of scrimmage to run a gadget play.
Toney would end the play with a touchdown by breaking several tackles, but the play would be called back due to center Creed Humphrey committing a holding penalty.
Legendary quarterback Len Dawson was known to run a "choir huddle," which was run by the Chiefs as a preseason tribute to Dawson after his death last August.
The Chiefs also used a spin at the line of scrimmage on their first touchdown in Super Bowl LV, a play that was taken from the 1948 Rose Bowl.

     Summary: The Chiefs have already caught the internet's attention with stellar athletic plays from quarterback Patrick Mahomes once or twice this season.
But in the season finale versus the Las Vegas Raiders on Saturday, Kansas City debuted a new type of never-before-seen play, and it went viral.
During the second quarter of the 31-13 win, the Chiefs were at the Raiders' 9-yard line on second down.
"As the season went back on, I was kind of nudging coach (Andy) Reid like, 'Hey, let's bring it back in a different way.'
Hopefully we can maybe do it again and get back to whatever we ran last time and get another touchdown."

In fact, when I asked Reid to make the case for Mahomes as MVP (as if that would be needed), it’s the first thing he brought up.
On the play, Mahomes was chased to his left by star pass rusher Maxx Crosby, and ran to the sideline, looking for an outlet against his body.
And that’s really what I’m focused about.
On the play, Allen dropped into coverage, and Rayshawn Jenkins came free on the opposite side, getting a clean shot on Dobbs and jarring the ball free.
