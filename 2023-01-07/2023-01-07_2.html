     NFL Week 18 Chiefs-Raiders and Titans-Jaguars best bets, props, odds and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A pair of massive playoff implication games for the NFL on a Saturday before the final slate of Sunday games.
There are some fun plays today that I highly recommend as we head into the final weekend of the NFL regular season.
The only issue becomes if the Chiefs get out in front and blow out the Las Vegas Raiders.
Jarrett Stidham o250+ passing yards -105I don’t like the juice on Stidham’s over 237.5 at -125, so if you want a little better odds, take him for an extra 13 yards.
Christian Kirk o75 yards receiving +150Like the Stidham line in the early game, Kirk’s over 59.5 at -160 is terrible juice.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To Our Fans:Damar Hamlin's inspiring progress over the past few days has lifted the spirits of the entire NFL and football fans across the country.
While his recovery is just beginning, we thank the NFL medical personnel and the medical staffs from both teams whose emergency action quite likely saved his life.
Seeing the entire NFL family -- teams, players, coaches, and fans like you -- band together was yet another reminder that football is family: human, loving and resilient.
I'm deeply hopeful that with his continued progress, there is a good chance Damar himself will be watching his teammates.
On behalf of the entire NFL, thank you.

     Summary: Damar Hamlin made his first public statement on Saturday after the Buffalo Bills safety suffered cardiac arrest following an on-field collision during his team’s since-canceled Monday night game versus the Cincinnati Bengals.
“When you put real love out into the world it comes back to you 3x’s as much,” he posted on Saturday via Instagram.
“The Love has been overwhelming, but I’m thankful for every single person that prayed for me and reached out.
Although Hamlin bounced back on his feet, after taking a few steps, he collapsed backward onto the turf.
