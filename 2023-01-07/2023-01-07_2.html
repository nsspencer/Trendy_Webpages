     Summary: Betting Matchup PreviewGame DetailsWho: Kansas City Chiefs at Las Vegas RaidersWhen: Saturday, Jan. 7 (Week 18)Time: 1:30 p.m. PTWhere: Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas, NV)Betting Odds SummarySpread: Chiefs -9.5 (-105), Raiders +9.5 (-115)Moneyline: Chiefs (-450), Raiders (+350)Total: Over/Under 51.5 (-110/-110)Note: Odds and lines are current from FanDuel at the time of writing and subject to change.
The fate of the AFC’s top seed could be decided Saturday afternoon when the Kansas City Chiefs pay a visit to the Las Vegas Raiders.
RaidersThe Chiefs opened as 7.5-point road favorites over the Raiders, and that line has since moved to -9.5.
Stidham threw for 365 yards last week, but that is about as far as his sample size (with enough opportunities) extends.
Finally, we are taking an alternate spread of Chiefs -5.5 to lessen the risk of the regular line (Chiefs -9.5) and protect against critical numbers such as six and seven while still adding value to the parlay.

If the Chiefs win Saturday they should be the No.
But if the Bills lose on Sunday, a title game appearance against a one-seeded Chiefs team would still be at Arrowhead Stadium.
The team should re-sign Mecole Hardman instead of JuJu Smith-SchusterJuJu shouldn’t be re-signed this off-season.
Mecole Hardman should.

     4 Chiefs players to watch in Week 18 vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs (13-3) are set to play their final game of the regular season on the road against the Las Vegas Raiders (6-10) in Week 18.
With a victory, the Chiefs can clinch the AFC’s No.
With a loss, they’ll possibly find themselves playing on wild-card weekend.
The Raiders don’t have much to play for in this one other than to play spoiler to their most bitter rival and stop Kansas City from a clean sweep of the AFC West this season.
Here’s a look at four players for Kansas City who we’ll be paying close attention to when they square off with the Raiders on Saturday:

     Chiefs-Raiders Week 18 predictions from Arrowhead Pride
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going into Week 17, all of Arrowhead Pride’s contributors thought the Kansas City Chiefs would defeat the Denver Broncos.
When the two teams met in Week 14, the staff predicted a 13-point Kansas City victory.
The Chiefs' defense needs to generate some turnovers against a backup quarterback with more career interceptions than touchdowns.
The good news is the Raiders' defense is one of the bottom of the league in points and yards.
I don’t expect the Chiefs' defense to do the same after seeing how capable he is.
