     How to Watch Kansas City Chiefs vs. Las Vegas Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs are coming off a Week 17 win against one of their bitter division rivals, and they'll be looking to accomplish that same feat in Week 18 to close out their regular-season slate.
Andy Reid's bunch is on the road this weekend, traveling to Allegiant Stadium for a Saturday matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.
Kansas City (13-3) can clinch the top playoff seed in the AFC with a win, whereas Las Vegas (6-10) is coming off a narrow loss that saw quarterback Jarrett Stidham play much better than many anticipated he would.
The Raiders gave the Chiefs all they could handle, though, losing by just one point in a 30-29 Kansas City victory.
Here's how you can follow along with the Chiefs as they play today.

If the Chiefs win Saturday they should be the No.
But if the Bills lose on Sunday, a title game appearance against a one-seeded Chiefs team would still be at Arrowhead Stadium.
The team should re-sign Mecole Hardman instead of JuJu Smith-SchusterJuJu shouldn’t be re-signed this off-season.
Mecole Hardman should.

     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs (13-3) are set to play their final game of the regular season on the road against the Las Vegas Raiders (6-10) in Week 18.
With a victory, the Chiefs can clinch the AFC’s No.
With a loss, they’ll possibly find themselves playing on wild-card weekend.
The Raiders don’t have much to play for in this one other than to play spoiler to their most bitter rival and stop Kansas City from a clean sweep of the AFC West this season.
Here’s a look at four players for Kansas City who we’ll be paying close attention to when they square off with the Raiders on Saturday:

     Summary: LAS VEGAS — The Kansas City Chiefs know they control their destiny.
With the NFL’s decision to cancel the suspended Monday night game between Buffalo and Cincinnati, a Chiefs victory at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday makes them the AFC’s No.
“I think he showed what he’s capable of and what he can do,” Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams said.
Close callThe Raiders nearly beat the Chiefs in Kansas City when the teams met on Oct. 10 but blew a 17-point lead in a 30-29 loss.
The second game of these division rivalries is always a little bit different because you’re going to change some things.”

     Chiefs-Raiders Week 18 predictions from Arrowhead Pride
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Going into Week 17, all of Arrowhead Pride’s contributors thought the Kansas City Chiefs would defeat the Denver Broncos.
When the two teams met in Week 14, the staff predicted a 13-point Kansas City victory.
The Chiefs' defense needs to generate some turnovers against a backup quarterback with more career interceptions than touchdowns.
The good news is the Raiders' defense is one of the bottom of the league in points and yards.
I don’t expect the Chiefs' defense to do the same after seeing how capable he is.
