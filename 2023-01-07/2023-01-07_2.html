The fate of the AFCâ€™s top seed could be decided Saturday afternoon when the Kansas City Chiefs pay a visit to the Las Vegas Raiders.
RaidersThe Chiefs opened as 7.5-point road favorites over the Raiders, and that line has since moved to -9.5.
Stidham threw for 365 yards last week, but that is about as far as his sample size (with enough opportunities) extends.
Finally, we are taking an alternate spread of Chiefs -5.5 to lessen the risk of the regular line (Chiefs -9.5) and protect against critical numbers such as six and seven while still adding value to the parlay.
