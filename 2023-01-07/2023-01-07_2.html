     Summary: A pair of massive playoff implication games for the NFL on a Saturday before the final slate of Sunday games.
There are some fun plays today that I highly recommend as we head into the final weekend of the NFL regular season.
The only issue becomes if the Chiefs get out in front and blow out the Las Vegas Raiders.
Jarrett Stidham o250+ passing yards -105I don’t like the juice on Stidham’s over 237.5 at -125, so if you want a little better odds, take him for an extra 13 yards.
Christian Kirk o75 yards receiving +150Like the Stidham line in the early game, Kirk’s over 59.5 at -160 is terrible juice.

Seeing the entire NFL family -- teams, players, coaches, and fans like you -- band together was yet another reminder that football is family: human, loving and resilient.
I'm deeply hopeful that with his continued progress, there is a good chance Damar himself will be watching his teammates.
