The fate of the AFCâ€™s top seed could be decided Saturday afternoon when the Kansas City Chiefs pay a visit to the Las Vegas Raiders.
RaidersThe Chiefs opened as 7.5-point road favorites over the Raiders, and that line has since moved to -9.5.
Stidham threw for 365 yards last week, but that is about as far as his sample size (with enough opportunities) extends.
Finally, we are taking an alternate spread of Chiefs -5.5 to lessen the risk of the regular line (Chiefs -9.5) and protect against critical numbers such as six and seven while still adding value to the parlay.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chiefsâ€™ receiving corps could finally be back to full strength if Hardman is active for this game.
He was lifted off injured reserve this week, but the Chiefs may hold him out of game action until the playoffs.
Itâ€™s been a disappointing last two weeks for Smith-Schuster, who has just five catches for 48 yards during that span.
Heâ€™s a decent flex play this week given the matchup.
Heâ€™s still not logging very many snaps, but he makes the most of his opportunities when the ball comes his way.
