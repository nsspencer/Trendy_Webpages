     Summary: “We like the players we gave up.
It was not easy for us; they all contributed last year, particularly Vierling and Maton,” president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said.
“But we just felt the opportunity to add another back-end arm that we really, really like -- that we also have control over for at least three years -- that it was a deal that would help make us better going into the season.”

     Law: The Tigers cash in by trading Gregory Soto to the Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s better than a lefty specialist, but he’s not good enough for high-leverage work on a contending team.
With all the first base/DH types the Phillies have, I don’t know where he fits.
He also cut his strikeout rate from 2021, although that year was a fairly small sample in the majors.
He’s the sort of player you love to have, although you might not go out of your way to acquire him.

     Phillies Strengthen Bullpen Again By Grabbing Gregory Soto From Tigers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gregory Soto's strong left arm is moving to Philadelphia after a five-man trade with Detroit.
(Photo ... [+] by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) Getty ImagesLess than a week after landing the major-league leader in saves, the Philadelphia Phillies have bolstered their bullpen for the third time this winter.
Pending physicals, the National League champions acquired highly-coveted lefty closer Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, along with infielder Kody Clemens, for outfielder Matt Vierling, infielder-outfielder Nick Maton, and promising Triple-A catcher Donny Sands.
Though subject to arbitration for the first time this year, Soto will be under Philadelphia team control through 2025 – longer than Kimbrel or Strahm.
Fleet Trea Turner signed an 11-year, $300 million pact to play shortstop and steal bases for the ... [+] Philadelphia Phillies.

     Gregory Soto trade: Phillies acquire lefty reliever from Tigers in five-player swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies obtained lefty reliever Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers on Saturday as part of a five-player swap.
Nevertheless, the Phillies likely found Soto intriguing in part because of his combination of stuff and deception.
The latter's arrival led Dombrowski to suggest the Phillies would likely enter the season with a closer-by-committee approach.
The Tigers, for their part, received in return three hitters who should see big-league action during the 2023 season.
He's batted .260/.309/.374 (91 OPS+) in 151 big-league games over the last two seasons while seeing most of his action in center field.

     Phillies "Working On A Trade" For Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have continued to strengthen their roster following their World Series defeat last year, acquiring left-handed reliever Gregory Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens in a trade with the Tigers.
The strikeout rate represented something of a dip for Soto, as it sat at 27.5% just a year prior.
Signed out of the Dominican Republic back in 2012, Soto came up through the Tigers’ system as a starting pitcher.
The Phillies pen now includes Kimbrel, Soto and Strahm, as well as Seranthony Dominguez, Jose Alvarado, Andrew Bellatti and Connor Brogdon.
Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported on Twitter that the Phillies and Tigers were working on a trade.
