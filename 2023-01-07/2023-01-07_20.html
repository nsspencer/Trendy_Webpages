     Six-year-old shoots teacher in Virginia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Six-year-old boy shoots his teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, USA.
[Photo/Agencies]A six-year-old student shot his first grade school teacher in Virginia during an "altercation", according to police.
Drew told reporters it didn't appear that the student and teacher knew each other beyond the classroom environment.
The teacher -- identified as Abigail "Abby" Zwerner, 25, by Fox3 Now News -- suffered "life threatening injuries" from the shooting, authorities said Friday.
The third occurred in Feb 2000 when a six-year-old boy shot a female classmate to death.

     Virginia Six-Year Old Shooting Teacher ‘A Red Flag for the Country,’ Mayor Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mayor of Newport News, Virginia where, a day earlier, a six-year-old elementary student brought a gun to school and intentionally shot his teacher, called the incident a “red flag for the country” during a press conference Saturday.
Mayor Phillip Jones told reporters that the teacher — a woman in her 30s — remains hospitalized following the shooting, but is “trending in a positive direction.”The incident took place Friday at Richneck Elementary School, with the first grade student (whose name is being withheld by law enforcement due to the age of the child) firing one shot at his teacher, who suffered “life-threatening injuries.”“This was not an accidental shooting,” Police Chief Steve Drew said.
A classmate of the six-year-old boy told the Daily Press that the teacher was shot in the stomach and that the shooter did it “on purpose.”The six-year-old boy was detained and taken into police custody following the shooting; because of his young age, he cannot be charged as an adult over the incident, nor can he be placed into the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if he’s found guilty of any charges, the Associated Press reports.
Authorities and Jones didn’t elaborate on the specifics of the shooting — or how the six-year-old obtained the gun — citing the pending investigation.
The youngest incident on record happened in 2013, when a five-year-old kindergartener fired a gun in a cafeteria; no one was injured in that incident.

     Virginia school district where 6-year-old allegedly shot teacher has had 3 school-related shootings in 17 months
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Virginia school district where a 6-year-old allegedly intentionally shot a teacher on Friday has had three instances of gun violence on district property in the past 17 months.
Police say a 6-year-old boy seriously injured a teacher at Richneck Elementary School when he opened fire in a classroom.
Before Friday's incident, there were shootings at two other schools within the Newport News Public Schools system that shook the community.
Hanan Daoud, who also has children within the school district, agrees.
Daoud told NBC News she recalled feeling "paralyzed" after hearing that there had been a shooting in the school district on Friday.

     6-year-old student shoots teacher in Virginia classroom, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A 6-year-old student shot and wounded a teacher at his school in Virginia during an altercation inside a first-grade classroom Friday, police and school officials in the city of Newport News said.
“We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters, later adding that the gunshot was not an accident.
A school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Boston’s Northeastern University.
Fox told The Associated Press Friday evening that he could think of one previous incident involving a child that age.
Another factor that stands out about the Virginia shooting is that it occurred in a classroom, Fox said.
