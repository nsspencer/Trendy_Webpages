     Warriors' Klay Thompson injury draws update from Steve Kerr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Paolo Songco · 2 min readKlay Thompson‘s absence from Saturday’s loss to the Orlando Magic game out of nowhere.
The veteran shooting guard was listed as a starter for the Golden State Warriors and it wasn’t until after tip-off that it was revealed that Thompson was a very late scratch due to a left knee injury.
After the game, Dubs head coach Steve Kerr revealed that it was the training staff who sensed Thompson’s injury before the game.
Based on their recommendation, Kerr decided that it would be prudent to have Klay sit this one out.
The Warriors get two days off before returning to action on Tuesday against the struggling Phoenix Suns.

     Klay Thompson scratched from Warriors-Magic due to left knee soreness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- Saturday night's Warriors game against the Orlando Magic was supposed to be all about the return of Andrew Wiggins and Andre Iguodala.
The tone at Chase Center quickly turned to confusion when Klay Thompson was introduced as part of the starting lineup but wasn't on the court when the game tipped off.
Thompson surprisingly wasn't part of the starting five and wasn't even on the Warriors' bench when the game began.
As the first quarter wound down, the Warriors announced Thompson officially is out for the entire game with left knee soreness.
Thompson this season also is averaging 20.6 points per game and shooting 38.3 percent from beyond the arc, putting up a career-high 10.4 threes per game.

     Injury Update: Klay Thompson Unexpectedly Ruled OUT vs. Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After initially being listed as available, Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson was unexpectedly scratched from the lineup just minutes before tip-off on Saturday night.
Hopefully this is nothing serious for Thompson, and his late scratch is just an abundance of caution.
The Warriors just got Andrew Wiggins back from injury, and now lose Klay Thompson at the exact same time.
They will need their top talent healthy in order to accomplish this, so hopefully Klay Thompson is not forced to miss any more time after this very late scratch against the Orlando Magic.

     Klay Thompson OUT Saturday vs. Magic with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Update: Thompson has a knee injury and he will not play in Saturday’s game.
He felt the pain before the opening tip and the Warriors have decided to exercise some caution with their shooting guard.
There’s no back-to-back scenario here for the Warriors to rest Thompson as they usually do, so it’s not exactly clear what’s happening.
Klay Thompson pulled from the starting lineup right before tip.
We’ll eventually get an update on Thompson’s status from the Warriors, and that’ll provide more clarity on the situation.
