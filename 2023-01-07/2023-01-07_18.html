     Phillies add All-Star Soto in 5-player trade with Tigers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We like the players we gave up.
It was not easy for us; they all contributed last year, particularly Vierling and Maton,” president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said.
“But we just felt the opportunity to add another back-end arm that we really, really like -- that we also have control over for at least three years -- that it was a deal that would help make us better going into the season.”

     Phillies trade Matt Vierling, Nick Maton for Tigers closer Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have acquired left-handed reliever Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, the latest in a series of additions to the back end of their bullpen.
The Phils will send utilityman Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling and catcher Donny Sands to Detroit for Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens, Roger's son.
Soto is a hard-throwing, high-leverage lefty who has spent the last two seasons as the Tigers' closer.
Dominguez, Kimbrel, Soto, Alvarado, Strahm and right-handers Connor Brogdon and Andrew Bellatti will likely claim seven of the bullpen's eight or nine spots, barring injury.
The trade will put the Phillies' luxury tax payroll at approximately $254 million.

     How does loss of Gregory Soto affect Tigers’ bullpen?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Tigers have traded away two of their top relievers this winter, including their two-time All-Star closer.
The Tigers sent closer Gregory Soto to the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday, leaving the bullpen without a closer or a high-leverage left-handed reliever.
The Tigers are likely to add another lefty.
Hinch, before making Soto the regular closer, had always preferred a less rigid approach to bullpen management.
Matt Moore, who pitched for the Tigers in 2019, would probably fall somewhere in between Norris and Chafin in terms of dollars.

     What's next for Detroit Tigers' bullpen after trading Gregory Soto? Look to free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Tigers could have kept Gregory Soto.
Soto fit the profile for the Tigers: He won't become a free agent until after the 2025 season, and his fastball often reaches triple digits.
In doing so, Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris finalized his decision about Soto, opting not to wait until the trade deadline this summer.
UNDERSTANDING THE DEAL:Why Tigers acquired these three position players in trade with PhilliesThe Soto situation is fairly simple to understand.
Reliever signs minor-league contractThe Tigers signed right-handed reliever Aneurys Zabala to a minor-league contract in late December.

     Phillies Strengthen Bullpen Again By Grabbing Gregory Soto From Tigers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gregory Soto's strong left arm is moving to Philadelphia after a five-man trade with Detroit.
(Photo ... [+] by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) Getty ImagesLess than a week after landing the major-league leader in saves, the Philadelphia Phillies have bolstered their bullpen for the third time this winter.
Pending physicals, the National League champions acquired highly-coveted lefty closer Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, along with infielder Kody Clemens, for outfielder Matt Vierling, infielder-outfielder Nick Maton, and promising Triple-A catcher Donny Sands.
Though subject to arbitration for the first time this year, Soto will be under Philadelphia team control through 2025 – longer than Kimbrel or Strahm.
Fleet Trea Turner signed an 11-year, $300 million pact to play shortstop and steal bases for the ... [+] Philadelphia Phillies.

     Law: The Tigers cash in by trading Gregory Soto to the Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s better than a lefty specialist, but he’s not good enough for high-leverage work on a contending team.
With all the first base/DH types the Phillies have, I don’t know where he fits.
He also cut his strikeout rate from 2021, although that year was a fairly small sample in the majors.
He’s the sort of player you love to have, although you might not go out of your way to acquire him.
