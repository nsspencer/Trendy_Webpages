     Earl Boen, Terminator Actor &amp; Voice of LeChuck in Monkey Island, Has Died
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was great to hear Dominic Armato return as the voice of Guybrush Threepwood in Return to Monkey Island when it launched last September, but fans were disappointed Earl Boen did not return to Monkey Island as the voice of LeChuck.
He did at least give his blessing to the new voice actor, Jess Harnell, but anyone hoping to hear Boen reprise the role at a later time can sadly put that dream to rest.
Earl Boen has died at the age of 81.
He also did many more roles than the Monkey Island villain.
But while Earl Boen has died, he lives on in his diverse body of work.
