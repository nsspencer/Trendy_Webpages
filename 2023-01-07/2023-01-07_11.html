     Brazil stocks set to slide as world leaders condemn pro-Bolsonaro riots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRASILIA, Brazil - Jan. 08, 2023: Damage caused at the Supreme Court by supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
The demonstrators refused to accept his legitimate October election defeat to leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Brazilian stocks are expected to fall on Monday after supporters of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed government buildings on Sunday in protest against his election loss.
In a tweet Sunday night, U.S. President Joe Biden condemned what he called "the assault on democracy and the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil."
The Brazilian president received words of support from Moscow, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Russia condemned the instigators "in the strongest terms," according to Reuters.

     Brazil markets to see fresh volatility after Bolsonaro supporters storm capital

     Summary: [1/2] Supporters of Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro are pictured through broken glass as they hold a demonstration against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Brasilia, Brazil, January 8, 2023.
REUTERS/Adriano MachadoMEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian assets face fresh volatility on Monday after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key government buildings, echoing the U.S. Jan. 6 insurrection of 2021, analysts said.
Ricardo Lacerda, founder and CEO of Brazilian investment bank BR Partners (BRBI11.SA), said he expects markets to react with volatility in the short term, especially on Monday, given the higher institutional risk.
Isaac Sidney, head of banking industry group Febraban, called for "firm reaction" against Sunday's unrest.
"I think the situation will quickly normalize," said Cristian Maggio, head of portfolio strategy at TD Securities in London.
