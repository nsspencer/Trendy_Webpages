     House Speaker voting highlights America’s sad compulsion to applaud

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareYears ago I was assigned to review a painfully unfunny off-Broadway comedy.
And as each speech finished for the two major contestants, the same ritual repeated: The supporting contingents rose and clapped wildly.
As the week drew on and the House members went through this act again and again and again, I started to wonder: Who or what was this demonstration for?
Were they a show for the cameras, as if viewers had to be reminded that the members were excited by their leaders?
As he leaves Vienna, the good-hearted Duke of “Measure for Measure” expresses his mistrust of the roars of the crowd.

     Hakeem Jeffries Goes Through Democratic ABCs in Minority Leader Speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video contentRep. Hakeem Jeffries was feeling musical on the House floor after being elected House Minority Leader for the Democratic Party ... and he let his song be heard by all, from A to Z.
We'll get to him in a minute, but first ... listen to Jeffries' ABCs of red, white and blue.
Jeffries got huge applause throughout, and what sounds like a standing O at the end.
You could argue there was just as much enthusiasm within the GOP, when now-House Speaker McCarthy delivered his remarks to cap off the long night ... when he promised to push a strong conservative agenda and to reign in a lot of Pres.
