     Justin Turner gets honest on joining forces with Red Sox’ Rafael Devers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Joey Mistretta · 2 min readJustin Turner recently opened up on joining the Boston Red Sox.
But Turner is a third baseman and the Red Sox happen to have a superstar at the hot corner in Rafael Devers, who recently inked a massive extension.
Nevertheless, Turner admitted that he’s excited to watch Devers patrol the position in Boston, per Ian Browne of MLB.com.
As a result of Rafael Devers’ presence, Justin Turner will likely draw the majority of his starts at designated hitter.
Although Rafael Devers is a star, the Red Sox still need other hitters to step up during the 2023 campaign.

     How Patriots coach Bill Belichick helped the Red Sox recruit Justin Turner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears the Red Sox called in the big guns to help convince longtime Dodgers infielder Justin Turner to come to Boston.
Sox manager Alex Cora had Patriots head coach Bill Belichick text Turner as part of the recruiting process, according to AM570′s David Vassegh.
It’s unclear exactly what Belichick texted Turner but it surely helped, as Turner left Los Angeles after nine years and signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Red Sox that includes a club option for 2024.
On Friday, after his deal became official, Turner raved about Boston’s full-court press to recruit him.
In Oct. 2021, as the Red Sox were making a surprise run to the ALCS, Cora raved about how Belichick finally texted him.
