While in the huddle in the second quarter, the Chiefs looked like they played a game of "Ring Around the Rosie."
Then they broke out of the huddle in some new version of a wildcat they probably invented this week.
The Chiefs beat the Raiders, 31-13, to clinch the AFC's top seed and earn a first-round playoff bye.

     WATCH: Chiefs deploy spinning huddle on wild gadget play vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a Week 18 rout of the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to do seemingly whatever they wanted on their way to the No.
On a 2nd and 3 in the red zone, the Chiefs ran a spinning huddle that resembled a "Ring Around the Rosie" before assembling on the line of scrimmage to run a gadget play.
Toney would end the play with a touchdown by breaking several tackles, but the play would be called back due to center Creed Humphrey committing a holding penalty.
Legendary quarterback Len Dawson was known to run a "choir huddle," which was run by the Chiefs as a preseason tribute to Dawson after his death last August.
The Chiefs also used a spin at the line of scrimmage on their first touchdown in Super Bowl LV, a play that was taken from the 1948 Rose Bowl.

Kansas City is the AFC's No.
Kansas City took care of business on Saturday, and Reid's club will soon reap the benefits.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They needed a Chiefs loss to earn the coveted top spot, meaning the best they could have ended up was second in the conference, considering the Chiefs’ win over the Raiders.
The only way the Bengals will finish second in the AFC is with a win over the Ravens and a Bills loss to the Patriots.
If the Bills win, the Bengals will play the Ravens or Chargers in the first round, no matter what happens at Paycor Stadium on Sunday.
The Chiefs’ win also takes the Bengals out of consideration for a neutral site AFC Championship Game.
Now, if the Bengals play the Chiefs or the Bills as the lower-seeded team, they’ll play a true road game.

     Summary: That locked up the top seed and a bye in the first round of the AFC playoffs for the Chiefs.
“Getting a bye is like winning a playoff game.”That means the Chiefs, 14-3, will be back at Arrowhead Stadium for a divisional round playoff game on the weekend of Jan. 21-22.
If the Chiefs win, they could be host to the AFC Championship Game, too.
The only way a neutral-site AFC Championship Game would take place is if the Bills, 12-3, win Sunday and advance to the title game, along with the Chiefs.
The cancellation of Monday’s Bills-Bengals game forced the NFL to put a contingency plan in place for a neutral-site AFC Championship Game.
