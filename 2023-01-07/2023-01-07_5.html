READ MORE Harry Kane edges closer to Tottenham record in FA Cup win over PortsmouthEight-time FA Cup winners Tottenham, who lost to Portsmouth in the 2010 semi-final, fielded a strong line-up but failed to register a shot on target against their third-tier opponents in the first half but improved after the break to dominate.
Sometimes you can think too much," Kane said of edging closer to Greaves's landmark.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham 1-0 Portsmouth (Kane 50′)TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM – Harry Kane moved a goal closer to Jimmy Greaves’ all-time club record as his 265th Spurs goal saw Antonio Conte’s side past spirited Portsmouth and into the FA Cup fourth round.
Spurs’ opener had nearly come from a far unlikelier source moments earlier when Emerson Royal met Son Heung-min’s cross and headed onto the post.

Lewis Thompson gave him a well-timed reminder of that with a thumping tackle as Portsmouth refused to lie down.
All eyes will be on the England captain in next week’s north London derby against Arsenal, when he can equal Greaves’ record with a goal or break it with a brace.
