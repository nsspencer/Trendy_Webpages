     Serie A: AS Roma snatches last-gasp draw against Milan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A goal in stoppage time by Tammy Abraham helped AS Roma snatch a 2-2 draw at AC Milan on Sunday, as Stefano Pioli’s side’s hopes of catching up to Serie A leaders Napoli suffered a blow.
It was a soggy night at the San Siro, creating slippery conditions that affected the play.
Milan’s Pierre Kalulu scored first when he headed in from a corner on the half-hour mark.
Roger Ibanez pulled one back for Roma three minutes before stoppage time when he headed in a corner, and Abraham completed the late comeback six minutes later when he managed to send in a rebound from inside the box.
Milan is now third in the Serie A table with 37 points after 17 games, equal with second-placed Juventus on points and seven behind Napoli.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Siro stage is set for AC Milan v Roma, a real classic with great significance.
The points at stake could give an important boost in the top areas of Serie A: AC Milan at 36, Roma at 30.
There have been a few days to come back from the Arechi and prepare for San Siro, and it is no coincidence that there are no new recoveries, and the offensive department is the one to pay the most.
Among the certainties, Tonali will have to try and stay out of the book.
"Roma are strong and well-rounded," said coach Pioli in his press conference on the eve of the match, "they combine game organisation with quality and physicality; they score a lot from set pieces.

     Summary: Clashes took place earlier in the day between Roma fans traveling to Milan and Napoli supporters heading to Genoa.
There were video tributes before the match to former Sampdoria players Gianluca Vialli and Siniša Mihajlović, who both died recently.
Flowers were also laid by the side of the field by members of the Sampdoria staff and the Italy players from Napoli.
Napoli was looking to recover from a 1-0 defeat to Inter Milan on Wednesday, when the league resumed after a 7 ½-week break.
Lazio was three points behind fourth-placed Inter Milan, which was held to a 2-2 draw at Monza on Saturday.

     Serie A: Napoli moves seven clear to ruin Sampdoria's Vialli and Mihajlovic send-off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: by Terry Daley , over 1 hour agoNapoli moved seven points clear at the top of Serie A after Sunday's 2-0 win at 10-man Sampdoria, which paid tribute to deceased greats Gianluca Vialli and Sinisa Mihajlovic.
Victor Osimhen poked Napoli ahead in the 19th minute before Eljif Elmas sealed the points with a perfectly-place penalty with eight minutes remaining at a soaking Stadio Luigi Ferraris in Genoa.
The win extended Napoli's lead on Juventus, a 1-0 winner over Udinese on Saturday, and AC Milan, a further point back in third.
Mihajlovic, who played for Sampdoria in the mid-1990s and later managed the club, succumbed to leukemia last month and Sunday's match was the first home fixture since he passed away.
A giant banner hung in the stands for Vialli read "Striker.
