     Travis Kelce says the No. 1 seed has been the goal since the season began
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs will finish their regular season schedule with a Week 18 matchup against their AFC West division rivals, the Las Vegas Raiders.
“Sure enough, you’ll probably see on [Saturday] how well we go at it.”It’s safe to say Kelce loves playing the Raiders.
He’s scored a touchdown or gone for over 100 yards in four of the five games since the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas in 2020.
During Kansas City’s Week 5 matchup against them this season, Kelce practically lived in the endzone as he finished the day with four touchdown catches.
Regardless of the reward for it, Kelce says the number-one seed was always Kansas City’s goal and remains a big motivator for the team as they close out the regular season.

     Travis Kelce’s Contract With the Chiefs Might be the Best Value in the NFL, For Now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travis Kelce’s Contract With the Chiefs Might be the Best Value in the NFL, For NowKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is inarguably the best player at his position in the NFL right now.
The best part of all in 2022, though, is that the Travis Kelce contract is so good right now it may also be the best value in the game.
The Travis Kelce contractTravis Kelce | Jason Hanna/Getty ImagesTravis Kelce came into the league during the 2013 NFL Draft when the Chiefs took the Cincinnati TE No.
And once you’ve earned a place in Canton, the question becomes, is Travis Kelce the best tight end of all time?
The one record he already owns has to do with the Travis Kelce contracts over the years.
