     Summary: The Jacksonville Jaguars traveled across the country in September to blowout the Los Angeles Chargers by 28 points, but oddsmakers don’t like their chances of doing it again.
At BetMGM, the Jaguars opened as a 2.5-point underdog for their playoff game against the Chargers at TIAA Bank Field.
The Jaguars and Chargers have never met in the postseason before, but the two teams have faced each other 10 times since 2010.
Jacksonville’s 38-10 win over Los Angeles in Week 3 comes with some caveats.
Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence finished that win with 262 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions.

Despite the deck being heavily stacked against them, the Titans still managed to put up a tremendous fight.
In fact, they should’ve won the game and sent Jacksonville packing instead.
The Titans’ incredibly frustrating and disappointing season is finally over, and now the fun begins, as Tennessee is almost certainly going to make massive changes all across the roster this offseason.
More conversation will be had about that in due time, but for now let’s take a look back at Saturday night and see what the biggest takeaways from the 2022 season finale were.
