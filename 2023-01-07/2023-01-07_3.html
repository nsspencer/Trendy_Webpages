     Pair of Former Tigers Look to Lead Jacksonville Jaguars to NFL Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Days like today are what fans and executives of the Jacksonville Jaguars imagined when the NFL franchise selected Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft.
They just might not have believed they'd be in this position in Year 2 with the former Clemson backfield stars.
If the Jaguars are able to pull it off in head coach Doug Pederson's first year with the organization, Lawrence and Etienne will receive a ton of credit.
Lawrence has thrown for 3,901 yards and 24 touchdowns while completing 66.5% of his passes in 16 games.
1 draft pick in 2021, Lawrence threw for over 10,000 and 90 touchdowns in three years with the Tigers.

     5 Jaguars players to watch vs. Titans in Week 18
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On paper, there’s no reason why the Jacksonville Jaguars shouldn’t roll to the AFC South title with an easy win Saturday night against the Tennessee Titans.
But victories in the NFL rarely come without push back.
The Titans are on a six-game losing streak and lost starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill to the injured reserve, but they can pull out of that tailspin and earn the division title by upsetting the Jaguars in primetime.
For Jacksonville to avoid that massive disappointment, the team can’t take its Saturday night opportunity lightly.
Here are five Jaguars who need to play well against the Titans to ensure the AFC South title belongs to Duval:
