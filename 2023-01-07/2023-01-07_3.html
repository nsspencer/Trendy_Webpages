     WATCH: Chiefs deploy spinning huddle on wild gadget play vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a Week 18 rout of the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to do seemingly whatever they wanted on their way to the No.
On a 2nd and 3 in the red zone, the Chiefs ran a spinning huddle that resembled a "Ring Around the Rosie" before assembling on the line of scrimmage to run a gadget play.
Toney would end the play with a touchdown by breaking several tackles, but the play would be called back due to center Creed Humphrey committing a holding penalty.
Legendary quarterback Len Dawson was known to run a "choir huddle," which was run by the Chiefs as a preseason tribute to Dawson after his death last August.
The Chiefs also used a spin at the line of scrimmage on their first touchdown in Super Bowl LV, a play that was taken from the 1948 Rose Bowl.

Ronald Jones, Kadarius Toney and Isiah Pacheco each ran in touchdowns for the Chiefs while Harrison Butker kicked a 44-yard field goal.
