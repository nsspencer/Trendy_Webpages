     Pair of Former Tigers Look to Lead Jacksonville Jaguars to NFL Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Days like today are what fans and executives of the Jacksonville Jaguars imagined when the NFL franchise selected Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft.
They just might not have believed they'd be in this position in Year 2 with the former Clemson backfield stars.
If the Jaguars are able to pull it off in head coach Doug Pederson's first year with the organization, Lawrence and Etienne will receive a ton of credit.
Lawrence has thrown for 3,901 yards and 24 touchdowns while completing 66.5% of his passes in 16 games.
1 draft pick in 2021, Lawrence threw for over 10,000 and 90 touchdowns in three years with the Tigers.
