     U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy pledges to tackle immigration, 'woke' education policies and IRS funding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jon Cherry | ReutersNewly elected U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy took the gavel of the chamber after a bruising weeklong battle within his own party, promising to carry out a conservative, America-first agenda, tackling the immigration crisis at the Mexican border, cutting back funding at the IRS and fixing "woke indoctrination in our schools."
He said the first legislation he plans to tackle will repeal funding for more than 87,000 new IRS agents.
McCarthy said the tense showdown on the House floor this week was proof that he is not someone who gives up easily.
Though his election marked the end of a long week and night in Washington, McCarthy said it was also a new beginning for the nation.
Republican members-elect celebrate as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is elected Speaker of the House in the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 07, 2023 in Washington, DC.

     The Shakespearean Tragedy of Kevin McCarthy, Prince of Washington
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McCarthy must concede and concede even more to slake his own.”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) holds up the Speaker's gavel after winning the House speakership election in the 15th round of voting at the U.S. Capitol Jan. 7, 2023.
Although Young and Marcus opted for Macbeth, it was also hard not to think of Julius Caesar, Shakespeare’s recounting of the most famous betrayal of all time.
And it was power that McCarthy wanted and power that a tenth of the House GOP caucus wanted to wrest from him.
“I don’t care if we go to plurality and elect Hakeem Jeffries,” Gaetz declared in the meeting, according to McCarthy.
“Seasoned legislator, an experienced leader, a friend to so many of us, a proud conservative with a tireless work ethic, Kevin McCarthy has earned the speakership of the People’s House,” she said, echoing his words.
