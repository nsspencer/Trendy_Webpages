     Katie Porter Read A Certain Book While Republicans Brawled

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday, hours before McCarthy belatedly clinched the gig, California Democratic representative Katie Porter was spotted leaning back in her chair reading a book.
The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, the bestseller by Mark Manson.
Manson‚Äôs book, which is both an anti-self help book that‚Äôs also a self-help book, preaches the gospel of ignoring the things you can‚Äôt control and focusing on those you can.
You win Katie Porter.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After days of deliberations and 15‚Äîyes, 15‚Äîrounds of voting, Kevin McCarthy may have gotten his prize, but Katie Porter won the day without saying a word.
Chaos is a good word to describe the complete fiasco of a congressional session that took place last week.
As the arguing and the repeated voting stretched on, House Republicans‚Äô patience wore thin.
All the while, Porter sat back, reading her book, reveling in the complete and utter cluster cuss on the House floor.
And Katie Porter will still be reading her book by the light of the dumpster fire.

     Summary: Amid a tense week of GOP squabbling over who would become the next House speaker, Democratic Representative Katie Porter transformed into an internet darling over her choice in literature.
On Friday, the California lawmaker was pictured in the lower chamber reading the book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** by Mark Manson.
"You win Katie Porter.
You win Katie Porter.

     Summary: Porter, dressed to match the books cover, was reading, ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F‚Äìk,‚Äù making a not-so-subtle statement that captured how many Democrats were feeling after watching Republicans try and fail to elect a House speaker again and again over four days.
The beleaguered California Republican was finally elected House speaker on the 15th ballot since Tuesday, winning over most of the holdouts while six anti-McCarthy Republicans voted ‚Äúpresent‚Äù to let him win.
The price he paid is an agreement that will dramatically reshape the way the House of Representatives is run.
‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F‚Äìk‚Äù argues that people should learn to cope with bad situations in order to be happy.
Americans deserve more than House Republicans‚Äô inability to govern‚Äîand better than their proposed rule changes,‚Äù Porter tweeted after McCarthy won the election.

     Rep.-elect Katie Porter reads book in the House Chamber on the fourth day of elections for Speaker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democratic Rep. Katie Porter was seen peacefully reading a book amid chaotic scenes in the House Chamber yesterday as Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers was restrained when he lunged toward fellow Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.
Porter addressed the Republican in-fighting in the run-up to McCarthy's protracted election later on Twitter, saying: 'The 15th time's the charm, apparently.'
Another Twitter-user wrote: 'Freaking love Katie Porter‚Ä¶just doing her thing while the children on the other side of the House are fighting.'
However, one person joked that the title of the book could pertain to a recent scandal she was involved in.
McCarthy began in his victory speech - moments after Rogers had to be held back from attacking Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.
