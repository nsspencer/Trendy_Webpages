     Report: Sean McVay considering stepping away from Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean McVay reportedly is considering stepping away from the Los Angeles Rams.
ESPN’s Chris Mortensen also reported in December that Rams offensive coordinator Liam Coen was planning a return to the same role at Kentucky next season.
McVay is still under contract with the Rams until 2026.
Should he step away, the contract would remain and he’d still be considered a member of the franchise.
It’s similar to Sean Payton's current situation with the New Orleans Saints.

     Sean McVay net worth: How much is Rams head coach making in 2023?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McVay has racked up a 60-37 record in six seasons, with two NFC championships and a Super Bowl ring to go with that.
McVay signed the deal in the 2022 offseason; he had one year remaining on his previous pact.
In 2019, McVay signed a five-year extension that would keep him locked in with Los Angeles through 2023.
The agreement came on the heels of a Super Bowl appearance by the Rams, who fell 13-3 to the Patriots in Super Bowl 53.
Sportscriber has McVay's net worth at around $7 million, though his annual salary is reportedly double that.

     Sean McVay's future as Los Angeles Rams coach in limbo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean McVay's immediate future as the Los Angeles Rams' head coach is in limbo, multiple sources told ESPN on Saturday.
Los Angeles is 5-11 -- the first time since the Rams hired him in 2017 that McVay will have a losing record as a head coach.
Sources believe McVay needs time to recharge and to determine whether he has the energy to continue coaching next season.
And their offensive coordinator, Liam Coen, is planning to return to his offensive coordinator job at Kentucky, sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen last month.
Former Lions quarterback and current Rams signal-caller Matthew Stafford was eligible to come off injured reserve on Saturday, but Los Angeles opted against activating him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams can make life a lot easier for Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions by beating the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.
Before Goff was seemingly the Rams quarterback of the future, there was Kurt Warner and after Warner, Marc Bulger.
In 2016 the Rams drafted Goff, and the next year the Rams brought in Sean McVay.
Remember when Jared Goff and his Detroit Lions upset the Arizona Cardinals last season?
It’s not a question that the Rams trade of Goff to the Lions was worth it.

     Summary: Adam Schefter reported on Saturday night that McVay’s future as the Rams’ head coach is in limbo and that he’ll take some time after the season ends Sunday to think about the next step for him.
“His immediate future as the Rams’ head coach is in limbo,” Schefter said on NFL Live.
The defending Super Bowl champions have been decimated by injuries, and sources believe it has taken its toll on McVay.
Sources believe McVay needs time to recharge and to determine whether he has the energy to continue coaching next season.
But perhaps a 5-11 season, the worst ever by a defending Super Bowl champion, has been too much for McVay.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There's an old adage that the NFL stands for "Not For Long" and that may be the case regarding Sean McVay's tenure as the Los Angeles Rams head coach.
McVay became the youngest head coach in NFL history when Los Angeles hired him at 30 years old in January 2017.
According to ESPN, Amazon was one of multiple NFL broadcast partners to express interest in hiring the Rams head coach as an analyst.
"I think it's flattering," Rams head coach Sean McVay said when asked about networks' interest in him as a broadcaster.
If he decides to remain as the Rams head coach, McVay gets to continue living out his dream job.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A trying season for the defending-champion Los Angeles Rams now appears to be headed for an offseason of some murmurs and tumult.
Head coach Sean McVay plans to take some time away following the conclusion of the year to evaluate his future, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Saturday.
Rapoport added that McVay allowed himself a similar period of reflection last year and will likely do so going forward each season provided he returns.
"I think that acknowledgement helps me work through it," McVay said Friday about his openness that this season has been challenging, via The Athletic's Jourdan Rodrigue.
Much like last offseason, rumors of potential television deals possibly luring McVay away will persist.

Sean McVay has some thinking to do.
(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)The Rams went through this with Sean McVay before, under happier circumstancesIf all this sounds familiar, it's exactly what happened immediately after McVay and the Rams won their long-awaited ring.
Hours after their Super Bowl LVI victory, the 36-year-old McVay was asked if he would return to the Rams next year.
Much of the same issues the Rams were facing after the Super Bowl are still present.
