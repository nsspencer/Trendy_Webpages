     Phillies trade Matt Vierling, Nick Maton for Tigers closer Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have acquired left-handed reliever Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, the latest in a series of additions to the back end of their bullpen.
The Phils will send utilityman Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling and catcher Donny Sands to Detroit for Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens, Roger's son.
Soto is a hard-throwing, high-leverage lefty who has spent the last two seasons as the Tigers' closer.
Dominguez, Kimbrel, Soto, Alvarado, Strahm and right-handers Connor Brogdon and Andrew Bellatti will likely claim seven of the bullpen's eight or nine spots, barring injury.
The trade will put the Phillies' luxury tax payroll at approximately $254 million.

     Phillies trade for reliever Gregory Soto, send Matt Vierling and Nick Maton to Tigers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday, the Phillies agreed to a trade with the Detroit Tigers, sending infielder Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling, and catcher Donny Sands to Detroit for left-handed pitcher Gregory Soto and utility infielder Kody Clemens.
And also like Alvarado, Soto has great stuff.
After a brief stint in triple-A Lehigh Valley, Alvarado became a new pitcher in the second half of the 2022 season.
He trimmed his walk rate from 14.9% in the first half to 6.5% in the second half while increasing his strikeout rate from 33.9% in the first half to 43% in the second half.
Manager Rob Thomson now has three left-handed arms at his disposal, in Soto, Alvarado, and Matt Strahm.

     Phillies Strengthen Bullpen Again By Grabbing Gregory Soto From Tigers

     Summary: Gregory Soto's strong left arm is moving to Philadelphia after a five-man trade with Detroit.
(Photo ... [+] by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) Getty ImagesLess than a week after landing the major-league leader in saves, the Philadelphia Phillies have bolstered their bullpen for the third time this winter.
Pending physicals, the National League champions acquired highly-coveted lefty closer Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, along with infielder Kody Clemens, for outfielder Matt Vierling, infielder-outfielder Nick Maton, and promising Triple-A catcher Donny Sands.
Though subject to arbitration for the first time this year, Soto will be under Philadelphia team control through 2025 – longer than Kimbrel or Strahm.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Left-hander Gregory Soto, who has served as the Tigers' closer for the past two seasons, has been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, the team confirmed Saturday afternoon.
The Tigers also sent utility player Kody Clemens to the Phillies.
"All three players have performed at a high level in the upper minor leagues," Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris said Saturday.
The Phillies talked to the Tigers about Soto during the winter meetings in early December, Dombrowski told reporters, but those conversations stalled.
Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported the trade discussions between the Tigers and Phillies.

     Phillies "Working On A Trade" For Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have continued to strengthen their roster following their World Series defeat last year, acquiring left-handed reliever Gregory Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens in a trade with the Tigers.
The strikeout rate represented something of a dip for Soto, as it sat at 27.5% just a year prior.
Signed out of the Dominican Republic back in 2012, Soto came up through the Tigers’ system as a starting pitcher.
The Phillies pen now includes Kimbrel, Soto and Strahm, as well as Seranthony Dominguez, Jose Alvarado, Andrew Bellatti and Connor Brogdon.
Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported on Twitter that the Phillies and Tigers were working on a trade.

     Tigers get 3 players from Phils for Soto, Clemens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Time will tell if they can turn into productive players who can upgrade Detroit’s offense.
Sands is a catcher, a position the Tigers targeted this offseason as they try to build depth behind Eric Haase and Jake Rogers.
The Tigers believe there is more in the bat and are “confident in his abilities behind the dish,” Harris said.
Soto was the Tigers’ closer and an All-Star last season, recording 30 saves and a 3.28 ERA across 60 1/3 innings.
Soto isn’t slated for free agency until after the 2025 season, which put a high price tag on him in the trade market.
