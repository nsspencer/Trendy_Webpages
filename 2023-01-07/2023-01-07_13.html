     Phillies trade Matt Vierling, Nick Maton for Tigers closer Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have acquired left-handed reliever Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, the latest in a series of additions to the back end of their bullpen.
The Phils will send utilityman Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling and catcher Donny Sands to Detroit for Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens, Roger's son.
Soto is a hard-throwing, high-leverage lefty who has spent the last two seasons as the Tigers' closer.
Dominguez, Kimbrel, Soto, Alvarado, Strahm and right-handers Connor Brogdon and Andrew Bellatti will likely claim seven of the bullpen's eight or nine spots, barring injury.
The trade will put the Phillies' luxury tax payroll at approximately $254 million.

     Phillies Strengthen Bullpen Again By Grabbing Gregory Soto From Tigers

     Summary: Gregory Soto's strong left arm is moving to Philadelphia after a five-man trade with Detroit.
(Photo ... [+] by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) Getty ImagesLess than a week after landing the major-league leader in saves, the Philadelphia Phillies have bolstered their bullpen for the third time this winter.
Pending physicals, the National League champions acquired highly-coveted lefty closer Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers, along with infielder Kody Clemens, for outfielder Matt Vierling, infielder-outfielder Nick Maton, and promising Triple-A catcher Donny Sands.
Though subject to arbitration for the first time this year, Soto will be under Philadelphia team control through 2025 – longer than Kimbrel or Strahm.
Fleet Trea Turner signed an 11-year, $300 million pact to play shortstop and steal bases for the ... [+] Philadelphia Phillies.

     Gregory Soto trade: Phillies acquire lefty reliever from Tigers in five-player swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies obtained lefty reliever Gregory Soto from the Detroit Tigers on Saturday as part of a five-player swap.
Nevertheless, the Phillies likely found Soto intriguing in part because of his combination of stuff and deception.
The latter's arrival led Dombrowski to suggest the Phillies would likely enter the season with a closer-by-committee approach.
The Tigers, for their part, received in return three hitters who should see big-league action during the 2023 season.
He's batted .260/.309/.374 (91 OPS+) in 151 big-league games over the last two seasons while seeing most of his action in center field.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s better than a lefty specialist, but he’s not good enough for high-leverage work on a contending team.
With all the first base/DH types the Phillies have, I don’t know where he fits.
He also cut his strikeout rate from 2021, although that year was a fairly small sample in the majors.
He’s the sort of player you love to have, although you might not go out of your way to acquire him.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said a few days ago he was mostly done with his roster construction this offseason.
On Saturday, the Phillies agreed to a trade with the Detroit Tigers, sending infielder Nick Maton, outfielder Matt Vierling, and catcher Donny Sands to Detroit for left-handed pitcher Gregory Soto and utility infielder Kody Clemens.
On a Zoom call with reporters on Saturday, Dombrowski said conversations with the Tigers about Soto began during the winter meetings in December, but no deal came to fruition.
And also like Alvarado, Soto has great stuff.
Manager Rob Thomson now has three left-handed arms at his disposal, in Soto, Alvarado, and Matt Strahm.

     Phillies "Working On A Trade" For Gregory Soto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phillies have continued to strengthen their roster following their World Series defeat last year, acquiring left-handed reliever Gregory Soto and utilityman Kody Clemens in a trade with the Tigers.
The strikeout rate represented something of a dip for Soto, as it sat at 27.5% just a year prior.
Signed out of the Dominican Republic back in 2012, Soto came up through the Tigers’ system as a starting pitcher.
The Phillies pen now includes Kimbrel, Soto and Strahm, as well as Seranthony Dominguez, Jose Alvarado, Andrew Bellatti and Connor Brogdon.
Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported on Twitter that the Phillies and Tigers were working on a trade.

     Summary: Soto was the Tigers’ closer and an All-Star last season, recording 30 saves and a 3.28 ERA across 60 1/3 innings.
Armed with nasty stuff that is dominant when he is commanding the baseball, Soto is a hard-throwing lefty reliever who can strengthen the Phillies' bullpen as a late-inning reliever.
The Tigers believe there is more in the bat and are “confident in his abilities behind the dish,” Harris said.
