     National Championship Odds: TCU vs. Georgia prediction, pick, how to watch – 1/9/2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By RB Hayek · 4 min readIt is championship time as the TCU Horned Frogs will battle the Georgia Bulldogs in the College Football Playoff National Championship.
It’s time to continue our NCAA football odds series as we make a TCU-Georgia prediction and pick.
Kenny Mcintosh rushed five times for 70 yards while catching five passes for 56 yards and a score.
Substantially, the last meeting occurred in the Liberty Bowl following the 2016 season, where Georgia defeated TCU 31-23.
However, TCU has defied the odds consistently and it makes it tough to pick against them when it comes to the spread.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The college football season arrives at its climax on Monday as the heralded Georgia Bulldogs attempt to defend their title against the Horned Frogs of Texas Christian University (TCU).
Georgia heads to the SoFi Stadium, Los Angeles, unbeaten so far this season and with history in its sights as the defending champions.
No team has won consecutive national titles since Alabama in 2011 and 2012, and none since the advent of the reformatted College Football Playoffs in 2014.
Ryan Quintanar of the TCU Horned Frogs celebrates with confetti following the Fiesta Bowl on December 31, 2022.
Georgia’s Stetson Bennett is already 25 years old, but it would be hard for teams to ignore a back-to-back national championship signal-caller, even if he were to be picked in later rounds.
