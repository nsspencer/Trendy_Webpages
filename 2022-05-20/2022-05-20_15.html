     Prime Video's Night Sky is a Sentimental but Hollow Sci-fi Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is a quaint and curious opening premise for a sci-fi story about the wonder of such a partnership, and yet “Night Sky” (created by Holden Miller) proves to have few standout ideas of its own afterward.
“Night Sky” concerns themes of caring for loved ones, and experiences with loss and aging, at least initially with Franklin and Irene’s tender story, which could have been something like a Sundance indie on its own.
Meanwhile, a nosy neighbor named Byron (Adam Bartley) has his own frustrations about trying to make something of himself in their small town of Farnsworth, Illinois while struggling to earn the respect of his grumbling neighbor Franklin.
His true background feels hazier and hazier, even when he finds himself being taken care of inside the York home.
“Night Sky” toys with a connectivity for everyone, in a way that only picks up speed in the second-to-last episode of season one.

     Night Sky has star power, but is too concerned with sci-fi guff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the set-up for Prime Video’s latest science fiction drama, Night Sky.
Yet despite suggestions from family that they move somewhere more manageable, for Irene the mystery of the portal is too overwhelming.
It’s a shame, because when Spacek and Simmons are given space to delve into their characters’ relationship, things really sing.
All the other complications, plotlines and fairly standard sci-fi guff only detract from what could have been a tender and poignant meditation on the unpredictability of our twilight years.
Night Sky is streaming on Prime Video.

     'Night Sky' review: A sweet love story with a sci-fi twist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the out-there premise of “Night Sky,” an Amazon series that combines science fiction and mystery with that rarest of commodities – a touching love story involving an old married couple – in an intriguing if plodding format.
“Night Sky” feels very much like another recent hybrid Amazon show, the Josh Brolin vehicle “Outer Range,” which mixes family drama with what appears to be some kind of extraterrestrial window while taking its sweet time in sprinkling out a trail of breadcrumbs.
Thanks to Spacek and Simmons, the show proves initially worthwhile despite being its meandering pace.
For now, that tandem makes it worth watching the “Sky.” Continuing to do so, like the show itself, remains an unsolved riddle.
“Night Sky” premieres May 20 on Amazon.

     Night Sky review: A sci-fi mystery that looks down, not up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In many ways, Night Sky feels deeply indebted to past sci-fi TV hits like Lost and even Netflix’s Lost in Space reboot.
For that reason, there are moments when Night Sky feels more like a family drama than it does a grand sci-fi mystery.
If some of those check-ins had been cut, Night Sky would probably flow a lot better than it does.
As a matter of fact, Night Sky is often at its best when it’s not doing that, and that, as they say, is the rub.
Season 1 of Night Sky premieres Friday, May 20 on Amazon Prime Video.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Night Sky’ On Prime Video, Where J.K. Simmons And Sissy Spacek Play A Married Couple Who Share A Cosmic Secret
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s certainly true of the new Amazon series Night Sky.
NIGHT SKY: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
In a weird way, Night Sky has some of the same sci fi DNA as Outer Range, even if the tone is wildly different.
Our Take: Night Sky, created by Holden Miller and Daniel C. Connolly, has a sweetness to it that we don’t get from most sci fi.
Night Sky is a decent series that is nudged into the very good category because of the performances of J.K. Simmons and Sissy Spacek.
