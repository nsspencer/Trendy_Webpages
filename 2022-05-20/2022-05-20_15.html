     Summary: The new design looks similar to Red Bull's and comes after two senior aerodynamicists, Dan Fallows and Andrew Alessi, left Red Bull to join Aston Martin at the end of last year.
"During this process, it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor.
In the analysis we carried out we confirmed that the processes followed by Aston Martin were consistent with this Article's requirements."
"Oracle Red Bull Racing have noted the FIA's statement with interest," the team's statement said.
The Aston Martin update has been applied to both cars in Spain, with the team's mechanics breaking F1's paddock curfew to complete the work ahead of Friday's practice sessions.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the similarities between the updated Aston Martin and Red Bull’s RB18 car were quickly noted, leading to the design being dubbed a ‘green Red Bull’.
The FIA clamped down on reverse engineering car designs in the wake of the Pink Mercedes case, and revealed in Barcelona on Friday that it did look into the updated Aston Martin car.
F1’s governing body said that during a “routine pre-event legality check” of the planned Aston Martin updates, “it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor”.
Through the investigation, the FIA found that Aston Martin had complied with the regulations through its process, making the new updates legal.
“In the analysis we carried out we confirmed that the processes followed by Aston Martin were consistent with this Article’s requirements.”A spokesperson from Aston Martin said: “We have shared details of our update with the FIA technical people.

“But you also have to take into account that seven people were poached from us and that our chief aerodynamicist was pulled to Aston Martin with a disproportionately high fee.
