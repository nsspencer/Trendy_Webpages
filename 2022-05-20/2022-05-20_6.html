    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of two 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupes has sold for 135 million euros ($143 million at current exchange rates), making it the most expensive car of all time, Mercedes said Thursday in a press release.
1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut CoupeThe Uhlenhaut Coupe was intended as a successor to Moss' roofless 300 SLR.
However, the Uhlenhaut Coupe never got a chance to race.
The two Uhlenhaut Coupe prototypes were consigned to Mercedes' non-public classic collection, where the second prototype will remain.
So the now-privately owned Uhlenhaut coupe might actually see the light of day more often than it did while owned by Mercedes.

     World's most expensive car: Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR sells for more than €135m
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world's most expensive car, one of only two in existence, has been sold at auction for a blistering €135m.
The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe was sold to a "private collector" at a Southeby's invite-only auction held at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.
Named after its creator and chief engineer at Mercedes - Rudolf Uhlenhaut - the 300 SLR is one of just two prototypes built by the Mercedes Benz racing division.
The 300 SLR had a larger, 3.0-litre engine and was able to reach 180 mph, making it one of the fastest road-legal cars at the time.
Sotheby's said the Uhlenhaut Coupe "will remain accessible for public display on special occasions, while the second original 300 SLR Coupe remains in company ownership and will continue to be displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart."

     Summary: A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe from 1955 has been sold at auction for a record price of €135,000,000 ($142.5m) to a private collector, auction house RM Sotheby’s has announced.
The sale of the 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe took place on May 5 at an auction held at the Mercedes-­Benz Museum in Stuttgart, with RM Sotheby’s working in close cooperation with Mercedes-Benz throughout the entire process.
Among the invitees were selected Mercedes customers and “international collectors of cars and art who share the corporate values of Mercedes-Benz,” the auction company stated.
The winning bid on the car makes it the most valuable car ever sold and a price which exceeds the existing record by more than $95 million.
The 300 SLR now sits in the top 10 most valuable items ever sold at auction.

     Summary: A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR "Uhlenhaut Coupé" has smashed the record for most expensive car sold at auction.
And one example set an auction record years ago, before being eclipsed by others, including the aforementioned Ferrari.
After its success in its inaugural year, the W196 was adapted into a single-seat, open-top 300 SLR to compete in the 1955 World Sportscar Championship.
That alone would have made the 300 SLR a highly desirable collector's car, but it's impossible to ignore the dark side of its history as well.
At the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 300 SLR driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh crashed violently with another car, catapulting it into the grandstands.

     This $142 Million Mercedes-Benz Is the Most Expensive Car Ever Sold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Formula 1 racers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell helped debut the all-electric Vision AMG concept car in what, on any other occasion, would be a truly grand finale.
The problem with most electric cars is that you have six inches of battery, which makes the car higher and the center of gravity further up.
“As it’s an electric car, we put the hood super low, and that means we can do exposed fenders.
“In the digital age, we’ve brought that [Panamericana Grille] to a car that doesn’t need a radiator anymore,” Wagener says.
Less than an hour after the Vision AMG was made public, Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, officially announced what’s claimed to be not just the world’s most expensive car sold at auction, but the priciest, period.
