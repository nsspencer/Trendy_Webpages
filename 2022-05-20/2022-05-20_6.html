     Hide Your Loved Ones, Ugly Sonic is Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You know, I didn't expect to think about Sonic until May 24th, AKA the day Sonic the Hedgehog 2 releases on VOD.
Remember back in your coddled pre-pandemic life, when the first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer featured an ultra-realistic hedgehog, but with human teeth?
Rescue Rangers mostly tools around in the Disney cartoon sandbox, but with guest spots from the likes of... the Coca-Cola polar bear?
Ugly Sonic moves slooooowly, has a beer gut, and yes, still has those pearly whites.

     Here's The First Footage Of Ugly Sonic In Chip And Dale: Rescue Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first footage of Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers has been revealed and it is glorious.
THEGAMER VIDEO OF THE DAYThe clips show that Ugly Sonic appears with his own booth at the same convention that Dale is selling old photos of himself at, with most passersby seemingly completely uninterested in the two.
He then mentions that he's getting his own show where he goes on ride alongs with the FBI.
A scene later in the movie has both Chip and Dale talking to Ugly Sonic after needing help from the FBI, who Sonic previously claimed to have known.
It's made clear that he wasn't really getting his own show and was just lying, before he claims that "going fast" is Sonic's thing and that Ugly Sonic "goes slow baby".

     The Ugly Sonic Scene in ‘’Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers’ Was “Not Easy,” Says Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers on Disney+.
Because, yes, Ugly Sonic shows up in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and it is possible we have given Twitter too much power.
Much like 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers offers a world in which cartoons are every bit as real as humans.
Ugly Sonic (voiced by I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson) proudly calls himself Ugly Sonic, displays the name on his fan-con booth, and signs the name on photos for snickering teenagers.
Without spoiling too much, Ugly Sonic shows up a few more times in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and in fact becomes a fairly crucial character in the film.
