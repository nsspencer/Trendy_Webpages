     Hide Your Loved Ones, Ugly Sonic is Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You know, I didn't expect to think about Sonic until May 24th, AKA the day Sonic the Hedgehog 2 releases on VOD.
Remember back in your coddled pre-pandemic life, when the first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer featured an ultra-realistic hedgehog, but with human teeth?
Rescue Rangers mostly tools around in the Disney cartoon sandbox, but with guest spots from the likes of... the Coca-Cola polar bear?
Ugly Sonic moves slooooowly, has a beer gut, and yes, still has those pearly whites.

     Chip ’N Dale: Rescue Rangers director explains the ‘Ugly Sonic’ cameo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now “Ugly Sonic,” the original design, is back.
First introduced at a fandom convention, signing autographs and coasting on his internet notoriety, Ugly Sonic (he bills himself that way, complete with a giant “Ugly Sonic” banner for his booth) comes across as a little smug and a little bitter about his brief, curtailed movie career.
I think I will actually plead the fifth.”Chip ’N Dale: Rescue Rangers is packed with these animated cameos, ranging from classic Disney characters to TV obscurities to one of the more famous creations of underground comics artist Robert Crumb.
But you know, it makes [the movie] so much better.”Frankly, Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers is absolutely making fun of the Ugly Sonic design, and the public response to it.
Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers is now streaming on Disney Plus.

     The Ugly Sonic Scene in ‘’Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers’ Was “Not Easy,” Says Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers on Disney+.
Because, yes, Ugly Sonic shows up in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and it is possible we have given Twitter too much power.
Much like 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers offers a world in which cartoons are every bit as real as humans.
Ugly Sonic (voiced by I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson) proudly calls himself Ugly Sonic, displays the name on his fan-con booth, and signs the name on photos for snickering teenagers.
Without spoiling too much, Ugly Sonic shows up a few more times in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and in fact becomes a fairly crucial character in the film.
