     Archbishop Bars Pelosi From Communion Over Abortion Stance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — An ultraconservative archbishop in San Francisco said on Friday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California would not be permitted to receive communion in his archdiocese because of her support for abortion rights.
Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone, who has repeatedly confronted Ms. Pelosi over abortion, said in a letter on Friday that until Ms. Pelosi was willing to “publicly repudiate” her position defending the “legitimacy of abortion,” she would be banned from the sacrament, a central element of Catholic worship.
“After numerous attempts to speak with Speaker Pelosi to help her understand the grave evil she is perpetrating, the scandal she is causing” and “the danger to her own soul she is risking, I have determined that she is not to be admitted to Holy Communion,” Archbishop Cordileone said on Twitter on Friday.
A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, a practicing Catholic who often mentions her faith in advocating for her progressive views, did not respond to a request for comment.
In a 2008 interview with C-SPAN, Ms. Pelosi described herself as a “regular communicant” and said that if she were ever denied communion, “that would be a severe blow to me.”

     Catholic bishop bars communion to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over abortion rights support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Roman Catholic archbishop of San Francisco has ordered priests in the archdiocese to deny House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the sacrament of communion because of the California Democrat's support for abortion rights.
The Roman Catholic Church opposes abortion, considering it a "grave sin."
Most Catholic bishops have been loathe to deny communion to politicians who support abortion rights.
Pelosi said last month that the controversy over her support for abortion rights "really gets me burned up in case you didn't notice, because again I'm very Catholic, devout, practicing, all of that.
Communion is an essential sacrament of Catholic practice.

     Summary: More:Explosive leaked draft in abortion case reveals Supreme Court on verge of overturning RoePelosi has been a vocal advocate of abortion rights for decades.
"Every woman, everywhere has the constitutional right to basic health care," Pelosi said at the time of the House vote.
This ban necessitates codifying Roe v.
A leak of a draft opinion earlier this month indicated a majority of justices planned to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Reaction from advocacy groups to the decision by the San Francisco archbishop was swift.

     San Francisco archbishop denying Pelosi Communion over abortion rights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Salvatore J. Cordileone, the Catholic archbishop of San Francisco, said Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be denied the sacrament of Holy Communion because of her vocal support for abortion rights.
Cordileone last year called for Communion to be withheld from public figures who support abortion rights but did not mention Pelosi by name at the time.
The order to deny Communion to Pelosi applies only to Catholic churches within the San Francisco archdiocese under Cordileone’s purview, including the speaker’s home church.
Last September, Pope Francis said the decision about granting Communion to politicians who support abortion rights should be made from a pastoral point of view, not a political one.
He told reporters: “I have never refused the Eucharist to anyone,” while adding that he has never knowingly encountered during Communion a politician who backs abortion rights.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The archbishop in San Francisco has not been relevant in civil life in years.
He’s made a choice — that he wants to be in opposition to the civic and government life in San Francisco rather than find laces of agreement.
San Francisco was also home to what was once a large and influential parochial school system.
The Catholic Church and San Francisco have sparred before.
The statement was called hateful, discriminatory, insulting and ignorant by San Francisco supervisors, the Chronicle reported.
