     Review: Actress Selma Blair bares soul in captivating memoir
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Or maybe they’ve heard about her mid-life multiple sclerosis diagnosis and the recent documentary, “Introducing, Selma Blair,” that details how the actress is adapting to life with the disease.
What they don’t know — and couldn’t until now — is the devastating trauma the Michigan-born Selma Blair Beitner has suffered during her 49 years.
Blair details all of it in her captivating and unflinching memoir, “Mean Baby.”Her addiction to alcohol, including getting drunk on Passover wine as an elementary school student.
“I was a mean, mean baby.
“The mean baby is still there, but her edges are softer, wiser, kinder.”And capable of producing a dazzling and intense memoir.
