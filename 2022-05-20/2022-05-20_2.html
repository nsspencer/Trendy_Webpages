     World's most expensive car: Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR sells for more than €135m
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world's most expensive car, one of only two in existence, has been sold at auction for a blistering €135m.
The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe was sold to a "private collector" at a Southeby's invite-only auction held at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.
Named after its creator and chief engineer at Mercedes - Rudolf Uhlenhaut - the 300 SLR is one of just two prototypes built by the Mercedes Benz racing division.
The 300 SLR had a larger, 3.0-litre engine and was able to reach 180 mph, making it one of the fastest road-legal cars at the time.
Sotheby's said the Uhlenhaut Coupe "will remain accessible for public display on special occasions, while the second original 300 SLR Coupe remains in company ownership and will continue to be displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart."

     1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR sells for a record $143 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR "Uhlenhaut Coupé" has smashed the record for most expensive car sold at auction.
And one example set an auction record years ago, before being eclipsed by others, including the aforementioned Ferrari.
After its success in its inaugural year, the W196 was adapted into a single-seat, open-top 300 SLR to compete in the 1955 World Sportscar Championship.
That alone would have made the 300 SLR a highly desirable collector's car, but it's impossible to ignore the dark side of its history as well.
At the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 300 SLR driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh crashed violently with another car, catapulting it into the grandstands.

     Vintage Mercedes sells for whopping record of — $143 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sotheby's says the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé was sold for an all-time record price of 135 million EUR ($143 million) in early May 2022. Business Wire via APA 1955 Mercedes-Benz, one of only two of its kind, was auctioned off earlier this month for a whopping 135 million euros ($143 million), making it the most expensive car ever sold, RM Sotheby's announced Thursday.
The Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut was sold to a private collector, the classic car auction company said in a statement, fetching almost triple the previous record price for a car, which was set in 2018 by a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO that went for over $48 million.
Next is "Shot Sage Blue Marilyn" by Andy Warhol, which sold, also this month, for $195 million.
That tragedy -- the deadliest in the history of motor racing -- forced the company to withdraw from the sport for years.
RM Sotheby's said the proceeds from the auction will be used to establish a worldwide Mercedes-Benz Fund that will fund environmental science and decarbonization research.

     This $142 Million Mercedes-Benz Is Now the Most Expensive Car Ever Sold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Formula 1 racers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell helped debut the all-electric Vision AMG concept car in what would normally be a truly grand finale on any other occasion.
“The problem with most electric cars is that you have six inches of battery, which makes the car higher and the center of gravity further up.
He goes on to say: “As it’s an electric car, we put the hood super low, and that means we can do exposed fenders.
“In the digital age, we’ve brought that [Panamericana Grille] to a car that doesn’t need a radiator anymore,” say Wagener.
Less than an hour after the Vision AMG was made public, Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, officially announced what’s claimed to be not just the world’s most expensive car sold at auction, but the priciest period.
