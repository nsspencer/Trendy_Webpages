     Red Power Ranger actor Austin St. John charged in wire fraud conspiracy indictment

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Austin St. John, who suited up as Red Power Ranger in the '90s "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" series, has been arrested for wire fraud conspiracy, according to the Department of Justice.
St. John, 47, first stepped into the "Power Rangers" world in 1993 as he portrayed Jason Lee Scott, the Red Power Ranger who led the rest of the crime-fighting team.
During the "Power Rangers Zeo" TV series in 1996, he transformed into The Gold Ranger, according to IMDb.
The former Power Ranger was expected to attend Des Moines Con, an Iowa comic festival, but it was announced Thursday he would no longer be able to attend due to "unforeseen personal obligations."
Austin plans to be here to meet all of his fans in 2023," the event's booking company announced on Facebook.

     Summary: Court documents allege that St. John transferred $421,000 in fraudulently obtained PPP loans to Hill's bank account.
"An indictment is not evidence of guilt," David Klaudt a lawyer representing St. John said.
"All defendants are presumed innocent and Mr. St. John intends to vigorously defend himself against this allegation."
St. John, 47, reprised his role in several Power Rangers off-shoots over the years, including most recently in a guest spot in the 2020 TV show "Power Rangers Beast Morphers."
The DOJ has prosecuted hundreds of millions of dollars in alleged PPP fraud since the creation of the program.
