     Colorado to experience weather whiplash as heavy snow follows temperatures near 90
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In less than 24 hours, Denver could go from having 90-degree weather to a potentially historic and dangerous snowstorm.
Snowfall amounts could be as high as two to three feet in the higher elevations, and up to eight inches in the city of Denver, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boulder.
"Anytime there's really heavy snow like that, it can cause tremendous impacts to Interstate 70, or some of the lesser traveled highways into our higher elevations."
Friday afternoon through Saturday morning "travel may become very difficult to impossible due to heavy snowfall on roadways," NWS Boulder said.
Some of the lower elevations, including Denver, could potentially set records.

     Colorado weather: Where, when and how much snow to expect with the late-season winter storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snow levels will gradually lower through Friday with all snow falling in and around the Denver metro by the evening commute.
We did squeeze out 3.9 inches of snow in May of 2019 but this storm could deliver more snow than that.
The Foothills from Estes Park to Conifer can expect 12 to 24 inches of snow from this storm by Saturday afternoon.
The Palmer Divide near Castle Rock and Monument should expect 12 to 18 inches of snow.
This storm has been trending a bit colder, and colder air temperatures mean that more snow could add up in Denver.
