     Review: New Chip ‘N Dale movie hilariously spoofs classic games, cartoons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Traditionally, when Disney films skip theaters and go straight to video, it's not a good sign.
Hence, today's Disney+ premiere of Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers—a PG-rated reboot with little in the way of advance press screenings—had us assuming the worst, despite its comedy pedigree.
Chip 'N Dale is a self-aware comedy romp that families will appreciate.
Samberg's opening narration suggests that the phrase "Chip 'N Dale" is likely to remind viewers of a few things—and it then flashes a PG-rated image of male strippers.
That's probably not surprising for a film whose lead characters hail from the " Disney Afternoon Collection " of late '80s characters.

     The Ugly Sonic Scene in ‘’Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers’ Was “Not Easy,” Says Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers on Disney+.
Because, yes, Ugly Sonic shows up in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and it is possible we have given Twitter too much power.
Much like 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers offers a world in which cartoons are every bit as real as humans.
Ugly Sonic (voiced by I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson) proudly calls himself Ugly Sonic, displays the name on his fan-con booth, and signs the name on photos for snickering teenagers.
Without spoiling too much, Ugly Sonic shows up a few more times in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and in fact becomes a fairly crucial character in the film.

Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers had a wide array of animated characters to choose from as its main antagonist — I mean, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast was right there!

     ‘Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers’ (Arguably) Best Cartoon and CG Cameos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [This story contains spoilers from Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers on Disney+.]
Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers dropped on Disney+ Friday, and the film, based on the beloved ’90s cartoon of the same name, features several surprising animated and CG cameos from assorted films and shows inside and outside the Disney realm.
In fact, one of the cameos was so random and funny, it was immediately trending high on Twitter, and thus is given his due respect below in The Hollywood Reporter’s list of the five — arguably, of course — most enjoyable cameos in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers.
But don’t worry, as he says, Ugly Sonic is “in on the joke.”South Park’s Randy MarshRandy Marsh gets the No.
Randy, voiced by series co-creator Trey Parker in the (very adult) Comedy Central show, does not speak in Rescue Rangers.

     I Regret to Inform You the Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers Movie Is Pretty Good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Disney+There’s a scene toward the beginning of Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers in which Chip (voiced by John Mulaney) walks down Hollywood Boulevard, glaring down the ads for the latest creatively bankrupt offerings from the industry he left behind for a sensible job in insurance.
Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers has more in common with Who Framed Roger Rabbit than it does the series with which it shares a name — to the point where Roger makes a cameo.
In the film, Chip and Dale are childhood friends who go to Hollywood together to seek out fame and fortune.
The original Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers makes them stars until Dale tries to go solo, their show gets canceled, and an embittered Chip goes off to lead a normie life while Dale gets 3-D surgery and rides out his waning fame signing autographs at fan conventions and holding out for a reboot.
Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers, which was written by Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, is filled with witty bits of business.
