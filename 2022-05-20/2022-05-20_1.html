     ’Daredevil’ Will Get a New Disney+ Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix was the original home of the Marvel series about Charlie Cox’s crusading blind lawyer, along with several other gritty TV series involving other street-level New York City heroes who collectively became The Defenders.
After Disney started their own streaming service, Disney+, and after Marvel restructured their TV production so all of it was produced by the same creative team that made their movies, the Netflix series all came to an end.
But a few months ago, the old episodes of those Netflix series — Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and The Punisher — migrated over to Disney+.
The other big question about the new Daredevil is how adult the series will be allowed to be.
While we wait for an answer, the Netflix episodes of Daredevil — and the other Marvel Netflix series — are already available to stream on Disney+.

     A New Daredevil Series In The Works For Disney Plus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like Marvel’s Daredevil series is making a return to the stream, although it is clear that the show that made its debut on Netflix will now be streaming exclusively on its newest home, Disney+.
To quickly recap, Netflix’s Daredevil came to an abrupt halt back in 2018, after just three seasons, when Netflix cancelled the series.
The third and final season picked up where The Defenders – also another Netflix series that ended after just one season – ended: with Murdock left in Saint Agnes Orphanage, all wrapped up and bandaged from his fight with The Hand.
For another matter, the show could also signal the return of Vincent D’Onofrio to the role of Kingpin in the series, although to be fair, D’Onofrio technically already made his return to the role in the Disney+ series, Hawkeye.
Having said that, whether or not the new Daredevil series becomes a hit will boil down to the showrunner’s capability in telling and tying the character into the MCU.

When they wanted a collaboration of heroes to come together for a team-up, Marvel Studios gave it to them.
When they wanted familiar faces from previous franchises to come back for another movie, Marvel Studios gave it to them.
When they wanted to see Marvel Studios give their own interpretations of heroes previously not portrayed well by other studios, Marvel Studios previously has and will give it to them.
If Marvel Studios knows what's good for them, they'll continue Daredevil from when we last saw him on Netflix.

     'Daredevil' Disney Plus Series Is A Continuation Of The Netflix Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A brand-new Daredevil series is in the works at Disney Plus, and it sounds like it'll pick up where the Netflix series left off.
While technically part of the MCU, the "street-level" Netflix Marvel shows never really properly referenced the events of the movies.
With the characters fully integrated into the MCU (and the Netflix shows now moved over to Disney Plus), fans hoped it would only be a matter of time until a new Daredevil series was announced.
Disney has yet to officially confirm the news, and it sounds like the project is still in early development, but this undeniably hugely exciting for fans of the Netflix series.
I can't imagine a Disney Plus incarnation of Daredevil will be anything like as gritty as the Netflix series was, of course, but more Charlie Cox as The Man Without Fear is absolutely a Very Good Thing Indeed.

     Original Daredevil Showrunners Address Series' Disney+ Revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Original Daredevil showrunners Erik Oleson and Steven S. DeKnight addressed reports that the former Netflix series' is getting a Disney+ revival.
Oleson, who oversaw Daredevil Season 3, responded to the news by tweeting "Thrilled to learn that #Daredevil lives on!
These appearances marked both actors' proper introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the canonical status of the original Daredevil series remains in doubt.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige added further weight to rumors that a new Daredevil series was in the works during a 2021 interview.
Despite Feige's phrasing, it's worth noting that both Marvel Studios and Disney+ have yet to officially confirm the series is happening.
