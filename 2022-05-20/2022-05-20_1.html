     Colorado Avalanche's Nathan MacKinnon laments 'really bad' team performance in Game 2 loss to St. Louis Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colorado Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon was direct in his assessment of his team's effort in a 4-1 Game 2 loss to the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.
Although Colorado needed overtime to win Game 1 against St. Louis, the Avalanche controlled that game.
The Blues entered Game 2 with a completely different approach than in the previous game.
They know in Game 1 they didn't do well enough, and all year they've responded," Blues coach Craig Berube said.
Colorado has been eliminated in the second round in three straight seasons.

     Colorado Avalanche Player Grades, Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cale Makar : C – Fans were holding their breath as he looked injured at the end of the first but he came back out and finished the game.
Nathan MacKinnon: C – Played hard, but couldn’t get the goal the team needed to keep them in it.
The Avs need him to get going numbers- wise, though he did have a very good puck-possession Game 1.
He had a costly mistake that led to the Blues third goal of the game and essentially the back breaker.
It’s hard to blame this game on him, but Binnington is certainly winning the goalie duel right now.

     Summary: The St. Louis Blues bounced back in Game 2 against the Colorado Avalanche, posting a 4-1 win on the road to tie the series at one.
They can’t get into a track meet with this Avalanche team, as they already lost a game while allowing that to happen in Game 1.
David Perron, St. Louis Blues (Jess Starr/The Hockey Writers)Two big takeaways from this game were the Blues being 61 percent in the faceoff circle and throwing 38 hits.
Related: 3 Takeaways From Blues’ 3-2 Overtime Loss to Avalanche in Game 1The lineup changes that head coach Craig Berube made were another stroke of brilliance.

     Kiszla: Avalanche needs coach Jared Bednar to be more than Ken doll on team bench when going gets tough in NHL playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is his job as coach of the Avalanche nothing more than to look as handsome as Ken doll on the team bench?
Bednar is blessed with by far the most talented roster of any professional team in Denver.
But maybe Bednar needs to do more than light a fragranced candle and pray for better effort as the series shifts to St. Louis.
Although St. Louis goalie Jordan Binnington has a tendency to cough up juicy rebounds, Colorado is making him look like Ken Dryden.
St. Louis, Bednar said, “answered back after a bad game in Game 1.
