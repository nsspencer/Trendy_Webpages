     N.J. weather: Tornado watch issued for 13 N.J. counties as severe thunderstorm threat increases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tornado watch remains in effect.
A tornado watch has been issued for most of New Jersey as the threat of severe storms Friday afternoon has increased.
A tornado warning is more urgent than a tornado watch, so it should be taken seriously.
A watch means conditions are favorable for a tornado to develop, but there's no immediate threat.
If a tornado warning were to be issued, it means that one has been spotted.

     Maryland weather: Tornado watch cancelled Friday for Baltimore area
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The National Weather Service has cancelled a tornado watch that had effected much of Maryland including the Baltimore area and threatened some scheduled events ahead of Preakness on Friday.
The tornado watch had also put an alert on several scheduled events ahead of the 147th Preakness Stakes, including the Preakness Live Culinary Art &amp; Music Festival, a concert and interactive cultural experience, and the 98th Black-Eyed Susan Day, which celebrates women and racing.
“Inclement weather is closely and actively monitored in real time using a sophisticated weather tracking system operating out of the Preakness command center,” said Rob D’Amico, chief security officer for 1/ST.
Backstretch personnel and horses will remain in the stables and will follow their own horse safety protocols.
Baltimore Sun reporters Micha Green and Christine Condon contributed to this article.
