     Recap: Panthers drop heartbreaking 2-1 decision to Lightning with seconds to go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ross Colton scored with 3.8 seconds left in a game that looked destined for overtime to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 2-1 victory over a gutted Florida Panthers squad that can’t find answers offensively.
After MacKenzie Weegar turned the puck over with 15 seconds left, the Cats failed to clear twice and paid the ultimate price when Ondrej Palat bounced the puck off the boards to Nikita Kucherov down low.
THAT'S ROSS GOAL-TON TO YOU pic.twitter.com/cH9UyQ0Znq — Tampa Bay Lightning (@TBLightning) May 20, 2022The Panthers had two power play chances in the third, one early, one late, and failed to convert on either.
Tampa Bay opened the scoring with yet another power-play goal 12:06 into the first.
Last-second, fatal mistake aside, the Panthers are matching Tampa Bay’s defensive game 5-on-5, proving that they can play low-scoring playoff hockey.
