     Marvel’s ‘Daredevil’ is born again at Disney+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney+ is bringing Daredevil back to streaming, with a new series based around the Marvel superhero in development from Covert Affairs co-creators Matt Corman and Chris Ord.
Charlie Cox previously portrayed the blind lawyer and superhero Matt Murdock for three seasons on Netflix from 2015-2018, as well as in the 2017 crossover miniseries The Defenders.
However, since that period has now expired, Disney appears keen to capitalise on the popular casting choices made in those projects by reviving some of the characters with the same talent attached.
Cox has since reappeared as Murdock in the feature film Spider-Man: No Way Home, while Vincent D’Onofrio, who portrayed the villain Wilson Fisk in the Netflix series, also reprised his role for Disney+ series Hawkeye earlier this year.
It has not been explicitly stated that Cox and D’Onofrio will return for a Disney+ Daredevil series, but both are reportedly attached to upcoming Hawkeye spin-off Echo, so odds are good.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the exciting news that Marvel Studios are developing a Daredevil series for Disney+, further details have claimed that the show will be a continuation of where the character left off on Netflix.

Due to this, the effort to bring certain characters over into the MCU proper has already begun, with Daredevil archenemy The Kingpin, played once again by Vincent D'Onofrio, featuring in the Disney+ series, Hawkeye.
And maybe there’s a little less blood, maybe there’s a little whatever, but I back them to do it.”How do you feel about the Daredevil Disney+ return being both a continuation and something new?

     Summary: Original Daredevil showrunners Erik Oleson and Steven S. DeKnight addressed reports that the former Netflix series' is getting a Disney+ revival.
Oleson, who oversaw Daredevil Season 3, responded to the news by tweeting "Thrilled to learn that #Daredevil lives on!

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige added further weight to rumors that a new Daredevil series was in the works during a 2021 interview.
Despite Feige's phrasing, it's worth noting that both Marvel Studios and Disney+ have yet to officially confirm the series is happening.
