     Judge puts hold on plan to lift Title 42 border expulsion policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to maintain, for now, pandemic-related restrictions that have largely closed the borders to asylum-seekers for more than two years.
The 47-page order from Judge Robert Summerhays of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana halts the Biden administration’s plans to lift the public health directive known as Title 42 on Monday.
Summerhays ruled that the policy should be maintained nationwide while two dozen Republican-led states pursue a lawsuit that challenges the Biden administration decision.
The judge found the states had proved they were likely to prevail on their claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not follow the proper steps when it issued its memo to terminate the Title 42 policy.
And Summerhays wrote that, if the Title 42 policy were lifted, the states would face unrecoverable increases in costs for health care reimbursements and education services for immigrants.

     Federal judge rules Title 42, allowing COVID asylum restrictions, must continue at border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday ruled that pandemic-related restrictions on migrants seeking asylum on the southern border must continue, blocking President Joe Biden's plan to terminate the Title 42 public health order Monday.
The Department of Justice announced its intent to appeal shortly after the ruling's release, arguing that ending Title 42 was a "lawful exercise of CDC’s authority."
With the appeal pending, she said the Biden administration will comply with the court's injunction and continue to enforce Title 42.
Over the past several weeks, he has been hit hard by Republicans and some Democrats for his administration’s decision to end Title 42.
More than 1 million people were expelled under Title 42 in fiscal year 2021.

     Summary: The order, known as Title 42, was enacted in March 2020, and scheduled to expire on Monday.
“They are not applying Title 42 across the board.
In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays acknowledged that ending Title 42 might have increased border crossings threefold to 18,000 per day.
Many migrants are repeat crossers because there are no legal consequences to being expelled under Title 42 authority.
U.S. authorities applied Title 42 in about four out of every 10 encounters.

     Judge says Title 42 COVID restrictions must continue on border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Pandemic-related restrictions on migrants seeking asylum on the southern border must continue, a judge ruled Friday in an order blocking the Biden administration’s plan to lift them early next week.
The ruling was just the latest instance of a court derailing the president’s proposed immigration policies along the U.S. border with Mexico.
The Justice Department said the administration will appeal, but the ruling virtually ensures that restrictions will not end as planned on Monday.
The judge cited what he said were the government’s own predictions that ending the restrictions would likely increase border crossings threefold, to as many as 18,000 daily.
Title 42 is the second major Trump-era policy to deter asylum at the Mexican border that was jettisoned by Biden, only to be revived by a Trump-appointed judge.

     Federal judge blocks Biden administration from ending Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He said the government could have considered the states’ concerns and perhaps devised an alternative to its “blanket” order ending Title 42.
In a video, he said the Title 42 order is “one of the last tools we have left in our toolbox” to stop an even greater influx of unauthorized immigrants.
Biden rejected Trump’s anti-immigration agenda, but his administration maintained Title 42 for so long that he ended up expelling migrants more times than his predecessor did.
Title 42 “is disrupting the processing of immigration laws that Congress enacted,” Justice Department attorney Jean Lin said during the May 13 hearing.
“The judge’s decision to block the termination of Title 42 is great news for border communities,” he wrote.
