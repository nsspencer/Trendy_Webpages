     Judge puts hold on plan to lift Title 42 border expulsion policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to maintain, for now, pandemic-related restrictions that have largely closed the borders to asylum-seekers for more than two years.
The 47-page order from Judge Robert Summerhays of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana halts the Biden administration’s plans to lift the public health directive known as Title 42 on Monday.
Summerhays ruled that the policy should be maintained nationwide while two dozen Republican-led states pursue a lawsuit that challenges the Biden administration decision.
The judge found the states had proved they were likely to prevail on their claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not follow the proper steps when it issued its memo to terminate the Title 42 policy.
And Summerhays wrote that, if the Title 42 policy were lifted, the states would face unrecoverable increases in costs for health care reimbursements and education services for immigrants.

     Federal judge rules Title 42, allowing COVID asylum restrictions, must continue at border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday ruled that pandemic-related restrictions on migrants seeking asylum on the southern border must continue, blocking President Joe Biden's plan to terminate the Title 42 public health order Monday.
The Department of Justice announced its intent to appeal shortly after the ruling's release, arguing that ending Title 42 was a "lawful exercise of CDC’s authority."
With the appeal pending, she said the Biden administration will comply with the court's injunction and continue to enforce Title 42.
Over the past several weeks, he has been hit hard by Republicans and some Democrats for his administration’s decision to end Title 42.
More than 1 million people were expelled under Title 42 in fiscal year 2021.

     Federal judge blocks Biden administration from lifting Title 42 for now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A federal judge in Louisiana has for now blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction, known as Title 42 , at the US-Mexico border, thwarting plans to terminate the controversial public health authority.
The termination of Title 42, the judge concluded, is not exempt from the notice and comment process, which can potentially take months.
The public health authority, which has been fiercely criticized by immigrant advocates, will remain in effect for now.
"Notwithstanding this injunction, a parallel injunction in DC prohibits the use of Title 42 to expel families who would face persecution or torture," Gelernt added.
"Our office will continue to do everything in our power to push back against the lawlessness of the Biden administration."

     Federal Court Blocks Biden From Ending Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A district judge ruled Friday that the Biden Administration must continue to expel migrants under Title 42, a COVID-19-related health measure first implemented under President Donald Trump.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that Title 42 is illegal because it prevents people from exercising their international right to claim asylum.
On May 20, Summerhays enjoined the order to end Title 42.
The Administration is now court ordered to continue enforcing Title 42, too, pending further legal battles.
Experts say the Administration’s effort to end Title 42 could mirror its legal battles over MPP.

     Federal judge blocks Biden administration from ending Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He said the government could have considered the states’ concerns and perhaps devised an alternative to its “blanket” order ending Title 42.
In a video, he said the Title 42 order is “one of the last tools we have left in our toolbox” to stop an even greater influx of unauthorized immigrants.
Biden rejected Trump’s anti-immigration agenda, but his administration maintained Title 42 for so long that he ended up expelling migrants more times than his predecessor did.
Title 42 “is disrupting the processing of immigration laws that Congress enacted,” Justice Department attorney Jean Lin said during the May 13 hearing.
“The judge’s decision to block the termination of Title 42 is great news for border communities,” he wrote.
