     Summary: One of two 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupes has sold for 135 million euros ($143 million at current exchange rates), making it the most expensive car of all time, Mercedes said Thursday in a press release.
1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut CoupeThe Uhlenhaut Coupe was intended as a successor to Moss' roofless 300 SLR.
However, the Uhlenhaut Coupe never got a chance to race.
The two Uhlenhaut Coupe prototypes were consigned to Mercedes' non-public classic collection, where the second prototype will remain.
So the now-privately owned Uhlenhaut coupe might actually see the light of day more often than it did while owned by Mercedes.

     This $142 Million Mercedes-Benz Just Became the Most Expensive Car Ever Sold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Formula 1 racers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell helped debut the all-electric Vision AMG concept car in what, on any other occasion, would be a truly grand finale.
Less than an hour after the Vision AMG was made public, Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, officially announced what’s claimed to be not just the world’s most expensive car sold at auction, but the priciest, period.
The streamlined coupé fetched a record-obliterating $142.8 million at an invite-only event presided by RM Sotheby’s at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, Germany, on May 5.
The car is one of only two prototype racers developed by engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut and his team for the 1955 Carrera Panamericana.
. . and what if we did something good with the money, something for society?’”That thought process led to the formation of the Mercedes-Benz Fund, which the sale of Uhlenhaut Coupé helped start.

     Mercedes-Benz crashes record for most expensive car sold at $142M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The German automotive brand confirmed that it has sold a luxury car for a mind-boggling $142 million (135 million EUR), shattering the previous record for the most expensive vehicle ever sold.
The automobile in question was an ultra-rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, one of only two ever manufactured.
Of the nine 300 SLR cars made, there were only two SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé prototypes.
“Nobody ever thought Mercedes would sell it.”The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé was named after Mercedes’ famed test department head Rudolf Uhlenhaut.
Mercedes-Benz AG/AFP via Getty IIndeed, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR’s value is due, in part, to the fact that the vehicle is exceedingly rare.

     Summary: A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR "Uhlenhaut Coupé" has smashed the record for most expensive car sold at auction.
And one example set an auction record years ago, before being eclipsed by others, including the aforementioned Ferrari.
After its success in its inaugural year, the W196 was adapted into a single-seat, open-top 300 SLR to compete in the 1955 World Sportscar Championship.
That alone would have made the 300 SLR a highly desirable collector's car, but it's impossible to ignore the dark side of its history as well.
At the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 300 SLR driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh crashed violently with another car, catapulting it into the grandstands.
