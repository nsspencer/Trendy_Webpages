     George Carlin's American Dream movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first hour or so of “George Carlin’s American Dream,” Apatow and Bonifiglio largely let Carlin speak for himself.
What “George Carlin’s American Dream” really captures is how much its subject was willing to shift and change, never just to sell tickets but to figure out what mattered to him as an artist.
It’s remarkable how “George Carlin’s American Dream” digs into why Carlin was so smart and so talented and somehow avoids hagiography.
It helps that “GCAD” clearly has the blessing of those close to Carlin, including his daughter and widow, who allow a window into the deeply personal side of the public figure.
Specials about comedy talents are often just excuses to watch the best bits of a famous star, but “George Carlin’s American Dream” is way more than that.

     'George Carlin's American Dream' finds the right words to capture the comedy icon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) George Carlin rose to prominence as a stand-up comedian in the 1960s and '70s, reinventing himself multiple times over a career that reveled in the use of language and took sharp aim at society.
The complexity of that life and resonance of those words, dirty or otherwise, is neatly distilled into "George Carlin's American Dream," a perceptive two-part look at a comedy legend who, as W. Kamau Bell observes, "still seems to be talking to us."
"I wanted to be just like him, getting every word in the right spot," Jerry Seinfeld says.
"Because when he did it, it thrilled me."

     Summary: That was George Carlin's signature “Class Clown.”“The way George Carlin looked at the world and broke it down taught so many of us how to be comedians,” said Judd Apatow.
We are all humans here trying to figure out our way,” said Kelly Carlin, who co-executive produced the series.
She was a particular fan of his four-hour 2018 HBO documentary on comedian Garry Shandling.
He didn’t share his inner life much with people.”The documentary charts Carlin's reinventions against the backdrop of huge social changes — Watergate, Vietnam, Reaganomics, hippie culture, among them.
"It was kind of a two -way sort of a thing.”The documentary comes at a time when Carlin's observations are making a comeback.

“It’s called the American dream,” Carlin says, ending the segment, “because you have to be asleep to believe it.”Reviews Pre-Air Reviews Pre-Air George Carlin’s American Dream B+ B+ George Carlin’s American Dream Directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio Premieres Part one on May 20 on HBO, part two on May 21 Format DocumentaryAdvertisementBut that Carlin—the, to quote Howard Beale in Network, “angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times”—was only one of many.
(That list by no means captures all of Carlin’s stages or the intricacies of them.)
On paper, American Dream seems to be guilty of both.
In fact, he could be construed as a testament to that American bootstrap mythology, a takeaway that would probably make Carlin roll his eyes.

El documental también analiza la adicción de Carlin a la cocaína y su confusión personal.
Bonfiglio agregó: “Era fascinante ver la variedad de comediantes de diferentes edades y diferentes orígenes y la influencia que él ha tenido en la gente”.
El documental llega en momentos en el que las observaciones de Carlin están siendo revisadas.
“Y creo que la razón por la que él sigue apareciendo es porque era alguien con quien podíamos comunicarnos.

     Judd Apatow on Documenting the Legacy (and Fart Jokes) of George Carlin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Something that popped out to me was Carlin talking about how doing acid changed the way he did comedy.
Something I was happy to see was that you made room to talk about Carlin’s fart jokes.
I wish people listened to George Carlin in 1970 when he warned us about what was happening to our environment.
It feels like Carlin has the same problem as George Orwell when it comes to people trying to claim his legacy.
With everything going on, from conversations about freedom of speech to Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle getting attacked onstage, what do you think Carlin would make of this moment in stand-up comedy?
