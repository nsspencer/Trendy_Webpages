     Judge puts hold on plan to lift Title 42 border expulsion policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to maintain, for now, pandemic-related restrictions that have largely closed the borders to asylum-seekers for more than two years.
The 47-page order from Judge Robert Summerhays of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana halts the Biden administration’s plans to lift the public health directive known as Title 42 on Monday.
Summerhays ruled that the policy should be maintained nationwide while two dozen Republican-led states pursue a lawsuit that challenges the Biden administration decision.
The judge found the states had proved they were likely to prevail on their claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not follow the proper steps when it issued its memo to terminate the Title 42 policy.
And Summerhays wrote that, if the Title 42 policy were lifted, the states would face unrecoverable increases in costs for health care reimbursements and education services for immigrants.

     Federal judge rules Title 42, allowing COVID asylum restrictions, must continue at border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday ruled that pandemic-related restrictions on migrants seeking asylum on the southern border must continue, blocking President Joe Biden's plan to terminate the Title 42 public health order Monday.
The Department of Justice announced its intent to appeal shortly after the ruling's release, arguing that ending Title 42 was a "lawful exercise of CDC’s authority."
With the appeal pending, she said the Biden administration will comply with the court's injunction and continue to enforce Title 42.
Over the past several weeks, he has been hit hard by Republicans and some Democrats for his administration’s decision to end Title 42.
More than 1 million people were expelled under Title 42 in fiscal year 2021.

     Summary: But, broadly, Biden aides felt they had been placed in a no-win situation: if Title 42 were overturned, the resulting flood of migrants could create a Republican talking point.
Biden ran on revamping the immigration system and putting an end to Trump-era deportation policies, such as Title 42.
Ending Title 42 would be a complete disaster for a nation already suffering from the Biden Border Crisis,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.
Title 42 is a public health emergency policy that can be initiated and ended by an administration.
Even though the Louisiana court has now stopped Title 42 from lifting on Monday, Gelernt said, the D.C.

     Federal Judge Blocks Biden From Ending Title 42 Border Restrictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “These costs are not recoverable.”The judge's ruling means that the Title 42 restrictions won't end Monday, as the Biden administration had planned.
"Title 42 is a public health emergency policy that can be initiated and ended by an administration.
Title 42 was imposed in March 2020 under the Trump administration at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under Title 42 U.S. border officials may quickly expel migrants to Mexico or their home countries without processing their asylum claims.
According to U.S. government data, migrants have been expelled about 2 million times since Title 42 was put in place in 2020.

     Federal judge blocks Biden administration from ending Title 42

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He said the government could have considered the states’ concerns and perhaps devised an alternative to its “blanket” order ending Title 42.
In a video, he said the Title 42 order is “one of the last tools we have left in our toolbox” to stop an even greater influx of unauthorized immigrants.
Biden rejected Trump’s anti-immigration agenda, but his administration maintained Title 42 for so long that he ended up expelling migrants more times than his predecessor did.
Title 42 “is disrupting the processing of immigration laws that Congress enacted,” Justice Department attorney Jean Lin said during the May 13 hearing.
“The judge’s decision to block the termination of Title 42 is great news for border communities,” he wrote.
