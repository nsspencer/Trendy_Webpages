     Summary: 3 of 3Rob Carr/Getty ImagesWhile trainers and jockeys play obvious roles in any big-stakes race, Lukas and Saez aren't the only reasons why Secret Oath has a shot at claiming back-to-back victories.
"When she gets to a horse, if you ask her, she gets past them quick," Lukas said of Secret Oath, per Shawn Stepner of WMAR Baltimore.
However, Secret Oath isn't the late-week favorite.
That would be Kentucky Derby runner-up Epicenter.
The Antonio Sano-trained colt will be jockeyed by John Velazquez, who has three Kentucky Derby wins and two Belmont wins on his resume.

     Summary: Pari-mutuel betting on Saturday’s Preakness Stakes began Friday morning, and live odds have been posted at Pimlico.
The day-before odds usually are confined to on-track bets at the Baltimore track.
It also is why advance-deposit wagering platforms have not shown the live odds until race day.
These were the live odds shown at Pimlico on Friday at 6:15 p.m. EDT.
If Epicenter were to win the Preakness on Saturday, the $2 double would pay $47.20.

     Summary: (Jerry Jackson/Baltimore Sun)Saturday’s 147th running of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course lost a bit of luster with the defection of upset Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike.
Sent off as the favorite in the Kentucky Derby, Epicenter ran a brave race and looked like a winner until Rich Strike struck.
AdvertisementIn the Kentucky Derby, Simplification had an uncomfortable trip and was farther back than expected chasing the hot fractions.
That’s new shooter Early Voting for the powerful barn of trainer Chad Brown.
Some of these runners — especially Fenwick, Early Voting and Armagnac (12-1 morning line) — look likely to be in the early vanguard.
