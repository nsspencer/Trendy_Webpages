     Travis Scott x Nike Is Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travis Scott is resuming his blockbuster Nike partnership with a new riff on the Air Trainer 1, plus a capsule collection of apparel, which he released in a relatively surprise drop on his website this afternoon.
This latest collection, initially scheduled for release last December, but was indefinitely postponed after the 2021 Astroworld Festival, where ten people died from injuries sustained in a massive crowd crush during Scott’s headlining performance.
They both sport backwards swooshes, a signature of Scott’s previous Nike shoes.
travisscott.comIn early 2020, Yu-Ming Wu, chief marketing officer of the sneaker resale platform Stadium Goods, told GQ that “Travis Scott is arguably the biggest sneaker collaborator,” matched only in hype and sales by the late designer Virgil Abloh—who, like Scott, began working with Nike in 2017.
He also made a return to the red carpet at the Billboard Music Awards last weekend alongside his partner, Kylie Jenner, and their 4-year-old daughter, Stormi.

     Travis Scott Nike Drop Gets Over 1 Million Entries in 30 Minutes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travis Scott still has the golden touch, or at least a VERY loyal group of fans, because his first merchandise drop since Astroworld just went crazy online.
Travis released a new collab Friday with pants, jackets, shirts and vests -- but it's the two pairs of Travis Scott Air Trainer 1's that really had fans in a frenzy, trying to score some of their own.
In fact, the hype was so wild for the shoe, Travis and his team needed to create a raffle to make everything fair.
This isn't it for Travis and Nike ... we've also heard there's rumblings of additional Nike releases next week, including an Airmax next Friday.
Of course, Travis has also had insanely successful releases with McDonald's, Fortnite and his Cacti hard seltzer flew off the shelves when it was released.

     Official Look at the Travis Scott x Nike Air Trainer 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the tragic events that transpired at the last Astroworld Festival, Nike felt it was appropriate to hold off on all product launches that were tied to Travis Scott until the smoke was clear.
The Cactus Jack head honcho has readied a batch of Air Max 1s and Air Trainer 1s, the latter of which have just been revealed by way of official imagery.
Medial side Swooshes arrive in reversed fashion and the Cactus Jack logo is printed on the left inserts.
Early reports have these slated to drop on May 27 via Nike for $140 USD a pop.
