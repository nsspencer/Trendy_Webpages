     Marvel’s ‘Daredevil’ set to return for Disney+ series, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s National Streaming Day, and there’s now another reason to suscribe to Disney+.
According to “Variety,” the streaming service is creating a new “Daredevil” series.
Netflix’s “Daredevil” series was cancelled in 2018 after three seasons, but two actors from that series – Charlie Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio – have both appeared in recent Marvel projects.
In addition, other Netflix series – Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and The Punisher - have been released on Disney+.
Charlie Cox reprised his role as Matt Murdock (Daredevil) in “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” while D’Onofrio returned as Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) in the Disney+ series “Hawkeye.”Mark Heim is a reporter for The Alabama Media Group.

     The Daredevil revival on Disney Plus makes the streaming service more mature
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney+ via youTubeHighly lauded superhero series "Daredevil" will get a revival on Disney Plus, the mega-corporation announced Thursday.
The announcement is no surprise to fans: Charlie Cox reprised the character in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and Vincent D'Onofrio played Kingpin as the primary antagonist in Disney's own "Hawkeye."
Which begs the question: How will Disney adapt the ultra-violent interpretation of the character for their more family-friendly brand?
While it's true the Marvel Cinematic Universe has strayed into more violent territory, nothing has been as intensely violent as, for example, Frank Castle carving someone's throat open with a shiv, drenching his own face in gore (viewer discretion is advised for that link, obviously).

Why Daredevil’s Superhuman Senses Are Failing?
But during Daredevil season 2 the Punisher shoots him in the head.
To protect himself, Matt started training to sharpen his physical abilities and superhuman senses.
I wanted that to be the approach for season 3, to really get into the characters’ heads.”Related: Daredevil Season 4: 3 Characters We Want To Return (&amp; 3 We Don’t)
