     A 'bear market' looms. What exactly does that mean?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 Index fell into a so-called bear market on Friday.
"Bear market" is a term used by investors to describe a steep and sustained market downturn.
Investors commonly apply the phrase to a broad stock index like the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it also works for individual stocks.
There isn't anything particularly special about the 20% demarcation line used to define a bear market.
"It's a shortcut in language around the financial markets that people use," said Charlie Fitzgerald III, an Orlando, Florida-based certified financial planner, of bear markets.

     S&amp;P 500 Drops for Seventh Straight Week but Evades Bear Market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the heart of those fears was fresh evidence reported this week from retailers like Walmart and Target that rising costs were now hitting corporate America.
Even as the costs of goods, transportation and labor increased, companies were able to pocket record profits by raising prices, confident that people would continue buying.
But this week brought indications that some consumers may have reached their limit, and profits have started to shrink.
A bear market occurred in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, but it was the shortest on record, lasting just 33 days before stocks began to rally.
Less than six months later, the S&amp;P 500 began hitting new highs again, climbing 42 percent above its prepandemic level before starting to slide in January.

     Summary: Stocks entered a bear market.
One of the broadest stock market indexes, the S&amp;P 500, entered a bear market during Friday's trading.
A bear market is considered an important barometer of investor pessimism and is symbolic of a deep and sustained market selloff.
The S&amp;P 500 didn't remain in bear market territory for too long and recovered to end the day barely changed.
Among Friday's biggest stock market losers was the Deere, which is one of the largest tractor makers in the world.

     S&amp;P 500 briefly falls into bear market territory as recession fears mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The S&amp;P 500 briefly fell into bear market territory Friday, slipping more than 20% from its record high and potentially ending the bull run that began in March 2020.
A reversal late in the day pushed the index higher at the market's close and saved it from reaching an official bear market designation.
The S&amp;P 500 managed to squeak 0.01% higher at Friday's closing bell, or about 18% down from its January 3 record high, after falling by as much as 2.3% earlier in the day.
The move comes on the heels of seven straight weekly losses for the index and follows months of precipitous market drops.
The S&amp;P 500 has long been considered the most accurate measure of the nation's stock performance.

     Why the looming bear market will be different
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN Business) When a bear market arrives, it's not pretty, especially for investors making short-term decisions.
Quick refresher: A "bear market" refers to when stocks drop 20% or more from their recent peak.
Since World War II, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced 17 bear markets or near bear markets, according to an analysis by LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick.
Historically, when the S&amp;P 500 has entered a bear market, the average drop was almost 30% and went on for nearly a year.
Usually, a bear market bottoms out when the Fed decides its work is done and eases policy.

What’s Driving The Bear Market?
What To ExpectFirst off, a bear market is primarily a historical observation.
Holding a mix of assets and countries can help make sure that you aren’t exposed to the worst losses in a bear market.
So while the bear market lasts, we may expect some volatility with value-oriented stocks and fixed income likely outperforming.

     Final-Hour Rally Yanks Wall Street From Maw of Bear Market

     Summary: It’s a sharp turnaround from the powerful run Wall Street enjoyed after emerging from its last bear market in early 2020, at the start of the pandemic.
That means the pain has widened beyond tech and high-growth stocks to encompass more of Wall Street.
Although its source is different, the gloom on Wall Street is mirroring a sense of exasperation across the country.
They even got GameStop to surge suddenly to such a high level that it sent shudders through professional Wall Street.
But these traders, called “retail investors” by Wall Street to differentiate them from big institutional investors, have been pulling back as stocks have tumbled.

Friday afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crossed the bear market threshold of a 20 percent decline from its peak on Jan. 3.
