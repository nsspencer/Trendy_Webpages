     Ginni Thomas urged Arizona Republicans to overturn 2020 result – report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ginni Thomas, the wife of the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Republicans in Arizona to overturn Joe Biden’s victory there in 2020, the Washington Post reported.
Ginni Thomas is an activist with deep ties on the Republican far right.
On Friday, the Post said Ginni Thomas emailed two Arizona Republicans on 9 November, six days after election day and two days after Biden’s win was called.
Nor did Ginni Thomas.
Clarence Thomas, Meyer said, is godfather “to Clint Bolick’s child, and Bolick’s wife is the Arizona lawmaker who Ginni Thomas pressured to overturn the 2020 election.

     Newly revealed Ginni Thomas emails show deeper role in bid to overturn 2020 election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Justice Thomas, meanwhile, has taken part in the court’s consideration of lawsuits challenging the election results.
In January, Thomas was the lone member of the court who supported a bid by Trump to withhold documents from the Jan 6. committee.
Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me, and I don’t involve him in my work,” Thomas told the Washington Free Beacon in an interview published in March.
Thomas sent emails to Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers and Rep. Shawnna Bolick, who this year is running for Arizona secretary of state.
“As state lawmakers, you have the Constitutional power and authority to protect the integrity of our elections — and we need you to exercise that power now!” the email said.

    </h2>

     Summary: Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, urged Arizona state lawmakers to reverse former President Donald Trump's election loss in 2020 by choosing electors themselves.
Bowers did not see Thomas' message, he said Friday in a written statement to The Arizona Republic.
"This bill would give the Arizona Legislature back the power it delegated to certify the electors.
A spokesperson for Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich did not immediately say whether Thomas filed a formal complaint alleging fraud.
“Article II of the United States Constitution gives you an awesome responsibility: to choose our state’s Electors,” Thomas wrote in a Nov. 9 email, the Post said.

Ginni Thomas repeated President Donald Trump's false claims that the election was marred by fraud.
The messages reveal how Thomas was more deeply involved in the effort to reverse Biden's win than previously known.
'Great American patriot, Ginni Thomas, the wonderful wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, is reported to have fought for voter integrity in the great state of Arizona,' he posted on Truth Social.
Ethics groups said her stance meant that Justice Thomas should recuse himself from election-related cases.

     Comments from Clarence Thomas suggest ‘antagonism’ with Chief Justice Roberts: legal expert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas has also had his share of disagreements with conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, and the disagreements between Thomas and Roberts were evident when Thomas spoke at a conference in Dallas recently.
Discussing the atmosphere on the High Court before 2005, Thomas told the Dallas crowd, “We actually trusted each other.
We may have been a dysfunctional family, but we were a family — and we loved it.”Thomas’ comments come at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Roberts, with his institutionalist approach, is positioned as the one justice who might generate a compromise opinion that stops short of completely overturning Roe v. Wade, at least this year.
That would thwart an outcome that Thomas has worked toward for decades.”Biskupic observes that “Thomas' sudden aim at Roberts' leadership is new.

     Summary: Thomas, sitting to Roberts' right, beamed and slung his arm over the chief's shoulder.
Roberts, with his institutionalist approach, is positioned as the one justice who might generate a compromise opinion that stops short of completely overturning Roe v. Wade, at least this year.
After Politico on May 2 published a first-draft opinion dated February 10 that appeared to show a majority ready to reverse Roe v. Wade, advocates on both sides swung into overdrive.
The controversy over Roe v. Wade and the disclosed draft seemed to provoke most of his comments.
Roberts, who has opposed abortion rights in the past, based his vote on adherence to precedent.

“Article II of the United States Constitution gives you an awesome responsibility: to choose our state’s Electors,” read the Nov. 9 email.
“Before you choose your state’s Electors … consider what will happen to the nation we all love if you don’t stand up and lead,” the email said.
Efforts to persuade state lawmakers to name new electors are among the issues under examination by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.
When Trump’s legal team pressed to replace Biden electors with Trump electors, Bowers released a public statement explaining that they were asking legislators to do something forbidden by state law.
