    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Night Sky , now out on Prime Video, is going where no television show has gone before — to space.
Prime Video, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and satellite services providers SES and Intelsat all worked together to beam the show into space among the stars.
With more than double the regular amount of UFO reports , perhaps there’s some distant alien lifeform who will discover the broadcast.
This marks Night Sky as the TV series that has traveled the furthest for distribution, and Prime Video the first streaming service to broadcast any content into space.
They also encouraged anyone viewing it who resides in any of Prime Video’s 240 countries and territories to tune into the full series.

     Prime Video's Night Sky is a Sentimental but Hollow Sci-fi Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is a quaint and curious opening premise for a sci-fi story about the wonder of such a partnership, and yet “Night Sky” (created by Holden Miller) proves to have few standout ideas of its own afterward.
“Night Sky” concerns themes of caring for loved ones, and experiences with loss and aging, at least initially with Franklin and Irene’s tender story, which could have been something like a Sundance indie on its own.
Meanwhile, a nosy neighbor named Byron (Adam Bartley) has his own frustrations about trying to make something of himself in their small town of Farnsworth, Illinois while struggling to earn the respect of his grumbling neighbor Franklin.
His true background feels hazier and hazier, even when he finds himself being taken care of inside the York home.
“Night Sky” toys with a connectivity for everyone, in a way that only picks up speed in the second-to-last episode of season one.

     'Night Sky' review: A sweet love story with a sci-fi twist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) You know that pleasant older couple across the street, who mostly keep to themselves?
That's the out-there premise of "Night Sky," an Amazon series that combines science fiction and mystery with that rarest of commodities -- a touching love story involving an old married couple -- in an intriguing if plodding format.
They take some solace from disappearing into the shed out back and gazing out at an alien landscape, whose existence remains a closely guarded secret.
"There's a reason we were the ones who found this," Irene says.
"Night Sky" feels very much like another recent hybrid Amazon show, the Josh Brolin vehicle "Outer Range," which mixes family drama with what appears to be some kind of extraterrestrial window while taking its sweet time in sprinkling out a trail of breadcrumbs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch the first episode of Night Sky and you’ll have found your new favourite show.
Carry on for another seven and you’ll wish you stopped a lot earlier.
Spread far too thin over eight hours, Amazon’s new sci-fi series is only occasionally brilliant – mostly coming off as a missed opportunity for a beautiful standalone film.
Feeling as gracefully old-fashioned as its two perfect leads, and deftly turning an original sci-fi idea into a sweetly melancholy love story, Night Sky comes annoyingly close to greatness.

     Night Sky review: A sci-fi mystery that looks down, not up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In many ways, Night Sky feels deeply indebted to past sci-fi TV hits like Lost and even Netflix’s Lost in Space reboot.
For that reason, there are moments when Night Sky feels more like a family drama than it does a grand sci-fi mystery.
If some of those check-ins had been cut, Night Sky would probably flow a lot better than it does.
As a matter of fact, Night Sky is often at its best when it’s not doing that, and that, as they say, is the rub.
Season 1 of Night Sky premieres Friday, May 20 on Amazon Prime Video.

     Summary: That’s certainly true of the new Amazon series Night Sky.
NIGHT SKY: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
In a weird way, Night Sky has some of the same sci fi DNA as Outer Range, even if the tone is wildly different.
Our Take: Night Sky, created by Holden Miller and Daniel C. Connolly, has a sweetness to it that we don’t get from most sci fi.
Night Sky is a decent series that is nudged into the very good category because of the performances of J.K. Simmons and Sissy Spacek.

     Amazon's latest stunt is beaming a new Prime Video sci-fi show into outer space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon tried a novel marketing strategy to get more eyeballs (or eyestalks) on a new Prime Video show: it beamed the first episode of sci-fi series Night Sky out of Earth's atmosphere.
The company pulled off the stunt earlier today for what it's calling "the first-ever intergalactic premiere for a TV series."
Prime Video noted in a press release that the transmission won't be caught by broadcast satellites and sent back to terra firma, as is usually the case.
Prime Video claims it's not only the first streaming service to send its content to space, but it marks the "farthest distance that a TV series has been intentionally distributed."
Night Sky premiered on Prime Video today.
