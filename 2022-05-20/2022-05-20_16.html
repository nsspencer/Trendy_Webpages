     A 1955 Mercedes-Benz Fetches Record $143 Million at Auction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Text sizeA 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé sold for €135 million (US$143 million) at an auction at RM Sotheby’s, making it the most expensive car, and one of the top 10 most valuable collectible items, ever sold in the world.
Previously, the highest price achieved by a car at auction was a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, which sold for €90 million through RM Sotheby’s in 2018, the auction house said.
Mercedes-Benz will donate the proceeds to establish a fund to provide scholarships for young people pursuing environmental sciences.
The private buyer, whose identity was not disclosed, “has agreed that the 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé will remain accessible for public display on special occasions,” Breitschwerdt said.
The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé was designed by and named after Rudolf Uhlenhaut, chief engineer of Mercedes-Benz’s racing department from the mid-1930s until early 1970s.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of two 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupes has sold for 135 million euros ($143 million at current exchange rates), making it the most expensive car of all time, Mercedes said Thursday in a press release.
1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut CoupeThe Uhlenhaut Coupe was intended as a successor to Moss' roofless 300 SLR.
However, the Uhlenhaut Coupe never got a chance to race.
The two Uhlenhaut Coupe prototypes were consigned to Mercedes' non-public classic collection, where the second prototype will remain.
So the now-privately owned Uhlenhaut coupe might actually see the light of day more often than it did while owned by Mercedes.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The German automotive brand confirmed that it has sold a luxury car for a mind-boggling $142 million (135 million EUR), shattering the previous record for the most expensive vehicle ever sold.
The automobile in question was an ultra-rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, one of only two ever manufactured.
Of the nine 300 SLR cars made, there were only two SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé prototypes.
“Nobody ever thought Mercedes would sell it.”The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé was named after Mercedes’ famed test department head Rudolf Uhlenhaut.
Mercedes-Benz AG/AFP via Getty IIndeed, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR’s value is due, in part, to the fact that the vehicle is exceedingly rare.

     This $142 Million Mercedes-Benz Just Became the Most Expensive Car Ever Sold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This time, however, that reveal was succeeded by the unveiling of a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, which became the most expensive car in history when it crossed the auction block for an astounding $142.8 million earlier this month.
It’s hard to believe that a car representing such a pivotal shift for AMG could be upstaged, but indeed it was.
Less than an hour after the Vision AMG was made public, Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, officially announced what’s claimed to be not just the world’s most expensive car sold at auction, but the priciest, period.
This 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé sold for $142.8 million at auction on May 5.
Mercedes-Benz AGThat thought process led to the formation of the Mercedes-Benz Fund, which the sale of the Uhlenhaut Coupé helped start.
