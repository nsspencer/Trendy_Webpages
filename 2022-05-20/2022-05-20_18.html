     Summary: The new design looks similar to Red Bull's and comes after two senior aerodynamicists, Dan Fallows and Andrew Alessi, left Red Bull to join Aston Martin at the end of last year.
"During this process, it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor.
In the analysis we carried out we confirmed that the processes followed by Aston Martin were consistent with this Article's requirements."
"Oracle Red Bull Racing have noted the FIA's statement with interest," the team's statement said.
The Aston Martin update has been applied to both cars in Spain, with the team's mechanics breaking F1's paddock curfew to complete the work ahead of Friday's practice sessions.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were next in their Mercedes, which have struggled to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull this season.
Carlos Sainz clocked the fourth-best time in his Ferrari, followed by defending champion Max Verstappen for Red Bull.
Leclerc leads Verstappen by 19 points after five races, but Verstappen has cut the deficit after back-to-back wins in Italy and Miami.
Ferrari is hoping that upgrades it has brought to Spain can help it match the race speed that Red Bull has enjoyed in the last two races, when Verstappen beat Leclerc.
“Hopefully (the upgrade) will be a good one and enough to be in front of Red Bull again,” Leclerc said.

The Aston Martin has already been dubbed the “green Red Bull” and Red Bull’s pit-wall team were pointedly sat with the green version of the drink at their work stations during practice.

Speaking on Friday ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix, Ocon revealed he had a chat with Wittich earlier in the week and was left satisfied the corner will be made safer when F1 returns next year.
“I had a chat with the race director yesterday, we had a one-hour chat to be fair on all of this situation and why it had not been explained,” Ocon said.
“There will be changes on the track next year, on that regard for safety.
“We left the weekend with two drivers with a sore neck and nearly two broken chassis for a very slow crash,” Sainz said.

     Summary: But the similarities between the updated Aston Martin and Red Bull’s RB18 car were quickly noted, leading to the design being dubbed a ‘green Red Bull’.
The FIA clamped down on reverse engineering car designs in the wake of the Pink Mercedes case, and revealed in Barcelona on Friday that it did look into the updated Aston Martin car.
F1’s governing body said that during a “routine pre-event legality check” of the planned Aston Martin updates, “it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor”.
Through the investigation, the FIA found that Aston Martin had complied with the regulations through its process, making the new updates legal.
“In the analysis we carried out we confirmed that the processes followed by Aston Martin were consistent with this Article’s requirements.”A spokesperson from Aston Martin said: “We have shared details of our update with the FIA technical people.

Despite his crash, Leclerc said it was "always an honour" for him to drive historic cars and that "it's also part of our job and sometimes we need to go into those cars."
He said: "To be honest, before that I think all the checks that had to be done was done.
"It's always also an honour for me and I'm always very happy and very glad to be driving those cars and always a pleasure too.
The Ferrari driver, who leads the 2022 F1 drivers' standings after five rounds, said he feels an emotional connection driving historic cars and said it's "great to experience what it was like and what it's like now."
