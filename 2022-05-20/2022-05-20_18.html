     Summary: But beyond the laptimes, both drivers were mostly happy with how the feel of the Mercedes W13 had been transformed, and that most of the porpoising troubles that have marred its start to 2022 had been banished.
Super happy with the progress, so a big, big, big, big thank you to everyone back at the factory for not giving up and for continuing to push.

     Summary: The new design looks similar to Red Bull's and comes after two senior aerodynamicists, Dan Fallows and Andrew Alessi, left Red Bull to join Aston Martin at the end of last year.
"During this process, it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor.
In the analysis we carried out we confirmed that the processes followed by Aston Martin were consistent with this Article's requirements."
"Oracle Red Bull Racing have noted the FIA's statement with interest," the team's statement said.
The Aston Martin update has been applied to both cars in Spain, with the team's mechanics breaking F1's paddock curfew to complete the work ahead of Friday's practice sessions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were next in their Mercedes, which have struggled to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull this season.
Carlos Sainz clocked the fourth-best time in his Ferrari, followed by defending champion Max Verstappen for Red Bull.
Leclerc leads Verstappen by 19 points after five races, but Verstappen has cut the deficit after back-to-back wins in Italy and Miami.
Ferrari is hoping that upgrades it has brought to Spain can help it match the race speed that Red Bull has enjoyed in the last two races, when Verstappen beat Leclerc.
“Hopefully (the upgrade) will be a good one and enough to be in front of Red Bull again,” Leclerc said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Ferrari has now revealed that a fuel system issue on Sainz’s car has prompted it to complete a chassis change ahead of Saturday’s running in Spain.
The switch was reported by FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer in his most recent update on Saturday morning, confirming the scrutineering declaration form for the car had been completed after the chassis change.
Ferrari subsequently confirmed that this was “due to a fuel system issue”.
There is no penalty or sanction for the chassis change.
Sainz is not the only driver to have undergone a chassis change ahead of final practice in Spain on Saturday.

     Summary: The governing body subsequently said it was satisfied that Aston Martin followed the rules, and that the AMR22 changes were created fully independently.
However, Red Bull is not completely convinced and has expressed concerns that some of its data may have been taken to Aston Martin when personnel moved from its squad to its Silverstone-based rival.
“I don’t know what these accusations are that Red Bull are talking about,” he said.
While it admits it went the wrong way, it said it was surprised when it saw Red Bull come out with the same idea.
And it came as a shock, but also a surprise, that Red Bull came out with a similar concept, as well.

In Miami he had a huge crash in FP1, and had to sit out the later FP2 session.
"Unfortunately, this seems a bit of a trend,” said Bottas when asked by Motorsport.com about his ongoing misfortune.
“Based on that one lap in FP2 I can say that it seems to be working,” he said.
OK, it’s Barcelona, I think in two laps he will recover, and even the lap he did was a very good one.

     Summary: But there are some other changes – both big and small – that differentiate it from the Aston Martin car that was last rolled out in Miami.
The extent of similarities between the Aston Martin updates and Red Bull’s RB18 saw the FIA carry out an investigation into the matter.
F1’s governing body said that during a “routine pre-event legality check” of the planned Aston Martin updates, “it became apparent that a number of features on the Aston Martin resembled those of another Competitor”, triggering an investigation relating to reverse engineering and "potential illicit IP transfer”.
Through the investigation, the FIA found Aston Martin had complied with the regulations through its process, making the new updates legal.

     Summary: Leclerc was taking part in a demonstration run at the 2022 Monaco Historic event last Sunday when the 1974 Ferrari 312B3 suffered a brake issue.
His team-mate Carlos Sainz said on Thursday that he wouldn’t want to take the risk of driving a historic car while Ferrari were in the title fight.
“It’s always also an honour for me and I’m always very happy and very glad to be driving those cars and always a pleasure too.
But he said he had more fun in Lauda’s car due to the 312T4 running on museum tyres.
“I got to meet Niki a few times in the paddock in the past and yeah, they are just legends of our sports, of course it’s always amazing to be driving their cars.”
