     Preakness 2022: See updated odds to win Saturday at Pimlico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pari-mutuel betting on Saturday’s Preakness Stakes began Friday morning, and live odds have been posted at Pimlico.
The day-before odds usually are confined to on-track bets at the Baltimore track.
It also is why advance-deposit wagering platforms have not shown the live odds until race day.
These were the live odds shown at Pimlico on Friday at 6:15 p.m. EDT.
If Epicenter were to win the Preakness on Saturday, the $2 double would pay $47.20.

     Summary: 3 of 3Rob Carr/Getty ImagesWhile trainers and jockeys play obvious roles in any big-stakes race, Lukas and Saez aren't the only reasons why Secret Oath has a shot at claiming back-to-back victories.
"When she gets to a horse, if you ask her, she gets past them quick," Lukas said of Secret Oath, per Shawn Stepner of WMAR Baltimore.
However, Secret Oath isn't the late-week favorite.
That would be Kentucky Derby runner-up Epicenter.
The Antonio Sano-trained colt will be jockeyed by John Velazquez, who has three Kentucky Derby wins and two Belmont wins on his resume.
