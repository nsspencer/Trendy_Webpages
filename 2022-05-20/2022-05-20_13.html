     Avalanche vs. St. Louis Blues Game 3: Three keys to victory for Colorado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS — The Avalanche enters Game 3 of its Western Conference semifinal series against the Blues with mixed feelings.
Colorado played extremely well in Game 1’s 3-2 overtime victory but looked discombobulated in Game 2’s 4-1 defeat.
St. Louis had an improved forecheck in Game 2, often eliminating Avs defensemen from consistently moving the puck up ice.
Get the puck behind St. Louis’ defenseman and make the Blues work at taking it end to end.
St. Louis’ first two goals were scored off deflections from Avalanche defensemen.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The St. Louis Blues elevated their play to earn a split following their first two games of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Colorado Avalanche.
The Avalanche will look for a better performance in Game 3 on Saturday in St. Louis.
Colorado registered 54 shots on goal in Game 1, with St. Louis' Jordan Binnington making 51 saves to keep his team in the contest.
St. Louis made dramatic improvement in the faceoff circle, winning 60.7 percent of its draws in Game 2 after winning just 35.8 percent in Game 1.
We also can be even better, which is a good sign when you play a good game."

     Colorado Avalanche Player Grades, Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cale Makar : C – Fans were holding their breath as he looked injured at the end of the first but he came back out and finished the game.
Nathan MacKinnon: C – Played hard, but couldn’t get the goal the team needed to keep them in it.
The Avs need him to get going numbers- wise, though he did have a very good puck-possession Game 1.
He had a costly mistake that led to the Blues third goal of the game and essentially the back breaker.
It’s hard to blame this game on him, but Binnington is certainly winning the goalie duel right now.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Game 2 did not look anything like Game 1.
In Game 1, Colorado controlled the entire game from the second period onward, as exemplified by their thirteen to zero shot advantage in eight minutes of overtime.
I don’t need to say it, Nathan Mackinnon already said it for me: “We were really bad tonight.”Every team at every level of every sport in human history has had an off day.
The Blues are extremely dangerous and by ceding home ice advantage to them in this series, the Avalanche are now officially playing with fire.
They are the better team in this series, they just have to play like it.

     Perron's scoring powering Blues heading into Game 3 against Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS -- Thanks to some motivation and a desire to make up for lost time, David Perron finds himself in elite company in St. Louis Blues history heading into Game 3 of the Western Conference Second Round against the Colorado Avalanche at Enterprise Center on Saturday (8 p.m.
That the best-of-7 series against the Avalanche, the top-seeded team in the Western Conference, is tied 1-1 is in large part a testament to Perron.
This is not the first time this postseason that Perron, who turns 34 on May 28, has played his way into St. Louis playoff lore.
[RELATED: Complete Avalanche vs. Blues series coverage]"Yeah, after all these years, it's a long way coming for many reasons, many ways, so obviously I'm proud of that," Perron said.
"He's been a good power-play guy for some time now, whether it's shooting, or he makes plays.

     3 Takeaways from the Avalanche’s Loss to the Blues in Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Colorado Avalanche and the St. Louis Blues locked horns again at Ball Arena in Denver Thursday night in Game 2 of their second-round Stanley Cup Playoff series.
After being outshot and outplayed by the Avalanche in Game 1, the Blues came out with a ferocious intensity, playing a physical, smart brand of hockey to defeat the Avalanche, 4-1.
The two superstars have combined for only two points against the Blues through two games (two assists by MacKinnon).
Nathan MacKinnon, Colorado Avalanche (Jess Starr/The Hockey Writers)Mikko Rantanen, Colorado’s leading scorer during the regular season with 92 points, has yet to tally a goal in these playoffs.
After tallying six points against the Predators, Landeskog leads the team with three points over the first two games against the Blues, including Colorado’s lone goal in Game 2.
