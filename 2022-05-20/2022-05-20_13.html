     Colton scores with seconds left, Lightning beat Panthers 2-1 in Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ross Colton scored with 3.8 seconds remaining, giving the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers in Game 2 of their best-of-seven series on Thursday night.
Once I saw the puck behind the net, I just went to the front of the net,” Colton said.
“We’re two games closer to where we want to be, but we’re not there yet,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.
“I told you this in the last series, and I’m going to tell you again: Tonight was just one game.
NOTES: Brunette is a finalist for NHL coach of the year, as is former Panthers coach Gerard Gallant of the New York Rangers and Calgary coach Darryl Sutter -- the brother of former Panthers coach Duane Sutter.

     After nightmare ending to Game 2, Panthers go to Tampa with ‘belief’ they can save season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It left Florida rattled in the moment and Tampa Bay jubilant.
The Panthers knew the margin for error was going to be slim, and they leave South Florida for Tampa feeling like they let two winnable games slip away.
We have a belief that we can do it and the other part of it is I really liked our game,” Brunette said.
Florida is slated to practice Saturday at the Florida Panthers IceDen in Coral Springs before traveling across the state for two road games.
Anton Lundell, meanwhile, is not dealing with an injury, even though he played only 4:07 in Game 2.

     Florida Panthers dig deep hole down 2-0 heading to Tampa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — History is repeating itself for the Florida Panthers.
Florida finished the regular season with the most goals since 1995-96 (337) and boasted the fifth-best power play in the league at a 24.4 percent clip.
Much of it has to do with their power play making the same mistakes, going 0-4 on the night, but other factors contributed to it as well.
This Florida team has gotten a lot of its offense off of second chance opportunities and this Lightning team is not one to give up many of those chances.
It’s shots like that one that could potentially help the Panthers get out of this 2-0 hole — and maybe finally help them score a power play goal.

     Panthers, down 2-0 to Tampa Bay, cling to the belief they can still win playoff series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tampa Bay Lightning’s Ross Colton celebrates his game winning goal against the Florida Panthers during the third period of their Round 2 playoff game, Thursday, May 19, 2022.
AdvertisementThe Panthers are down 2-0 in the best-of-seven second-round playoff series against Tampa Bay after Thursday’s disheartening 2-1 loss in Game 2 — during which the Lightning scored the game-winner with just 3.8 seconds left.
On top of that, they’re going to Tampa Bay, home of the two-time defending champions, for back-to-back games Sunday and Monday.
AdvertisementBut Panthers interim coach Andrew Brunette has two reasons for believing his team can claw its way back into this series.
On top of that, Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy has been a wall with 68 saves in the series.
