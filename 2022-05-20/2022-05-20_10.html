     Summary: A 4-month-old panther was found wandering alone, and Florida wildlife officials made several attempts – including using towels with the kitten's scent – to find its mother.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, they searched for signs of the mother but couldn't find her.
Biologists were nearby, ready to open the cage of the female panther showed up – but she didn't.
That night, the female panther approached the kitten's cage "and immediately showed maternal behavior toward the kitten," according to FWC officials.

“But on the third night, the mother found her baby.”The adult female heard the kitten meowing, and the pair were reunited, the FWC said.
“Telemetry data indicates the kitten is alive and well and trail camera footage captured the pair together,” the FWC wrote on Facebook.

     VIDEO: Florida panther kitten reunites with mama panther
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A Florida panther was reunited with her kitten after conservation workers found the baby panther alone, according to the Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.
The FWRI said the kitten was found alone in March, so biologists used towels covered with the kitten’s scent to attract the mother panther to some trails.
Biologists also put the kitten in a cage outdoors so the mother would arrive and recognize her offspring.
It took three tries before a female panther arrived.
The FWRI said on May 20 that the mother and kitten were spotted together a month later on trail camera video.

     Summary: Ross Colton scored with 3.8 seconds remaining, giving the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers in Game 2 of their best-of-seven series on Thursday night.
Once I saw the puck behind the net, I just went to the front of the net,” Colton said.
“We’re two games closer to where we want to be, but we’re not there yet,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.
“I told you this in the last series, and I’m going to tell you again: Tonight was just one game.
NOTES: Brunette is a finalist for NHL coach of the year, as is former Panthers coach Gerard Gallant of the New York Rangers and Calgary coach Darryl Sutter -- the brother of former Panthers coach Duane Sutter.

The Panthers knew the margin for error was going to be slim, and they leave South Florida for Tampa feeling like they let two winnable games slip away.
We have a belief that we can do it and the other part of it is I really liked our game,” Brunette said.
Florida is slated to practice Saturday at the Florida Panthers IceDen in Coral Springs before traveling across the state for two road games.
Anton Lundell, meanwhile, is not dealing with an injury, even though he played only 4:07 in Game 2.

On top of that, they’re going to Tampa Bay, home of the two-time defending champions, for back-to-back games Sunday and Monday.

On top of that, Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy has been a wall with 68 saves in the series.

     Florida Panthers dig deep hole down 2-0 heading to Tampa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — History is repeating itself for the Florida Panthers.
Florida finished the regular season with the most goals since 1995-96 (337) and boasted the fifth-best power play in the league at a 24.4 percent clip.
Much of it has to do with their power play making the same mistakes, going 0-4 on the night, but other factors contributed to it as well.
This Florida team has gotten a lot of its offense off of second chance opportunities and this Lightning team is not one to give up many of those chances.
It’s shots like that one that could potentially help the Panthers get out of this 2-0 hole — and maybe finally help them score a power play goal.

Looking for immediate energy, the Panthers started the game with their fourth line, which had several big checks on the opening shift.
The Lightning dictated play through the end of the period, but the Panthers regrouped during the intermission.
So the game remained tied at one as the Panthers went on that late power play.
