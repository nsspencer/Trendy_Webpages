Oleson, who oversaw Daredevil Season 3, responded to the news by tweeting "Thrilled to learn that #Daredevil lives on!
These appearances marked both actors' proper introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the canonical status of the original Daredevil series remains in doubt.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige added further weight to rumors that a new Daredevil series was in the works during a 2021 interview.
Despite Feige's phrasing, it's worth noting that both Marvel Studios and Disney+ have yet to officially confirm the series is happening.
