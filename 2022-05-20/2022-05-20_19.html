     A 'bear market' looms. What exactly does that mean?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 Index fell into a so-called bear market on Friday.
"Bear market" is a term used by investors to describe a steep and sustained market downturn.
Investors commonly apply the phrase to a broad stock index like the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it also works for individual stocks.
There isn't anything particularly special about the 20% demarcation line used to define a bear market.
"It's a shortcut in language around the financial markets that people use," said Charlie Fitzgerald III, an Orlando, Florida-based certified financial planner, of bear markets.

     S&amp;P 500 briefly falls into bear market territory as recession fears mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The S&amp;P 500 briefly fell into bear market territory Friday, slipping more than 20% from its record high and potentially ending the bull run that began in March 2020.
A reversal late in the day pushed the index higher at the market's close and saved it from reaching an official bear market designation.
The S&amp;P 500 managed to squeak 0.01% higher at Friday's closing bell, or about 18% down from its January 3 record high, after falling by as much as 2.3% earlier in the day.
The move comes on the heels of seven straight weekly losses for the index and follows months of precipitous market drops.
The S&amp;P 500 has long been considered the most accurate measure of the nation's stock performance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks entered a bear market.
One of the broadest stock market indexes, the S&amp;P 500, entered a bear market during Friday's trading.
A bear market is considered an important barometer of investor pessimism and is symbolic of a deep and sustained market selloff.
The S&amp;P 500 didn't remain in bear market territory for too long and recovered to end the day barely changed.
Among Friday's biggest stock market losers was the Deere, which is one of the largest tractor makers in the world.

     Stocks claw back from edge of first bear market since 2020
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street rumbled to the edge of a bear market Friday after another drop for stocks briefly sent the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index more than 20% below its peak set early this year.
“Whether or not the S&amp;P 500 closes in a bear market does not matter too much,” said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.
It’s a sharp turnaround from the powerful run Wall Street enjoyed after emerging from its last bear market in early 2020, at the start of the pandemic.
Although its source is different, the gloom on Wall Street is mirroring a sense of exasperation across the country.
They even got GameStop to surge suddenly to such a high level that it sent shudders through professionals on Wall Street.

What’s Driving The Bear Market?
What To ExpectFirst off, a bear market is primarily a historical observation.
Holding a mix of assets and countries can help make sure that you aren’t exposed to the worst losses in a bear market.
So while the bear market lasts, we may expect some volatility with value-oriented stocks and fixed income likely outperforming.

     S&amp;P 500 Closes Just Above Bear Market Threshold: Live Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen for seven consecutive weeks, its worst stretch since the dot-com bubble burst more than two decades ago.
Friday afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crossed the bear market threshold of a 20 percent decline from its peak on Jan. 3.
Less than six months later, the S&amp;P 500 began hitting new highs again, climbing 42 percent above its prepandemic level before starting to slide in January.
“There is a lot of uncertainty moving forward,” Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday.
Wall Street had been expecting that torrid consumer demand would have to slow at some point.
