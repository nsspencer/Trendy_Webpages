     Colorado weather: Where, when and how much snow to expect with the late-season winter storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This storm is the perfect recipe of weather conditions to deliver the Front Range enough snow to beat the 3.9 inches of snow we got in May of 2019.
The late May sun angle will hinder snow totals initially, so the heaviest snow may fall after the sun goes down Friday night.
The Foothills from Estes Park to Conifer can expect 12 to 24 inches of snow by Saturday afternoon.
Rocky Mountain National Park and some of the highest elevations will see up to 30 inches of snow.
Colorado Springs, and the Denver metro should brace for 4 to 8 inches of snow.

     Weather whiplash: Denver expected to go from 90 degrees to snow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) — In less than 24 hours, Denver could go from having 90-degree weather to a potentially historic and dangerous snowstorm.
Friday afternoon through Saturday morning “travel may become very difficult to impossible due to heavy snowfall on roadways,” NWS Boulder said.
The forecast is for Denver to receive 4 to 8 inches of snow Friday and Saturday.
“Heavy snow will accumulate on tree branches and powerlines, possibly causing them to break and lead to power outages,” NWS Boulder said in its winter storm warning.
Avalanches could also be a concern, as new snow falls on partially melted snow from the recent warm weather in the Colorado mountains.
