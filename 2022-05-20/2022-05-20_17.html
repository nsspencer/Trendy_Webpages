    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the release of Hayley Kiyoko's Bachelorette-themed music video, “For the Girls,” the pop star confirmed she's no longer accepting roses.
In the music video, which dropped on May 20, Kiyoko stars as the reality series' first lesbian Bachelorette as she welcomes a group of hopefuls to the mansion.
However, the night takes a dramatic turn during the rose ceremony when IRL Bachelor alum Becca Tilley arrives and shares a sultry look with Kiyoko.
Tilley further confirmed the news on Instagram, where she shared a video reel of multiple moments from her four-year-long relationship with the “Girls Like Girls” singer.
“Hard to say if this is a hard or soft launch, but it's a launch,” she wrote in the caption.
