     Summary: Doncic had lunch at Underdogs Cantina just after noon on Friday, SFGATE confirmed.
Underdogs is part of a group of popular Mexican restaurants and sports bars in San Francisco.
An Underdogs employee said that Doncic's party had Baja fish tacos and an Impossible burrito, although they were unsure what Doncic personally ate.
Our tipster did say that unlike Doncic's visit to Sens the day before Game 1, he only ordered water, no beers.
However Doncic was feeling on Friday morning, it was well enough to leave the team hotel to grab some Mexican grub a few hours before Game 2.

     Draymond Green Draws Bold Comparison for Luka Doncic After Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors are currently facing the Mavericks in the Western Conference finals, and Golden State forward Draymond Green said playing against Luka Dončić is like facing LeBron James.
“It feels a lot like playing against LeBron, playing against Luka every possession,” Green said on his podcast, The Draymond Green Show.
Green drew various comparisons following his team’s Game 1 win over Dallas between the 23-year-old Slovenian and 37-year-old.
“One of the main, glaring similarities that stick out at you is how those two guys can manipulate a defense, how those two guys can control the pace of a game,” Green said.
“Where I think they differ is, LeBron will take more transition opportunities, where Luka kind of doesn’t, unless it’s just a complete run-out,” Green said.

     Sleepless Luka Dončić reportedly vomited after Game 1 vs. Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to a report from TNT’s Allie LaForce, the Dallas Mavericks’ leading scorer, Luka Dončić, vomited and was unable to sleep “even a second” upon returning to the team hotel in San Francisco following a blowout loss to the Warriors on Wednesday.
Dončić, 23, averaged 28.4 points per game during the regular season and 30.5 points per game in 11 playoff appearances this postseason.
Aside from an apparent illness, LaForce reported that Dončić is also dealing with a right shoulder injury that began bothering him in Game 6 of the conference semifinals against the Suns.
The injury didn’t appear to bother Dončić too much in a 33-point Game 6 effort against Phoenix or during his 35-point performance in a shocking blowout win in Game 7, but Dončić appeared to favor his right shoulder at times during the Game 1 loss to Golden State on Wednesday.
The TNT sideline reporter added that Dončić’s effectiveness on Friday could come down to his “pain tolerance” with both his shoulder and his illness.

     TNT confirms Mavs’ Luka Doncic was sick, throwing up after Game 1 loss vs. Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bottom line: Luka Doncic was not 100% for Game 2 after battling an illness for more than 24 hours and also dealing with a sore right shoulder.
Laforce said Doncic told her he felt better Thursday night but did not get a full eight hours of sleep.
Also of concern, LaForce said, is the shoulder injury he’s been nursing since the second round series with Phoenix.
Doncic is coming off a playoff-low 20 points (on 6-of-18 shooting) in Game 1 to go with seven turnovers.
I don’t know if he was sick or not sick,” Kidd said.
