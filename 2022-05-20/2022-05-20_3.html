     ‘Ugly Sonic’ Is Slinging Merch In The New Chip ‘n Dale Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s right, Ugly Sonic makes an appearance in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, a live-action and computer-animated action-adventure comedy starring John Mulaney and Andy Samberg as the furry duo that’s now available on Disney+.
But none of those cameos has taken people by surprise quite as much as Ugly Sonic.
Ugly Sonic is something of a legend on the internet.
But Ugly Sonic lives on, so be warned: Some minor spoilers for Rescue Rangers are below.
So while you can get them for $40 in the Sonic Origins bundle, pretty soon you won’t be able to buy Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 (&amp; Knuckles), and Sonic CD individually.

     ‘Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers’ Ending Explained: How do the Chipmunk Gumshoes Save the Day in Their Big Return?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So let’s dust off that Indy fedora and strap up those laces as we talk about what happens at the ending of Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers.
The twist for this iteration of these characters is that events of the Rescue Rangers show were, in fact, an actual television show, and the crew went on to pursue other endeavors after its cancellation in the early 90s.
Once the police get involved, Pete and his goons kidnap Chip, and it’s up to Dale to reunite the remaining rangers to stop the former boy who wouldn’t grow up.
Sweet Pete is accidentally turned into his own bootlegged monster, with a Wreck-it Ralph's arm, a villain's cape, Woody's leg and giant cat face, and chases the chipmunks down.
A go-getter and aspiring thinker, Raul hopes to be the best there is at what he does, and what he does is simply okay.

     The Ugly Sonic Scene in ‘’Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers’ Was “Not Easy,” Says Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers on Disney+.
Because, yes, Ugly Sonic shows up in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and it is possible we have given Twitter too much power.
Much like 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers offers a world in which cartoons are every bit as real as humans.
Ugly Sonic (voiced by I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson) proudly calls himself Ugly Sonic, displays the name on his fan-con booth, and signs the name on photos for snickering teenagers.
Without spoiling too much, Ugly Sonic shows up a few more times in Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and in fact becomes a fairly crucial character in the film.

     I Regret to Inform You the Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers Movie Is Pretty Good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Disney+There’s a scene toward the beginning of Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers in which Chip (voiced by John Mulaney) walks down Hollywood Boulevard, glaring down the ads for the latest creatively bankrupt offerings from the industry he left behind for a sensible job in insurance.
Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers has more in common with Who Framed Roger Rabbit than it does the series with which it shares a name — to the point where Roger makes a cameo.
In the film, Chip and Dale are childhood friends who go to Hollywood together to seek out fame and fortune.
The original Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers makes them stars until Dale tries to go solo, their show gets canceled, and an embittered Chip goes off to lead a normie life while Dale gets 3-D surgery and rides out his waning fame signing autographs at fan conventions and holding out for a reboot.
Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers, which was written by Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, is filled with witty bits of business.
