     Colorado weather: Where, when and how much snow to expect with the late-season winter storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This storm is the perfect recipe of weather conditions to deliver the Front Range enough snow to beat the 3.9 inches of snow we got in May of 2019.
The late May sun angle will hinder snow totals initially, so the heaviest snow may fall after the sun goes down Friday night.
The Foothills from Estes Park to Conifer can expect 12 to 24 inches of snow by Saturday afternoon.
Rocky Mountain National Park and some of the highest elevations will see up to 30 inches of snow.
Colorado Springs, and the Denver metro should brace for 4 to 8 inches of snow.
