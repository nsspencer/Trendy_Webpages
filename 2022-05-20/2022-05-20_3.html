     Summary: Ross Colton scored with 3.8 seconds left in a game that looked destined for overtime to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 2-1 victory over a gutted Florida Panthers squad that can’t find answers offensively.
After MacKenzie Weegar turned the puck over with 15 seconds left, the Cats failed to clear twice and paid the ultimate price when Ondrej Palat bounced the puck off the boards to Nikita Kucherov down low.
THAT'S ROSS GOAL-TON TO YOU pic.twitter.com/cH9UyQ0Znq — Tampa Bay Lightning (@TBLightning) May 20, 2022The Panthers had two power play chances in the third, one early, one late, and failed to convert on either.
Tampa Bay opened the scoring with yet another power-play goal 12:06 into the first.
Last-second, fatal mistake aside, the Panthers are matching Tampa Bay’s defensive game 5-on-5, proving that they can play low-scoring playoff hockey.

     Florida Panthers dig deep hole down 2-0 heading to Tampa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — History is repeating itself for the Florida Panthers.
Florida finished the regular season with the most goals since 1995-96 (337) and boasted the fifth-best power play in the league at a 24.4 percent clip.
Much of it has to do with their power play making the same mistakes, going 0-4 on the night, but other factors contributed to it as well.
This Florida team has gotten a lot of its offense off of second chance opportunities and this Lightning team is not one to give up many of those chances.
It’s shots like that one that could potentially help the Panthers get out of this 2-0 hole — and maybe finally help them score a power play goal.

     Summary: Ross Colton scored with 3.8 seconds remaining, giving the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers in Game 2 of their best-of-seven series on Thursday night.
Once I saw the puck behind the net, I just went to the front of the net,” Colton said.
“We’re two games closer to where we want to be, but we’re not there yet,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.
“I told you this in the last series, and I’m going to tell you again: Tonight was just one game.
