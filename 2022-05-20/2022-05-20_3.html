     ’Daredevil’ Will Get a New Disney+ Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix was the original home of the Marvel series about Charlie Cox’s crusading blind lawyer, along with several other gritty TV series involving other street-level New York City heroes who collectively became The Defenders.
After Disney started their own streaming service, Disney+, and after Marvel restructured their TV production so all of it was produced by the same creative team that made their movies, the Netflix series all came to an end.
But a few months ago, the old episodes of those Netflix series — Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and The Punisher — migrated over to Disney+.
The other big question about the new Daredevil is how adult the series will be allowed to be.
While we wait for an answer, the Netflix episodes of Daredevil — and the other Marvel Netflix series — are already available to stream on Disney+.

     Daredevil Disney+ Series Will be Both a Continuation &amp; Something New
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the exciting news that Marvel Studios are developing a Daredevil series for Disney+, further details have claimed that the show will be a continuation of where the character left off on Netflix.
As well as being some “new.” coming courtesy of a report in The Hollywood Reporter, the Disney+ Daredevil comeback will be "the first of the Netflix Marvel shows to get a new but continued series."
Daredevil proved to be one of the more popular Marvel Netflix shows, receiving critical acclaim and a hugely positive response from audiences.
Due to this, the effort to bring certain characters over into the MCU proper has already begun, with Daredevil archenemy The Kingpin, played once again by Vincent D'Onofrio, featuring in the Disney+ series, Hawkeye.
And maybe there’s a little less blood, maybe there’s a little whatever, but I back them to do it.”How do you feel about the Daredevil Disney+ return being both a continuation and something new?

     Original Daredevil Showrunners Address Series' Disney+ Revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Original Daredevil showrunners Erik Oleson and Steven S. DeKnight addressed reports that the former Netflix series' is getting a Disney+ revival.
Oleson, who oversaw Daredevil Season 3, responded to the news by tweeting "Thrilled to learn that #Daredevil lives on!
These appearances marked both actors' proper introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the canonical status of the original Daredevil series remains in doubt.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige added further weight to rumors that a new Daredevil series was in the works during a 2021 interview.
Despite Feige's phrasing, it's worth noting that both Marvel Studios and Disney+ have yet to officially confirm the series is happening.

     Summary: Daredevil season 1 showrunner Steven DeKnight reveals whether he would return to the Marvel series, following news of its Disney+ revival.
Following news of the series' initial development breaking, Daredevil's original showrunner has revealed whether he would return for the revived series.
One fan reached out to DeKnight through his personal Twitter account, asking whether he would return for the Disney+ revival series in any capacity.
As such, it is understandable to see why there'd be interest in seeing the original creatives return for the series revival.
While DeKnight is uninvolved with the upcoming Daredevil show, the original showrunner's faith in the new creative team is encouraging.

     'Daredevil' Disney Plus Series Is A Continuation Of The Netflix Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A brand-new Daredevil series is in the works at Disney Plus, and it sounds like it'll pick up where the Netflix series left off.
While technically part of the MCU, the "street-level" Netflix Marvel shows never really properly referenced the events of the movies.
With the characters fully integrated into the MCU (and the Netflix shows now moved over to Disney Plus), fans hoped it would only be a matter of time until a new Daredevil series was announced.
Disney has yet to officially confirm the news, and it sounds like the project is still in early development, but this undeniably hugely exciting for fans of the Netflix series.
I can't imagine a Disney Plus incarnation of Daredevil will be anything like as gritty as the Netflix series was, of course, but more Charlie Cox as The Man Without Fear is absolutely a Very Good Thing Indeed.
