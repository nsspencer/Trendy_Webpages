The departures represent one of the biggest cast shake-ups in years on a show that has seen unusual steadiness in recent seasons.
McKinnon opened the show with an out-of-this-world skit, and said her final goodbyes on "Earth."

     'SNL' says goodbye to Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) "Saturday Night Live" closed out its 47th season by saying goodbye to two of its most beloved cast members.
On Saturday night's episode, the NBC variety show bid adieu to Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson in subtle, but emotional ways.
The show first said goodbye to McKinnon by opening the show with a recreation of one of the comedian's most memorable sketches, "Close Encounter."
Saturday's cold open brought back McKinnon's Miss Rafferty -- an alien abductee who goes through a rougher experience than her counterparts.
This led to a very poignant moment for McKinnon who stood on the makeshift spaceship and allowed her character and herself to say goodbye.
