     Lakers' Austin Reaves: Finishes strong with 31-16-10
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reaves amassed 31 points (7-17 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 14-14 FT), 16 rebounds, 10 assists, one block and two steals across 42 minutes during Sunday's 146-141 overtime victory over the Nuggets.
Reaves saved the best game of his NBA career for last, as he took advantage of an increased workload (42 minutes) and the Lakers resting several regulars to post his first triple-double and set new career highs in points, rebounds, assists and free throws (14-14 FT).
While the Lakers' season will go down as an unmitigated disaster, the emergence of Reaves -- an undrafted rookie out of Oklahoma -- was one of the few bright spots.
While he may not have the highest long-term ceiling, Reaves has the makings of a rock-solid role player who will have a good chance to stick around in the league for many years.
