    </h2>

     Summary: Russell Westbrook is headed to the Pacers?
When considering the possibility of a Russell Westbrook trade to any team, there needs to be more taken into account than the players involved due to Westbrook’s loaded contract.
Magic Johnson also said Los Angeles should have pursued Buddy Hield instead of Russell Westbrook.
So it is possible that Los Angeles could be motivated to make a deal with the Pacers specifically.
For now, the Pacers are the favorites to land Russell Westbrook.

Excuse fans who watched James push Lakers brass to trade for Westbrook last offseason for deciding to believe that when they see it.

     Russell Westbrook’s brutally honest response to notion that LeBron James and Anthony Davis tried to support him during Lakers struggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook was brutally honest when discussing the support he received from LeBron James and Anthony Davis during the 2021-22 season.
When @DanWoikeSports mentions that LeBron and AD said many times throughout the year, "Let Russ be Russ," Russell Westbrook immediately responds: "Yeah, but that wasn't true.
During the 2021-22 season, Westbrook averaged 18.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game this season while shooting 44.4 percent from the field and 29.8 percent from beyond the arc.
While James and Davis may have been vocal in their support for Westbrook, the former MVP clearly feels like things didn’t exactly go in his favor in Los Angeles.
Westbrook’s poor shooting and lack of consistency from the rest of the Lakers’ roster led to the team struggling to find a lineup that worked throughout the entire 2021-22 season.
