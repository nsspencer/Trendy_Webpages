    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Halle Berry doesn’t have to do much to get people talking, and her latest social media post is proof of just that.
Over the weekend, the actress took to Instagram to post her latest photoshoot, posing on the beach in a bikini along with some interesting accessories.
While her swimsuit seems to be a basic black two-peice, on top, Berry is wearing a sheer black trenchcoat along with some black lace fingerless gloves.
In her caption, the actress wrote, “Nisi all grown up #BAPSvibes,” referencing her role on the 1997 show B.A.P.S.
“I would absolutely return to it, it’s a beloved character, I loved playing Storm, and people love Storm,” Berry told Vanity Fair last December.
