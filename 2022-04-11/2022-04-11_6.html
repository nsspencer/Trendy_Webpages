I feel like as a defender on the perimeter, you just get disrespected.
I’m not even talking about me personally, but I don’t understand how guards in general don’t win it.
These guards are shooting off ball screens, they get isos with the offense spaced out and a lot of shooters on the court.
You’ve got to guard these matchups one-on-one, and I think we just get taken for granted.” -via Yahoo!

     Summary: Welcome to Day 1 of doom-scrolling for updates about Luka Doncic’s potentially playoff-compromising left calf strain.
He didn’t return to the bench, and the Mavericks didn’t provide an update while he received treatment after the game.
Souryal said treatment for muscle strains can include hyperbaric, compression and muscle stimulation approaches — multiple modalities in play at the same time.
The team’s medical staff has a track record of helping players return from muscle strains quicker than the NBA average.
Stotts said the average time lost for calf strains in the league this season was 16 days — not specific to grade or location.
