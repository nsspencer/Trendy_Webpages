     The Winners and Losers of the 2022 WNBA Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Wevers/USA TODAY SportsThe 2022 WNBA draft is in the books.
In a draft that featured a ton of talent at various positions, here are the winners and losers of Monday’s draft.
Indiana, who went with a surprise selection in the 2021 WNBA draft in selecting West Virginia’s Kysre Gondrezick, also started the shakeup of mock drafts in 2022 when it selected Stanford’s Lexie Hull on Monday night.
Bell’s selection to Las Vegas, while later than expected, gave Florida Gulf Coast its highest draft selection in school history.

     2022 WNBA Draft: Complete results, grades as Rhyne Howard goes No. 1 to Atlanta Dream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 WNBA Draft is in the books, and as expected the Atlanta Dream got the night started by selecting Rhyne Howard out of Kentucky with the No.
Now that the action is all wrapped up, here are the full results along with breakdowns and grades for every first-round pick.
Atlanta Dream: Rhyne Howard, G, KentuckyAs expected, the Dream select Rhyne Howard with the No.
1 overall pick to the Dream in large part because they believed this was a three-player draft, not a one-or-two player draft.
No one was projecting her as a first-round pick, though, and it does feel like she would have been around later.
