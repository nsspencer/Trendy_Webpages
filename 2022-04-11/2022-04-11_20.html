     Portland, Ore., wakes up to rare April snowfall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Judson Jones and Rachel Ramirez | CNNThe residents of Portland, Oregon, woke up to a rare April sight on Monday: a blanket of fresh, white snow.
Just last week, Portland had sunny, 70-degree weather.
Last April was the driest on record for the city, followed by an unprecedented, multi-day heat wave in June.
That heat wave, scientists later concluded, was “virtually impossible” without climate change.
Hundreds of heat-related hospitalizations and deaths were reported during that heat wave, leading officials to call it a mass-casualty event.

     Summary: Portland, ORE. (KOIN) – It took more than 80 years of compiling numbers, but only a few hours to set a new record.
According to the National Weather Service, Portland got enough snow in the early Monday morning hours to surpass the most that the area has seen on a single day in April since they started tracking weather in the area in 1940.
The announcement of the new record came out in a Tweet monday morning:“In 82 years of record keeping, #PDX had never recorded more than a trace of snow in April.
Looking out the window, it appears there will be more than 0.1 inch when all is said and done.” @NWSPortlandThe rare April winter weather left several inches of heavy, wet snow in a lot of places.
The KOIN 6 Weather team says the snow is expected to taper off and turn to rain by mid-morning and will likely be mostly melted by mid-afternoon.
