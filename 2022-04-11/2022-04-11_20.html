     Teachers are 'inclined' to 'pedophilia,' playwright David Mamet claims on Fox News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet is under fire after bizarrely claiming on Fox News that teachers are "inclined" to "pedophilia."
"If there's no community control of the schools, what we have is kids being not only indoctrinated, but groomed in a very real sense by people who are, whether they know it or not, sexual predators," Mamet claimed.
Mamet then claimed, "This has always been the problem with education, is that teachers are inclined, particularly men because men are predators, to pedophilia."
Host Mark Levin did not question Mamet's claim that teachers are "inclined" to pedophilia and agreed with him that "the culture" is "quite sick."
Writer Mark Harris also tweeted, "At a time of increasing threats to gay people, David Mamet has chosen to ally himself with the purveyors of a vicious, ugly slander that will endanger teachers and LGBT Americans.

'”Like the conservative movement, Mamet intellectually peaked four decades ago, but implying that over three million US teachers are disposed towards child abuse is shockingly low even by his own recent standards.
In his new book Recessional, he claimed that Democrats, and not Republicans, had attempted a coup during the 2020 election.
Meanwhile, The Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro has been suggesting that anyone horrified by Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill must be a pedophile, while investing $100 million into conservative children’s programming from Daily Wire Kids.

     Playwright David Mamet claims on Fox News that teachers 'are inclined' toward pedophilia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet dove headfirst into the classroom culture wars by claiming that teachers "are inclined" toward pedophilia and that students are being "groomed" for sexual abuse — while offering no evidence to back up his charges.
"This demonization of teachers is dangerous for our educators and for their students, and it must stop," Weingarten said in a statement.
"Schools, however, are not particularly high risk environments for sexual abuse by adults," Finkelhor wrote in an email.
Also, Finkelhor added, "providing sexuality education in school based on professionally designed curricula is not a typical 'grooming' scenario."
"Sexuality education in schools that includes information about appropriate and inappropriate behaviors is crucial for preventing sexual abuse because many families don’t do a good job of this."

     David Mamet says teachers are "inclined to pedophilia," perpetuating right-wing grooming rhetoric
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "This has always been the problem with education, is that teachers are inclined, particularly men because men are predators, to pedophilia," Mamet added.
This claim quickly made rounds on social media after Madeline Peltz of Media Matters for America shared a snippet of the segment on Twitter.
RELATED: The goal of the GOP's QAnon-influenced "groomer" troll: More political violenceIncidentally, Mamet's play "Oleanna" features a college professor who's denied tenure when a female student accuses him of sexual harassment.
The article revisits the playwright's 2008 essay, titled "Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal," for the Village Voice.
"Woke signaling, blind compliance with public-health authoritarianism, deference to theater critics and tyrannical city officials — Mr. Mamet doesn't play along," the WSJ article concludes.

     David Mamet Comes Out as Right-Wing Culture Warrior, Claims Teachers Are Inclined to Pedophilia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Said law prohibits the discussion of sexual orientation and gender in certain grade levels of the state’s public schools.
What we have is kids not only being indoctrinated but groomed, in a very real sense, by people who are, whether they know it or not, sexual predators.
“If you’re against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer, or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of 4-8-year old children,” she tweeted.
The fringe theory has slowly infected mainstream political discourse and now, apparently, the mind of the guy who wrote Glengarry Glen Ross.
Mamet also, it might be worth mentioning in light of his recent comments, wrote a screenplay for Lolita.

     Summary: With the high-profile, starry revival of his American Buffalo opening Thursday on Broadway, playwright David Mamet seems to be doing his best — or worst — to make headlines.
Speaking on the hot-button topic of community and parental control in schools, Mamet said: “We have to take back control.
This has always been the problem with education, is that teachers are inclined, particularly men because men are predators, to pedophilia.
Deadline has reached to a spokesperson for the American Buffalo revival for comment.
