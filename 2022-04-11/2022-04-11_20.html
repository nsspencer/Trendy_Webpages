     Here's What Klay Thompson Said After Doing Something For The First Time in 3 Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson and the Golden State Warriors wrapped up their regular season by crushing the Pelicans in New Orleans by a score of 128-107.
Thompson erupted for 41 points, which is the first time he has scored 40 or more points since 2019.
After the game, the three-time NBA Champion spoke to reporters.
The Warriors finished their season as the third seed in the Western Conference with a 53-29 record in the 82 games that they played.
Thompson had missed each of the last two seasons due to injuries, but returned to the lineup earlier this year.

     Warriors’ Klay Thompson In ‘Great Groove’ Heading Into Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Pelicans rallying, Thompson had scored 11 straight points to all but seal the win.
“The proof is on the court just what he’s looked like over the last couple weeks,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr.
“He’s been in a great groove now, so it’s a really good sign.”Thompson’s recent play is among main reasons the Warriors are heading into the playoffs on a five-game winning streak.
With fellow “Splash Brother” Stephen Curry sidelined by a foot injury, Thompson has scored 30 or more in three straight games.
“I pat myself on the back because when you go through the injuries I did, there’s some really slow days,” Thompson said.

     Why Warriors' Klay Thompson isn't worried about Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Golden State Warriors’ final game of the regular season, Klay Thompson, fresh off of a 41-point outing, was asked about his team’s opponent in the first round of this season’s playoffs: the Denver Nuggets.
Ernie Johnson of “Inside the NBA” pointed out that the Warriors had beaten the Nuggets just once in four tries this season.
When asked what stock the Golden State guard put into that fact, Thompson seemed to brush it off.
There’s a lot of truth to what Thompson said, especially in the second part of his response.
During the four games against the Nuggets this season, the Warriors were far from “whole” as at least one member of Golden State’s core three stars (Thompson, Steph Curry and Draymond Green) was missing, with Green missing every one of those contests.
