     American Idol: Kenedi Anderson Drops Out Of Season 20 — Full Statement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: American Idol viewers weren’t expecting any eliminations on Monday, but they got one anyway.
Following 17-year-old Kenedi Anderson‘s stunning Top 24 performance of Christina Perri’s “Human,” host Ryan Seacrest interrupted the broadcast with an important message about Anderson’s future in the competition, or lack thereof.
“You might have noticed that there was no voting information during Kenedi’s performance just now,” Seacrest said a studio.
“Since we taped these shows in Hawaii earlier, Kenedi has decided to withdraw from our show for personal reasons.
Of course, Anderson isn’t the first Idol hopeful to leave the competition early.
