     Amid rise of gun violence, Biden unveils 'basic common sense' regulations targeting ghost guns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden’s decision to take aim at ghost guns comes amid growing concern about the rise of gun violence and increasing pressure from Democrats in Congress to crack down on gun deaths and violent crime.
In addition to the new regulations, Biden called on Congress to ban the sale and possession of ghost guns.
Last year, about 20,000 ghost guns were recovered in criminal investigations, a tenfold increase from 2016, the Justice Department said.
Tretta called the new rules "lifesaving" and noted that the weapon used to shoot her and kill two students was a ghost gun.

     Biden vows to crack down on ghost guns – ‘weapons of choice for many criminals’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Biden has announced a crackdown on “ghost guns”, untraceable firearms assembled from kits that have been used in a rising number of shooting crimes.
“These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,” Biden said during an event in the White House Rose Garden.
In 2019, a 16-year-old killed two students and injured three others before killing himself with a ghost gun at a school in Santa Clarita.
The National Rifle Association criticised the effort to regulate ghost guns and urged its members to oppose Dettelbach.
Jessica Anderson, executive director of the conservative organisation Heritage Action, added: “Biden attacking so-called ‘ghost guns’ will only make our communities worse off.

     Biden aims at 'ghost gun' violence with new federal rule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Law enforcement is sounding the alarm," Biden said of ghost guns, briefly holding one up for cameras to see in the Rose Garden.
Jones was acting director when President Barack Obama nominated him in January 2013.The Biden administration's plan on guns was first reported by Politico.For nearly a year, the ghost gun rule has been making its way through the federal regulation process.
The group believes the rule violates the U.S. Constitution and several federal laws.But gun safety advocacy groups, like Everytown for Gun Safety, which pushed the federal government for years to take action on ghost guns, applauded Biden's moves and insisted that both Dettlebach's appointment and the finalized rule will help combat gun violence.
"Justice Department statistics show that nearly 24,000 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes and reported to the government from 2016 to 2020.
Police in Philadelphia have seen nearly a 500% increase in the number of ghost guns recovered in the past two years, Shapiro said.
