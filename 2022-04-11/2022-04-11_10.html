     Nets’ Seth Curry reveals status for play-in game vs. Cavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given the superstar talent on their roster, such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn is the kind of team that few in the East want to see emerge victorious in their play-in game.
Ahead of Tuesday’s crucial contest against the Cleveland Cavs, Nets sharpshooter Seth Curry, who has been dealing with a nagging ankle injury, revealed his status for the play-in game, as reported by Nick Friedell of ESPN.
— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) April 11, 2022Per Friedell, Curry said that he is playing in the contest against the Cavs.
The three-point marksman was held out of the team’s regular season finale, though Nets head coach Steve Nash said that he would be listed as probable for the play-in game.
However, Curry’s presence should be a big boost to the Nets as they attempt to secure a victory in the play-in game.

     Summary: Tyler Fulghum breaks down why he doesn't trust the Nets to cover the spread at home against the Cavaliers in Tuesday's play-in game.
(0:48)Can the Nets cover the spread at home vs. Cavs in play-in game?
The play-in tournament is something new for them, and the Brooklyn Nets certainly didn't expect to experience it this year.
The Cleveland Cavaliers weren't sure they would, either, after losing 50 games last season.
Both finished 44-38, with the Nets taking seventh place by going 3-1 against the Cavaliers.
