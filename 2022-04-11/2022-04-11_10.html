     No timetable for Luka Doncic’s return after MRI confirms left calf strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luka Dončić’s status for the Mavericks’ playoff opener on Saturday is up in the air after an MRI confirmed Monday he is dealing with a left calf strain, according to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon.
There is reportedly no timetable set for Dončić’s return.
MacMahon also noted that Dallas is not ready to make a final call on the star guard’s availability for Game 1 against the Jazz.
Dallas is 8–9 with Dončić out of the lineup, going 4–3 at home and a 4–6 on the road.
Dallas has been eliminated in the first round six times since winning the NBA championship in 2011.

     No timetable on return of Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic as MRI confirms left calf strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- An MRI on Monday confirmed that Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic suffered a left calf strain in the team's regular-season finale, a source told ESPN.
After a brief discussion with Mavs director of player health and performance Casey Smith, Doncic hobbled to the locker room.
Doncic did not speak to the media Sunday night because he was receiving postgame treatment.
"For some reason, I feel like he'll be ready to go," Mavs guard Jalen Brunson said after Sunday's game.
Doncic, a first-team All-NBA selection the past two seasons, averaged 28.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game this season.

     Key reason Kings chose Marvin Bagley III over Luka Doncic, Trae Young revealed by former employee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvin Bagley III had a strong finish to the season after being shipped by the Sacramento Kings to the Detroit Pistons at the trade deadline.
While Bagley remains a solid player with versatility and athleticism, his largely empty stint with the Kings is hard to ignore.
Most especially when he was selected ahead of Luka Doncic and Trae Young in the 2018 NBA Draft.
Having another guard in Doncic or Young, who were selected back-to-back after Bagley, alongside Fox wasn’t optimal.
Bagley badly needed a change of scenery, and the Kings had to swallow another wrong decision.

     Luka Doncic injury update: Mavericks star diagnosed with calf strain; no timetable for return, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks star point guard Luka Doncic has been diagnosed with a left calf strain after undergoing an MRI on Monday afternoon, per ESPN's Tim MacMahon.
Doncic's status for Game 1 of the Mavericks' first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz on Saturday is still unknown as Dallas hasn't set a timetable for his return.
Doncic sustained the injury in Dallas' regular-season finale against the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday.
If Doncic isn't 100 percent healthy, not only will it hinder Dallas in the series, but there is always the chance of worsening the current injury.
If Doncic is ruled out for Game 1, Dallas will turn to Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson to try and fill the All-NBA guard's shoes.

     Summary: The MRI on Luka Doncic confirmed a left calf strain.
However, the Dallas Mavericks’ refusal to reveal the severity of the injury is a concerning sight for Mavs fans.
https://t.co/iqYXmbJK0I — Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) April 11, 2022Luka Doncic sustained his calf injury late in the third quarter of Sunday’s contest against the San Antonio Spurs.
The Mavs diagnosed him with a calf strain and he was eventually ruled out for the remainder of their final regular season game.
It could very well be because a calf strain usually requires at least one week of healing.

     Luka Doncic Suffers Calf Strain In Mavs’ Regular Season Finale

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APRIL 11: An MRI confirmed Doncic’s calf strain, Tim MacMahon of ESPN tweets.
APRIL 10: Star guard Luka Doncic left the Mavericks‘ regular season finale vs. San Antonio on Sunday in the third quarter due to what the team is calling a left calf strain (Twitter link).
As Jeff Stotts of In Street Clothes observes (via Twitter), calf strains can result in a wide range of recovery timelines depending on the severity and the location.
However, the NBA rescinded that technical on Saturday, allowing Doncic to suit up on Sunday.
If Doncic has to miss any playoff games, the Mavs would lean more heavily on point guards Jalen Brunson and Spencer Dinwiddie for scoring and play-making.

     Mavs played 17 games this season without Luka Doncic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At various times this season when Doncic missed 17 games on seven separate occasions, the rallying cry from his teammates was that they eventually learned how to play without the team’s superstar point guard.
Overall this season, the Mavs are 8-9 when Doncic was sidelined, including owning a 4-3 record at home and a 4-6 record on the road.
Ideally, the Mavs would rather have Doncic in the starting lineup and on the floor for the upcoming playoff series against the Jazz.
The nice thing is we have won home court (advantage), so we don’t have to travel.”Here’s the rundown of games Doncic missed this season and why he sat out those games.
For the season, Doncic finished third in the NBA in scoring (28.4), fifth in assists (8.7) and 19th in rebounds (9.1). . .The Mavs’ 52-30 regular season record ties the 2003-’04 squad for the eighth-best won-loss record in franchise history.
