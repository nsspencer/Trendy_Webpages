     Orioles 2, Brewers 0: Different ballpark, same result for Milwaukee's punchless offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE – The Milwaukee Brewers made their first appearance at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in nearly 19 years on Monday afternoon.
Perhaps they're still en route from Wrigley Field.
Facing one of the worst pitching staffs in the major leagues the Brewers turned in another punchless performance at the plate in being shut out by the Baltimore Orioles, 2-0.
That ineptitude, combined with shaky starting pitching, has left the Brewers a surprising 1-3 against two non-contenders to start a season in which they're expected to be major power in the National League.
Right-hander Adrian Houser was the latest member of the team's vaunted rotation to struggle, allowing four hits, two runs and three walks with three strikeouts over 3⅔ innings.

     Summary: Beginning in 2019, we devoted our entire company to building through the farm system in the “Oriole Way” of past eras, recently emulated successfully by other MLB clubs.
As a result, we now boast the No.
1 rated player talent pool and scouting and development system in all of Major League Baseball, highlighted by both the top overall MLB prospect in Adley Rutschman and the No.
1 overall MLB pitching prospect in Grayson Rodriguez.
When we began this journey in 2019, we expected our Minor League rebuild to take four to five years, even before accounting for the unpredictable loss of an entire year of Minor League baseball in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Summary: After opening against a team that won 100 games last year, the Orioles now get to try their luck against a team that won 95.
He was 4-5 with a 5.04 ERA last season, and struggled in the spring to the tune of a 7.88 ERA in three starts.
But he was great last spring and the regular season went the way it did, so who knows.
Adrian Houser, the Brewers starter, went 10-6 with a 3.22 ERA a season ago, and had a 3.00 ERA across three starts this spring.

     Summary: FAIR: “There is absolutely no reason why Matt Harvey should be on this team.”Those who struggle with addiction should not simply be ostracized from society.
Matt Harvey is a tremendously flawed human being, but there is no reason to believe he ever intended to contribute to former teammate Tyler Skaggs’ death.
He is an objectively bad baseball player and has been for four years now.
I hope Matt Harvey remains on a positive track in his life.
But signing Matt Harvey in any capacity at this point is embarrassing.
