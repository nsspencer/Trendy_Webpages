    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a marriage that has now lasted a decade, the couple Wynonna Judd and Michael Scott (Cactus) Moser have been on a rollercoaster of a ride.
She met her first husband, Arch Kelly in 1993, after which 3 years later they joined hands in holy matrimony.
In June 2012, Wynonna Judd married Cactus Moser, the Highway 101 drummer, in the presence of only their respective children.
With the idea to keep it simple and significant, Wynonna didn't even invite her mother or sister to the wedding.
It is during that accident when Judd realised what her favourite sound was, it was his breath.
