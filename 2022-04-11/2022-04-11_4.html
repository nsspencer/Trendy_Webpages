    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The entire band was together for one of the few points to that point in the season.
“Concerned and worried, those words, it’s easy to do that,” Durant said, maybe half an hour after the final buzzer that Sunday afternoon.
Even if that game would be in Brooklyn for the Nets, they cannot want any part of that.
The Nets have Durant and Irving, and that’s a hell of a head start.
“Let’s get it on,” Irving said Sunday, after the Nets closed out the season on a modest 12-5 tear by outclassing the Pacers, 134-126.

     Nets news: Kyrie Irving's hilarious immediate reaction to Kevin Durant's career-high 16 assists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 seed was on the line in the Nets’ last game of the season when they hosted the Indiana Pacers on Sunday.
Unlike when the Nets defeated the Cavs and Kevin Durant dropped 36 points last Friday, on Sunday it was a different defense.
Since the Nets love how Kyrie Irving plays off the ball, they’ve had to evolve as a team following the James Harden-Ben Simmons trade.
Kyrie had a pretty funny way to hype up his star running mate:"PG from PG County man, I told him in the locker room just to get a good laugh out of him….
He carried the bulk of the scoring burden and Durant was the “PG from PG County,” or the point guard from Prince Georges County, Maryland.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets were supposed to wrap up their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs long ago.
After finishing 44-38 on the year, the Nets will have to earn their way into the playoffs via the play-in tournament.
Want to bet on the Nets beating Cleveland to make the playoffs behind a strong performance from Kevin Durant??
You can win big with DraftKings if the Nets win and Durant scores at least 30 points.
Durant will not want to mess around with an elimination game in the play-in tournament if the Nets lose.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of all the teams in the Eastern Conference you could have picked for the play-in games, the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers were probably at the bottom of the list.
(7) Brooklyn Nets vs. (8) Cleveland CavaliersWhen: Tuesday, April 12 | 7 p.m.
After the James Harden trade, the Nets scored an incredible 123.6 points per 100 possessions with Durant and Irving on the floor.
This is all to say that in order to beat Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Nets on Tuesday, they're going to have to score ... a lot.
Assuming Durant, Irving, Garland and LeVert all bring their A-game, Mobley could be the swing factor in Tuesday's matchup.

     Nets get healthy at right time: Seth Curry to play vs. Cavs, Goran Dragic cleared

     Summary: It’s the post-season even if only the play-in tournament and the Nets are looking like they’re getting healthy at the same time.
Curry, who’s admitted his ankle needs rest and is officially listed as probable, said he’ll be ready to go.
Curry has missed two of the Nets last four games and three of the last nine.
He said he too would welcome the versatile 25-year-old back but noted the Nets have an issue at hand, the play-in game (or games.)
“We’re worried about the play-in game right now,” Curry said.
