    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney+ has found its lead protagonist for the Percy Jackson And The Olympians series in The Adam Project’s Walker Scobell, reports Variety.
AdvertisementThe series is set to follow 12-year-old Percy Jackson (Scobell), a modern demigod who, after finding out his Greek deity parentage, must go on an adventure to find the sky god Zeus’ master lighting bolt after being accused of stealing the prized possession.
In a post on his website, Percy Jackson And The Olympians author Rick Riordan revealed the casting news and explained how Scobell fit the bill of the snarky hero.
“It was obvious to me and the rest of the team that Walker had the perfect mix of comedic timing, sweetness, rebelliousness, snark and heroism to embody our hero Percy Jackson,” said Riordan.
While other YA fantasy series like Harry Potter have had great movie adaptions, Percy Jackson has, uh, not.
