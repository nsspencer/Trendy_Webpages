     Russell Westbrook: 'I was never given a fair chance' in first season with Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook, in his final media session of the season, said he "was never given a fair chance to be who I needed to be to help this team."
The former NBA MVP was acquired last offseason from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a late first-round pick.
Westbrook averaged 18.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.1 assists on the season but struggled with efficiency in an up-and-down year.
He shot 29.8 percent on 3.4 3-point attempts a game for a Lakers team (33-49) that had NBA title aspirations but failed to make the postseason.
The Lakers are Westbrook's fourth NBA team he's played for, after previous stints with the Wizards, Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder.

     Los Angeles Lakers' Russell Westbrook opens up on disconnect with Frank Vogel, disappointing season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook explains why he felt that he constantly had to prove himself to Frank Vogel and the Lakers after being traded to Los Angeles.
Westbrook, who was the highest-paid player during the Lakers' nightmarish 2021-22 season, wasn't done with his griping with just the coach, either.
"When I first got here, the ability to be able to do what I'm able to do for a team and an organization wasn't given a fair chance," he said.
Westbrook went on to blame false news reports as a contributing factor to his struggles this past season.
Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka did not commit to giving the James-Davis-Westbrook group another chance next season, should Westbrook opt in.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the most intriguing aspects of Westbrook’s interview, however, centered around superstar teammates LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
Report: "LeBron &amp; AD were clear on, 'Let Russ be Russ.'"
pic.twitter.com/2CwYvIjwgx — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) April 11, 2022Westbrook is disputing the notion that LeBron and Davis gave him the leeway to play his game.
This was before LeBron and Davis met with Westbrook to discuss his potential role with the 2020 champions.
It will be interesting to see how LeBron and Davis respond to Westbrook’s comments given how Russ pretty much threw them under the bus here.
