Kwan has broken a Major League record by reaching base 15 times in his first four games.
The biggest argument for his inclusion on the Major League roster as he broke camp?

     MLB today: Rookie Steven Kwan, the former Oregon State Beavers star, a hit in Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland rookie Steven Kwan hit .469 in spring training after compiling a .301 batting average in three minor league seasons.
Kwan had four singles and a double, was hit by a pitch and scored four runs.
The 24-year-old outfielder made his major league debut on opening day and is 8 for 10 in three games, reaching base in 12 of 14 plate appearances.
“I know it’s three games in, but nobody wants to not get excited,” Guardians manager Terry Francona said.
He’ll face righty Alek Manoah (9-2, 3.22), who won his big league debut in the Bronx last May.

     Fantasy baseball: Steven Kwan and 10 others rising or falling in value after opening weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland Guardians rookie OF Steven Kwan certainly starred in his very first weekend in the major leagues, reaching base in a record 12 of his 14 plate appearances against the Kansas City Royals.
Few in the fantasy baseball world seemed to enjoy it, however, as Kwan was barely rostered entering the weekend and even as of Monday morning, remained available in more than 88% of ESPN standard leagues.
We knew the contact-oriented Kwan was an on-base machine in the minor leagues, but what is the statistical upside otherwise?
Remember the most recent rookie to produce a five-hit game the first days of a season?

     Summary: (MLB x @XboxGamePass) pic.twitter.com/AQ4VLcFEPM — MLB (@MLB) April 11, 2022When we’re talking sample sizes after one weekend of play, almost all data come from tiny samples.
Strikeout percentage stands out, obviously, but it shouldn’t be surprising that Kwan has not struck out so far in 14 plate appearances.
In 603 college plate appearances, Kwan logged only 50 strikeouts, or a strikeout in 8.3% of plate appearances.
Likewise, in 947 minor league plate appearances he only struck out 87 times, or in 9.2% of plate appearances.
Kwan does not miss, and the Guardians lineup looks great with him in it.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through the first four days of the 2022 Major League Baseball season, the toughest out in the entire game has been a a 24-year-old rookie outfielder who not too long ago didn't feel like he deserved to be on the same field with his college teammates.
Kwan reached base three times in his major league debut on Opening Day.
On Saturday, he reached base three times again.
Kwan is also the first player since at least 1901 to reach base 12 times in his first three major league games, according to Sarah Langs of mlb.com.
No other player has reached base more than 10 times under those circumstances.

However, it's worth noting that isn't necessarily just because I think Kwan is going to be a must-roster player doesn't mean my expectations of him have changed dramatically.
Which is all to say, I tend to still think Kwan is a pretty middling hitter, most likely.
And your chance to snag that potential difference maker will be gone.
