     No timetable on return of Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic as MRI confirms left calf strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- An MRI on Monday confirmed that Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic suffered a left calf strain in the team's regular-season finale, a source told ESPN.
After a brief discussion with Mavs director of player health and performance Casey Smith, Doncic hobbled to the locker room.
Doncic did not speak to the media Sunday night because he was receiving postgame treatment.
"For some reason, I feel like he'll be ready to go," Mavs guard Jalen Brunson said after Sunday's game.
Doncic, a first-team All-NBA selection the past two seasons, averaged 28.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game this season.

     Summary: Sixers center Joel Embiid has been named the Eastern Conference’s Player of the Week for the final week of the 2021/22 regular season (April 4-10), while Mavericks guard Luka Doncic has won the award in the West, the NBA announced today (via Twitter).
Embiid, putting a stamp on an MVP-caliber season, averaged 38.7 PPG, 14.3 RPG, and 2.7 APG on .609/.444/.757 shooting in three games (37.7 MPG) before resting in Philadelphia’s regular season finale on Sunday.
The Sixers had a 3-1 week as Embiid earned his second Player of the Week award of the season.
It was his third Player of the Week award this season.
Doncic’s season ended on a sour note though, as he left Sunday’s finale early due to a strained left calf.

     Luka Doncic injury update: Mavericks star diagnosed with calf strain; no timetable for return, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks star point guard Luka Doncic has been diagnosed with a left calf strain after undergoing an MRI on Monday afternoon, per ESPN's Tim MacMahon.
Doncic's status for Game 1 of the Mavericks' first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz on Saturday is still unknown as Dallas hasn't set a timetable for his return.
Doncic sustained the injury in Dallas' regular-season finale against the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday.
If Doncic isn't 100 percent healthy, not only will it hinder Dallas in the series, but there is always the chance of worsening the current injury.
If Doncic is ruled out for Game 1, Dallas will turn to Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson to try and fill the All-NBA guard's shoes.

     Injury experts talk Luka Doncic calf strain scenarios and ‘complex’ risk-reward of playoff return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Day 1 of tracking Luka Doncic’s calf injury ended with an anti-climactic result.
The Dallas Morning News interviewed a trio of sports medicine experts Monday who said muscle strains remain the most “finicky” and “complex” injuries for athletes because of the variability in severity, location and treatment options.
Souryal said treatment for muscle strains can include hyperbaric, compression and muscle-stimulation approaches — multiple modalities in play at the same time.
The team’s medical staff has a history of helping players return from muscle strains quicker than the NBA average.
Stotts said NBA players missed an average of 16 days for calf strains this season — not specific to grade or location.
