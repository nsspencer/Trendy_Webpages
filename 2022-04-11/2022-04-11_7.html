     On National Pet Day, Celebrating the Health Benefits of Our Furriest Friends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today is National Pet Day and unconditional love from your furry, feathered or scaly friend is just one of the benefits to pet ownership.
Dr. Secor referred to recent research, published in the journal Aging Mental Health, showing the positive influence pets have on older adults in particular.
Pet owners experience improved physical and mental health, including:Increased opportunities to exercise and get outside.
“The study also shows these benefits increase resilience in older adults against mental health disorders.
The importance of pets in collective health, he continued, is also reflected in the popular pet therapy programs at hospitals across Hartford HealthCare, which were temporarily suspended during the pandemic with visitor restrictions.

     Willow Biden, the First Cat, shows off her new life at the White House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Willow Biden went from a Pennsylvania barn to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
— and to mark the occasion, The Dodo shone a spotlight on the newest member of the Biden family: Willow, the cat that first lady Jill Biden met in 2020 during a campaign stop at a Pennsylvania farm and later adopted.
She officially joined the Bidens at the White House in January.
In The Dodo's video, Willow takes viewers along as she goes about her daily routine, which includes napping on desks, staring out the window at birds, and getting treats from the first lady.
It's clear that Willow, a short-haired gray tabby, has made herself right at home in the White House.
