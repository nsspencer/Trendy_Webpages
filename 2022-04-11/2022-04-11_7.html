     Summary: This certainly isn't the place the Nets -- or anyone else -- expected them to be.
Then there's Cleveland, a team that finished with the fourth-worst record a year ago.
(7) Brooklyn Nets vs. (8) Cleveland CavaliersWhen: Tuesday, April 12 | 7 p.m.
When Irving and Durant are clicking, the Nets are an incredibly difficult team to stop.
In the end, though, I expect Durant and Irving to be more than enough to take care of a young Cavaliers team.

     Why Kevin Durant and the Nets should be a safe bet to win vs. Cavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets were supposed to wrap up their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs long ago.
After finishing 44-38 on the year, the Nets will have to earn their way into the playoffs via the play-in tournament.
Want to bet on the Nets beating Cleveland to make the playoffs behind a strong performance from Kevin Durant??
You can win big with DraftKings if the Nets win and Durant scores at least 30 points.
Durant will not want to mess around with an elimination game in the play-in tournament if the Nets lose.

     Nets get healthy at right time: Seth Curry to play vs. Cavs, Goran Dragic cleared
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s the post-season even if only the play-in tournament and the Nets are looking like they’re getting healthy at the same time.
Curry, who’s admitted his ankle needs rest and is officially listed as probable, said he’ll be ready to go.
Curry has missed two of the Nets last four games and three of the last nine.
He said he too would welcome the versatile 25-year-old back but noted the Nets have an issue at hand, the play-in game (or games.)
“We’re worried about the play-in game right now,” Curry said.
