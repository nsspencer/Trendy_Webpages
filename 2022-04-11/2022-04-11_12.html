     Summary: Biden picks a former federal prosecutor to lead the ATF as it targets 'ghost guns'Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biden on Monday announced the finalization of a federal rule to regulate so-called "ghost guns" more like regular guns, including requiring serial numbers and background checks for the purchase of kits to assemble guns privately.
The rule would not ban gun kits themselves or strengthen penalties for crimes committed with ghost guns.
Last year, about 20,000 suspected ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement during criminal investigations, according to the ATF, marking a tenfold increase in reported ghost guns compared to 2016.
Biden also introduced his second nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, former U.S. Attorney Steve Dettelbach.
Biden said ATF estimates being able to trace less than 1% of ghost guns.

     Amid rise of gun violence, Biden unveils 'basic common sense' regulations targeting ghost guns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden’s decision to take aim at ghost guns comes amid growing concern about the rise of gun violence and increasing pressure from Democrats in Congress to crack down on gun deaths and violent crime.
In addition to the new regulations, Biden called on Congress to ban the sale and possession of ghost guns.
Last year, about 20,000 ghost guns were recovered in criminal investigations, a tenfold increase from 2016, the Justice Department said.
Tretta called the new rules "lifesaving" and noted that the weapon used to shoot her and kill two students was a ghost gun.

Why authorities say ghost guns are dangerousWhile ghost guns are only a fraction of the firearms involved in gun crimes, law enforcement across the country are pointing the finger at ghost guns as a growing problem.
Ghost guns have been involved in school shootings, such as one in Saugus, California, where a 16-year-old killed four people, and in mass shootings, like one in Northern California where a 44-year-old used a ghost gun to kill five people despite a court order prohibiting him from having guns.

     Biden vows to crack down on ghost guns – ‘weapons of choice for many criminals’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Biden has announced a crackdown on “ghost guns”, untraceable firearms assembled from kits that have been used in a rising number of shooting crimes.
“These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,” Biden said during an event in the White House Rose Garden.
In 2019, a 16-year-old killed two students and injured three others before killing himself with a ghost gun at a school in Santa Clarita.
The National Rifle Association criticised the effort to regulate ghost guns and urged its members to oppose Dettelbach.
Jessica Anderson, executive director of the conservative organisation Heritage Action, added: “Biden attacking so-called ‘ghost guns’ will only make our communities worse off.

     What you should know about ghost guns as Biden announces new regulation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday announced new steps aimed at regulating so-called "ghost guns," as use of the untraceable, homemade weapons in violent crimes rises .
Purchasing kits to build ghost guns online does not require a background check, so buyers can sidestep the typical requirements that might come with buying a firearm.
In San Francisco, for example, about 20% of the nearly 1,100 guns it seized in 2021 were ghost guns, police there told CNN.
Of the 12,088 guns recovered in Chicago last year, 455, or 3.76%, were ghost guns, according to data from the city, up from 130 ghost guns recovered in 2020, when ghost guns made up 1.15% of the 11,343 guns recovered.
Additionally, the new rules mandate firearm dealers add a serial number to already-assembled ghost guns they come across.

     Biden announces ban on unlicensed ghost gun kits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) – President Biden on Monday announced a ban on unlicensed kits to manufacture so-called ghost guns at home as part of his efforts to crack down on the proliferation of untraceable firearms.
Biden touted these new actions to fight gun crime on Monday, alongside Vice President Harris and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.
Take a look,” Biden said, walking over to a ghost gun kit on a table.
The rule applies to all ghost guns, regardless of how they were made, which can include 3D printing as well as kits.
Biden called on Congress to pass legislation to ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms, like ghost guns.
