     Anthony Mackie reflects on the ‘mind-blowing’ call to become Captain America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyone vaguely familiar with comic book history would have been fully aware that the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s long game would eventually see Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson installed as the new Captain America, dating right back to his franchise debut in The Winter Soldier.
With those boxes ticked, the next step is for the actor to headline his own standalone feature-length blockbuster, which is currently in development.
“As a dad of boys, it’s really cool when your kids can see you do something that they can watch.
We do all these movies, most of them our kids can’t watch.
But my kids were actually able to sit down and eat popcorn and watch The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, or Avengers, or all those movies.
