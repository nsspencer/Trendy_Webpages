     Orioles 2, Brewers 0: Different ballpark, same result for Milwaukee's punchless offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE – The Milwaukee Brewers made their first appearance at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in nearly 19 years on Monday afternoon.
Perhaps they're still en route from Wrigley Field.
Facing one of the worst pitching staffs in the major leagues the Brewers turned in another punchless performance at the plate in being shut out by the Baltimore Orioles, 2-0.
That ineptitude, combined with shaky starting pitching, has left the Brewers a surprising 1-3 against two non-contenders to start a season in which they're expected to be major power in the National League.
Right-hander Adrian Houser was the latest member of the team's vaunted rotation to struggle, allowing four hits, two runs and three walks with three strikeouts over 3⅔ innings.

1 overall MLB pitching prospect in Grayson Rodriguez.
When we began this journey in 2019, we expected our Minor League rebuild to take four to five years, even before accounting for the unpredictable loss of an entire year of Minor League baseball in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Summary: BALTIMORE (AP) — The night before starting the Orioles’ home opener, Baltimore native Bruce Zimmermann walked onto the field at Camden Yards.
Zimmermann pitched four innings to start a successful day for Baltimore’s maligned pitching staff, and the Orioles beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0 on Monday.
Mullins, whose 30-30 campaign was one of the few bright spots in a 110-loss season for the Orioles last year, singled with the bases loaded.
Zimmermann, the first Maryland-born pitcher to start a home opener for the Orioles since 1990, allowed three hits, struck out four and walked two.
“I thought he got better as he stayed out there longer.”The Orioles faced Milwaukee in a home opener for the first time since 1995, when the Brewers were in the American League.

     Summary: Baltimore Orioles play the Milwaukee Brewers on Opening Day as the Orioles celebrate the 30th anniversary of Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
And because of those dreams, Zimmermann hoped taking some time in the pitch-dark quiet would make Monday easier.
AdvertisementThere was no avoiding the magnitude: The 27-year-old left-hander was the starting pitcher for his childhood ballclub on Opening Day.
“Walking out on that field and seeing the ‘Opening Day’ spray-painted on the grass and the new left field wall and the warehouse lit up, it was kind of storybook in a way,” Orioles starting pitcher Bruce Zimmermann said.
He’s a hard worker.”To be here, on the bump for Opening Day at Camden Yards, it took more than a solid spring training.

Cedric Mullins had a two-run single for his first RBI of the season, Baltimore pitchers combined on a shutout and the Orioles got their first win of the year in their first home game of the year, 2-0 over Milwaukee.
The fears of starting 0-4 for the first time since the infamous 1988 season can be put to rest.
Urias tagged and went to third, though, and Jorge Mateo and Robinson Chirinos drew walks to load the bases.
The Orioles can now say they’ve never lost with their jacked-up left field corner.

“It was palpable,” said Zimmermann, the first pitcher born in Maryland to start the Orioles’ home opener since 1990.
The three with the highest exit velocities — Mullins’ hit and a pair from Anthony Santander, who reached base four times — fortunately found gaps.

Matt Harvey is a tremendously flawed human being, but there is no reason to believe he ever intended to contribute to former teammate Tyler Skaggs’ death.
He is an objectively bad baseball player and has been for four years now.
I hope Matt Harvey remains on a positive track in his life.
But signing Matt Harvey in any capacity at this point is embarrassing.
