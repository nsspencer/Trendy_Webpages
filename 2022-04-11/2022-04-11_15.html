     Orioles 2, Brewers 0: Different ballpark, same result for Milwaukee's punchless offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE – The Milwaukee Brewers made their first appearance at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in nearly 19 years on Monday afternoon.
Perhaps they're still en route from Wrigley Field.
Facing one of the worst pitching staffs in the major leagues the Brewers turned in another punchless performance at the plate in being shut out by the Baltimore Orioles, 2-0.
That ineptitude, combined with shaky starting pitching, has left the Brewers a surprising 1-3 against two non-contenders to start a season in which they're expected to be major power in the National League.
Right-hander Adrian Houser was the latest member of the team's vaunted rotation to struggle, allowing four hits, two runs and three walks with three strikeouts over 3⅔ innings.

     Summary: Beginning in 2019, we devoted our entire company to building through the farm system in the “Oriole Way” of past eras, recently emulated successfully by other MLB clubs.
As a result, we now boast the No.

1 overall MLB pitching prospect in Grayson Rodriguez.
When we began this journey in 2019, we expected our Minor League rebuild to take four to five years, even before accounting for the unpredictable loss of an entire year of Minor League baseball in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orioles got one hit when they needed it Monday.
Cedric Mullins had a two-run single for his first RBI of the season, Baltimore pitchers combined on a shutout and the Orioles got their first win of the year in their first home game of the year, 2-0 over Milwaukee.
The fears of starting 0-4 for the first time since the infamous 1988 season can be put to rest.
Urias tagged and went to third, though, and Jorge Mateo and Robinson Chirinos drew walks to load the bases.
The Orioles can now say they’ve never lost with their jacked-up left field corner.

     Summary: APBALTIMORE (AP) — The night before starting the Orioles' home opener, Baltimore native Bruce Zimmermann walked onto the field at Camden Yards.
Zimmermann pitched four innings to start a successful day for Baltimore's maligned pitching staff, and the Orioles beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0 on Monday.
On the 30th anniversary of its inaugural season, Camden Yards looked noticeably different after the wall in left field was pushed back and made taller in the offseason.
Zimmermann, the first Maryland-born pitcher to start a home opener for the Orioles since 1990, allowed three hits, struck out four and walked two.
"I thought we did today.”NEW LOOKThe previous dimensions at Camden Yards were 333 feet to left field, 364 to left-center and 410 to center.
