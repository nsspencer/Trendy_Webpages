     PERCY JACKSON Series Casts Its First Lead in Walker Scobell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, Disney+’s Percy Jackson series has cast its first lead.
Scobell will star as the hero of Disney+’s new series adaptation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
And at 13, Scobell’s casting as Percy Jackon means he will be much closer to the age of the 12-year-old Percy Jackson in the books.
Logan Lerman played the titular character in the Percy Jackson movies when Lerman was old enough to fill out college applications.
We hope we hear more casting news from Disney+’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians series very soon.

     Disney Plus' Percy Jackson series casts Walker Scobell as lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney+ has found its lead protagonist for the Percy Jackson And The Olympians series in The Adam Project’s Walker Scobell, reports Variety.
AdvertisementThe series is set to follow 12-year-old Percy Jackson (Scobell), a modern demigod who, after finding out his Greek deity parentage, must go on an adventure to find the sky god Zeus’ master lighting bolt after being accused of stealing the prized possession.
In a post on his website, Percy Jackson And The Olympians author Rick Riordan revealed the casting news and explained how Scobell fit the bill of the snarky hero.
“It was obvious to me and the rest of the team that Walker had the perfect mix of comedic timing, sweetness, rebelliousness, snark and heroism to embody our hero Percy Jackson,” said Riordan.
While other YA fantasy series like Harry Potter have had great movie adaptions, Percy Jackson has, uh, not.

     Summary: Walker Scobell (The Adam Project) has landed the title role in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, a series adaptation of author Rick Riordan’s best-selling novels.
“Walker Scobell is an incredibly talented young man who blew us away with his audition tapes for the role of Percy,” Riordan wrote.
“Many of you recently discovered how great Walker is when you watched his movie The Adam Project, in which Walker lit up the screen as a younger version of Ryan Reynolds’ character.
The first two books in Riordan’s series were previously adapted into feature films that starred Logan Lerman as the title character.
Scobell made his film debut with Netflix’s The Adam Project.
