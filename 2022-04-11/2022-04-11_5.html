     On National Pet Day, Celebrating the Health Benefits of Our Furriest Friends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today is National Pet Day and unconditional love from your furry, feathered or scaly friend is just one of the benefits to pet ownership.
Dr. Secor referred to recent research, published in the journal Aging Mental Health, showing the positive influence pets have on older adults in particular.
Pet owners experience improved physical and mental health, including:Increased opportunities to exercise and get outside.
“The study also shows these benefits increase resilience in older adults against mental health disorders.
The importance of pets in collective health, he continued, is also reflected in the popular pet therapy programs at hospitals across Hartford HealthCare, which were temporarily suspended during the pandemic with visitor restrictions.

     National Pet Day: The White House spotlights the first pets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington CNN —The White House is putting the first pets on display for National Pets Day.
The Biden’s family cat, Willow, was captured doing “work” around the White House in a video posted to The Dodo’s social media on Monday.
She officially moved into the White House in January and her name was inspired by the first lady’s hometown of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.
Commander was featured for National Pets Day in an Instagram post by The Dogist.
Their other German Shepherd, a rescue named Major, has been living away from the White House after a handful of aggressive incidents involving staff at the White House.
