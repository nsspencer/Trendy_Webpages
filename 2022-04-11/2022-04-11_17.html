     Cleveland Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen will miss play-in game against Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen seems close to returning, but that won’t come in Tuesday night’s NBA play-in tournament game against the Brooklyn Nets.
On Monday's injury report filed to the league, All-Star Allen was listed as out of the 7 p.m. game at Barclays Center as the seventh-place Nets host the eighth-place Cavs.
It will be the 19th consecutive game missed by Allen since he fractured his left middle finger against the Toronto Raptors on March 6.
Allen is the only Cavs player on the report other than Collin Sexton and Dean Wade, both rehabbing from surgery.
According to the Associated Press, Allen participated in an intense session of drills and shot with his left hand.

     Summary: Tyler Fulghum breaks down why he doesn't trust the Nets to cover the spread at home against the Cavaliers in Tuesday's play-in game.
(0:48)Can the Nets cover the spread at home vs. Cavs in play-in game?
The play-in tournament is something new for them, and the Brooklyn Nets certainly didn't expect to experience it this year.
The Cleveland Cavaliers weren't sure they would, either, after losing 50 games last season.
Both finished 44-38, with the Nets taking seventh place by going 3-1 against the Cavaliers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of all the teams in the Eastern Conference you could have picked for the play-in games, the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers were probably at the bottom of the list.
(7) Brooklyn Nets vs. (8) Cleveland CavaliersWhen: Tuesday, April 12 | 7 p.m.
After the James Harden trade, the Nets scored an incredible 123.6 points per 100 possessions with Durant and Irving on the floor.
This is all to say that in order to beat Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Nets on Tuesday, they're going to have to score ... a lot.
Assuming Durant, Irving, Garland and LeVert all bring their A-game, Mobley could be the swing factor in Tuesday's matchup.
