     Britney Spears Said She's Pregnant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She pleaded with the court to end the legal arrangement, which she described as "abusive."
"I deserve to have a life," Spears said at the time.
"I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does by having a child, a family, any of those things, and more."
As a result, her father, Jamie Spears, was put in charge of her financial and business affairs, as well as decisions regarding her personal life.
In her Instagram post on Monday, Spears, who has two children with Federline, said she planned to spend less time going out to avoid the paparazzi.
