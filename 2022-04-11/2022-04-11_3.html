     Frank Vogel out as Lakers' coach: Here's a look at possible replacements in Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Frank Vogel era as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers is over – a three-year run that included a championship in 2020, his first season with the team.
Someone had to take the fall for the Lakers missing the playoffs, and Vogel was first on the list, though roster construction and injuries were hardly his fault.

     LeBron James Says He Has ’Nothing But Respect’ for Frank Vogel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Vogel’s tenure as Lakers head coach had not officially ended by the time LeBron James spoke to the media on Monday morning, but all reports indicate that that conclusion is imminent.
James was asked about his time working with Vogel in Los Angeles and was complimentary about the 48-year-old coach’s tenure.
“I respect Frank as a coach, as a man,” James said.
When asked in Sunday’s postgame press conference about Wojnarowski’s report, Vogel said, “I haven’t been told s---,” according to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha.
Vogel led the Lakers to an NBA title in his first season with the team, which concluded in the NBA’s COVID-19 bubble in Orlando.

     Summary: The Lakers officially announced the firing of coach Frank Vogel on Monday and it simultaneously released a graphic with, “Thank you, Coach,” as a caption.
Just an hour later, Los Angeles announced it fired Vogel.
But tweeting a thank-you note in the same breath that you fire your championship-winning coach is not the best PR.
This is all the more relevant because Vogel apparently learned he was being fired from the report as opposed to the Lakers’ front office.
“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court,” Lakers general manager said in a release.

Despite some cloud casted on him this season, Frank Vogel remains an esteemed coach in the NBA, widely known for his smothering defensive systems.
Getting Frank Vogel back would be objectively unlikely, but the Indiana Pacers have a lot of reasons to want him back.

     Summary: The Lakers fired coach Frank Vogel Monday just two years after he led the team to its 17th NBA championship and first since 2010.
It culminated with a 49-loss season during which the Lakers were never more than three games over .500 and in which Vogel used 40 starting lineups.
In three seasons with the team, Vogel went 127-98.
Davis missed another 18 games, the Lakers left to fight for the final spot in the play-in tournament.
The Lakers would lose eight games in a row before winning against Oklahoma City in the home finale at Crypto.com Arena.

     Summary: Beset by injuries, lineup fit questions and unfulfilled aspirations of being a title contender, the Los Angeles Lakers fired coach Frank Vogel on Monday, less than 18 months after he guided the franchise to a championship and just one day after their regular season finale.
The Lakers’ plan to part with Vogel was first reported by ESPN shortly after a season-ending 146-141 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night.
“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court,” Pelinka said in a statement.
Vogel, who received a one-year extension in September that carried him through the 2022-23 season, departs with a 127-98 (.564) record in three seasons.

The Lakers fired Vogel on Monday, choosing their title-winning coach to take the first fall for one of the most disappointing seasons in NBA history.
Pelinka declined to elaborate Monday on why he and owner Jeanie Buss felt Vogel needed to be fired.
“This was a disappointing Lakers season at every level,” Pelinka said.
Davis managed to play in only 40 of their 82 games, while Westbrook struggled to fit into the Lakers’ team concept during one of the worst seasons of his professional career.

"This was a disappointing Lakers season at every level,'' Pelinka added.
Yet even after Vogel won a championship, he still needed to wait until after the 2020-21 season to earn a contract extension.
The Lakers won the 2020 championship based on their defense, and last season, they ranked No.
Not even Vogel could save this season's Lakers roster, though, as they fell to No.
