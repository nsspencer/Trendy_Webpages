     Wildwood High Alum Frank Vogel Expected to be Fired by Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angles Lakers have fired three-year head coach Frank Vogel, a Wildwood high school alum, following a 33-49 season, missing the playoffs.
"I'm going to enjoy tonight, celebrate what these young guys did, and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow," Vogel said when asked about his job status after the Lakers final game on Sunday.
The Lakers hired Vogel before the start of the 2019-2020 season after he sat out one season.
Vogel is a 1991 graduate of Wildwood high school and has been a head coach of the Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic and the Lakers, with a career record of 431-389 in 11 seasons.
About a week ago, Jake Fisher of Bleacher Report, reported that Sixers head coach Doc Rivers would be a potential candidate to replace Vogel if he was no longer with the team.

     Lakers targeting Nick Nurse as Frank Vogel’s replacement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers are set to dump the coach who led them to an NBA championship just two seasons ago.
University of Michigan coach and former NBA All-Star Juwan Howard is also expected to be a candidate, according to the report.
Nurse, 54, led the Raptors to the franchise’s first NBA championship in 2018-19, Kawhi Leonard’s lone season in Toronto.
Despite losing Kyle Lowry last summer, the Raptors went 48-34 this season and earned the No.
But between Westbrook’s offensive struggles and injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers’ season went off the rails.

     Summary: The Lakers, winners of the 2020 NBA championship under Vogel, entered the season as Western Conference favorites.
Yet even after Vogel won a championship, he still needed to wait until after the 2020-21 season to earn a contract extension.
The Lakers won the 2020 championship based on their defense, and last season, they ranked No.
Not even Vogel could save this season's Lakers roster, though, as they fell to No.
The Lakers, meanwhile, will now search for their sixth full-time head coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011.
