Durant, Irving and the Brooklyn Nets are the biggest story of the play-in round.
The Nets used a winning run at the end of the regular season to land a home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

     Summary: The NBA will continue to have the play-in tournament this season, with the competition determining the No.
The play-in teams tend to have a tough time going far in the postseason due to their low seed and first-round matchups.
Getting out of the play-in tournament is hard enough, especially if you are in the 9-10 matchup.
The San Antonio Spurs have the worst title odds for the play-in teams at +100000.
Of the West play-in teams, the Los Angeles Clippers represent the best potential title team but even they will be without Kawhi Leonard.

     Summary: The Cleveland Cavaliers and Brooklyn Nets will battle it out for the seventh seed in a play-in game on Tuesday night in New York.
It’s time to continue our NBA odds series with a Cavaliers-Nets prediction and pick.
Thus, if the Cavaliers must play another game on Friday, there is a better chance of Allen playing that game instead.
Now, the Nets will have Durant and Irving available, but Simons is still out.
The Nets will cover the spread if Durant and Irving go off, leading the pack and controlling the Cavs.
