     Wildwood High Alum Frank Vogel Expected to be Fired by Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angles Lakers have fired three-year head coach Frank Vogel, a Wildwood high school alum, following a 33-49 season, missing the playoffs.
"I'm going to enjoy tonight, celebrate what these young guys did, and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow," Vogel said when asked about his job status after the Lakers final game on Sunday.
The Lakers hired Vogel before the start of the 2019-2020 season after he sat out one season.
Vogel is a 1991 graduate of Wildwood high school and has been a head coach of the Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic and the Lakers, with a career record of 431-389 in 11 seasons.
About a week ago, Jake Fisher of Bleacher Report, reported that Sixers head coach Doc Rivers would be a potential candidate to replace Vogel if he was no longer with the team.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Vogel’s tenure as Lakers head coach had not officially ended by the time LeBron James spoke to the media on Monday morning, but all reports indicate that that conclusion is imminent.
James was asked about his time working with Vogel in Los Angeles and was complimentary about the 48-year-old coach’s tenure.
“I respect Frank as a coach, as a man,” James said.
When asked in Sunday’s postgame press conference about Wojnarowski’s report, Vogel said, “I haven’t been told s---,” according to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha.
Vogel led the Lakers to an NBA title in his first season with the team, which concluded in the NBA’s COVID-19 bubble in Orlando.

     Lakers fire Frank Vogel after doomed season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beset by injuries, lineup fit questions and unfulfilled aspirations of being a title contender, the Los Angeles Lakers fired coach Frank Vogel Monday, less than 18 months after he guided the franchise to a championship and just one day after their regular season finale.
Choose your plan ArrowRight The 48-year-old Vogel had faced serious questions about his job security since December as the Lakers struggled to develop a cohesive offense and regressed on defense.
The Lakers’ plan to part with Vogel was first reported by ESPN.com shortly after a season-ending 146-141 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night.
James’s own early season injury issues made a tough situation worse, preventing the new-look Lakers from developing chemistry.
Vogel, who received a one-year extension in September that carried him through the 2022-23 season, departed with a 127-98 (.564) record in three seasons with the Lakers.

     Summary: The Lakers, winners of the 2020 NBA championship under Vogel, entered the season as Western Conference favorites.
Yet even after Vogel won a championship, he still needed to wait until after the 2020-21 season to earn a contract extension.
The Lakers won the 2020 championship based on their defense, and last season, they ranked No.
Not even Vogel could save this season's Lakers roster, though, as they fell to No.
The Lakers, meanwhile, will now search for their sixth full-time head coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011.

     Lakers fire title-winning coach Frank Vogel after 3 seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Lakers fired Frank Vogel on Monday, choosing their championship-winning head coach to take the first fall for one of the most disappointing seasons in NBA history.
Vogel was fired exactly 18 months after he led the Lakers to the franchise’s 17th title in his first season in charge.
It was a dismal, embarrassing end to a tenure that began tremendously for Vogel, the former coach at Orlando and Indiana.
The Lakers claimed a title in the Florida bubble in October 2020, but didn’t win another playoff round in the next two seasons.
After so much preseason ballyhoo around the teaming of James, Davis and Westbrook, the trio managed to play in only 21 games together — and went 11-10.
