     Cavs news: Kevin Love fires warning ahead of play-in game vs. Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers lost three times in four meetings with the Brooklyn Nets back in the regular season, but the Cavs veteran knows that all that is water under the bridge once the playoff kicks off.
The Cavs will be squaring off with Brooklyn in the play-in tournament in the Eastern Conference this coming Tuesday at Barclays Center, with Love sounding a bit cautious of what his team is about to go through, per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com.
You don’t know it, don’t understand it until you go through it.”Love adds:“The thing that we have on our side is we are all so tight and we all stick together through everything.
J.B. likes to say win the scrap and all our battles are won in the trenches.
That victory also ended the Cavs’ three-game losing skid, a stretch that included a 118-107 loss to the Nets in Brooklyn on Apr.

     Brooklyn Nets play-in schedule: See the Nets' path to the first round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 seed in the Eastern Conference, but there’s still work to be done for the Nets to advance to the first round of the playoffs.
The Nets will have to go through the NBA’s play-in tournament, and have the benefit of home-court advantage as the No.
The loser of that game is eliminated from playoff contention – but the loser of the 7-8 game still gets another chance.
On Thursday, the loser of the 7-8 game will play the winner of the 9-10 game to determine the No.
If the Nets were to advance from that game, they would play the Miami Heat in the first round.

It’s time to continue our NBA odds series with a Cavaliers-Nets prediction and pick.
Thus, if the Cavaliers must play another game on Friday, there is a better chance of Allen playing that game instead.
Now, the Nets will have Durant and Irving available, but Simons is still out.
The Nets will cover the spread if Durant and Irving go off, leading the pack and controlling the Cavs.
