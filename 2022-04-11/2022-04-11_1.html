     Lakers fire Frank Vogel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Vogel, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to the 2020 NBA championship, has coached his final game for the organization, a decision expected to be shared with him as soon as Monday, sources told ESPN.
The Lakers’ search for his replacement is expected to be expansive and lengthy — without a clear-cut front-runner, sources said.
The Lakers concluded a disappointing 33-49 season on Sunday with a 146-141 overtime victory at the Denver Nuggets, after being eliminated from play-in tournament contention on Tuesday.
Continuity was a constant challenge for Vogel and the Lakers this season, as they had to contend with injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis and a challenging roster construction, including limited shooting and athleticism.
Despite entering the season with high expectations, the Lakers were only able to have James, Davis and Russell Westbrook on the floor together for 21 games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the most significant changes fans of the Lakers are hoping to see is a change in coaching.
Frank Vogel, who coached the Lakers to an NBA championship 18 months ago, is expected to be fired soon.
Adrian Wojnarowski even reported that Vogel had coached his last game just moments after the final buzzer sounded in Denver.

It is understandable that Vogel would have wanted his job status and his future to be private and under wraps.

     Lakers News: Frank Vogel Addresses Reports He Will Fired Following 2021-22 Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers head coach Frank Vogel has caught a lot of flak for how the 2021-22 season has unraveled, but at least he got to enjoy a win in the final game.
The Lakers erased a double-digit lead and won in overtime against the Denver Nuggets, a rare moment of success for the team.
However, almost as soon as the buzzer sounded a report surfaced that the Lakers were planning on letting go of Vogel soon.
Vogel heaped plenty of praise on the rookie, largely crediting him for how he performed down the stretch.
Vogel believes Johnson improved over the course of the year and made a case to be someone the team should keep long term.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers wasted absolutely no time in reportedly firing Frank Vogel on Sunday night moments after their win over the Nuggets went final.
On this week’s episode of “Can U Dig It,” a podcast by the Silver Screen &amp; Roll network, myself and Christian rant about the state of the Lakers.
For the Lakers to have success moving forward, LeBron, AD, Rob and the new head coach need to be on the same page.
Otherwise, the Lakers are going to be back in the same position next season and no scapegoat to blame it on.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers’ season is over, but that doesn’t mean we are done talking about them, especially with LA likely making a major move by firing head coach Frank Vogel.
“Frank Vogel is getting screwed,” Barkley said on the April 10 episode of Inside the NBA.
They should try that for them old ass geezers.”Is Frank Vogel to blame for the Lakers’ issues?
Charles Barkley was correct when saying the Lakers’ catastrophic season is not Frank Vogel’s fault (nor is it Russell Westbrook’s).
The Lakers’ season may be over, but the storylines aren’t stopping anytime soon.
