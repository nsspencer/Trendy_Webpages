    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was widely expected that Frank Vogel will be fired by the Los Angeles Lakers after once the NBA regular season ended.
It was an awkward situation when Vogel was asked about the report of him getting fired during the postgame press conference.
Lakers head coach used an expletive in response.
Allegedly he was treated with lack of respect by director of basketball operations Kurt Rambis who yelled at Vogel in front of the team.
This led to players losing respect in their head coach to the point where they would text during games.

     Summary: The Lakers wasted absolutely no time in reportedly firing Frank Vogel on Sunday night moments after their win over the Nuggets went final.
On this week’s episode of “Can U Dig It,” a podcast by the Silver Screen &amp; Roll network, myself and Christian rant about the state of the Lakers.
For the Lakers to have success moving forward, LeBron, AD, Rob and the new head coach need to be on the same page.
Otherwise, the Lakers are going to be back in the same position next season and no scapegoat to blame it on.

pic.twitter.com/BjzkysxqQE — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 11, 2022Should the Indiana Pacers pursue Frank Vogel for another go-round?
Despite some cloud casted on him this season, Frank Vogel remains an esteemed coach in the NBA, widely known for his smothering defensive systems.
Getting Frank Vogel back would be objectively unlikely, but the Indiana Pacers have a lot of reasons to want him back.

     Lakers coach Frank Vogel on future with team: 'I haven't been told s---'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Lakers' 146-141 overtime win over the Nuggets on Sunday night, questions immediately turned to coach Frank Vogel's future in Los Angeles.
I’m going to enjoy tonight’s game… we’ll deal with tomorrow tomorrow," he said.
During his first season at the helm, Vogel led the team to a 52-19 record and to the 2020 NBA Finals, where the Lakers defeated the Heat in six games.
In his second season, the Lakers lost to the Suns in the first round of the playoffs and finished 42-30 during the regular season.
The Lakers finished this season with a 33-49 record, sitting 11th in the Western Conference, and were eliminated from the playoffs on Tuesday night after their seventh consecutive loss.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nobody inside or outside the Lakers organization expected Frank Vogel to be back as coach next season — and that includes Vogel.
According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Lakers could go with the NFL-style “ax the coach the day after the season ends” move.
Frank Vogel, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to the 2020 NBA championship, has coached his final game for the organization, a decision expected to be shared with him as soon as Monday, sources told ESPN.
The Lakers’ search for his replacement is expected to be expansive and lengthy — without a clear-cut front-runner, sources said.
If so, they will get an interchangeable quality coach.

Frank Vogel on the Lakers sidelines EPA“I’m going to enjoy tonight’s game and what our guys did tonight and the way we finished out this season,” Vogel said, brushing off the topic.
Former Lakers Robert Horry and James Worthy discussed the situation on the Spectrum Sports postgame show and were frustrated with the timing of Wojnarowski’s tweet.
But a minute after the game, give the coach a press conference after the game.”Vogel’s job security has been questioned throughout the Lakers’ rough season.

"I'm going to enjoy tonight, celebrate what these young guys did, and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow."
Frank Vogel addresses the media regarding reports about his future with the Lakers.
But this situation was different because unlike a trade, which isn’t final until it’s final, this decision was already made.

     Summary: AP Photo/David ZalubowskiThe Los Angeles Lakers have reportedly decided to fire coach Frank Vogel.
"I haven't been told s--t and I'm going to enjoy tonight's game, celebrate what these young guys did in terms of scratching and clawing and getting back in this game and getting a W, and we'll deal with tomorrow, tomorrow," Vogel told reporters after Sunday's season-ending win over the Denver Nuggets.
The writing has been on the wall regarding Vogel's departure for months, with the Lakers' 33-49 record ranking among the most disappointing seasons in franchise history.
James and Anthony Davis combined to play 96 games; that's a losing formula before even getting to the busted Westbrook gamble.
Vogel is under contract with the Lakers through 2022-23, so he could take a season off before making his return.
