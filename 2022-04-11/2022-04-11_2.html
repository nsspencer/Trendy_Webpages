     Meet the New Percy Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That actor’s name is Walker Scobell and he’s just been cast as Percy Jackson in Disney+’s upcoming show Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
Production on Percy Jackson and the Olympians begins this summer with James Bobin (The Muppets) directing the pilot from a script by Riordan and Jon Steinberg (Black Sails).
Simply put, he has a natural charisma about him that will certainly serve him well as Percy becomes a hero and a leader.
“When Walker Scobell was five, he learned that his favorite superhero Tony Stark— AKA Iron Man— w as not an actual person but an actor playing a role.
He said if he couldn’t become a superhero in real life, the next best thing would be to play one.”Now, as Percy Jackson, he’s already achieved that dream.

     Disney Plus' Percy Jackson series casts Walker Scobell as lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney+ has found its lead protagonist for the Percy Jackson And The Olympians series in The Adam Project’s Walker Scobell, reports Variety.
AdvertisementThe series is set to follow 12-year-old Percy Jackson (Scobell), a modern demigod who, after finding out his Greek deity parentage, must go on an adventure to find the sky god Zeus’ master lighting bolt after being accused of stealing the prized possession.
In a post on his website, Percy Jackson And The Olympians author Rick Riordan revealed the casting news and explained how Scobell fit the bill of the snarky hero.
“It was obvious to me and the rest of the team that Walker had the perfect mix of comedic timing, sweetness, rebelliousness, snark and heroism to embody our hero Percy Jackson,” said Riordan.
While other YA fantasy series like Harry Potter have had great movie adaptions, Percy Jackson has, uh, not.
