     Wildwood High Alum Frank Vogel Expected to be Fired by Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angles Lakers have fired three-year head coach Frank Vogel, a Wildwood high school alum, following a 33-49 season, missing the playoffs.
"I'm going to enjoy tonight, celebrate what these young guys did, and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow," Vogel said when asked about his job status after the Lakers final game on Sunday.
The Lakers hired Vogel before the start of the 2019-2020 season after he sat out one season.
Vogel is a 1991 graduate of Wildwood high school and has been a head coach of the Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic and the Lakers, with a career record of 431-389 in 11 seasons.
About a week ago, Jake Fisher of Bleacher Report, reported that Sixers head coach Doc Rivers would be a potential candidate to replace Vogel if he was no longer with the team.

FRANK VOGEL OUT AS LAKERS' COACH:Here's a look at possible replacements in Los AngelesESPN first reported the news.
This was an injury-plagued season for an aging Lakers team.
It would've been difficult any coach to overcome the injuries and roster limitations and win with the Lakers this season.
Vogel said he hadn't been informed about his status Sunday night, a 146-141 win against the Denver Nuggets to end the Lakers' season.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Lakers officially announced the firing of coach Frank Vogel on Monday and it simultaneously released a graphic with, “Thank you, Coach,” as a caption.
Just an hour later, Los Angeles announced it fired Vogel.
But tweeting a thank-you note in the same breath that you fire your championship-winning coach is not the best PR.
This is all the more relevant because Vogel apparently learned he was being fired from the report as opposed to the Lakers’ front office.
“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court,” Lakers general manager said in a release.

     Summary: Frank Vogel’s tenure as Lakers head coach had not officially ended by the time LeBron James spoke to the media on Monday morning, but all reports indicate that that conclusion is imminent.
James was asked about his time working with Vogel in Los Angeles and was complimentary about the 48-year-old coach’s tenure.
“I respect Frank as a coach, as a man,” James said.
When asked in Sunday’s postgame press conference about Wojnarowski’s report, Vogel said, “I haven’t been told s---,” according to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha.
Vogel led the Lakers to an NBA title in his first season with the team, which concluded in the NBA’s COVID-19 bubble in Orlando.

Getting Frank Vogel back would be objectively unlikely, but the Indiana Pacers have a lot of reasons to want him back.

The Lakers won the 2020 championship based on their defense, and last season, they ranked No.
Not even Vogel could save this season's Lakers roster, though, as they fell to No.

     Summary: Beset by injuries, lineup fit questions and unfulfilled aspirations of being a title contender, the Los Angeles Lakers fired coach Frank Vogel on Monday, less than 18 months after he guided the franchise to a championship and just one day after their regular season finale.

“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court,” Pelinka said in a statement.
Vogel, who received a one-year extension in September that carried him through the 2022-23 season, departs with a 127-98 (.564) record in three seasons.
