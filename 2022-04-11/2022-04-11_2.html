     The Lakers have reportedly fired Frank Vogel, but now what?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers wasted absolutely no time in reportedly firing Frank Vogel on Sunday night moments after their win over the Nuggets went final.
On this week’s episode of “Can U Dig It,” a podcast by the Silver Screen &amp; Roll network, myself and Christian rant about the state of the Lakers.
For the Lakers to have success moving forward, LeBron, AD, Rob and the new head coach need to be on the same page.
Otherwise, the Lakers are going to be back in the same position next season and no scapegoat to blame it on.
And for a short-form recap pod, check out Lakers Lowdown, in which Anthony Irwin recaps the previous day’s news and gets you ready for the day ahead in LakerLand, every weekday morning on the Silver Screen &amp; Roll Podcast feed.

pic.twitter.com/BjzkysxqQE — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 11, 2022Should the Indiana Pacers pursue Frank Vogel for another go-round?
Despite some cloud casted on him this season, Frank Vogel remains an esteemed coach in the NBA, widely known for his smothering defensive systems.
Getting Frank Vogel back would be objectively unlikely, but the Indiana Pacers have a lot of reasons to want him back.

     Summary: When Vogel got to the postgame press conference, he had no interest in discussing his apparent impending firing.
Some time from exiting the court to his arrival at the press conference, Vogel was informed about the firing report.
Frank Vogel on the Lakers sidelines EPA“I’m going to enjoy tonight’s game and what our guys did tonight and the way we finished out this season,” Vogel said, brushing off the topic.
Former Lakers Robert Horry and James Worthy discussed the situation on the Spectrum Sports postgame show and were frustrated with the timing of Wojnarowski’s tweet.
But a minute after the game, give the coach a press conference after the game.”Vogel’s job security has been questioned throughout the Lakers’ rough season.

     Report: Lakers coach Frank Vogel could be fired as soon as Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nobody inside or outside the Lakers organization expected Frank Vogel to be back as coach next season — and that includes Vogel.
According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Lakers could go with the NFL-style “ax the coach the day after the season ends” move.
Frank Vogel, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to the 2020 NBA championship, has coached his final game for the organization, a decision expected to be shared with him as soon as Monday, sources told ESPN.
The Lakers’ search for his replacement is expected to be expansive and lengthy — without a clear-cut front-runner, sources said.
If so, they will get an interchangeable quality coach.

"I haven't been told s--- and I'm going to enjoy tonight's game," Vogel told reporters.
Yet even after Vogel won a championship, he still needed to wait until after the 2020-21 season to earn a contract extension.
The Lakers won the 2020 championship based on their defense, and last season, they ranked No.
Not even Vogel could save this season's Lakers roster, though, as they fell to No.

"I'm going to enjoy tonight, celebrate what these young guys did, and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow."
Frank Vogel addresses the media regarding reports about his future with the Lakers.
But this situation was different because unlike a trade, which isn’t final until it’s final, this decision was already made.
