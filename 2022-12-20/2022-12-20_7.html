     Jalen Brunson's All-Star Credentials Praised by Fans as Knicks Cruise Past Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesAfter signing with the New York Knicks this past offseason, point guard Jalen Brunson didn't take long to prove himself to be an All-Star-caliber player.
Brunson showcased his credentials once again by leading the Knicks to a 132-94 blowout victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
After spending the first four years of his career with the Dallas Mavericks playing behind star point guard Luka Dončić, the Villanova product chose to join a situation where he'd be the unquestioned floor general.
If he keeps playing like this, New York will have a strong chance at returning to the postseason this year.
The Knicks will look to keep the momentum going and extend their win streak when they welcome the Toronto Raptors (13-18) to town on Wednesday.

     Knicks beat Warriors at MSG for first time since 2013, extend winning streak to league-best eight games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Knicks' eight-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the league, and tied for the second-longest this season behind the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks, who each won nine in a row at various points.
This is also the longest winning streak for the Knicks since they won nine consecutive games in 2021, and tied for the eighth-longest streak in franchise history.
They did so by forcing 19 turnovers and holding the Warriors under 100 points for only the second time this season.
His effort on the perimeter is one of many reasons that the Knicks have been nearly impossible to score against during this streak.
During the Knicks' winning streak, Grimes is averaging 13.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and two assists, while shooting 50.8 percent from the field and 45.7 percent from 3-point land.
