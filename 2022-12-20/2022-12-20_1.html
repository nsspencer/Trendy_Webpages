     Summary: A magnitude 6.4 earthquake shakes Northern California, leaving 70k without powerEnlarge this image toggle caption Kent Porter/AP Kent Porter/APRIO DELL, Calif. (AP) — A powerful earthquake that residents described as "violent" rocked a rural stretch of the Northern California coast early Tuesday, leaving 11 people injured and 70,000 without power as a rain storm was about to roll in, officials said.
The magnitude 6.4 earthquake occurred at 2:34 a.m. near Ferndale, a small community about 210 miles (345 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco and close to the Pacific coast.
"It was probably the most violent earthquake we have felt in the 15 years I have lived here," he said.
Authorities said more than 70,000 people lost power and remained without it nearly 12 hours after the earthquake.
The earthquake came just days after a small magnitude 3.6 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area, waking up thousands of people before 4 a.m. Saturday and causing minor damage.
