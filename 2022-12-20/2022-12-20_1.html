     Waves recorded in B.C. after earthquake rocks California coast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A strong earthquake shook a rural stretch of northern California early Tuesday, jolting residents awake, cutting off power to 70,000 people, and damaging some buildings and a roadway, officials said.
John Cassidy, an earthquake seismologist with National Resources Canada, tweeted images showing shaking on Vancouver Island when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck California Tuesday (Dec. 20).
Ground shaking on #VancouverIsland as waves from this morning's M6.4 northern #California earthquake rolled across the region.
Closer to home, the seismometer in the Institute of Ocean Sciences building in North Saanich recorded the Island’s waves.
“It’s a good reminder to check the earthquake kits and update the plan and know what to do when shaking begins,” Cassidy said.

     Tens of thousands remain without power after earthquake in California

     Summary: Tens of thousands remain without power after earthquake in CaliforniaEnlarge this image toggle caption Kent Porter/AP Kent Porter/APRIO DELL, Calif. — Tens of thousands of homes and businesses along the Northern California coast remained without power Tuesday evening, nearly a day after a powerful earthquake jolted people awake and shook homes off foundations, injuring at least 12 and leaving many without water.
The magnitude 6.4 earthquake occurred at 2:34 a.m. near Ferndale, a small community about 210 miles (345 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco and close to the Pacific coast.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric had restored power to about 40,000 customers — more than half of the original 72,000 that had been affected — by late Tuesday.
The earthquake occurred in an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, where three tectonic plates meet.
The earthquake came just days after a small magnitude 3.6 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area, waking up thousands of people before 4 a.m. Saturday and causing minor damage.
