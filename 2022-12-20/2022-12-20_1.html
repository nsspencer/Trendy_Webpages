     Tens of thousands remain without power after earthquake in California
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tens of thousands remain without power after earthquake in CaliforniaEnlarge this image toggle caption Kent Porter/AP Kent Porter/APRIO DELL, Calif. — Tens of thousands of homes and businesses along the Northern California coast remained without power Tuesday evening, nearly a day after a powerful earthquake jolted people awake and shook homes off foundations, injuring at least 12 and leaving many without water.
The magnitude 6.4 earthquake occurred at 2:34 a.m. near Ferndale, a small community about 210 miles (345 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco and close to the Pacific coast.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric had restored power to about 40,000 customers — more than half of the original 72,000 that had been affected — by late Tuesday.
The earthquake occurred in an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, where three tectonic plates meet.
The earthquake came just days after a small magnitude 3.6 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area, waking up thousands of people before 4 a.m. Saturday and causing minor damage.
