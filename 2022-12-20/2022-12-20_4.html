     MLB rumors: Carlos Correa-Giants press conference postponed for medical issue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants mysteriously postponed their introductory press conference for Carlos Correa on Tuesday about three hours before it was scheduled to begin at Oracle Park.
Ronald Blum of The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing sources, that the press conference was delayed due to an issue discovered during his physical.
"One person confirmed that Tuesday’s conference to welcome Correa was put on hold because the sides were awaiting the results of testing," Blum wrote.
"A second person said that a medical issue was flagged during Correa’s physical."
What happens next is unclear, but Giants fans are hoping everything eventually clears up and Correa receives his introductory press conference at Oracle Park soon.

     Carlos Correa signing: Giants postpone introductory press conference over issue with physical exam, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants had planned to introduce new shortstop Carlos Correa during a Tuesday press conference.
However, that press conference has been postponed because of a medical concern that came to light during the physical, the Associated Press reports.
Correa and the Giants had earlier agreed to a 13-year, $350 million free-agent contract.
It's not yet certain what path the Giants and Correa will take moving forward.
His pending deal with the Giants is the largest ever for a shortstop and the largest ever for a former No.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa intro for medical concern
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a news conference Tuesday to introduce Carlos Correa after a medical concern arose during the All-Star shortstop's physical, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.
Correa and the Giants agreed on Dec. 13 to the massive deal, subject to a successful physical, according to one of the people.
Correa, the 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, has a .279 career average with 155 homers and 553 RBIs in eight big league seasons.
Correa, 28, was a free agent one year ago after leaving the Houston Astros, and he reached a $105.3 million deal with the Minnesota Twins.
The Giants went 81-81 last season, a year after winning a franchise-record 107 games and the NL West.

     Giants Concerned With Medical Issue in Carlos Correa’s Physical, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Superstar shortstop Carlos Correa was supposed to be introduced as a franchise cornerstone by the Giants at a news conference Tuesday morning.
It’s unknown at this time whether the potential medical issue could derail the massive deal between Correa and the club.
The agreement is subject to a successful physical exam, a source told the AP.
Health and availability have been issues in Correa’s MLB career to this point.
Correa, a two-time All-Star, played his first seven MLB seasons with the Astros before joining the Twins in 2022.

     Giants delaying Carlos Correa unveiling fuels concerns, questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants have had a lot of strange and unexpected days in recent years.
The Giants had never officially announced the Correa contract, which is a common practice among sports organizations.
After a completely unforgettable season, and a largely unmemorable team, the Giants needed a jolt.
That hunt seemed fulfilled a week ago, when it was reported that Correa had agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal.
Correa’s deal came after several other stars, some represented by Boras, had rejected the Giants, for whatever reason.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa intro, awaiting test results after issue in physical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a Tuesday morning news conference to introduce new $350 million shortstop Carlos Correa, and a source told The Chronicle, without elaboration, that the team and Correa are awaiting test results.
The Giants last week agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal with Correa, a two-time All-Star and 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, with the massive contract pending a successful physical.
Correa, 28, has played in 150 games just once in eight MLB seasons and 130 games three times.
His deal with the Giants would make Correa baseball’s highest-paid infielder.
The deal would be the largest given by the Giants, outpacing Buster Posey’s nine-year, $167 million contract.

     Summary: The SF Giants tumultuous offseason is only getting wilder.
The Giants postponed Correa's introductory press conference on Tuesday due to medical concerns, according to a report by Ronald Blum of the Associated Press.
Will the SF Giants deal with Carlos Correa fall through?
The Giants remain the favorites to sign Carlos Correa.
However, if the deal falls through, and Correa signs elsewhere, it will transform the 2022-23 offseason into one of the worst in SF Giants franchise history.
