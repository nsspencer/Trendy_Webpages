     Connor Clifton and the Bruins defensemen were more offensive, and that made Monday’s win different
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ), we can’t say the Bruins defensemen have been negligent in their offensive duties.
As the night played out, Hampus Lindholm added a pair of assists, and Clifton and Carlo chipped in with one apiece.
Clifton led off the scoring with his third goal of the season.
This was the same Clifton who found himself two days earlier, in a 4-2 win over the Blue Jackets, Gorilla-taped to the bench by Montgomery.
“That leads to trouble.”It officially made Clifton the first member of the Black and Gold called out by the coach this season.

     Carlo Nets First Goal Of Season For Boston Bruins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have not lacked for goal-scoring this season while ranking first or second pretty much all season among the league’s top offensive groups.
The Black and Gold got two goals from Bruins D-men in the win, including stay-at-home defenseman Brandon Carlo’s first goal of the season making him the 21st different player to score a goal for the Boston Bruins this season.
Brandon Carlo – offensive defenseman.
Carlo's first goal of the season gives Boston a 2-0 lead.
The lamp-lighter also gives every regular in a Boston Bruins uniform a goal this season as they continue to enjoy lineup depth like they haven’t before in previous recent seasons.

     Dear Santa: Boston Bruins Wish List for 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the way the Boston Bruins’ season has been going, whether there is a need for much of a discussion on this is up for debate.
So, Bruins’ fans writing their wish lists out, make sure to include these topics to the North Pole.
Related: Bruins’ Sweeney Will Have to Get Creative to Trade Smith or ReillyLatest News &amp; HighlightsThis is where Santa can step in.
Given the Bruins’ utter dominance of the league so far, this seems like the only way the team can be stopped.
The Bruins have been a buzzsaw from the start of the season, so Santa doesn’t need to make any overwhelming changes.
