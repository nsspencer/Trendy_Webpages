     Summary: Having won six in a row on the way to a 19-12 record and an ascension up the Eastern Conference ladder, the Nets continued rolling against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.
Kevin Durant and Co. led the way as Brooklyn seized a 91-51 advantage at halftime, which marked their most points scored in the first half in franchise history.
The Nets put up 91 points in the 1st half of their game against the Warriors tonight.
That is the 3rd-highest 1st half point total in NBA history.
But it was James Wiseman who led Golden State in scoring at halftime, logging 17 points on a perfect 7-for-7 shooting clip off the bench.

     Kevin Durant Calls For Nets vs. Knicks Christmas Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After playing the Boston Celtics in 2020 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021, the Brooklyn Nets were left off the biggest day of regular season hoops this year: Christmas Day.
"Knicks-Nets would've been a great Christmas Day game, especially with the way the Knicks have been playing and the way we’re playing right now.
I felt like that would’ve been the perfect matchup on Christmas," said Durant on which team he'd like to play on Christmas Day.
But in terms of playing the Nets in recent years, the Knicks haven't been able to do that in quite some time.
Although the Nets will be watching the five-game Christmas Day slate from home, the Knicks will host the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.

     Summary: The banged-up Warriors were without several top players Wednesday night at Barclays Center, but Kyrie Irving also was sidelined for the Nets with right-calf tightness.
The lone game he missed was the game the Nets won at Indiana on Dec. 10 despite sitting eight rotation regulars, also including Kevin Durant.
Kyrie Irving did not play in the Nets’ 143-113 win over the Warriors because of right-calf tightness.
Kevin Durant, who scored 23 points, shoots a fadeaway jumper during the Nets’ blowout win.
… Joe Harris moved back into the starting lineup to replace Irving and had 11 points in 19 minutes.

     Summary: Kevin Durant feels as though the Brooklyn Nets have unfairly garnered negative media attention this season.
Whether it was Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons or Steve Nash, there was plenty of headline-worthy news coming from the Nets.
Before the Nets took the floor Wednesday, Durant vocalized his latest grip with the media.
“I don’t see that standard for other teams,” Durant said, according to Yahoo Sports.
We gotta work for that.”Granted, New York — as Durant noted — is among the highest-intensity markets for sports.

     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readKevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets may be one of the most talented teams in the NBA right now, but they won’t be playing on Christmas day.
“I probably am responsible for us not playing on Christmas, with what went on this summer.
We play on the 26th, that’s close enough,” Durant said of the Christmas day snub, per Brian Mahoney of Associated Press.
It’s such a shame that the Nets won’t be playing on Christmas, though.
The Nets have quickly moved on from their horrific start to the campaign and have started playing to their full potential.

     Summary: CNN —The Brooklyn Nets put up a franchise record 91 points in the first half – the third highest total in NBA history – in Wednesday’s 143-113 blowout win over reigning champion the Golden State Warriors.

In total, nine of the 12 Nets players that took to the floor scored in double figures, another franchise record.
It was the second blowout loss in as many nights for the Warriors, who suffered a 38-point loss to the New York Knicks on Tuesday.
The Warriors, meanwhile, sit 11th in the West Conference standings and at 3-16 now have the worst road record in the NBA this season.
