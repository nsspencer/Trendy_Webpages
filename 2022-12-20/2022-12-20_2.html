It was a horrible time to be in the city but they gave us hope.
I was in a mixed race relationship, the political landscape and music and lyrics gave us a voice as young people.
I was 16 when I met him, he was 18, we were angry young punks.
We got to love music and we brought that all together and it's inspired so many generations of people."

     Summary: Terry Hall, singer with ska icons The Specials, dies at 63Enlarge this image toggle caption Yui Mok/AP Yui Mok/APLONDON — Musician Terry Hall, who helped create one of the defining sounds of post-punk Britain as lead singer of The Specials, has died.
With Hall's deadpan vocals setting the tone, The Specials captured the uneasy mood of the times in songs including "A Message to You, Rudy," "Rat Race" and "Too Much Too Young."
The Specials had seven U.K. Top 10 hits before Hall and fellow band members Neville Staple and Lynval Golding left in 1981 to form Fun Boy Three.
Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello also offered condolences, saying "Terry's voice was the perfect instrument for the true and necessary songs on 'The Specials.'
Terry often left the stage at the end of The Specials' life-affirming shows with three words... 'Love Love Love.'"

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Terry Hall, lead singer of British ska band The Specials, whose often politically charged hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s included "Gangsters" and "Ghost Town", has died aged 63, his former band members said.
"But the onstage demeanour of their lead singer was a reminder that they were in the serious business of challenging our perception of who we were in the late 1970s."
1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1980, and they repeated the feat in 1981 with "Ghost Town," a protest against urban decay under the government of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.
Hall left the band in 1981 to set up another group, Fun Boy Three, with two other former Specials members.
He rejoined The Specials -- also known as The Special AKA -- and performed with them as recently as this year.
