     Mat Ishbia agrees to Suns purchase for record $4 billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:26)Billionaire mortgage lender Mat Ishbia has agreed to purchase the majority stake of the Phoenix Suns and the WNBA's Mercury for a record price of $4 billion, Ishbia and current owner Robert Sarver announced on Tuesday.
"I am extremely excited to be the next Governor of the Phoenix Suns and Mercury," Mat Ishbia said in a statement.
The Suns' record sale marks a new day in the escalating valuations of NBA teams.
The Lakers had a minority share sold for a higher valuation than the Suns' $4 billion purchase, landing a $5 billion valuation.
But in recent weeks, team employees told ESPN that groups of prospective bidders were seen touring team facilities.
