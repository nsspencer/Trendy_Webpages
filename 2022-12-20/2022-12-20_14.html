     Carlo Nets First Goal Of Season For Boston Bruins

     Summary: The Boston Bruins have not lacked for goal-scoring this season while ranking first or second pretty much all season among the league’s top offensive groups.
The Black and Gold got two goals from Bruins D-men in the win, including stay-at-home defenseman Brandon Carlo’s first goal of the season making him the 21st different player to score a goal for the Boston Bruins this season.
Brandon Carlo – offensive defenseman.
Carlo's first goal of the season gives Boston a 2-0 lead.
The lamp-lighter also gives every regular in a Boston Bruins uniform a goal this season as they continue to enjoy lineup depth like they haven’t before in previous recent seasons.

     Bergeron leads Bruins past Panthers 7-3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Bruins coach Jim Montgomery watched his team let a four-goal lead turn into a 4-3 edge and wondered whether he needed to call a timeout to settle things down.
It’s not like I can call timeout and say anything better,” he said after Boston recovered from some mid-game sloppiness and beat the Florida Panthers 7-3 on Monday night.
Bergeron also had a pair of assists, and Linus Ullmark stopped 36 shots to earn his 10th consecutive win.
It stayed that way until Bergeron took a long lead pass from Connor Clifton and beat Spencer Knight with 11 minutes to play.
The Bruins captain added another goal about three minutes later, backhanding in a rebound from the slot.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I don't think our game was a whole lot different until it got to 6-3," Panthers head coach Paul Maurice said.
After clawing their way back to within one goal, the Florida Panthers simply couldn't recover from their early deficit in an eventual 7-3 loss to the Boston Bruins at TD Garden on Monday.
Stepping up during a recent string of injuries and ailments for the Panthers, Reinhart finished second on the team with a 66.67 CF% at 5-on-5 against the Bruins, per NaturalStatTrick.com.

     Bruins-Panthers takeaways: What we learned from Boston’s 7-goal night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins Bruins-Panthers takeaways: What we learned from Boston’s 7-goal night Jim Montgomery's squad withstood a frantic stretch from the Panthers to improve to 17-0-2 at home.
Bruce Cassidy first coined the phrase “Cliffy Hockey” in Clifton’s rookie year to describe his aggressive, energetic and sometimes reckless play.
Like Carlo, he’s showcased some assertiveness in the offensive end to coincide with his energetic skillset.
“I do not like the term ‘Cliffy Hockey’ — not from [the media] using it, but from within our room,” Montgomery said.
“The ‘Cliffy Hockey’ that I see knows very much how the team is playing and is always supporting the structure of the play.
