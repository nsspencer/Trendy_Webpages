     'Bomb cyclone': What to know about this kind of monster storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grafton Marshall Smith/Getty Images(NEW YORK) — As a major winter storm moves across the U.S. this week, it could undergo bombogenesis, or “bomb out,” in the Midwest and the Plains.
Bombogenesis — or a “bomb cyclone” — occurs when the pressure of a storm drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours.
A millibar is a measure of atmospheric pressure inside a storm, telling meteorologists how strong or weak the storm system is.
The difference between the two air masses helps to strengthen the storm system, creating what’s known as bombogenesis.
On the East Coast, it often happens when a storm system moves over or near the relatively warm Gulf Stream, adding moisture into the system.

     What Is a Bomb Cyclone?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bombogenesis, the calling card of a bomb cyclone, happens when the barometric pressure at the center of the cyclone pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours (a millibar is a unit of measurement for atmospheric pressure).
Some of these storms can intensify much more quickly, though, dropping 60 millibars in 24 hours.
The result, as you can imagine, is impressive.
These storms can be as intense as a regular-season hurricane, but even more ferocious as they can drop immense amounts of snow as well as 50 mile per hour (80.5 kilometer per hour) winds, causing flooding, beach erosion, loss of power and storm surges.

     Massive ‘bomb cyclone’ expected to put damper on holiday travel across US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A massive winter storm is expected to put a damper on holiday travel across the United States.
This winter storm is also expected to impact more than 110 million Americans who are expected to travel, whether its on the road or in the air.
The Washington Post said that the strong winds could lead to power outages as well.
In preparation for that, different airlines have been working on plans for waivers, including United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
The upcoming storm is expected to strengthen explosively and make it possibly qualify as a “bomb cyclone,” which is an intense kind of mid-latitude storm.

     Bomb Cyclone Photos: What to Expect From Freezing Weather Forecast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winter Storm Elliott is forecast to bring blizzard conditions to much of the Midwest and Great Lakes this week, with the potential to develop into a powerful "bomb cyclone."
A similar storm hit the northeastern states in January, but it is unusual for this extreme weather to venture so far south.
The storm will reach its peak on Friday with high winds and heavy snow across the Midwest and parts of the East Coast.
Subzero temperatures have been forecast for the Dakotas and Minnesota, and many states are due to see the coldest Christmas in decades.
"To stay safe, maintain access to weather information and digest that information on a regular basis, as weather forecasts change with time," Mullens said.

     Summary: Zoom in: Blizzard conditions are forecast between early Thursday and Friday night from Kansas City, Missouri, to the Michigan border with Canada.
The storm is likely to qualify as a "bomb cyclone" since it will intensify at a rapid rate, through a process known as bombogenesis.
However, it could pose a danger to energy infrastructure that is still vulnerable to extreme cold and high winds.
In the Plains, the cold may rival anything experienced in the past three decades.

Still, some forecasters are predicting the storm could become a bomb cyclone before it enters the Northeast and New England.
So what, exactly, is a bomb cyclone?

     Fierce ‘bomb cyclone’ to disrupt holiday travel, unleash Arctic outbreak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travel could “become extremely dangerous and life-threatening, particularly in light of the bitterly cold temperatures during the height of the storm,” wrote the National Weather Service office serving Chicago.
“Dangerously cold wind chills, as low as 50 below zero” are expected in the Dakotas, wrote the National Weather Service.
Temperatures could drop as much as — or even more than — 40 degrees, plummeting to levels rivaling the cold air outbreak of 1989.
Particularly impressive with this episode is how far south the cold air will blast.
That will result in “Arctic sea smoke” over the Gulf, or a rare type of fog resembling steam that forms when cold air blows over warmer water.
