     Terry Hall, singer with ska band The Specials, dies aged 63
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Terry Hall, lead singer of British ska band The Specials, whose often politically charged hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s included “Gangsters” and “Ghost Town”, has died aged 63, his former band members said.
Hall joined the band in 1977 in his central English home city of Coventry.
1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1980, and they repeated the feat in 1981 with “Ghost Town,” a protest against urban decay under the government of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.
Hall left the band in 1981 to set up another group, Fun Boy Three, with two other former Specials members.
He rejoined The Specials — also known as The Special AKA — and performed with them as recently as this year.

     Summary: Terry Hall, singer with ska icons The Specials, dies at 63Enlarge this image toggle caption Yui Mok/AP Yui Mok/APLONDON — Musician Terry Hall, who helped create one of the defining sounds of post-punk Britain as lead singer of The Specials, has died.
With Hall's deadpan vocals setting the tone, The Specials captured the uneasy mood of the times in songs including "A Message to You, Rudy," "Rat Race" and "Too Much Too Young."
The Specials had seven U.K. Top 10 hits before Hall and fellow band members Neville Staple and Lynval Golding left in 1981 to form Fun Boy Three.
Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello also offered condolences, saying "Terry's voice was the perfect instrument for the true and necessary songs on 'The Specials.'
Terry often left the stage at the end of The Specials' life-affirming shows with three words... 'Love Love Love.'"

     Summary: The Specials – Gangsters (1979)The Specials: Gangsters – videoThe astonishing split single (with an embryonic version of the Selecter on the B-side) that introduced the Specials and the 2 Tone label to the nation.
Hall sang two vocals – one bored and deadpan, one combative – which were then mixed to startling effect.

The Specials – Ghost Town (1981)The Specials: Ghost Town – videoThe Specials’ era-defining No 1 single brilliantly captured 1981 Britain, which wasn’t that dissimilar to today.
From the delicately yearning verses to the triumphantly celebratory chorus (“When you’re near / It all makes sense”) it touches all the places a perfect pop song should.

     Terry Hall, frontman for English ska-punk band the Specials, dies at 63
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Terry Hall, who fronted the groundbreaking British ska-punk band the Specials and went on to a noteworthy career in his other bands and as a songwriter and collaborator, has died.
The Specials in the late 1970s, from left, Neville Staples, Terry Hall and Horace Gentleman.
There were, inevitably, Specials reunions, including a world tour and two albums, but Hall sat them out.
They followed it with “Protest Songs 1924-2012,” a wide-ranging covers album with songs by Leonard Cohen, Frank Zappa and Bob Marley.
The Specials had planned to record a new album in Jamaica and tour, but COVID lockdown scotched their activity.
