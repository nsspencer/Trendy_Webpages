     San Diego Padres' 2023 Projected Starting Lineup After Signing Matt Carpenter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Diego Padres added another bat to their lineup Tuesday, agreeing to terms with free agent infielder Matt Carpenter on a one-year contract.
After signing Carpenter, here's a look at the Padres' projected starting lineup for the 2023 Major League Baseball season.
The San Diego Padres added another bat to their lineup Tuesday, agreeing to terms with free agent infielder Matt Carpenter on a one-year contract.
The Padres continued to add this offseason, agreeing to terms on an 11-year, $280 million contract with free agent shortstop Xander Bogaerts two weeks ago.
Carpenter could be the club's regular designated hitter, but the Padres likely aren't finished adding to their club, this winter.

     Summary: Free agent Matt Carpenter has agreed to a one-year deal with the Padres that includes a player option for 2024, major-league sources confirmed to The Athletic on Tuesday.
Prior to signing with the Yankees in May, Carpenter played 11 seasons with the Cardinals from 2011 to 2021.
Scouting reportAfter batting .176 over his last two seasons with the Cardinals, Carpenter signed a minor-league deal with the Texas Rangers in March.

Defensively, the 37-year-old will give San Diego some versatility, although he could see significant time as a designated hitter.

     Summary: Perhaps the rejuvenated Matt Carpenter can bring balance from the left side of the plate.
Advertisement“No disrespect to the beautiful San Diego weather,” Carpenter said via a video conference on Tuesday afternoon, “but I didn’t come here for the weather.
Carpenter did return for the playoffs but went 1-for-12 while appearing in six games (two starts).
A three-time All-Star, Carpenter hit .262/.368/.449 over parts of 11 seasons in St. Louis.
Like he did after catching on with the Yankees, Carpenter figures to move around a new-look Padres lineup that added Xander Bogaerts earlier this month and will get Fernando Tatis Jr. back from his suspension in late April.

     Padres Sign Matt Carpenter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12:52pm: The Padres added some punch to their lineup Tuesday, reportedly agreeing to a two-year, $12MM contract with veteran infielder/outfielder Matt Carpenter.
Carpenter, a client of SSG Baseball, can opt out of the contract after the 2023 season by declining a 2024 player option.
The contract pays Carpenter a $3MM signing bonus and $3.5MM salary for the 2023 campaign, and he’ll have to decide on a $5.5MM player option next winter.
With the Padres, Carpenter becomes the favorite for DH work, though the Yankees played him at both corner infield slots and in both corner outfield positions in 2022.
AJ Cassavell of MLB.com first reported the two sides had agreed to a deal with a 2024 player option.

     Friars find flexibility, lefty bat in deal with Carpenter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: **A three-time All-Star, Carpenter experienced quite a resurgence in the Bronx before he broke his foot in early August.
“I went on a journey last offseason to kind of redefine myself and refine my swing,” Carpenter said.
Carpenter has developed a reputation for being one of the toughest at-bats in the sport, posting a .369 career on-base percentage.
Whether he’s starting against righties or coming off the bench against left-handers, the Padres envision Carpenter as a useful hitter in just about any capacity.
Without another addition, perhaps Carpenter platoons at DH with one of the Padres’ righty-hitting bench pieces -- say, Luis Campusano or Brandon Dixon.
