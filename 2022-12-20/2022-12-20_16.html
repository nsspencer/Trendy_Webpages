     Bulls respond to rout, locker room dustup with win over Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The only yells in the Chicago Bulls' locker room on Tuesday night were happy ones.
The Bulls looked nothing like the team that lost 150-126 to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday, a rout that saw players confronting each other in the locker room at halftime.
Either try harder and fight harder, or be frustrated and have the same thing continue on.
The Bulls chose to try harder.
Chicago responded with its 30-7 run, highlighted by 14 consecutive points in one stretch, and Patrick Williams' 3-pointer put the Bulls up 82-67.

     Source: Cause of Bulls’ locker-room dispute was Zach LaVine’s defense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was more than a glimpse of that doggedness Tuesday as he defended the hell out of Zach LaVine.
The constant defensive breakdowns during the previous five games and in that first half against the undermanned T-wolves.
At one point in late November, LaVine’s defensive rating was 103.4, which ranked him 79th among starters — as high as LaVine had ever been ranked.
“There’s situations where guys are getting blown by off the dribble; there’s not communication on the back side,’’ Donovan said.
‘‘I don’t think you can sit there and point at every defensive breakdown and say, ‘Hey, that’s on Zach’ or ‘It’s all DeMar.’ No, it’s all of us.

     Bulls close dramatic day by beating Heat, snapping losing streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One win over a shorthanded Miami Heat squad will not cure all that ails the Chicago Bulls.
All of which is to say: This is not a game the Bulls could afford to lose.
They held the Heat to 21 points, 8-for-22 shooting and four turnovers in the first, good enough to carry a 10-point lead into the second.
The Heat won the opening 6:25 of the second quarter 17-4, holding the Bulls scoreless for the first 3:58 of the period and scoring eight points off four turnovers.
With a few exceptions in the second quarter, Vučević's teammates were clearly focused getting him the ball when faced with a post mismatch, which presented often against the Heat's switch-heavy scheme.

     Summary: The Chicago Bulls are in freefall.
Their offense ranks 22nd, despite DeMar DeRozan being even more efficient than he was last year and Zach LaVine's percentages rising in December.
"I think everybody goes through ups and downs, just like every team does," LaVine told The Athletic on Tuesday when asked about the matter.
For Donovan, the challenge of optimizing DeRozan and LaVine together through a balance of execution, accountability and cooperation looms large.
Chicago acquired DeRozan in a sign-and-trade that August, shortly after signing Alex Caruso and nabbing Ball in another sign-and-trade.
