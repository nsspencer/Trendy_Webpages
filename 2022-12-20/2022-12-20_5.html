     Giants postpone Carlos Correa introductory press conference at Oracle Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been three years since the last press conference for a new arrival at Oracle Park, but the wait for the next one will be a little bit longer.
Shortstop Carlos Correa's scheduled 11 a.m. press conference was postponed at 8:15 a.m. Tuesday morning, along with scheduled radio and TV appearances.
The Associated Press' Ronald Blum reported Tuesday afternoon, citing a source, that the Giants postponed the press conference after a "medical issue" was flagged during that physical.
The Giants have not held a press conference at Oracle Park since Gabe Kapler was introduced in 2019.
They did hold a press conference last November when Buster Posey retired.

     Snag In Carlos Correa's Physical Could Put Him Back On Free-Agent Market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The current free-agent period has been littered with rumors, big contracts, false reporting on some of the biggest stars in the game and more.
Correa, a bonafide superstar, signed a massive 13-year, $350 million contract, pending a physical.
Said physical appears to be the issue that could ultimately result in the 28-year-old heading back into free agency.
At this juncture, it would be highly unlikely for the Boston Red Sox to enter the mix, but it would make a lot of sense.
Still, the Red Sox fanbase is up in arms after the departure of Xander Bogaerts.

     Giants Concerned With Medical Issue in Carlos Correa’s Physical, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Superstar shortstop Carlos Correa was supposed to be introduced as a franchise cornerstone by the Giants at a news conference Tuesday morning.
It’s unknown at this time whether the potential medical issue could derail the massive deal between Correa and the club.
The agreement is subject to a successful physical exam, a source told the AP.
Health and availability have been issues in Correa’s MLB career to this point.
Correa, a two-time All-Star, played his first seven MLB seasons with the Astros before joining the Twins in 2022.

     Mets swoop in to sign Carlos Correa to a 12-year, $315 million deal, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets and Correa have reached a 12-year, $315 million deal late Tuesday night, according to the New York Post's Jon Heyman.
But that press conference was postponed because of a medical concern that came to light during the physical, the Associated Press reported.
Neither happened and Correa opted out of his contract after the season and is poised to cash in this offseason.
His deal with the Giants would have been the largest ever for a shortstop and the largest ever for a former No.
Overall, Correa's $350 million pact would have been the fourth-largest deal for an MLB player, trailing only Mike Trout's $426.5 million extension with the Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million extension with the Dodgers, and Aaron Judge's recent $360 million deal with the Yankees.

The Giants postponed Correa's introductory press conference on Tuesday due to medical concerns, according to a report by Ronald Blum of the Associated Press.
Will the SF Giants deal with Carlos Correa fall through?
The Giants remain the favorites to sign Carlos Correa.
However, if the deal falls through, and Correa signs elsewhere, it will transform the 2022-23 offseason into one of the worst in SF Giants franchise history.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants have had a lot of strange and unexpected days in recent years.
The Giants had never officially announced the Correa contract, which is a common practice among sports organizations.
After a completely unforgettable season, and a largely unmemorable team, the Giants needed a jolt.
That hunt seemed fulfilled a week ago, when it was reported that Correa had agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal.
Correa’s deal came after several other stars, some represented by Boras, had rejected the Giants, for whatever reason.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa intro, awaiting test results after issue in physical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a Tuesday morning news conference to introduce $350 million shortstop Carlos Correa, and a source told The Chronicle, without elaboration, that the team and Correa are awaiting test results.
The Giants last week agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal with Correa, a two-time All-Star and 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, with the massive contract pending a successful physical.
As an example, former Giants outfielder Angel Pagan reportedly had an agreement with Baltimore fall through in 2017 because of an issue with his physical.
Correa, 28, has played in 150 games just once in eight MLB seasons and 130 games three times.
The deal would be the largest given by the Giants, outpacing Buster Posey’s nine-year, $167 million contract.

     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a news conference Tuesday to introduce Carlos Correa after a medical concern arose during the All-Star shortstop's physical, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.
Correa and the Giants agreed on Dec. 13 to the massive deal, subject to a successful physical, according to one of the people.
Correa, the 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, has a .279 career average with 155 homers and 553 RBIs in eight big league seasons.
Correa, 28, was a free agent one year ago after leaving the Houston Astros, and he reached a $105.3 million deal with the Minnesota Twins.
The Giants went 81-81 last season, a year after winning a franchise-record 107 games and the NL West.

     Summary: The Giants mysteriously postponed their introductory press conference for Carlos Correa on Tuesday about three hours before it was scheduled to begin at Oracle Park.
Ronald Blum of The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing sources, that the press conference was delayed due to an issue discovered during his physical.
"One person confirmed that Tuesday’s conference to welcome Correa was put on hold because the sides were awaiting the results of testing," Blum wrote.
"A second person said that a medical issue was flagged during Correa’s physical."
What happens next is unclear, but Giants fans are hoping everything eventually clears up and Correa receives his introductory press conference at Oracle Park soon.

     Summary: The Giants and Carlos Correa agreed to terms last week on a 13-year, $350MM framework for a deal.
That structure was pending a physical and Correa had yet to officially sign the contract.
The club was going to introduce him today but the scheduled news conference was postponed due to a medical concern, reports Ronald Blum of the Associated Press.
However, the fact that they are at least delaying the official stamp is a situation that will be worth monitoring.
Again, it’s worth repeating that we don’t know what the current issue is or the severity of it, but Slusser reports that is not a back problem.
