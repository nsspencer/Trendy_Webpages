     Summary: After a flawless five-game homestand, the Memphis Grizzlies had a puzzling beginning to their road trip.
The Grizzlies' seven-game win streak was snapped against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but they have a chance to get back on track against the Denver Nuggets.
In his last game, Jokic put up the first stat line of at least 40 points, 25 rebounds and 10 assists since Wilt Chamberlain in 1968.
Memphis (19-10) will be without Desmond Bane and Danny Green.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donovan was asked if he felt LaVine was currently unable to defend at a high level because of the knee or because he simply won’t, and that’s when the coach did his best to get into a stance and defend his star.
“Some of the things he has referenced to you guys is he’s trying to get his legs underneath him, so I think that has an impact on it,’’ Donovan said of what he was seeing on film from LaVine defensively.
“But I think clearly our entire team the last five games, everybody is capable of being better defensively.
Not only Zach, but Vooch [Nikola Vucevic], DeMar [DeRozan], Alex [Caruso], everybody.
We’ve got to be better collectively, and as a coaching staff we’ve got to help them as well.’’
