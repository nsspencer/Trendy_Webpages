     Jalen Brunson's All-Star Credentials Praised by Fans as Knicks Cruise Past Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesAfter signing with the New York Knicks this past offseason, point guard Jalen Brunson didn't take long to prove himself to be an All-Star-caliber player.
Brunson showcased his credentials once again by leading the Knicks to a 132-94 blowout victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
After spending the first four years of his career with the Dallas Mavericks playing behind star point guard Luka Dončić, the Villanova product chose to join a situation where he'd be the unquestioned floor general.
If he keeps playing like this, New York will have a strong chance at returning to the postseason this year.
The Knicks will look to keep the momentum going and extend their win streak when they welcome the Toronto Raptors (13-18) to town on Wednesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prior to the team’s hot streak, someone within the Knicks organization reached out to the Raptors regarding a potential deal for OG Anunoby, Ian Begley of SNY TV reports.
That would have signaled a major roster shakeup.
Anunoby is averaging 18.7, 5.8 rebounds and 2.4 steals per game.
The Knicks would have needed to surrender serious assets to acquire Anunoby, who has two years left on his four-year, $72MM contract.

     NBA on TNT Tuesday Preview: Knicks take on the Steph Curry-less Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks take on the Golden State Warriors on TNT Tuesday night and I’m not sure I want any part of this game from a betting perspective.
I already got burned last week by the Warriors when they got blown out by the Bucks.
But, alas, I’m thinking of giving the Warriors another shot, despite having three (major) factors working against them.
Warriors (+6) at Knicks (7:30 p.m. est)Warriors +190 ML; O/U 221.5First of all, those three major factors?
I’ll take the Knicks at -6 and I’ll also go with the UNDER (221.5) because the Knicks aren’t letting anyone score right now and the Warriors without Curry aren’t doing much scoring.

     NBA rumors: Knicks "reached out" for OG Anunoby trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jedd Pagaduan · 2 min readThe New York Knicks are currently in the midst of a remarkable turnaround.
The Knicks may be rolling at the moment, but it was only two weeks ago when their front office was considering a shakeup involving Toronto Raptors forward OG Anunoby.
Per Ian Begley of SNY, the Knicks “reached out” to the Raptors to inquire about a potential Anunoby blockbuster trade.
However, now that New York has found a rhythm, it doesn’t seem like the Knicks are urgently pursuing a trade of such magnitude.
On the season, OG Anunoby is staking his claim as one of the league’s best 3 and D wings.

“The entire league wants OG Anunoby.

     Summary: Most importantly for bettors, the Knicks have covered the spread in all seven games of their current winning streak.
Julius Randle has averaged 26.7-points per game over the seven game winning streak.
Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks have won seven straight games.
The Penguins are coming off a loss to the Carolina Panthers, but before that, they had a seven game winning streak of their own.
Obviously, it's a rematch of the playoff series from last year where the Lightning eliminated the Leafs in seven games.
