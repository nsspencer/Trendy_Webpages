     Carlos Correa, Mets lock in 12-year, $315 million deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Salao · 2 min readThe New York Mets continue to break the bank to build on their roster, this time securing top-shelf free-agent shortstop Carlos Correa.
The news was first reported by MLB insider Jon Heyman, indicating that it will be a deal worth $315 million over a dozen seasons.
Breaking: Carlos Correa and the Mets have a deal.
That’s after signing Quintana and Verlander to two-year deals totaling over $100 million as well as their eight-year, $162 million pact with center fielder Brandon Nimmo.
But it’s his prime seasons as a 28-year-old in the first half of the deal the Mets are ultimately paying for.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa introductory press conference at Oracle Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been three years since the last press conference for a new arrival at Oracle Park, but the wait for the next one will be a little bit longer.
Shortstop Carlos Correa's scheduled 11 a.m. press conference was postponed at 8:15 a.m. Tuesday morning, along with scheduled radio and TV appearances.
The Associated Press' Ronald Blum reported Tuesday afternoon, citing a source, that the Giants postponed the press conference after a "medical issue" was flagged during that physical.
The Giants have not held a press conference at Oracle Park since Gabe Kapler was introduced in 2019.
They did hold a press conference last November when Buster Posey retired.

     Summary: Report: Giants delay Correa presser due to medical issue originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaThe Giants mysteriously postponed their introductory press conference for Carlos Correa on Tuesday about three hours before it was scheduled to begin at Oracle Park.
Ronald Blum of The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing sources, that the press conference was delayed due to an issue discovered during his physical.
"One person confirmed that Tuesday’s conference to welcome Correa was put on hold because the sides were awaiting the results of testing," Blum wrote.
"A second person said that a medical issue was flagged during Correa’s physical."
What happens next is unclear, but Giants fans are hoping everything eventually clears up and Correa receives his introductory press conference at Oracle Park soon.

     Snag In Carlos Correa's Physical Could Put Him Back On Free-Agent Market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The current free-agent period has been littered with rumors, big contracts, false reporting on some of the biggest stars in the game and more.
Correa, a bonafide superstar, signed a massive 13-year, $350 million contract, pending a physical.
Said physical appears to be the issue that could ultimately result in the 28-year-old heading back into free agency.
At this juncture, it would be highly unlikely for the Boston Red Sox to enter the mix, but it would make a lot of sense.
Still, the Red Sox fanbase is up in arms after the departure of Xander Bogaerts.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa intro for medical concern
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a news conference Tuesday to introduce Carlos Correa after a medical concern arose during the All-Star shortstop's physical, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.
Correa and the Giants agreed on Dec. 13 to the massive deal, subject to a successful physical, according to one of the people.
Correa, the 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, has a .279 career average with 155 homers and 553 RBIs in eight big league seasons.
Correa, 28, was a free agent one year ago after leaving the Houston Astros, and he reached a $105.3 million deal with the Minnesota Twins.
The Giants went 81-81 last season, a year after winning a franchise-record 107 games and the NL West.

     Giants postpone Carlos Correa intro, awaiting test results after issue in physical
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants postponed a Tuesday morning news conference to introduce $350 million shortstop Carlos Correa, and a source told The Chronicle, without elaboration, that the team and Correa are awaiting test results.
The Giants last week agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal with Correa, a two-time All-Star and 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, with the massive contract pending a successful physical.
As an example, former Giants outfielder Angel Pagan reportedly had an agreement with Baltimore fall through in 2017 because of an issue with his physical.
Correa, 28, has played in 150 games just once in eight MLB seasons and 130 games three times.
The deal would be the largest given by the Giants, outpacing Buster Posey’s nine-year, $167 million contract.

     Summary: The San Francisco Giants have had a lot of strange and unexpected days in recent years.
The Giants had never officially announced the Correa contract, which is a common practice among sports organizations.
After a completely unforgettable season, and a largely unmemorable team, the Giants needed a jolt.
That hunt seemed fulfilled a week ago, when it was reported that Correa had agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal.
Correa’s deal came after several other stars, some represented by Boras, had rejected the Giants, for whatever reason.

     Summary: The Giants had not said anything publicly about the agreement with Correa, which was still not official pending the physical.
The plan for the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday was to introduce the freshly acquired Carlos Correa, the ballclub’s biggest free agent addition in decades, but that didn't happen.
For reasons that have yet to be made clear, the team postponed Correa’s introductory press conference just hours before it was supposed to start.
Here's the whole email about the Carlos Correa press conference being postponed,” with a screenshot of a terse one-sentence email from the Giants sharing the postponement.
Shortly after the press conference was officially postponed, Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reported an issue regarding test results and cited an unnamed inside source.
