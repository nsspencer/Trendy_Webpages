     Jalen Brunson's All-Star Credentials Praised by Fans as Knicks Cruise Past Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesAfter signing with the New York Knicks this past offseason, point guard Jalen Brunson didn't take long to prove himself to be an All-Star-caliber player.
Brunson showcased his credentials once again by leading the Knicks to a 132-94 blowout victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
After spending the first four years of his career with the Dallas Mavericks playing behind star point guard Luka Dončić, the Villanova product chose to join a situation where he'd be the unquestioned floor general.
If he keeps playing like this, New York will have a strong chance at returning to the postseason this year.
The Knicks will look to keep the momentum going and extend their win streak when they welcome the Toronto Raptors (13-18) to town on Wednesday.

     Summary: This is what it looks like when you’re playing basketball at a level worthy of a packed city room.
“I love our team, I love the way they practice, the way we prepare,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after watching the Knicks obliterate the Warriors, 132-94, adding an eighth-straight victory to their slowly growing pile.
The Knicks are playing the Raptors on Wednesday, and there was no need to make anyone work any more than he had to.
“First time for everything.”Tom Thibodeau Robert SaboBut, then, these aren’t the standard-issue Knicks.
But the bigger break may be the Knicks’ own health, their ability to answer the bell night after night.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors committed 20 turnovers, off which the Knicks scored 36 freebie points.
Awaiting the spectacleThe Warriors are waiting for Curry, who has missed the last three games with a left shoulder injury.
Soft at the arcForgive the Golden State scouting report if it did not emphasize 3-point defense against the Knicks.
The Warriors adjusted their defense midway through the second quarter, mixing in more zone along with their usual chasing and switching.
The Warriors probably didn’t expect such a flurry of triples from a team that usually shoots blanks, but it was a major difference-maker.
