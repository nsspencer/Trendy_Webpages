     Jon Scheyer not using Duke illness outbreak as excuse for Blue Devils' upset loss to Wake Forest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shorthanded Duke team lost its first true road game of the season Tuesday, with the No.
14 Blue Devils falling at Wake Forest, 81-70.
Duke was without five-star freshmen Dereck Lively II and Dariq Whitehead, both of whom started the Blue Devils’ previous game, but missed Tuesday’s contest with a non-COVID illness.
Duke coach Jon Scheyer declined to use Duke's illness as an excuse when asked about the Blue Devils' health after the game.
Here is what Scheyer and Duke forward Ryan Young said after the Blue Devils' loss at Wake Forest:

     Summary: On the road in Winston-Salem, N.C., for its first ACC road game of the season, No.
With 20 minutes to play at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Blue Devils trail 39-30.
Lively started nine games in a row before Tuesday, while Whitehead excelled in his first start last time out for the Blue Devils.
Work to do In their first game in 10 days, the Blue Devils have looked far from their best against the Demon Deacons.
Thanks to Grandison’s play, Duke has a fighting chance on the road in the second half, even without its best basketball or full roster.

     Duke Stumbles On The Road vs. Wake Forest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke’s trip to Wake Forest was mostly an exercise in frustration as Wake Forest won 81-70.
Tryese Proctor’s steal to start the second half sort of encapsulated the night: he made a brilliant pick but blew the layup.
Missing Lively and Whitehead were not why Duke lost.
Part of this may be the natural result of not practicing a lot over the break, but in fairness, that’s probably true for Wake Forest as well.
Congratulations to Wake Forest.
