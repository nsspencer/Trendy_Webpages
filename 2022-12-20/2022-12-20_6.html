     Knicks beat Warriors at MSG for first time since 2013, extend winning streak to league-best eight games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Knicks' eight-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the league, and tied for the second-longest this season behind the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks, who each won nine in a row at various points.
This is also the longest winning streak for the Knicks since they won nine consecutive games in 2021, and tied for the eighth-longest streak in franchise history.
They did so by forcing 19 turnovers and holding the Warriors under 100 points for only the second time this season.
His effort on the perimeter is one of many reasons that the Knicks have been nearly impossible to score against during this streak.
During the Knicks' winning streak, Grimes is averaging 13.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and two assists, while shooting 50.8 percent from the field and 45.7 percent from 3-point land.

The Knicks are playing the Raptors on Wednesday, and there was no need to make anyone work any more than he had to.
“First time for everything.”Tom Thibodeau Robert SaboBut, then, these aren’t the standard-issue Knicks.
But the bigger break may be the Knicks’ own health, their ability to answer the bell night after night.
