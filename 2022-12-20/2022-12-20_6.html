Even the cast were shocked by the number of cliffhangers in the new series when they first read the scripts.
‚ÄúBefore it was only Emily‚Äôs chaos,‚Äù says Bravo.
And it‚Äôs a big soup of chaos and drama.‚ÄùSeason one arrived in October 2020, followed by a second last December.

     Summary: [Warning: The following contains spoilers from Emily in Paris Season 3.
Emily In Paris fans went on a rollercoaster in Season 3 as Emily (Lily Collins) finally made the decision to commit to a romantic life in Paris and settle down with Alfie (Lucien Laviscount).
It looked like Emily had finally figured out what she wanted until a sudden engagement between Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) and Camille (Camille Razat) sent everything spinning out of control.
Given time, I don't think the wedding would have happened, but it became circumstantial.

     Summary: Emily in Paris tries to answer this in Episode 4, which is filled with silly social media montages, enough Kir Royales to have us feeling tipsy just watching and some very PG ferris wheel sex.
We open with Emily soaking up that fun-employment life after quitting Savoir for more time in Paris, and she‚Äôs filling her days with Instagram Lives, unfortunately regressing to a level of cringe we haven‚Äôt seen since Season 1.
After the meeting wraps, Luc reveals that Emily actually shared it with him, and that‚Äôs how he and Julien came up with it.
The next day, Sylvie meets with Camille and her family, who are shocked that Emily is still in Paris and spending her days doing Segway tours.
Back home at her apartment after work, Sylvie is sitting on the couch getting a little too cozy with her husband, whom she‚Äôs no longer romantically involved with‚Ä¶unless?

     Summary: ‚ÄúYou come to Paris, you walk into my office and you don‚Äôt even bother to learn the language,‚Äù Sylvie, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, says to Emily.
Playing Sylvie really made me realize that I had some aspects of my personality I didn‚Äôt know I had, and it gave me much more confidence.
It‚Äôs the sort of character Leroy-Beaulieu now says she isn‚Äôt interested in playing anymore.
Though she was born in Paris, Leroy-Beaulieu was mostly raised in Rome, until she moved back to Paris as a teenager (with her mother and brother) after her parents‚Äô divorce.
‚ÄúI realized really, really young how the other kids were acting weird with me,‚Äù she says.
