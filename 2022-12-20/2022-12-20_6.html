     Summary: Terry Hall, singer with ska icons The Specials, dies at 63Enlarge this image toggle caption Yui Mok/AP Yui Mok/APLONDON — Musician Terry Hall, who helped create one of the defining sounds of post-punk Britain as lead singer of The Specials, has died.
With Hall's deadpan vocals setting the tone, The Specials captured the uneasy mood of the times in songs including "A Message to You, Rudy," "Rat Race" and "Too Much Too Young."
The Specials had seven U.K. Top 10 hits before Hall and fellow band members Neville Staple and Lynval Golding left in 1981 to form Fun Boy Three.
Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello also offered condolences, saying "Terry's voice was the perfect instrument for the true and necessary songs on 'The Specials.'
Terry often left the stage at the end of The Specials' life-affirming shows with three words... 'Love Love Love.'"

     Summary: Listen Gift Article ShareLONDON — Terry Hall, the British musician and lead singer in the late 1970s ska-punk band the Specials, has died at 63, the group announced Monday.
Why do we need that reward?” Mr. Hall recalled in the 2021 interview.
Mr. Hall shared frontman duties with Neville Staple, a Jamaican-born Black performer who specialized in toasting, a style of rapping.
In a 2021 interview with the Financial Times, he described how the band’s music gigs were targeted by racist hooligans.
“It got really extreme,” Mr. Hall recalled.

     Summary: The Specials – Gangsters (1979)The Specials: Gangsters – videoThe astonishing split single (with an embryonic version of the Selecter on the B-side) that introduced the Specials and the 2 Tone label to the nation.
Hall sang two vocals – one bored and deadpan, one combative – which were then mixed to startling effect.
The Specials – Do Nothing (1980)The Specials: Do Nothing – videoIn their first two years as recording artists, the Specials enjoyed seven Top 10 singles and two gold albums.
The Specials – Ghost Town (1981)The Specials: Ghost Town – videoThe Specials’ era-defining No 1 single brilliantly captured 1981 Britain, which wasn’t that dissimilar to today.
From the delicately yearning verses to the triumphantly celebratory chorus (“When you’re near / It all makes sense”) it touches all the places a perfect pop song should.

The Specials in the late 1970s, from left, Neville Staples, Terry Hall and Horace Gentleman.
There were, inevitably, Specials reunions, including a world tour and two albums, but Hall sat them out.
They followed it with “Protest Songs 1924-2012,” a wide-ranging covers album with songs by Leonard Cohen, Frank Zappa and Bob Marley.
The Specials had planned to record a new album in Jamaica and tour, but COVID lockdown scotched their activity.
