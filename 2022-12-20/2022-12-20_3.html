     Summary: Franco Harris, a Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame running back, dies at 72Enlarge this image toggle caption Harry Cabluck/AP Harry Cabluck/APPITTSBURGH — Franco Harris, the Hall of Fame running back whose heads-up thinking authored "The Immaculate Reception," considered the most iconic play in NFL history, has died.
"When (Noll) drafted Franco Harris, he gave the offense heart, he gave it discipline, he gave it desire, he gave it the ability to win a championship in Pittsburgh," Steelers Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann said of his frequent roommate on team road trips.
Eight times he topped 1,000 yards rushing in a season, including five times while playing a 14-game schedule.
He piled up another 1,556 yards rushing and 16 rushing touchdowns in the playoffs, both second all-time behind Smith.
Harris signed with Seattle, running for just 170 yards in eight games before being released in midseason.
