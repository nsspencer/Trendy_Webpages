     Mat Ishbia agrees to Suns purchase for record $4 billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:26)Billionaire mortgage lender Mat Ishbia has agreed to purchase the majority stake of the Phoenix Suns and the WNBA's Mercury for a record price of $4 billion, Ishbia and current owner Robert Sarver announced on Tuesday.
"I am extremely excited to be the next Governor of the Phoenix Suns and Mercury," Mat Ishbia said in a statement.
The Suns' record sale marks a new day in the escalating valuations of NBA teams.
The Lakers had a minority share sold for a higher valuation than the Suns' $4 billion purchase, landing a $5 billion valuation.
But in recent weeks, team employees told ESPN that groups of prospective bidders were seen touring team facilities.

     Meet The New Owners Of The Phoenix Suns, Mat And Justin Ishbia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mat Ishbia won't be the only controlling owner with an NCAA Division I Men's Basketball National Championship ring.
On Tuesday, Forbes confirmed an ESPN report that Ishbia and his brother Justin Ishbia had reached an agreement to buy control of the NBA’s Phoenix Suns at a record price that values the team at $4 billion.
Forbes estimates that Mat Ishbia, the chairman and CEO of Michigan-based mortgage lender United Wholesale Mortgage, is worth $4.7 billion.
The previous record purchase price for an NBA team was the $3.2 billion Joe Tsai paid for the Brooklyn Nets in 2019.
An attorney by day, but an entrepreneur at heart, Jeff Ishbia launched a variety of endeavors—an alarm business, a title company and, in 1986, a mortgage company.
