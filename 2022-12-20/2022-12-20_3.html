     Winter Solstice 2022: When It Is and How to Observe the Shortest Day of the Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, which this year occurs on Dec. 21, marks the first day of winter and the shortest day of the year in that half of the world.
It coincides with the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, which marks the start of summer and the year’s longest day there.
In the months leading up to the Northern Hemisphere’s winter solstice, the sun’s rays gradually shift southward from the equator until the sun reaches its most southerly point in the sky at the Tropic of Capricorn, a mapmaker’s line that parallels the equator at 23.5 degrees south latitude.
After a brief pause at that line on the solstice, the sun appears to reverse direction and begins its journey northward.
