     Binance CEO says deposits returning to exchange
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Deposits are returning and "things seem to have stabilised" at Binance, its chief executive said on Wednesday, a day after it had a sharp increase in withdrawals and paused some stablecoin transactions.
On Tuesday, blockchain data firm Nansen said that Binance had seen withdrawals of $1.9 billion in the last 24 hours and that the exchange said it "temporarily paused" withdrawals of the USDC stablecoin.
"Things seem to have stabilised," CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote in a tweet.
The $1.9 billion of withdrawals of tokens based on the ethereum blockchain marked the largest daily outflow over a 24-hour period since June 13, the Nansen data showed.
How crypto exchanges such as Binance and its now-bankrupt former rival FTX handle customer deposits is under close scrutiny from users and regulators.

     Summary: Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance Getty ImagesBinance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said Tuesday it is pausing withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC USDC while it completes a token swap involving the asset.
Withdrawals in other tokens tied to the value of the dollar–specifically tether and BUSD BUSD , a stablecoin developed by Binance and blockchain-focused firm Paxos–are unaffected.
Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive, added in a Twitter post: “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals.
However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in New York in USD.
As of 10:46 a.m. New York time, all three major stablecoins, tether, USD coin (USDC) and BUSD, are trading a little under $1, according to Nomics.

     Summary: Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, paused withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC on Tuesday while it carried out a "token swap."
USDC withdrawals were resumed about 8 hours after Binance first announced the pausing of withdrawals.
Binance said earlier on Tuesday it had "temporarily paused" USDC withdrawals while it does a "token swap."
Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, tweeted that the exchange is seeing an increase in withdrawals of USDC, a cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin because it is pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar .
If traders are withdrawing USDC from Binance, it could be to move it onto another platform.

     Binance Customer Withdrawals Exceed $3 Billion in 24 Hours
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Behemoth crypto exchange Binance has seen massive withdrawals in the past week and—on Tuesday—the highest amount of one-day withdrawals since June, Nansen data has revealed.
Binance’s international arm saw over $8.78 billion leave its exchange and $5.1 billion in incoming funds, meaning the exchange faced a net outflow of roughly $3.66 billion.
While such data only refers to Binance’s Ethereum and ERC-20 token movements, approximately 63% of Binance’s portfolio is on Ethereum and the outflows are much larger compared to other crypto exchanges over the same period.
On Ethereum, Jump withdrew about $18.4 million this week and pulled about $123.4 million from Binance last week.
According to Nansen’s portfolio tracker, Binance’s total portfolio has decreased by $3.6 billion in just the past eight hours.

Zhao acknowledged the outflow situation on Tuesday, tweeting that Binance had at one point seen “some withdrawals” of roughly $1.1 billion.
