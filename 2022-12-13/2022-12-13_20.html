     Summary: LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Binance has registered $1.9 billion of withdrawals in the past 24 hours, blockchain data firm Nansen said on Tuesday, as the world's biggest crypto exchange said it had "temporarily paused" withdrawals of the USDC stablecoin.
"Binance's withdrawals are increasing due to the growing uncertainty about its reserves report," a Nansen spokesperson said.
Binance said in a tweet around 1654 GMT that USDC withdrawals had resumed.

Earlier Tuesday, Binance had already seen its “highest daily withdrawals since June,” according to Nansen’s analysis.
The rate of withdrawals has since stabilized to approximately $79 million in net outflows, the firm’s data showed as of Tuesday evening ET.
Zhao acknowledged the outflow situation on Tuesday, tweeting that Binance had at one point seen “some withdrawals” of roughly $1.1 billion.
Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits.
