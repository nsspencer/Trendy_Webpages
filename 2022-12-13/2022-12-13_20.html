     Pelicans Update Brandon Ingram's Status for Jazz Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Utah Jazz will be at near-full strength but what about the New Orleans Pelicans?
Lauri Markkanen, Jordan Clarkson, and Mike Conley are not listed on the Utah Jazz's injury report heading into Tuesday night's face-off with the first-place New Orleans Pelicans.
This will be the first time the Jazz have had their starting lineup intact since Conley went down with a knee injury on November 19.
Jazz backup point guard Collin Sexton (hamstring) and forward Simone Fontecchio (ankle) won't be available, although Sexton did participate in the shoot-around Tuesday morning.
While the Jazz got some good news on the injury front, the Pelicans will be missing a critical piece to their starting five.

     Summary: Now is a great time to start checking on where those picks stand and familiarizing ourselves with some of the names that might be available where the Jazz are picking.
Big Board Check-InToday we’ll take a look at The Athletic’s Top 100 as our frame of reference.
Sitting at 12th on the big board is currently Kyle Filipowski, the 7’0” C playing at Duke.
Taking Mitchell in the draft is taking a flier on his top-tier athleticism.

     Analysis: Jazz win first of two games against Pelicans. What needs to get better before Thursday’s rematch?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It did not go well for the Pelicans, who had a seven-game win streak snapped by the Utah Jazz in a blowout game.
Defending the 3The Jazz held the Pelicans to just 4-of-27 from the 3-point line on Tuesday night.
After watching all of the Pelicans’ 3-point shot attempts, it feels like the Jazz got really lucky that the Pelicans were so horrible from deep on Tuesday.
But when we are looking ahead at Thursday’s game, you can certainly not bank on the Pelicans shooting so poorly and you can bet that they are going to come out more aggressive.
I think the Jazz’s ceiling when all their players are healthy is really, really high and that they are a difficult matchup for almost anyone.
