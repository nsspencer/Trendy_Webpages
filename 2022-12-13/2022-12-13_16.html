     'Kindred': How the new Hulu show compares to Octavia E. Butler's book
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Kindred," a new FX series on Hulu, is based on the 1979 novel by Octavia E. Butler.
As in the novel, Dana is brought back several times throughout Rufus’ life, with each stay growing longer.
Kevin is tasked with teaching piano to the young Rufus – and later, Rufus' mother, Margaret.
In the book, Kevin is a writer, and he is hired by Tom to tutor Rufus, who had been pulled from school.
The show hasn't been renewed yet, but “we’re working hard on a really great second season,” Jacobs-Jenkins says.

     'Kindred' review: Hulu adapts Octavia E. Butler's novel into another time-travel tale that takes its sweet time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —After starting out well, “Kindred” gets lost in a maze of its own making, adapting Octavia E. Butler’s time-traveling novel into an eight-part Hulu series that spends far too much time spinning its wheels.
The series does begin promisingly enough, as Dana (Mallori Johnson) moves into a new house in Los Angeles and begins to experience a series of eerie visions.

Brace yourself, in other words, for a lengthier commitment to glean greater insight into how all of this works.
“Kindred” premieres December 13 on Hulu.

     Kindred: Season 1 Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Octavia E. Butler’s 1979 novel Kindred is an original story that has maddeningly withstood live-action adaptation.
And now it’s an eight-episode FX series from playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins that is more loosely based, and inspired by Butler’s Kindred than a direct adaptation.
Adding plots, character points of view, and non-linear storytelling to the mix, Kindred the series is creative but it loses the focus and grace of Butler’s prose and intentions.
An orphan since her mentally ill mother, Olivia, disappeared when she was young, Dana’s aunt fills the maternal void but is judgemental about Dana’s choices and questions her mental stability.
While Jacobs-Jenkins can be commended for not feeling beholden to tell Kindred exactly as Butler did, the changes he makes undercut its sense of momentum and focus in the overall season.

     Kindred review: A thrilling adaptation of the Octavia Butler classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But this gripping adaptation, developed and exec produced by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (Watchmen), expands Butler's groundbreaking exploration of America's racist history into a profound puzzle-box thriller.
"Near the end of her life, she claimed to see things that weren't there," she warns.
With his plaintive gaze and sonorous voice, the actor brings a wonderful blend of humor and empathy to the role.
Though the enslaved men and women on the Weylin plantation are subject to all forms of mistreatment, Kindred never fetishizes the violence, instead honing in on the casual, everyday brutality of a slave's existence.
Unable to pay the doctor who tended to Rufus, Tom offers his servant, Sabina (Cherrie McRae), as payment.

     What Octavia Butler’s ‘Kindred’ Can Teach Us About Human Behavior
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kindred, her fourth novel, was a departure, a story in which a contemporary Black woman in an interracial marriage is summoned back in time to Maryland in 1815.
Butler had attended a Clarion workshop 30 years prior as a student, but now she was back to teach eager pupils like me.
The idea that human beings are hierarchical permeates Butler’s work, and it’s what she tried to explain to me during an in-depth conversation at a party in Seattle.
Then, she turned her attention to the visceral past and placed a Black woman at the center of her own story.
Kindred is where Butler’s lessons on writing with closely felt details and nuanced physicality are on full display.

Olivia, Dana, and Kevin are still trying to figure out the mechanics of Dana’s time-traveling capabilities.
Hagar’s daughter Alice is there but Olivia tells Dana that Hagar passed from what she believed to be cancer.
While Dana is playing with Alice, Olivia cryptically tells Kevin without context that Dana will be okay as long as she drinks water.
Then, she says she feels that like Rufus, Dana has to be more than just scared to time travel — she has to fear for her life.
