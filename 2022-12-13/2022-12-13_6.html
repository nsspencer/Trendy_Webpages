     Draymond Green has fan removed during Warriors-Bucks game in Milwaukee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a testy game filled with technical fouls, a fan at Fiserv Forum was tossed during the action Tuesday night in Milwaukee.
Midway through the third quarter of the Warriors' game against the Bucks, Draymond Green approached the game officials and pointed to a fan sitting on the baseline behind the basket Milwaukee was shooting on.
On Dec. 1, Green was fined $25,000 by the NBA for directed obscene language at a fan during the Warriors' game in Dallas on Nov. 29.
The fan in Dallas later tweeted at Green, noting that he wanted to match the $25,000 fine, a gesture Draymond appreciated.
Green surely will address the incident with the fan in Milwaukee at some point after the game.

     Warriors road woes continue in 128-111 loss to Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At this point, there’s not much to say about the Golden State Warriors until they either make a notable acquisition or prove they are capable of winning on the road.
While the Dubs dominated the Celtics at the Chase Center over the weekend, Golden State was clearly the inferior team against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night, losing 128-112.
The Warriors can point to the impact of Andrew Wiggins’ absence, but the Bucks were missing Jrue Holiday too.
There’s just clearly something missing from Golden State right now.
Bobby Portis added 25 points and 11 rebounds off the bench, primarily against Warriors backup bigs Anthony Lamb and JaMychal Green.

     Warriors' Draymond Green Has Fan Removed From Courtside vs. Bucks

     Summary: AP Photo/Morry GashGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green had a fan removed during his team's 128-111 road loss against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum on Tuesday evening.
ESPN's Kendra Andrews provided more context on the interaction between the fan and Green prior to the ejection, which occurred while Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo shot free throws.
Green previously had an interaction with a fan at a Nov. 29 road game against the Dallas Mavericks, and it led to a $25,000 fine.
The fan, Alykhan Rehmatullah, told Green on Twitter that he would match $25,000 to charity.
"You don't see that happen," Green told Andrews about the match, which he also called "a cool gesture."
