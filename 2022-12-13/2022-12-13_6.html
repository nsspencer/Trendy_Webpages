     Carlos Correa, San Francisco Giants agree to 13-year, $350 million deal – a record for a shortstop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants would not be denied in their quest for a franchise-altering superstar addition this winter.
Spurned by slugger Aaron Judge, they instead reeled in Carlos Correa, a more versatile all-around player who agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal Tuesday night – the most lucrative deal for a shortstop in major league history.
A baseball official with direct knowledge of the deal confirmed that Correa, 28, is in agreement with the Giants.
Correa earned $35.5 million with the Twins last season, which gives him a 14-year windfall of $385.5 million.
His $350 million contract is the fourth-largest commitment in baseball history, behind Mike Trout and the Angels ($426.5 million), Mookie Betts and the Dodgers ($365 million) and Judge.

     Mets showing interest in star free-agent Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cohen’s Mets are showing interest in Correa, according to sources familiar with the team’s thinking.
Correa, 28, likely would play third base for the Mets, alongside his fellow native of Puerto Rico, shortstop Francisco Lindor.
With penalties, the Mets’ total payroll would be approximately $421 million, by far the highest in major-league history.
Two other free-agent shortstops, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts, signed 11-year deals worth $300 million and $280 million, respectively.
The Mets may also have to explore interest in top prospects like Brett Baty and Mark Vientos.

     SF Giants, SS Carlos Correa agree to $350 million deal: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the Giants are in agreement on an enormous 13-year, $350 million contract, according to multiple reports.
The huge dollars, double the amount of any other Giants deal ever, reflects the degree to which the Giants absolutely had to have Correa.
Like Judge, Correa bet on himself and played his free agency saga masterfully.
Turner signed with Philadelphia for 11 years, $300 million this offseason, and Lindor signed with New York for 10 years and $341 million last year.
Over his eight-year major league career, Correa has hit .279 with 155 home runs and an .836 OPS.

     MLB free agency: Giants land Carlos Correa with 13-year, $350 million contract, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa and the Giants have agreed to a massive 13-year contract worth $350 million, reports ESPN.
Neither happened and Correa opted out of his contract after the season, and cashed in huge this winter.
Overall, Correa's $350 million pact is the fourth-largest deal for an MLB player, trailing only Mike Trout's $426.5 million extension with the Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million extension with the Dodgers, and Aaron Judge's recent $360 million deal with the Yankees.
Correa's bat will significantly improve a Giants offense that last season ranked seventh in runs scored and eighth in OPS.
The Correa deal is a sorely needed splash for Giants president of baseball operation Farhan Zaidi, who earlier this offseason missed out on Judge.

     Summary: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN.

The 13 years matches the longest contract ever for a free agent, tying Bryce Harper's 13-year, $330 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.
Before Correa, the last player the Giants signed to a $100 million contract was pitcher Johnny Cueto, who got a six-year, $130 million deal in December 2015.
At 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, Correa is among the game's biggest players at shortstop, where he has played all 881 of his career games in the field.

     Correa agrees to 13-year megadeal with Giants (source)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the on-field component only proved a shadow of his true value -- as the Twins quickly discovered.
An analytical and probing mind with natural charisma, Correa quickly became the leader of the Minnesota clubhouse, able to connect with the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking sides of the team alike and earning respect for his attitude and preparation.
Now with the Giants, he'll seek a similarly prominent voice as a cornerstone player of the future -- and he'll be around to see it through.
In Correa, the Giants have a marquee player who will inject some much-needed star power on a team that will be tasked with competing with two heavyweights -- the Dodgers and Padres -- in the National League West.
There are still some holes left to be filled, particularly in the bullpen, but the Giants’ big splash should go a long way toward closing the gap with their division rivals.

     Giants, Carlos Correa Agree To 13-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco is reportedly in agreement with Carlos Correa on a 13-year, $350MM contract.
Statcast has pegged Correa as 17 runs above average since it began tracking defense in 2016, including plus grades each year from 2018-21.
It’s the second-biggest free agent deal of all-time, just narrowly below the $360MM deal that Judge inked a week ago.
The deal runs through the 2035 campaign, what will be Correa’s age-40 season.
Jeff Passan of ESPN first reported Correa and the Giants had agreed to a 13-year, $350MM contract.
