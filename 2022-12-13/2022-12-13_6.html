     Summary: The Giants made a major splash Tuesday night, agreeing to a massive 13-year, $350 million contract with star shortstop Carlos Correa in free agency.
The Astros offered Carlos Correa a five-year, $160 million contract at the end of the 2021 season.
He ended up getting 14 years and $395 million guaranteed between the Twins and Giants.

     Carlos Correa, San Francisco Giants agree to 13-year, $350 million deal – a record for a shortstop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants would not be denied in their quest for a franchise-altering superstar addition this winter.
Spurned by slugger Aaron Judge, they instead reeled in Carlos Correa, a more versatile all-around player who agreed to a 13-year, $350 million deal Tuesday night – the most lucrative deal for a shortstop in major league history.
A baseball official with direct knowledge of the deal confirmed that Correa, 28, is in agreement with the Giants.
Correa earned $35.5 million with the Twins last season, which gives him a 14-year windfall of $385.5 million.
His $350 million contract is the fourth-largest commitment in baseball history, behind Mike Trout and the Angels ($426.5 million), Mookie Betts and the Dodgers ($365 million) and Judge.

     MLB free agency: Giants land Carlos Correa with 13-year, $350 million contract, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa and the Giants have agreed to a massive 13-year contract worth $350 million, reports ESPN.
Neither happened and Correa opted out of his contract after the season, and cashed in huge this winter.
Overall, Correa's $350 million pact is the fourth-largest deal for an MLB player, trailing only Mike Trout's $426.5 million extension with the Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million extension with the Dodgers, and Aaron Judge's recent $360 million deal with the Yankees.
Correa's bat will significantly improve a Giants offense that last season ranked seventh in runs scored and eighth in OPS.
The Correa deal is a sorely needed splash for Giants president of baseball operation Farhan Zaidi, who earlier this offseason missed out on Judge.

     San Francisco Giants, Carlos Correa agree to 13-year, $350M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The $350 million exceeds the $341 million shortstop Francisco Lindor received from the New York Mets and the $340 million for shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. with the San Diego Padres.
And in the history of baseball, only Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Judge's exceed it in value.
Before Correa, the last player the Giants signed to a $100 million-plus contract was pitcher Johnny Cueto, who received a six-year, $130 million deal in December 2015.
By his second season, Correa was one of the best players in baseball.
At 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, Correa is among the game's biggest players at shortstop, where he has played all 881 of his career games in the field.

     Giants, Carlos Correa Agree To 13-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco is reportedly in agreement with Carlos Correa on a 13-year, $350MM contract.
Statcast has pegged Correa as 17 runs above average since it began tracking defense in 2016, including plus grades each year from 2018-21.
It’s the second-biggest free agent deal of all-time, just narrowly below the $360MM deal that Judge inked a week ago.
The deal runs through the 2035 campaign, what will be Correa’s age-40 season.
Jeff Passan of ESPN first reported Correa and the Giants had agreed to a 13-year, $350MM contract.

     Correa agrees to 13-year megadeal with Giants (source)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the on-field component only proved a shadow of his true value -- as the Twins quickly discovered.
An analytical and probing mind with natural charisma, Correa quickly became the leader of the Minnesota clubhouse, able to connect with the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking sides of the team alike and earning respect for his attitude and preparation.
Now with the Giants, he'll seek a similarly prominent voice as a cornerstone player of the future -- and he'll be around to see it through.
In Correa, the Giants have a marquee player who will inject some much-needed star power on a team that will be tasked with competing with two heavyweights -- the Dodgers and Padres -- in the National League West.
There are still some holes left to be filled, particularly in the bullpen, but the Giants’ big splash should go a long way toward closing the gap with their division rivals.
