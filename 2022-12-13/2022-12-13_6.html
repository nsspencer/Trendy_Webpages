     Summary: The consumer price index, which measures a wide basket of goods and services, rose just 0.1% from the previous month, and increased 7.1% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 0.2% on the month and 6% on an annual basis, compared with respective estimates of 0.3% and 6.1%.
Falling energy prices helped keep inflation at bay.
Food prices, however, rose 0.5% and were up 10.6% from a year ago.
Real average hourly earnings rose 0.5% for the month, though they were still down 1.9% from a year ago.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), Chairman of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee (JEC), released the following statement after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation slowed to 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in November and annual inflation slowed to 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 0.2%, down slightly from 0.3% in October.??
And although it remains too high, annual inflation fell to 7.1% and reflects the smallest 12-month increase since December 2021.
“A range of indicators underscore our overall economic strength.
From the American Rescue Plan to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and from the CHIPS and Science Act to the Inflation Reduction Act, today’s economic strength and resilience are a testament to those investments.”

     Summary: This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.
Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month.
A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return.
Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations.
Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

     Summary: Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner now sees even smaller Fed rate hikes, of 25 basis points at the central bank's February meeting, and no further increases in March, leaving the peak fed funds rate at 4.625%.
The consumer inflation numbers follow November's producer prices report last week, which was slightly higher than expected but pointed to a moderation in the trend.
"There is a big question mark whether we can really come to the 2% inflation (Fed target).
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

     Inflation cools in November for the second-straight month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Chart: Axios VisualsFollowing a cooler-than-expected inflation reading in October, consumer price gains slowed even further last month: the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1% in the year ending in November, down from 7.7% the prior month, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Why it matters: Inflation is still way too high, but the data offers some hope that it can ease alongside a still-healthy economy.
By the numbers: On a monthly basis, CPI rose 0.1%, slower than the 0.4% in October.
On a monthly basis, it rose 0.2% — up 6% over the 12 months ending in November.
That will come after surprisingly cooler inflation readings, though officials have warned that its war on inflation is far from over.

With Wall Street at the controls and the baggage car forgotten on a siding, it looks ready to assume the lead.
The November Consumer Price Index inflation report just proclaimed to Wall Street, "You're the winner!"
Now, onto to the big investment show, with the Federal Reserve bankers giving themselves high fives.

That makes sense because while it's almost certain we're going to get a half a point rate hike tomorrow, this could impact the rate hike that happens in February."
"The highest probability for February is that it will be a quarter point (hike).
This is at least showing that things are moving in the right direction and that could lower the probability of that quarter point to potentially no raise at all on February 1st."
"“Directionally and sequentially the CPI report for November is certainly better than anticipated, when expectations were for it to be pretty good.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Consumer prices rose less than expected in November, the second-straight month inflation pressures moderated more than anticipated by economists.
Consensus estimates called for a 6.1% annual increase and 0.3% monthly rise in the core CPI reading.
(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The Fed keeps a closer eye on "core" inflation, which offers policymakers a more nuanced look at inputs like housing.
The headline CPI figure, in contrast, has moved largely in tandem with erratic energy prices this year.
The cost of shelter rose 7.1% over the last year, comprising nearly half of the total increase in core CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
