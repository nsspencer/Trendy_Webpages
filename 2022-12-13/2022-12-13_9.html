     LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony Watch Their Three Sons Square Off In High School Game 20 Years After Their Own Battle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony experienced a full-circle moment on Monday night as the two got to watch three of their sons share the hardwood together in a high school basketball game.
Bryce and Bronny James’ Sierra Canyon knocked off Kiyan Anthony’s Christ the King 62-51 in what was undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated high school basketball games of all-time.
James and Anthony know exactly what it’s like playing in a high-profile high school basketball game.
LeBron was ultimately drafted first overall in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers straight out of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School.
The highlight of the night was Bronny rising up for a breakaway dunk and looking exactly like his father did 20 years ago.
