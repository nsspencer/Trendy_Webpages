     Lakers News: LeBron James &amp; Carmelo Anthony Watch Sons Face Off 20 Years After Their Epic High School Meeting

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Back in 2002, the two biggest high school basketball stars squared off when LeBron James led St. Vincent-St. Mary to a victory over Carmelo Anthony and Oak Hill Academy.
Now, 20 years to the day, and after forging a brotherhood throughout their time in the NBA, LeBron and Carmelo got to witness their children face off in their own high school basketball showdown.
Once again it was the James side who came away with the win as Sierra Canyon took home the victory over Christ the King High School, 62-51.
As fun as the game itself was, this obviously was bigger than the game itself for LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony.
This makes sense, especially on the Sierra Canyon side which is one of the best high school teams in the nation and is loaded with talent, some of whom are sons of celebrities.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony both have sons playing in elite high-school basketball programs.
Before they were teammates on the Lakers or Team USA, before they had even begun their NBA careers, James and Anthony were both high school basketball stars, two of the top prospects in the country.
All the way back in 2002, James and Anthony faced off in a high school game that featured 11,000 fans at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey, according to ESPN.
Anthony scored 36 points to James' 34 in that matchup, with Anthony's Oak Hill Academy defeating James' St. Vincent-St. Mary 72-66.
For James, the reunion tour isn't done just yet, as Sierra Canyon's next game will be in Ohio against James' alma mater St. Vincent-St. Mary on Dec. 17.
