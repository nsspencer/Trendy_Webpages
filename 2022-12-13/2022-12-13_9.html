     Draymond Green has fan removed during Warriors-Bucks game in Milwaukee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a testy game filled with technical fouls, a fan at Fiserv Forum was tossed during the action Tuesday night in Milwaukee.
Midway through the third quarter of the Warriors' game against the Bucks, Draymond Green approached the game officials and pointed to a fan sitting on the baseline behind the basket Milwaukee was shooting on.
On Dec. 1, Green was fined $25,000 by the NBA for directed obscene language at a fan during the Warriors' game in Dallas on Nov. 29.
The fan in Dallas later tweeted at Green, noting that he wanted to match the $25,000 fine, a gesture Draymond appreciated.
Green surely will address the incident with the fan in Milwaukee at some point after the game.

     Summary: EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (Dec. 13, 2022) – The work of a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University visual arts student will be featured exclusively at the Milwaukee Bucks HBCU Game Night and worn by selected fans.

With a passion for visual arts and design, Barcliff has participated in multiple design competitions, including a recent N.C. A&amp;T Bojangles Mural design contest, but this is the biggest yet.
“Janiya is a driven designer who seeks out these types of challenges in order to test her talents,” said associate professor Roymieco Carter, director of A&amp;T’s Visual Arts Program.

     Draymond Green gets a Milwaukee Bucks fan ejected from the game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks took care of business last night and beat the Golden State Warriors 128-111 in a convincing fashion.
It was definitely a night to forget for the Dubs, but their emotional leader and forward, Draymond Green, still managed to make headlines somehow.
Bucks fan gets ejectedMidway through the third quarter, with the Bucks in full control of the game, an incident occurred as Draymond Green got into a verbal argument with a particular Bucks fan sitting a few rows behind the basket during a Giannis Antetokounmpo free-throw attempt.
Green was visibly fired up, and only a minute later, with a stoppage in play, Draymond insisted to the refs that the fan needed to get ejected from the game.
The Bucks fan maybe got forced into an early exit, but at least his team took home the W.

     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks hosted and dominated the Golden State Warriors in a marquee matchup that ended up being a 128-111 blowout, as Giannis and co. took care of business early and left no hope for the Dubs to grab the road win.
Giannis back to MVP formAfter having the worst performance of the season against the Rockets, Giannis Antetokounmpo responded with vengeance and dominated the Warriors.
The Greek Freak ended up with 30 points, 12 rebounds, and 5 assists in only 30 minutes of play.
Giannis produced, but he got massive help from the supporting cast, as Milwaukee proved once again that they have a deep roster.

     Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday final injury update for Bucks-Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Quinn Allen · 2 min readThe Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors face off Tuesday night in a heavyweight showdown between two title contenders.
While Khris Middleton was cleared to play despite a mild ankle sprain, guard Jrue Holiday has been ruled out for Tuesday’s tilt because of a non-COVID-19 illness, Mike Budenholzer told reporters.
And they’ll have their closer for Tuesday’s tilt, though Holiday will be forced to miss the clash.
Khris Middleton is averaging 11 points, 4.6 assists, and 2.4 rebounds in five games thus far, playing just 23.8 minutes per night.
Holiday meanwhile is playing like his usual self, putting up 19.1 points, 7.4 dimes, and 5.3 boards.

     Draymond Green claims he received DEATH THREAT from a fan during Warriors' defeat at Milwaukee Bucks

     Summary: Draymond Green has claimed he received a death threat from a fan during the Golden State Warriors' defeat at the Milwaukee Bucks Tuesday - shortly before getting the man kicked out of the arena by security.
He immediately spoke to officials after the clash, and the man was ejected, with Green later clarifying to reporters what happened.
This comes only a week after Westbrook was involved in an argument with a different Bucks fan sitting courtside.
James also had four fans removed from a game in Atlanta in February of 2021, after they also became vulgar with him.
I don't think it's fair to the players — not just to me, but I don't think it's fair to the players.'
