     Cubs target Carlos Correa agrees to 13-year deal with Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correa, the All-Star free agent shortstop and a top Cubs offseason target, has agreed to a 13-year deal with the San Francisco Giants, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported Tuesday night.
The deal is worth $350 million, for an average annual value of about $27 million for the 28-year-old Correa.
BREAKING: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source familiar with the deal tells ESPN.
Trea Turner came off the board first, landing a 11-year, $300 million deal with the Phillies last week.
Xander Bogaerts then landed his own 11-year deal, worth $280 million, with the Padres.

     Summary: The Giants made a major splash Tuesday night, agreeing to a massive 13-year, $350 million contract with star shortstop Carlos Correa in free agency.
The Astros offered Carlos Correa a five-year, $160 million contract at the end of the 2021 season.
He ended up getting 14 years and $395 million guaranteed between the Twins and Giants.

     SF Giants, SS Carlos Correa agree to $350 million deal: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the Giants are in agreement on an enormous 13-year, $350 million contract, according to multiple reports.
The huge dollars, double the amount of any other Giants deal ever, reflects the degree to which the Giants absolutely had to have Correa.
Like Judge, Correa bet on himself and played his free agency saga masterfully.
Turner signed with Philadelphia for 11 years, $300 million this offseason, and Lindor signed with New York for 10 years and $341 million last year.
Over his eight-year major league career, Correa has hit .279 with 155 home runs and an .836 OPS.

     Giants, Carlos Correa agree to 13-year, $350M deal, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The $350 million exceeds the $341 million shortstop Francisco Lindor received from the New York Mets and the $340 million for shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. with the San Diego Padres.
And in the history of baseball, only Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Judge's exceed it in value.
Before Correa, the last player the Giants signed to a $100 million-plus contract was pitcher Johnny Cueto, who received a six-year, $130 million deal in December 2015.
Only three primary shortstops in the expansion era (since 1961) produced more WAR through their age-27 season than Carlos Correa.
By his second season, Correa was one of the best players in baseball.

     Correa agrees to 13-year megadeal with Giants (source)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the on-field component only proved a shadow of his true value -- as the Twins quickly discovered.
An analytical and probing mind with natural charisma, Correa quickly became the leader of the Minnesota clubhouse, able to connect with the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking sides of the team alike and earning respect for his attitude and preparation.
Now with the Giants, he'll seek a similarly prominent voice as a cornerstone player of the future -- and he'll be around to see it through.
In Correa, the Giants have a marquee player who will inject some much-needed star power on a team that will be tasked with competing with two heavyweights -- the Dodgers and Padres -- in the National League West.
There are still some holes left to be filled, particularly in the bullpen, but the Giants’ big splash should go a long way toward closing the gap with their division rivals.

     Giants, Carlos Correa Agree To 13-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco is reportedly in agreement with Carlos Correa on a 13-year, $350MM contract.
Statcast has pegged Correa as 17 runs above average since it began tracking defense in 2016, including plus grades each year from 2018-21.
It’s the second-biggest free agent deal of all-time, just narrowly below the $360MM deal that Judge inked a week ago.
The deal runs through the 2035 campaign, what will be Correa’s age-40 season.
Jeff Passan of ESPN first reported Correa and the Giants had agreed to a 13-year, $350MM contract.
