     Summary: The “First Class” singer jokingly said to Lipa — who was recently linked to Trevor Noah — that they were basically “on tour together,” a spy tells us.
Jack Harlow and Dua Lipa were seen flirting at Variety’s Hitmakers honors.
Variety via Getty ImagesThe pair had both performed at Z100’s Jingle Ball at Madison Square Garden the night before.
The pair then met in-person at the Variety event, and sources tell us they’ve been in “constant communication” ever since.
Harlow, for his part, has become renowned for his flirty personality, but hasn’t had any public relationships to date.

     Jack Harlow and Dua Lipa Are 'Hanging Out': Source
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this month, the "First Class" rapper was spotted with Dua Lipa for the first time in public at Variety's Hitmakers brunch.
The sighting caused buzz on social media considering he released his song "Dua Lipa" — where he seemingly shoots his shot with the pop star — earlier this year.
Since then, a source told PEOPLE that Harlow, 24, and Lipa, 27, are "hanging out."
"Dua Lipa" was featured on the rapper's latest studio album Come Home the Kids Miss You.
Despite rumors, however, a source told PEOPLE at the time that "they're just friends."

     Jack Harlow and Dua Lipa Are Reportedly Doing More Than a Feature
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harlow and Lipa at that fateful brunch.
That didn’t get in the way of Harlow, 24, who finally met Lipa, 27, in person seven months later at Variety’s Hitmakers Brunch.
And now, in the world’s latest Mad Libs news development, “Page Six” reported that the pair are actually dating.
Per a “Page Six” source, Harlow “was very interested in her, and was going to strongly pursue [the romance].” In other words, not just a simple rhyme.
A source told “Page Six” that they were never romantic, and their flirty night out came after he taped her podcast, At Your Service.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Christopher Polk/Variety via Getty ImagesIs Jack Harlow the king of manifesting?
Earlier this year, in a song titled “Dua Lipa,” Harlow said he wanted to “do more with her than do a feature.” Now, “Page Six” reports that the two are dating.
“Page Six” claims the musicians met at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch in November, and that Harlow traveled to New York to meet Lipa after her Z100 Jingle Ball appearance on Friday.
This spring, when Charlamagne asked Harlow if Dua was a woman he “fancied,” Harlow said he “admired her.” Excuse me while I go write a song called “Jason Momoa,” about a man I admire.
