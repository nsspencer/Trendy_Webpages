     France v. Morocco: An Unlikely Semi-Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: France, the two-time world champs and current holders of the title, and they are stacked with talent once again.
In fact, if you split their squad in half, the French could probably produce two teams good enough to win the World Cup.
Much like Croatia, the longer the game remains even, the better this Morocco side seems to get.
If France fails to find an early goal, then they’re going to have to strap-in for a long night.
Morocco could leave now with their heads held high and be received by their countrymen as heroes.

     Summary: Morocco have the hopes and dreams of the entire Arab world, not to mention the support of most neutrals.
You do not make it to a World Cup semifinal by chance.
Head coach Didier Deschamps is one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager.
Indeed, Mbappe is just one shy of Messi’s World Cup goal tally – but he’s only 23, and could easily be playing in another two World Cups before he even turns 32.
Watched by quite possibly billions of people, the World Cup final will be held on Sunday, Qatar’s national day, at Lusail Stadium.
