     Biden signs bill to protect same-sex and interracial marriages

     Summary: It specifies that states must recognize same-sex marriages across state lines and that same-sex couples have the same federal benefits as any married couple.
The Respect for Marriage Act does not codify same-sex marriage, though.
She noted the Respect for Marriage Act will be one of the last bills she will sign as she ends her second stretch as speaker.
Biden's views, like those of many Americans, shifted to support same-sex marriage over his lifetime.
But in 2012 then-Vice President Biden announced his support for same-sex marriage on NBC's Meet the Press, backing the measure even before Obama did.

     WATCH: Biden signs Respect for Marriage Act, protecting same-sex and interracial marriages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed gay marriage legislation into law Tuesday before a crowd of thousands, a ceremony that reflected growing acceptance of same-sex unions.
Plaintiffs from lawsuits that originally helped secure the nationwide right to gay marriage were also there.
Lawmakers crafted a compromise that was intended to assuage conservative concerns about religious liberty, such as ensuring churches could still refuse to perform gay marriages.
He memorably — and unexpectedly — endorsed same-sex unions in a television interview in 2012, when he was vice president.
By the time of Biden’s 2012 interview, gay marriage remained controversial, but support had expanded to roughly half of U.S. adults, according to Gallup.

… The [Respect for Marriage Act] recognizes that everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves — without the government interference.'
It replaces the Defense of Marriage Act, which in 1996 defined marriage as between a man and a woman, The New York Times reported.
In a concurrent opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas included other cases that he believed the court should reexamine, including the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

     LGBTQ families react after President Biden signs Respect for Marriage Act
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Courtesy Love-Ramirez Family(WASHINGTON) — LGBTQ families are celebrating after President Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act Tuesday afternoon in a ceremony held on the White House South Lawn.
The act codifies protections for same-sex and interracial marriage by mandating that states recognize lawful unions performed in other states.
“As a lesbian in an interracial marriage, this is pretty important,” she said.
She continued, “The majority of Americans support marriage equality.
Love-Ramirez said he will continue advocating for others in the LGBTQ community until this “slow march” toward marriage equality is achieved.
