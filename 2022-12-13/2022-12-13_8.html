    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2023 will likely be a challenging year for the commercial construction industry.
Commercial construction is being hit in three key ways: cost of capital, cost of construction materials and cost of land.
What are some sectors in commercial construction that can weather a slowdown in 2023?
Our backlog is somewhat evenly spread between commercial, industrial and special projects, with special projects taking a slight lead.
2022 was MYCON’s most successful year to date, and with our current project backlog, we expect 2023 to be an even bigger year for us.
