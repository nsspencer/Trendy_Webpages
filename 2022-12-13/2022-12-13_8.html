     Inflation cools in November for the second-straight month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Chart: Axios VisualsFollowing a cooler-than-expected inflation reading in October, consumer price gains slowed even further last month: the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1% in the year ending in November, down from 7.7% the prior month, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Why it matters: Inflation is still way too high, but the data offers some hope that it can ease alongside a still-healthy economy.
By the numbers: On a monthly basis, CPI rose 0.1%, slower than the 0.4% in October.
On a monthly basis, it rose 0.2% — up 6% over the 12 months ending in November.
That will come after surprisingly cooler inflation readings, though officials have warned that its war on inflation is far from over.

     Summary: The consumer price index, which measures a wide basket of goods and services, rose just 0.1% from the previous month, and increased 7.1% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 0.2% on the month and 6% on an annual basis, compared with respective estimates of 0.3% and 6.1%.
Falling energy prices helped keep inflation at bay.
Food prices, however, rose 0.5% and were up 10.6% from a year ago.
Real average hourly earnings rose 0.5% for the month, though they were still down 1.9% from a year ago.

     Soft CPI May Boost Disruptive Tech in ARKK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Investors looking for the right tech exposure for 2023 may want to revisit the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) as tech could benefit from the CPI bounce.
It’s been a difficult year for tech stocks as funding for many innovative companies dried up with rising interest rates, and some of the biggest tech firms like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) have had to make layoffs.
ARKK could be a strategy poised for more flows if that becomes the case, offering a particular tech exposure for 2023.
ARKK targets firms that would benefit from “disruptive innovations” like improvements to AI, DNA technologies, and automation, to name a few.
Finding the right tech exposure in such a complicated new rate regime for tech isn’t the easiest task for investors.

     Summary: Stripping out the contentious shelter component of the index, core prices actually fell 0.1% on the month.
Using a three-month annualized rate to smooth out the month-to-month volatility, the core index excluding shelter suggests an underlying rate of core inflation of just 1% — below the Federal Reserve’s target.
The CPI carries a special measure of weight this month, of course, because it comes on the eve of the next Fed monetary policy decision.
• Cooling core goods inflation and healing supply chains (emphatic check: core goods prices actually fell outright for the second consecutive month.)

The consumer inflation numbers follow November's producer prices report last week, which was slightly higher than expected but pointed to a moderation in the trend.
"There is a big question mark whether we can really come to the 2% inflation (Fed target).
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

That makes sense because while it's almost certain we're going to get a half a point rate hike tomorrow, this could impact the rate hike that happens in February."
"The highest probability for February is that it will be a quarter point (hike).
This is at least showing that things are moving in the right direction and that could lower the probability of that quarter point to potentially no raise at all on February 1st."
"“Directionally and sequentially the CPI report for November is certainly better than anticipated, when expectations were for it to be pretty good.

     Summary: Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), Chairman of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee (JEC), released the following statement after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation slowed to 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in November and annual inflation slowed to 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 0.2%, down slightly from 0.3% in October.??
And although it remains too high, annual inflation fell to 7.1% and reflects the smallest 12-month increase since December 2021.
“A range of indicators underscore our overall economic strength.
From the American Rescue Plan to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and from the CHIPS and Science Act to the Inflation Reduction Act, today’s economic strength and resilience are a testament to those investments.”
