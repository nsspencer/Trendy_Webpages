     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks look to shake off an embarrassing loss on the road as they host the Golden State Warriors this evening.
It’s always an exciting day for Milwaukee when an all-time great comes to play against the Bucks, and ticketholders get to watch two members of the NBA’s Top 75 Players list go head-to-head.
Only a minor change on the injury report to mention - Jrue and Khris are both still game-time-decisions, but Jrue has been listed as questionable, while Khris is listed as probable for the game this evening.
As always, go Bucks!

     Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday final injury update for Bucks-Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Quinn Allen · 2 min readThe Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors face off Tuesday night in a heavyweight showdown between two title contenders.
While Khris Middleton was cleared to play despite a mild ankle sprain, guard Jrue Holiday has been ruled out for Tuesday’s tilt because of a non-COVID-19 illness, Mike Budenholzer told reporters.
And they’ll have their closer for Tuesday’s tilt, though Holiday will be forced to miss the clash.
Khris Middleton is averaging 11 points, 4.6 assists, and 2.4 rebounds in five games thus far, playing just 23.8 minutes per night.
Holiday meanwhile is playing like his usual self, putting up 19.1 points, 7.4 dimes, and 5.3 boards.

     Golden State Warriors vs Milwaukee Bucks Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fresh off of having an NBA Finals rematch against the Boston Celtics, the Golden State Warriors have another potential NBA Finals match against the Milwaukee Bucks tonight.
The Golden State Warriors will be missing Andrew Wiggins with a right adductor sprain and Andre Iguodala with left hip injury management.
The Milwaukee Bucks will continue to miss Joe Ingles with an ACL tear.
The Warriors on the other hand just defeated the Boston Celtics in a game that snapped their two-game losing streak.
While the Golden State Warriors still haven't returned to that championship form that everyone is expecting, beating the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks in back-to-back games will certainly make a statement.

On Tuesday night, the Warriors are in Milwaukee to meet the Bucks, who won the championship in 2021.
