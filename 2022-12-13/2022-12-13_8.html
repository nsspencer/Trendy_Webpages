     Summary: articleAn automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch.
The nail-biter race showed the congresswoman's combative style is wearying voters in her conservative Colorado district.
Frisch netted a total of four votes in the recount, far from enough to close a 500-plus vote gap with Boebert.
An Aspen City Councilman, Frisch had already conceded the race last month after the first tally put him just under the state's margin for a mandatory recount.

     Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert narrowly won re-election, recount confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An automatic recount confirmed that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert narrowly won her bid for re-election, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Monday evening.
NBC News’ Decision Desk has projected Boebert, a far-right lawmaker, the winner of the House race against her Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch.
The recount found a four-vote difference from November’s result, with Boebert getting 546 more votes than Frisch.
Under Colorado law, a recount is triggered if the difference between the top two vote-getters is less than or equal to 0.5% of total votes cast.
Trump won the district twice, capturing 53.1% of the vote in 2016 and 52.9% four years later.

     Colorado election results: Lauren Boebert wins re-election by 546 votes, recount confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freedom Caucus firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo, has won her bid for re-election against Democrat Adam Frisch, an automatic recount confirmed Monday.
Frisch gained a total of four votes in the recount, not nearly enough to catch up and overtake Boebert's lead.
However, as the results came in, it became clear there would be more of a red trickle.
Republicans lost several key races they had hoped to win, frustrating their effort to recapture House and Senate majorities.
However, the Democratic Party's would-be 51-seat Senate majority was unexpectedly snatched away by Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema's decision to switch and register as an independent.

     Summary: This combo image shows Democratic candidate for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District Adam Frisch and U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. APDenver — An automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch.
The nail-biter race showed the renowned conservative firebrand's combative style is wearying voters in her conservative Colorado district.
Frisch netted a total of four votes in the recount, far from enough to close a 500-plus vote gap with Boebert.
Until election night, Boebert had been heavily favored to win reelection after redistricting made the sprawling, conservative district more Republican.
The one-time owner of a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, Boebert comfortably won the district in 2020′s general election and swiftly established herself as a partisan flashpoint in Washington.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) officially clinched another term in the House on Monday after a recount confirmed her razor-thin victory in her reelection bid.
A tally of the vote showed Boebert defeating her Democratic opponent Adam Frisch by just 546 votes.
While the narrow margin in the race triggered a mandatory recount under Colorado state law, Frisch, a conservative Democrat, conceded to Boebert last month, acknowledging that the recount was highly unlikely to swing the outcome of the contest.
Boebert ultimately finished on top in the initial tally, but only by a fraction of a percentage point.
In announcing his concession to Boebert last month, he urged supporters not to donate to his campaign during the recount.
