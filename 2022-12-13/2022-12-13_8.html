     Blake Shelton Once Sent Jennifer Hudson a Goat for Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blake Shelton stopped by Jennifer Hudson‘s talk show on Monday (Dec. 12) to reminisce about the time he gifted her a goat — yes, an actual goat — for Christmas.
We wanted you to come back to The Voice, not start your own freaking talk show!” the country star joked with his former co-star before plugging the singing competition’s season 22 finale.
“I think at some point I asked you, I said, ‘I really would like to get him a goat for Christmas.’ And so, got him a pygmy goat.
“But then then the season was over and I wasn’t gonna see y’all, so I had to, like, get an airplane to fly this freaking goat from Oklahoma to Chicago,” Shelton continued.
“I mean, this goat had, like, a first-class ride.”Hudson went on to share that her son named the pygmy goat Prancer and called the experience “one of the most memorable Christmases for my kid, ever.”Watch Shelton and Hudson recount the story of the Christmas goat below.

     Blake Shelton Just Posted an Embarrassing TikTok and 'Voice' Fans Are Losing It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 11 years of being a coach on The Voice, folks might think Blake Shelton only loves to ham it up for the TV cameras.
Back in November, the country singer posted a clip on TikTok in which he promoted his collaboration with Lands' End.
But in typical Blake fashion, he didn't do it via a promotional video discussing the items in the collection.
Instead, wife Gwen Stefani caught him browsing his latest clothing pieces while flying on what looked to be a private jet.
If there's one thing consistent about Blake, it's that he's not afraid to get folks laughing even at his own expense.
