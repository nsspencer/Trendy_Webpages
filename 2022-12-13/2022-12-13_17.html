     Carmelo Anthony Had the Perfect Response to Not Being in the NBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carmelo Anthony was asked about his aspirations to return to the NBA on Monday night and it would’ve been hard to script a better response.
“I love the game, I will say that, but I realise there’s a lot of things that’s not in my control,” Anthony said on ESPN.
I’m cool and I get to watch my son play, train him, be around him.
Bronny, meanwhile, put up 12 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals.
Sierra Canyon won the game 62-51, but if Melo gets his way, Kiyan won’t be far behind Bronny in chasing his NBA dream.
