     Blake Shelton Just Posted an Embarrassing TikTok and 'Voice' Fans Are Losing It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 11 years of being a coach on The Voice, folks might think Blake Shelton only loves to ham it up for the TV cameras.
Back in November, the country singer posted a clip on TikTok in which he promoted his collaboration with Lands' End.
But in typical Blake fashion, he didn't do it via a promotional video discussing the items in the collection.
Instead, wife Gwen Stefani caught him browsing his latest clothing pieces while flying on what looked to be a private jet.
If there's one thing consistent about Blake, it's that he's not afraid to get folks laughing even at his own expense.
