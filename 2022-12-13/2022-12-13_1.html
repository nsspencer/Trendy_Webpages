    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second day of the World Cup 2022 semifinals will pit two-time champions and holders France against Morocco.
The only remaining Arab and African team are now just two wins away from lifting the World Cup trophy.
Kashef strongly favours France for the win, giving the team a 68 percent chance of ending Morocco’s fairytale World Cup run.
This still gives the Atlas Lions a one in three chance of reaching the World Cup final.

     France v. Morocco: An Unlikely Semi-Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: France, the two-time world champs and current holders of the title, and they are stacked with talent once again.
In fact, if you split their squad in half, the French could probably produce two teams good enough to win the World Cup.
Much like Croatia, the longer the game remains even, the better this Morocco side seems to get.
If France fails to find an early goal, then they’re going to have to strap-in for a long night.
Morocco could leave now with their heads held high and be received by their countrymen as heroes.
