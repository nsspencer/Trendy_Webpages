     Bills bring Cole Beasley back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beasley, the wide receiver who said in October that he was retiring, is signing with the Bills’ practice squad, according to Mike Garafolo of NFL Network.
The Bills released Beasley in March and he was out of the NFL for the entire offseason before signing with the Buccaneers in September.
But he apparently has decided to give it another try, on a Bills team he knows well, for a chance to win a Super Bowl.
The 33-year-old Beasley caught 82 passes for 693 yards for the Bills last season.
Originally an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys, Beasley played seven seasons in Dallas and three in Buffalo.

     Summary: NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo reported Tuesday morning that the Bills are signing the veteran receiver to the practice squad and expected to elevate him to the game-day roster in short order, per sources informed of the situation.
In his last season with the Bills, the 33-year-old posted 82 catches for 693 yards and one TD in 16 games.
The previous two seasons, the veteran receiver was enmeshed in controversy over his decision not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and took issue with many of the NFL's protocols at the time.
Beasley signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice squad in September but played in just two games, catching four passes for 17 yards, before his release.
The Bills have been searching for veteran depth behind Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis and Isaiah McKenzie.
