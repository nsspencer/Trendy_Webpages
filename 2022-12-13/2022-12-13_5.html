     Taylor Swift, songwriters agree to end ‘Shake It Off’ copyright case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two songwriters have dropped their lawsuit claiming Grammy-winning musician Taylor Swift copied their lyrics in her 2014 number-one hit “Shake It Off,” according to court documents filed on Monday.
Monday’s court papers, filed jointly by attorneys for both Swift and the songwriters, did not say if there was a settlement.
In “Shake It Off,” Swift sings: “the players gonna play, play, play, play, play, and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.”“Playas Gon’ Play,” written by Hall and Butler, included the phrases “playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate.” The song, performed by R&amp;B group 3LW, was released in 2001 and appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and MTV’s Total Request Live.
A judge dismissed the case in 2018, but a U.S. appeals court revived it in 2019.

     Taylor Swift Fans Were Surprised With A Second Chance To Buy Eras Tickets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of Taylor Swift's devastated fans got a surprise Christmas gift on Monday: a second chance at tickets to the Eras tour.
But some of them on Monday got an email from Ticketmaster that they'd get a second chance.
"Congratulations, you have been selected to participate in a limited-time opportunity to request to purchase 2 tickets to Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour," the email from Ticketmaster reads.
Holly Perry, a Swift fan in Los Angeles, had set aside hours during a vacation to buy tickets the first time.
They said in a statement that Ticketmaster's lack of competition became "painfully obvious" after Ticketmaster failed fans trying to buy the concert tickets.
