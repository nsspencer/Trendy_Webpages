     Cubs target Carlos Correa agrees to 13-year deal with Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correa, the All-Star free agent shortstop and a top Cubs offseason target, has agreed to a 13-year deal with the San Francisco Giants, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported Tuesday night.
The deal is worth $350 million, for an average annual value of about $27 million for the 28-year-old Correa.
BREAKING: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source familiar with the deal tells ESPN.
Trea Turner came off the board first, landing a 11-year, $300 million deal with the Phillies last week.
Xander Bogaerts then landed his own 11-year deal, worth $280 million, with the Padres.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants and Carlos Correa are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source confirmed to NBC Sports Bay Area.
The mark was previously held by only Bryce Harper, a player Farhan Zaidi and the Giants chased in 2019.
The agreement between Correa and the Giants was first reported by ESPN's Jeff Passan.
In Correa, the Giants are betting on a 28-year-old shortstop who is just one year removed from winning the Platinum Glove given to the best fielder in baseball.
The Giants had previously offered Harper $310 million and Judge $360 million to lead the way, but both ended up elsewhere.

     MLB free agency: Giants land Carlos Correa with 13-year, $350 million contract, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa and the Giants have agreed to a massive 13-year contract worth $350 million, reports ESPN.
Neither happened and Correa opted out of his contract after the season, and cashed in huge this winter.
Overall, Correa's $350 million pact is the fourth-largest deal for an MLB player, trailing only Mike Trout's $426.5 million extension with the Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million extension with the Dodgers, and Aaron Judge's recent $360 million deal with the Yankees.
Correa's bat will significantly improve a Giants offense that last season ranked seventh in runs scored and eighth in OPS.
The Correa deal is a sorely needed splash for Giants president of baseball operation Farhan Zaidi, who earlier this offseason missed out on Judge.

     San Francisco Giants, Carlos Correa agree to 13-year, $350M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The $350 million exceeds the $341 million shortstop Francisco Lindor received from the New York Mets and the $340 million for shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. with the San Diego Padres.
And in the history of baseball, only Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Judge's exceed it in value.
Before Correa, the last player the Giants signed to a $100 million-plus contract was pitcher Johnny Cueto, who received a six-year, $130 million deal in December 2015.
Only three primary shortstops in the expansion era (since 1961) produced more WAR through their age-27 season than Carlos Correa.
By his second season, Correa was one of the best players in baseball.

     Fantasy Baseball Offseason Tracker: Giants sign Carlos Correa to mega deal; Sean Murphy headlines catcher swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's where you'll find our breakdown of the biggest moves -- i.e., the ones with serious implications for Fantasy Baseball.
Murphy hit .226 with a .702 OPS in Oakland last year compared to .272 with an .812 OPS on the road.
His stock no doubt improves with this deal, though there isn't much room to move him up in an increasingly crowded catcher crop.
Of course, the fact Manaea fits into that category gives you some idea how far his Fantasy stock has fallen.
Senga's 2022 stats (in Japan): 11-6, 1.89 ERA, 1.04 WHIP, 148 IP, 50 BB, 159 KOf course, there are risks.

     Correa agrees to 13-year megadeal with Giants (source)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the on-field component only proved a shadow of his true value -- as the Twins quickly discovered.
An analytical and probing mind with natural charisma, Correa quickly became the leader of the Minnesota clubhouse, able to connect with the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking sides of the team alike and earning respect for his attitude and preparation.
Now with the Giants, he'll seek a similarly prominent voice as a cornerstone player of the future -- and he'll be around to see it through.
In Correa, the Giants have a marquee player who will inject some much-needed star power on a team that will be tasked with competing with two heavyweights -- the Dodgers and Padres -- in the National League West.
There are still some holes left to be filled, particularly in the bullpen, but the Giants’ big splash should go a long way toward closing the gap with their division rivals.
