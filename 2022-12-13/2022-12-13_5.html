     Morocco vs France: A history of pirate raids and brutal colonialism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ahead of Morocco versus France on Wednesday, here's what you need to know about the history of relations between the two countries.
‚ÄúWe have conquered the Iberian peninsula and are prepared to battle France,‚Äù tweeted one user, comparing Morocco in the years 732 and 2022 respectively.
Unlike Algeria, which became part of France, Morocco was technically not a colony but a protectorate - the country‚Äôs sultan continued as head of state.
Morocco and France have mostly maintained friendly ties in the decades since independence.
There is believed to be over 1.5 million people of Moroccan origin living in France, representing the largest Moroccan diaspora in the world.
