     Summary: BLUE RIDGE, Texas — The tornado that struck Blue Ridge in rural Collin County Tuesday morning damaged or destroyed every building on the properties shared by the Reising-Diehl families along FM 545.
But the same tornado also showed how quickly a family like theirs jumps into the act of rescuing each other.
I’m just glad we’re all safe.”“I knew it was coming,” said their grandfather Donald Reising who rode out the tornado inside his home.
As Reising and his family began salvaging what they could and started temporary repairs on damaged roofs, they learned that the tornado damage that appears to have started on their property extends all the way through the town of Blue Ridge where additional homes were damaged, Blue Ridge High School and Blue Ridge Middle School suffered minor damage too, and trees were snapped and tombstones overturned at the Blue Ridge Cemetery.
“I don’t know what to say,” Donald Reising added as he watched his sons and daughters and grandchildren working together to clean up the tornado damage.
