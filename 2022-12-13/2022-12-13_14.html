     Summary: Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance Getty ImagesBinance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said Tuesday it is pausing withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC USDC while it completes a token swap involving the asset.
Withdrawals in other tokens tied to the value of the dollar–specifically tether and BUSD BUSD , a stablecoin developed by Binance and blockchain-focused firm Paxos–are unaffected.
Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive, added in a Twitter post: “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals.
However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in New York in USD.
As of 10:46 a.m. New York time, all three major stablecoins, tether, USD coin (USDC) and BUSD, are trading a little under $1, according to Nomics.

     Summary: 1/2 https://t.co/uF9lLPDSyS — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022The bank run on Binance comes a month after CZ triggered a bank run on FTX, which led to liquidity issues and its eventual collapse.
Despite the FUD rampant within the crypto community, many members remain optimistic that Binance will weather the storm and not share the same fate as FTX.
Others are speculating that if Binance goes down, the entire crypto industry might be brought to its knees.
You realise if Binance goes down everything else will crumble?
The fact is, time is the #1 audit and binance has proven the test of time.”The media are trying to cause a bank run on @binance.
