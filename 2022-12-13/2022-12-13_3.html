     Summary: Never in Aubrey Caparello's wildest dreams did she think she would see her teachers dress up as Taylor Swift at school.
But Tuesday was a fairytale, as Swift Creek Middle School — dubbed "Swifty Creek" for the day as a reference to the singer's fans known as "Swifties" — celebrated the singer's 33rd birthday with a special breakfast and lunch, teacher karaoke and performances from the school band.

     Summary: Swifties, cancel all your vigilante shit, because this is no hoax: Taylor Swift has gotten you another opportunity to purchase tickets for the Eras Tour.
Yes, you may have had the sense you’d been betrayed by the treacherous Ticketmaster, but Swift simply wouldn’t tolerate it.
Your fearless leader has once again stood up to the man, and long story short, tickets are going back on sale.
This will surely come as welcome news for Swift’s fans, but after all the mess, it’s unlikely that vigilante shit will actually be canceled.
And by vigilante shit, we mean totally above-board legal action against Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation.

     Taylor Swift Fans Were Surprised With A Second Chance To Buy Eras Tickets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of Taylor Swift's devastated fans got a surprise Christmas gift on Monday: a second chance at tickets to the Eras tour.
But some of them on Monday got an email from Ticketmaster that they'd get a second chance.
"Congratulations, you have been selected to participate in a limited-time opportunity to request to purchase 2 tickets to Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour," the email from Ticketmaster reads.
Holly Perry, a Swift fan in Los Angeles, had set aside hours during a vacation to buy tickets the first time.
They said in a statement that Ticketmaster's lack of competition became "painfully obvious" after Ticketmaster failed fans trying to buy the concert tickets.

Those select folks received an email Monday from Ticketmaster saying, “You have been identified as a fan who received a boost during the Verified Fan presale but did not purchase tickets.
AdvertisementAn FAQ on the Ticketmaster website explains that fans who got the email will have an opportunity to buy a maximum of two tickets to a Swift show.
The Verified Fan program requires advance registration and offers invite codes, lottery-style, to randomly selected interested individuals.
Even with the second-chance invites promised to Swifties, potential buyers are still not guaranteed to receive tickets, the Ticketmaster site says.

     Summary: Fortunately, we have such an occasion — Swift’s birthday, as the star turns 33 on Dec. 13.
It’s a good, celebratory time to try to pull out a best songs list.
But given her catalog of 225-plus songs, even cutting a best list down to 50 is a tough task, so that ended up being where we drew the line.
If your favorite Swift song is missing from this highly subjective, critical 50-best list, rest assured that it’s probably in our unspoken 51st or 52nd slot.
