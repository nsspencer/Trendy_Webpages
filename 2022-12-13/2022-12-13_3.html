     Taylor Swift pushes Ticketmaster to sell more Eras Tour tickets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Swifties, cancel all your vigilante shit, because this is no hoax: Taylor Swift has gotten you another opportunity to purchase tickets for the Eras Tour.
Yes, you may have had the sense you’d been betrayed by the treacherous Ticketmaster, but Swift simply wouldn’t tolerate it.
Your fearless leader has once again stood up to the man, and long story short, tickets are going back on sale.
This will surely come as welcome news for Swift’s fans, but after all the mess, it’s unlikely that vigilante shit will actually be canceled.
And by vigilante shit, we mean totally above-board legal action against Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation.

     Summary: Some Taylor Swift fans are getting a second chance to buy tickets for the singer’s upcoming Eras Tour.
Those select folks received an email Monday from Ticketmaster saying, “You have been identified as a fan who received a boost during the Verified Fan presale but did not purchase tickets.
AdvertisementAn FAQ on the Ticketmaster website explains that fans who got the email will have an opportunity to buy a maximum of two tickets to a Swift show.
The Verified Fan program requires advance registration and offers invite codes, lottery-style, to randomly selected interested individuals.
Even with the second-chance invites promised to Swifties, potential buyers are still not guaranteed to receive tickets, the Ticketmaster site says.
