     Ari Aster’s Film is Now Titled ‘Beau is Afraid’ — World of Reel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, there you go.
Ari Aster’s “Disappointment Boulevard” is now called “Beau is Afraid,” according to A24.
In that same tweet, a poster could be seen of a young boy in animation form.
In 2011, Aster directed a short film titled “Beau.” Described as a “decades-spanning surrealist horror film set in an alternate present,” Phoenix’s character would play an “extremely anxious but pleasant-looking man who has a fraught relationship with his overbearing mother and never knew his father.” When his mother dies, he makes a journey home that involves some wild supernatural threats.
You can actually watch “Beau is Afraid” on YouTube.

     Ari Aster's 'Beau Is Afraid': Cast, Plot, Release Date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ari Aster, the distinctive director whose given audiences such mind-melding films as his feature debut Hereditary (2018) and the Florence Pugh-starring Midsommar (2019) has revealed the first look at his latest A24 film, Beau Is Afraid.
Originally titled Disappointment Blvd, the long-awaited film stars Joaquin Phoenix and is slated for a 2023 release date in theaters.
Aster is reportedly writing, producing and directing Beau Is Afraid, which is currently in production.
The director has been pegged as one of the most exciting auteurs in film today after the success of Hereditary and Midsommar.
Like Beau, Hereditary was also a family drama that included supernatural elements, with several sinister twists, to say the least.
