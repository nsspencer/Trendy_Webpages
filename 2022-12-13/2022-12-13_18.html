     Ari Aster’s Film is Now Titled ‘Beau is Afraid’ — World of Reel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, there you go.
Ari Aster’s “Disappointment Boulevard” is now called “Beau is Afraid,” according to A24.
In that same tweet, a poster could be seen of a young boy in animation form.
In 2011, Aster directed a short film titled “Beau.” Described as a “decades-spanning surrealist horror film set in an alternate present,” Phoenix’s character would play an “extremely anxious but pleasant-looking man who has a fraught relationship with his overbearing mother and never knew his father.” When his mother dies, he makes a journey home that involves some wild supernatural threats.
You can actually watch “Beau is Afraid” on YouTube.
