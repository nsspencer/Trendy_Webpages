     Watch Camila Cabello Channel Wednesday Addams As She Recreates Iconic Dance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Camila Cabello is a Wednesday Addams lookalike in a new video where she recreated the iconic dance scene from the Netflix hit series Wednesday, hoping her team on The Voice will dance, dance, dance all the way to championship.
Cabello took to TikTok on Monday (December 13) ahead of the two-night season finale of The Voice to share a video of her and contestant Morgan Myles dancing to a revamped version of Lady Gaga's "Bloody Mary" as part of a new TikTok trend that has users dancing like Wednesday from the show.
While Myles stunned in a sparkling long-sleeved red gown, the "Bam Bam" singer looked just like Wednesday in a gorgeous strapless black gown with matching elbow-length gloves and dark makeup, complete with the character's signature intense stare.

     Camila Cabello Is in Her Wednesday Era With Black Lipstick and a Faux Bridge Piercing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Wednesday Addams is most likely digging up a grave somewhere (for fun and in the fictional world, of course), Camila Cabello is out here in the real world closing out the season final of The Voice with a vivacious black lip and a glitter faux bridge piercing.
Who else could bring Cabello's Wednesday era to life other than her right-hand makeup artist, Patrick Ta?
Her liking for the nude lip hues turned itself over to the dark side on December 12 as Ta shared a glam-fie of her latest makeup look on Instagram.
On her lips lays a satin black lipstick.
He lined the lower lash line of her eyes with white eyeliner as well, so her brightened eyes coordinated perfectly with her pearled choker.
