     Summary: Inflation dips in November, as gasoline savings eclipse grocery price increasesEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesAmericans are saving money at the gas pump, only to spend it in the produce aisle.
Gasoline and grocery prices moved in opposite directions last month, as the overall inflation rate declined slightly.
For a year, Americans have seen racing inflation eat away at their savings and add to their credit card debt.
Grocery prices rose 0.5% in November, led by a whopping 8.9% jump in the price of lettuce.

     Inflation slowed in November, offering relief for consumers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The top contributor to the monthly price increase came from shelter costs, which rose 0.6% in November.
But prices fell for a host of goods, including gasoline, used cars and trucks and medical services.
"In a world where inflation is rising at double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America," he said.
Hiring last month exceeded expectations and wages grew a blistering 5.1% compared to a year earlier, offering welcome relief for workers strained by price hikes.
Despite the robust job market, growing evidence suggests the Fed's rate hikes have put the brakes on some economic activity.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's especially true of "core inflation," which strips out price trends in food and energy, like gasoline, heating oil and electricity.
In other words: "core" inflation gives a better sense of the future inflationary trend in the U.S., economists said.
watch nowWhen inflation is low and stable, monthly core inflation is roughly 0.2%, on average, said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
"The good news is, we're seeing energy prices and food prices come off their highs," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.
The "shelter" index is up 7.1% over the last year, accounting for about half of the increase in annual "core" inflation, according to the BLS.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From October to November, core prices rose 0.2% — the mildest increase since August 2021.
Housing costs also jumped, though much of that data doesn’t yet reflect real-time measures that show declines in home prices and apartment rents.
Some of those trends extended into last month’s data, with goods prices, excluding food and energy, falling 0.5% from October to November, the second straight monthly drop.
Yet even in services, excluding housing, there were some signs of cooling prices.
Overall, a measure that approximates services excluding rent was unchanged in November, after having dipped 0.1% in October.

     Summary: President Joe Biden on Tuesday celebrated the positive consumer price index report that showed inflation easing in the United States ahead of the holiday season.
"We learned last month that the inflation rate came down, down more than experts expected," Biden said, speaking from the White House.
"In a world where inflation is rising in double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America."
But he said the positive economic news confirms that his economic policies are working, and urged Americans to stay the course.
"What is clear is my economic plan is working and we're just getting started," Biden said.

     Biden seeks political boost from slowing inflation

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight “Inflation is coming down in America,” Biden said, declaring it a reason for optimism ahead of the holiday season and the year ahead.
A number of other figures — including “core inflation,” which removes volatile categories like food and energy prices — also showed smaller increases.
“So much for President Biden’s claim that inflation peaked one year ago — grocery prices rose by 12 percent over the last year,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.
Conservatives argued that all this spending was paving the way for runaway inflation, even as Biden said it was critical to provide relief to suffering Americans.
He also attributed the improving economic outlook to moves by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, and to the White House policy of not meddling in those decisions.

     Summary: Prices rose less than expected for November 2022, improving the inflation outlook for Federal ... [+] Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Stripping out food and energy costs, prices rose 0.2% for the month, or 6% on a 12-month view.
For example, food costs rose, but the cost of many proteins now is falling.
Housing Costs RoseThe primary contributor to inflation in November was housing, as costs rose 0.6% for the month.
Rate Hikes LikelyDespite recent encouraging inflation data, the Fed is still expected to raise interest rates into early 2023.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The November CPI headline rate marked the fifth-straight monthly decline and was better than economists’ expectations of 7.3%.
“I think we’re finally getting some indication that we’re getting relief on the inflation front,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN in an interview.
Some signs of supply chain improvementThe current inflation issues continue to be driven by supply shocks including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic, Sweet said.
That should help inflation move even closer to the Fed’s 2% target by later next year, he added.
However, one factor that could also contribute to lower inflation next year is not exactly welcome: a recession, Sweet said.

In fact, this new report is the fifth month in a row where annual inflation has fallen in the United States.
Most Americans can see the progress driving down the street, finding relief at the pump as gas prices fall.
Gas prices are now lower than they were a year ago, and half the gas stations selling gas at — are selling gas at $3.09 or less.
Today’s report contains another pri- — piece of good news: Food inflation has slowed last month, providing much-needed relief for millions of families at the grocery store.
