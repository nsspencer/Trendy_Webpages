     After benching, Marcus Mariota leaves Falcons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After being benched for rookie Desmond Ridder for performance reasons, Mariota has left the team.
Coach Arthur Smith has said Mariota will be placed on injured reserve.
Via Josh Kendall of TheAthletic.com, Smith said Tuesday that Mariota is currently not with the Falcons.
Smith told Mariota last Thursday that he’ll be benched for Ridder.

     Why Marcus Mariota left Falcons shortly after Arthur Smith announced Desmond Ridder as starting QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the Atlanta Falcons, it only seemed like a matter of time before Desmond Ridder got the starting job at quarterback.
If they weren't competitive, it's likely Arthur Smith would have ridden it out with Marcus Mariota.
According to The Athletic's Josh Kendall, Mariota left the team Friday, a day after Ridder was named the starter to address what is being called a chronic knee issue.
Between Ridder, Woodside, and Feleipe Franks, the Falcons now have three quarterbacks who have thrown four NFL passes.
While Mariota will be due a base salary of $9 million, as well as a $3 million roster bonus, neither is guaranteed.

     Falcons QB Marcus Mariota's Injury 'Nothing to Do' with Benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith revealed how much Marcus Mariota's injury influenced his decision to make a quarterback change to Desmond Ridder.
During a Monday press conference, Atlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith officially named rookie Desmond Ridder the team's starting quarterback moving forward, replacing veteran starter Marcus Mariota.
In his absence, the Falcons signed Logan Woodside off the Tennessee Titans practice squad to serve as Ridder's backup.
Moreover, Smith shared that it's been a push from Mariota, not the team, to get the knee injury looked at.
Thus, considering the timeline of events and statement from Smith, it's evident that Mariota's injury failed to play a part in the final outcome.

     Summary: FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — Falcons head coach Arthur Smith knew he was taking a risk last week when he chose to make rookie Desmond Ridder his starting quarterback.
The first came in 2019 when Mariota was Tennessee’s starting quarterback and Smith was the Titans’ offensive coordinator.
(Aaron M. Sprecher / Associated Press)The Falcons signed Mariota to a two-year, $18.75 million deal in the offseason.
“We would have had to adapt if he had had to play early in the season,” Smith said.
If it benefits us in the long term, that’s a really good thing for us.”(Top photo of Marcus Mariota, left, and Desmond Ridder: Justin Casterline / Getty Images)
