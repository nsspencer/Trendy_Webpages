     Biden celebrates easing inflation numbers, defends his economic policies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden on Tuesday celebrated the positive consumer price index report that showed inflation easing in the United States ahead of the holiday season.
"We learned last month that the inflation rate came down, down more than experts expected," Biden said, speaking from the White House.
"In a world where inflation is rising in double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America."
But he said the positive economic news confirms that his economic policies are working, and urged Americans to stay the course.
"What is clear is my economic plan is working and we're just getting started," Biden said.

Gasoline and grocery prices moved in opposite directions last month, as the overall inflation rate declined slightly.
For a year, Americans have seen racing inflation eat away at their savings and add to their credit card debt.
Grocery prices rose 0.5% in November, led by a whopping 8.9% jump in the price of lettuce.

     Here’s the inflation breakdown for November 2022 — in one chart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's especially true of "core inflation," which strips out price trends in food and energy, like gasoline, heating oil and electricity.
In other words: "core" inflation gives a better sense of the future inflationary trend in the U.S., economists said.
watch nowWhen inflation is low and stable, monthly core inflation is roughly 0.2%, on average, said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
"The good news is, we're seeing energy prices and food prices come off their highs," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.
The "shelter" index is up 7.1% over the last year, accounting for about half of the increase in annual "core" inflation, according to the BLS.

     Inflation slowed in November, offering relief for consumers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The top contributor to the monthly price increase came from shelter costs, which rose 0.6% in November.
But prices fell for a host of goods, including gasoline, used cars and trucks and medical services.
"In a world where inflation is rising at double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America," he said.
Hiring last month exceeded expectations and wages grew a blistering 5.1% compared to a year earlier, offering welcome relief for workers strained by price hikes.
Despite the robust job market, growing evidence suggests the Fed's rate hikes have put the brakes on some economic activity.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From October to November, core prices rose 0.2% — the mildest increase since August 2021.
Housing costs also jumped, though much of that data doesn’t yet reflect real-time measures that show declines in home prices and apartment rents.
Some of those trends extended into last month’s data, with goods prices, excluding food and energy, falling 0.5% from October to November, the second straight monthly drop.
Yet even in services, excluding housing, there were some signs of cooling prices.
Overall, a measure that approximates services excluding rent was unchanged in November, after having dipped 0.1% in October.

     Inflation-weary Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McKinsey worked alongside the market research and opinion-polling firm Ipsos to query 2,010 Americans in fall 2022.
This article, part of a series, presents the survey’s findings on access to economic opportunity, the steady rise in prices, and the hard budget choices households are facing.
Persistent inflation weighs on Americans’ near- and long-term outlookIn one significant way, Americans have reason to be optimistic.
Higher-income Americans (more than $100,000 annually) experienced the highest drop of 24 points in overall economic sentiment compared with that of six months ago.
With cash buffers from the stimulus checks running low among low-income households, Americans are increasingly resorting to drawing down savings and running up credit card debt.

     Summary: In a world where inflation is rising at double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America.
In fact, this new report is the fifth month in a row where annual inflation has fallen in the United States.
Most Americans can see the progress driving down the street, finding relief at the pump as gas prices fall.
Gas prices are now lower than they were a year ago, and half the gas stations selling gas at — are selling gas at $3.09 or less.
Today’s report contains another pri- — piece of good news: Food inflation has slowed last month, providing much-needed relief for millions of families at the grocery store.

     Wall Street closes higher after inflation cooled in November
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks on Wall Street finished higher Tuesday after a report showed inflation cooled more than expected last month, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve is about to dial down the size of its interest rate hikes.
Smaller hikes to interest rates would mean less added pain to both the economy and to markets.
A hike of 0.50 percentage points would usually be a big deal because it’s double the typical move.
Despite the encouraging data, analysts cautioned that the Fed’s fight against inflation — and its hikes to interest rates — still has further to go.
Even if the Fed is moving at smaller increments each time, it may still ultimately take rates higher than markets expect.
