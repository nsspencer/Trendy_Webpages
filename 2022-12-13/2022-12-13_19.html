     Binance Customer Withdrawals Exceed $3 Billion in 24 Hours
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Behemoth crypto exchange Binance has seen massive withdrawals in the past week and—on Tuesday—the highest amount of one-day withdrawals since June, Nansen data has revealed.
Binance’s international arm saw over $8.78 billion leave its exchange and $5.1 billion in incoming funds, meaning the exchange faced a net outflow of roughly $3.66 billion.
While such data only refers to Binance’s Ethereum and ERC-20 token movements, approximately 63% of Binance’s portfolio is on Ethereum and the outflows are much larger compared to other crypto exchanges over the same period.
On Ethereum, Jump withdrew about $18.4 million this week and pulled about $123.4 million from Binance last week.
According to Nansen’s portfolio tracker, Binance’s total portfolio has decreased by $3.6 billion in just the past eight hours.
