Indeed, it is the most important agricultural pollinator on our planet, given that one third of our food supply depends directly on pollination from bees.

Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive, added in a Twitter post: “On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals.

     Crypto firm Binance says deposits returning after heavy withdrawals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON/SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The head of major crypto exchange Binance said on Wednesday deposits were returning, a day after it saw heavy outflows of cryptocurrencies and halted some stablecoin withdrawals.
On Tuesday, blockchain data firm Nansen said Binance saw withdrawals of $1.9 billion in 24 hours, the largest such outflow since June.
Users had pulled out $3.7 billion in crypto over the seven days to Tuesday, it later added.
loadingBinance also temporarily halted withdrawals of the major USDC stablecoin, citing a so-called "token swap".
How crypto exchanges such as Binance and its now-bankrupt former rival FTX handle customer deposits has come under close scrutiny from users, regulators and policymakers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Thurman, content lead for Nansen, told CNN that at its peak, Binance saw “as high as $3 billion in net outflows” over a 24-hour basis.
Earlier Tuesday, Binance had already seen its “highest daily withdrawals since June,” according to Nansen’s analysis.
The rate of withdrawals has since stabilized to approximately $79 million in net outflows, the firm’s data showed as of Tuesday evening ET.
Zhao acknowledged the outflow situation on Tuesday, tweeting that Binance had at one point seen “some withdrawals” of roughly $1.1 billion.
Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits.
