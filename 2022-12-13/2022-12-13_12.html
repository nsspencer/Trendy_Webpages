     Biden celebrates easing inflation numbers, defends his economic policies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden on Tuesday celebrated the positive consumer price index report that showed inflation easing in the United States ahead of the holiday season.
"We learned last month that the inflation rate came down, down more than experts expected," Biden said, speaking from the White House.
"In a world where inflation is rising in double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America."
But he said the positive economic news confirms that his economic policies are working, and urged Americans to stay the course.
"What is clear is my economic plan is working and we're just getting started," Biden said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prices rose less than expected for November 2022, improving the inflation outlook for Federal ... [+] Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Stripping out food and energy costs, prices rose 0.2% for the month, or 6% on a 12-month view.
For example, food costs rose, but the cost of many proteins now is falling.
Housing Costs RoseThe primary contributor to inflation in November was housing, as costs rose 0.6% for the month.
Rate Hikes LikelyDespite recent encouraging inflation data, the Fed is still expected to raise interest rates into early 2023.

     Summary: Inflation dips in November, as gasoline savings eclipse grocery price increasesEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesAmericans are saving money at the gas pump, only to spend it in the produce aisle.
Gasoline and grocery prices moved in opposite directions last month, as the overall inflation rate declined slightly.
For a year, Americans have seen racing inflation eat away at their savings and add to their credit card debt.
Grocery prices rose 0.5% in November, led by a whopping 8.9% jump in the price of lettuce.

     Inflation slowed in November, offering relief for consumers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The top contributor to the monthly price increase came from shelter costs, which rose 0.6% in November.
But prices fell for a host of goods, including gasoline, used cars and trucks and medical services.
"In a world where inflation is rising at double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America," he said.
Hiring last month exceeded expectations and wages grew a blistering 5.1% compared to a year earlier, offering welcome relief for workers strained by price hikes.
Despite the robust job market, growing evidence suggests the Fed's rate hikes have put the brakes on some economic activity.

     WATCH: ‘Economic plan is working’ to slow inflation, Biden says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden delivered remarks on Tuesday following reports that inflation has slowed again last month – the latest sign that price increases are gradually cooling despite the pressures they continue to inflict on American households.
Economists have warned that in continuing to tighten credit to fight inflation, the Fed is likely to cause a recession next year.
Still, services costs are likely to stay persistently high, Powell suggested.
Services businesses tend to pass on some of their higher labor costs to their customers by charging more, thereby perpetuating inflation.
Economists expect the Fed to further slow its rate hikes next year, with quarter-point increases in February and March if inflation remains relatively subdued.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From October to November, core prices rose 0.2% — the mildest increase since August 2021.
Housing costs also jumped, though much of that data doesn’t yet reflect real-time measures that show declines in home prices and apartment rents.
Some of those trends extended into last month’s data, with goods prices, excluding food and energy, falling 0.5% from October to November, the second straight monthly drop.
Yet even in services, excluding housing, there were some signs of cooling prices.
Overall, a measure that approximates services excluding rent was unchanged in November, after having dipped 0.1% in October.

Gas prices are now lower than they were a year ago, and half the gas stations selling gas at — are selling gas at $3.09 or less.

     Biden seeks political boost from slowing inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight “Inflation is coming down in America,” Biden said, declaring it a reason for optimism ahead of the holiday season and the year ahead.
A number of other figures — including “core inflation,” which removes volatile categories such as food and energy prices — also showed smaller increases.
“So much for President Biden’s claim that inflation peaked one year ago — grocery prices rose by 12 percent over the last year,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.
Conservatives argued that all this spending was paving the way for runaway inflation, even as Biden said it was crucial to provide relief to suffering Americans.
He also attributed the improving economic outlook to moves by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, and to the White House policy of not meddling in those decisions.
