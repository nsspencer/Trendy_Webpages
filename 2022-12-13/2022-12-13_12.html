     Avatar: The Way of Water movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Avatar: The Way of Water" struggles to find its footing at first, throwing viewers back into the world of Pandora in a narratively clunky way.
"Avatar: The Way of Water" once again casts the military, planet-destroying humans of this universe as its truest villains, but the villains' motives are sometimes a bit hazy.
The bulk of "Avatar: The Way of Water" hinges on the same question Sarah Connor asks in the "Terminator" movies—fight or flight for family?
Do you run and hide from the powerful enemy to try and stay safe or turn and fight the oppressive evil?
They dare to hunt sacred water animals in stunning sequences during which you have to remind yourself that none of what you're watching is real.

     Avatar: The Way of Water is a gorgeous rehash of all the first film’s triumphs and failures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The original Avatar’s story was little more than a white savior narrative cosplaying as a sci-fi epic.
But the movie’s breathtaking visuals and astonishing level of rich detail made the prospect of returning to the alien world of Pandora for multiple sequels an interesting — if a bit dubious — one.
In a number of mostly technical ways, Avatar: The Way of Water is a superior film to its predecessor and a filmmaking marvel that’s a testament to Cameron’s ability to craft immersive, breathtaking set pieces.
Set some years after the events of 2009’s Avatar, The Way of Water continues the story of human marine-turned-Na’vi savior Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his mate Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) as they raise their gaggle of children in Pandora’s lush forests.
It’s the sort of visual that perfectly encapsulates everything that was wild (read: exhausting) about the original Avatar and feels reflective of how uninterested Cameron is in elevating the franchise beyond a rather base and fetishistic power fantasy.

     Avatar: The Way of Water Puts Most Modern Blockbusters to Shame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And are there new delights to be discovered in the alien world of Pandora, all these years after the original Avatar?
But after a slow start, The Way of Water manages to repeat that formula without being a tired retread.
Instead, The Way of Water sees Jake and his family leave their life in the Pandoran forest to escape Quaritch, moving to an oceanside community to learn the way of, well, water.
But The Way of Water wouldn’t work if it didn’t nail the ending, and use that accumulated scale in service of something genuinely jaw-dropping.
But for The Way of Water, the decadence is more than enough—for cinemas that have been starved of authentic spectacle, finally, here’s a gorgeous three-course meal of it.

     Review: ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ is a big screen blast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This image released by 20th Century Studios shows Stephen Lang, as Quaritch, in a scene from “Avatar: The Way of Water.” (20th Century Studios via AP)It is impossible to talk about “Avatar: The Way of Water” without sounding hyperbolic.
“The Way of Water” will make awe-struck believers out of even “Avatar” agonistics like me, at least for three hours and 12 minutes.
“Never doubt James Cameron” has become a bit of a rallying cry lately, at least among those left on Twitter.
Even as “The Way of Water” release date actually approached the “who cares?” chorus intensified.
Maybe it’s just the magic of James Cameron.

     ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ rekindles the wonder in a way that demands to be seen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —“Avatar” took a very basic story and adorned it with eye-popping spectacle, in a way that made the film a must-see commodity, and a record-breaking hit in the process.
Thirteen years later, braving much different theatrical tides, director James Cameron has done it again with “Avatar: The Way of Water,” a state-of-the-art exercise that rekindles that sense of wonder and demands to be seen by anyone with lingering interest in watching movies in theaters.
The children, in particular, must grapple with the personalities and pettiness associated with becoming the new kids on the reef.
Ultimately, though, “The Way of Water” melts away any skepticism that it might be too late or too long in its return to Pandora.
“Avatar: The Way of Water” premieres December 16 in US theaters.

     Box Office Preview: ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ Eyes Domination With $175 Million Start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Internationally, “Avatar 2” could add at least $250 million to $350 million over the weekend, which would put global ticket sales at $400 million to $500 million.
China, where movie theaters have been in crisis mode, will determine whether ticket sales manage to near the half-billion dollar mark.
However, COVID flare-ups in the country, as well as theater closures (only 77% of cinemas are open), have put box office expectations in limbo.
The sequel to “Avatar” cost a reported $350 million, so it won’t satisfy at the box office by simply putting up impressive numbers.
The international box office, where the first “Avatar” made over 70% of its money, will be key to the movie’s financial success.

     Review: James Cameron’s Spectacular Avatar: The Way of Water
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That much is certain after seeing Avatar: The Way of Water, his sequel to 2009’s ginormo-hit, Avatar.
The first Avatar has this duality, too, on both a formal and narrative level.
Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), the cigar-chomping, leathery (human) villain of the first film, is also back, now as a Na’vi avatar apparently created before the first film’s climactic attack just in case Quaritch Version 1.0 didn’t survive.
In creating Pandora’s forest world for the original movie, Cameron clearly borrowed liberally from existing marine ecosystems.
At times, one wonders if The Way of Water might be, among other things, Cameron’s version of a kitchen-sink family drama.
