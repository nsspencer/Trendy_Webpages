     Cubs target Carlos Correa agrees to 13-year deal with Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correa, the All-Star free agent shortstop and a top Cubs offseason target, has agreed to a 13-year deal with the San Francisco Giants, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported Tuesday night.
The deal is worth $350 million, for an average annual value of about $27 million for the 28-year-old Correa.
BREAKING: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source familiar with the deal tells ESPN.
Trea Turner came off the board first, landing a 11-year, $300 million deal with the Phillies last week.
Xander Bogaerts then landed his own 11-year deal, worth $280 million, with the Padres.

     San Francisco Giants, Carlos Correa agree to 13-year, $350M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortstop Carlos Correa and the San Francisco Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN.
The deal comes with a full no-trade clause but does not include any opt-outs, the source said.
It's the fourth-largest contract by total value in MLB history, trailing just Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels, Mookie Betts' $365 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aaron Judge's $360 million with the New York Yankees.
The 13 years matches the longest contract ever for a free agent, tying Bryce Harper's 13-year, $330 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.
This winter, Correa found a market that lavished $300 million on Trea Turner and $280 million on Xander Bogaerts far more to his liking and wound up with the second-biggest deal behind Aaron Judge's nine-year, $360 million contract with the New York Yankees.

     Mets showing interest in star free-agent Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cohen’s Mets are showing interest in Correa, according to sources familiar with the team’s thinking.
Correa, 28, likely would play third base for the Mets, alongside his fellow native of Puerto Rico, shortstop Francisco Lindor.
With penalties, the Mets’ total payroll would be approximately $421 million, by far the highest in major-league history.
Two other free-agent shortstops, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts, signed 11-year deals worth $300 million and $280 million, respectively.
The Mets may also have to explore interest in top prospects like Brett Baty and Mark Vientos.

     Summary: The Giants and Carlos Correa are in agreement on a 13-year, $350 million contract, a source confirmed to NBC Sports Bay Area.
The mark was previously held by only Bryce Harper, a player Farhan Zaidi and the Giants chased in 2019.
The agreement between Correa and the Giants was first reported by ESPN's Jeff Passan.
In Correa, the Giants are betting on a 28-year-old shortstop who is just one year removed from winning the Platinum Glove given to the best fielder in baseball.
The Giants had previously offered Harper $310 million and Judge $360 million to lead the way, but both ended up elsewhere.

     Giants, Carlos Correa Agree To 13-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 10:49pm: The Giants are in agreement on a 13-year, $350MM contract with Carlos Correa, reports Jeff Passan of ESPN (Twitter link).
That deal allowed Correa to opt out and retest the market this winter, and he took full advantage after what proved to be a lone season in Minnesota.
It’s the second-biggest free agent deal of all-time, just narrowly below the $360MM deal Judge inked a week ago.
Correa becomes the second free agent to land a 13-year deal, matching the record length secured by Bryce Harper with the Phillies over the 2018-19 offseason.
The deal runs through the 2035 campaign, what will be Correa’s age-40 campaign.

But even considering all that, the on-field component only proved a shadow of his true value -- as the Twins quickly discovered.
An analytical and probing mind with natural charisma, Correa quickly became the leader of the Minnesota clubhouse, able to connect with the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking sides of the team alike and earning respect for his attitude and preparation.
Even knowing he might only be with the Twins for one year, Correa took an interest in all aspects of the organization's long-term future -- from developing younger players, to actively coaching the defense around him while manning shortstop, to expressing his desires to management and the front office about acquisitions and team composition come Trade Deadline time.
Now, with the Giants, he'll seek a similarly prominent voice as a cornerstone player of the future -- and he'll be around to see it through.
