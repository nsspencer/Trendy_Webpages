    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Today, our country takes a major step forward in the fight for equality as the Respect for Marriage Act is signed into law.
Thanks to the leadership of President Biden, a longtime champion of the LGBTQ+ community, this new bipartisan law will finally repeal the outdated, discriminatory law known as DOMA and ensure the federal government treats all marriages equally.
"Make no mistake: As your Governor, I'll never stop fighting for the LGBTQ+ community.
We'll protect the gains we've made in the struggle for equality and build on them in the years to come.
No matter who you are or who you love, you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the Empire State."

     Respect for Marriage Act: Biden signs bill protecting same-sex marriage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: &gt;&gt; Read more trending newsLawmakers, including several Republicans, on Thursday passed the Respect for Marriage Act through the House.
“Today I sign the Respect for Marriage Act into law.
… The [Respect for Marriage Act] recognizes that everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves — without the government interference.'
It replaces the Defense of Marriage Act, which in 1996 defined marriage as between a man and a woman, The New York Times reported.
In a concurrent opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas included other cases that he believed the court should reexamine, including the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

     WATCH: Biden signs Respect for Marriage Act, protecting same-sex and interracial marriages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed gay marriage legislation into law Tuesday before a crowd of thousands, a ceremony that reflected growing acceptance of same-sex unions.
Plaintiffs from lawsuits that originally helped secure the nationwide right to gay marriage were also there.
Lawmakers crafted a compromise that was intended to assuage conservative concerns about religious liberty, such as ensuring churches could still refuse to perform gay marriages.
He memorably — and unexpectedly — endorsed same-sex unions in a television interview in 2012, when he was vice president.
By the time of Biden’s 2012 interview, gay marriage remained controversial, but support had expanded to roughly half of U.S. adults, according to Gallup.
