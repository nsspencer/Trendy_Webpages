     Summary: articleAn automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch.
The nail-biter race showed the congresswoman's combative style is wearying voters in her conservative Colorado district.
Frisch netted a total of four votes in the recount, far from enough to close a 500-plus vote gap with Boebert.
An Aspen City Councilman, Frisch had already conceded the race last month after the first tally put him just under the state's margin for a mandatory recount.

     Colorado election results: Lauren Boebert wins re-election by 546 votes, recount confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freedom Caucus firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo, has won her bid for re-election against Democrat Adam Frisch, an automatic recount confirmed Monday.
Frisch gained a total of four votes in the recount, not nearly enough to catch up and overtake Boebert's lead.
However, as the results came in, it became clear there would be more of a red trickle.
Republicans lost several key races they had hoped to win, frustrating their effort to recapture House and Senate majorities.
However, the Democratic Party's would-be 51-seat Senate majority was unexpectedly snatched away by Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema's decision to switch and register as an independent.

     Summary: This combo image shows Democratic candidate for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District Adam Frisch and U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. APDenver — An automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch.
The nail-biter race showed the renowned conservative firebrand's combative style is wearying voters in her conservative Colorado district.
Frisch netted a total of four votes in the recount, far from enough to close a 500-plus vote gap with Boebert.
Until election night, Boebert had been heavily favored to win reelection after redistricting made the sprawling, conservative district more Republican.
The one-time owner of a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, Boebert comfortably won the district in 2020′s general election and swiftly established herself as a partisan flashpoint in Washington.

"We, as Republicans, must now prove we deserve to be in the majority and to stand for the policies to help every American to overcome challenges."
All of the counties completed their recounts, and confirmed we've won this race.
pic.twitter.com/EH80Egq9UH — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) December 12, 2022A member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, Boebert had made a name for herself as a member of the right flank in the Republican caucus with a penchant for hurling broadsides and mockery at progressive stars such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (R-NY).
Given the party's slim majority in the House, he can only afford a few defections, and the GOP does not appear to have a viable alternative lined up.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) officially clinched another term in the House on Monday after a recount confirmed her razor-thin victory in her reelection bid.
A tally of the vote showed Boebert defeating her Democratic opponent Adam Frisch by just 546 votes.
While the narrow margin in the race triggered a mandatory recount under Colorado state law, Frisch, a conservative Democrat, conceded to Boebert last month, acknowledging that the recount was highly unlikely to swing the outcome of the contest.
Boebert ultimately finished on top in the initial tally, but only by a fraction of a percentage point.
In announcing his concession to Boebert last month, he urged supporters not to donate to his campaign during the recount.

     Recount reconfirms GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert’s victory in Colorado’s 3rd District
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A recount reconfirmed that GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert defeated Democrat Adam Frisch in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, the Colorado secretary of state said this week.
Boebert received 50.06% of the final vote total, while Frisch received 49.89%, Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a news release Monday.
The net change in votes gave Frisch an additional vote, while Boebert lost three votes.
Frisch conceded the race last month, but there was an automatic recount done by the Colorado secretary of state’s office.
Boebert, a political newcomer in 2020, upset Rep. Scott Tipton in a GOP primary that year.
