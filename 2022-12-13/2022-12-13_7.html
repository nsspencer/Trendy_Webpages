     Summary: He’s the person at karaoke who sheepishly pretends they don’t want to take the mic, only to turn the room into an American Idol-esque set.
Now, he’s created an album that captures that exact feeling – High Drama.
The first single from the album, which arrives in full on Feb. 24, reimagines the classic Duran Duran single “Ordinary World,” stripping it down to a simple piano melody backed by dramatic strings.
Across the 11-track project, Lambert repurposes hits and deep cuts from genre-spanning artists.
“I’ve done that on Idol, obviously – and Queen is essentially sort of a covers situation, even though I’m in the band.
