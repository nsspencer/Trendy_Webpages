     Draymond Green has fan removed during Warriors-Bucks game in Milwaukee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a testy game filled with technical fouls, a fan at Fiserv Forum was tossed during the action Tuesday night in Milwaukee.
Midway through the third quarter of the Warriors' game against the Bucks, Draymond Green approached the game officials and pointed to a fan sitting on the baseline behind the basket Milwaukee was shooting on.
On Dec. 1, Green was fined $25,000 by the NBA for directed obscene language at a fan during the Warriors' game in Dallas on Nov. 29.
The fan in Dallas later tweeted at Green, noting that he wanted to match the $25,000 fine, a gesture Draymond appreciated.
Green surely will address the incident with the fan in Milwaukee at some point after the game.

     Golden State Warriors vs Milwaukee Bucks Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fresh off of having an NBA Finals rematch against the Boston Celtics, the Golden State Warriors have another potential NBA Finals match against the Milwaukee Bucks tonight.
The Golden State Warriors will be missing Andrew Wiggins with a right adductor sprain and Andre Iguodala with left hip injury management.
The Milwaukee Bucks will continue to miss Joe Ingles with an ACL tear.
The Warriors on the other hand just defeated the Boston Celtics in a game that snapped their two-game losing streak.
While the Golden State Warriors still haven't returned to that championship form that everyone is expecting, beating the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks in back-to-back games will certainly make a statement.

     Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday final injury update for Bucks-Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Quinn Allen · 2 min readThe Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors face off Tuesday night in a heavyweight showdown between two title contenders.
While Khris Middleton was cleared to play despite a mild ankle sprain, guard Jrue Holiday has been ruled out for Tuesday’s tilt because of a non-COVID-19 illness, Mike Budenholzer told reporters.
And they’ll have their closer for Tuesday’s tilt, though Holiday will be forced to miss the clash.
Khris Middleton is averaging 11 points, 4.6 assists, and 2.4 rebounds in five games thus far, playing just 23.8 minutes per night.
Holiday meanwhile is playing like his usual self, putting up 19.1 points, 7.4 dimes, and 5.3 boards.

     Draymond Green claims he received DEATH THREAT from a fan during Warriors' defeat at Milwaukee Bucks

     Summary: Draymond Green has claimed he received death threats from a fan during the Warriors' defeat at the Milwaukee Bucks Tuesday - shortly before getting the man kicked out of the arena by security.
He immediately spoke to officials after the clash, and the man was ejected, with Green later clarifying to reporters what happened.
This comes only a week after Westbrook was involved in an argument with a different Bucks fan sitting courtside.
James also had four fans removed from a game in Atlanta in February of 2021, after they also became vulgar with him.
I don't think it's fair to the players — not just to me, but I don't think it's fair to the players.'
