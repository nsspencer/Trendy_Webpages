     Coach K earns record 13th Final Four trip as Duke smothers Arkansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Krzyzewski’s coaching career and farewell tour survived again as his second-seeded Duke Blue Devils beat the fourth-seeded Arkansas Razorbacks 78-69 Saturday in the Elite Eight of the men’s NCAA Tournament.
Duke’s victory at the Chase Center secured a record 13th trip to the Final Four for Krzyzewski, the legendary basketball coach who will retire after the end of the season, his 42nd at Duke.
And after the timeout, we were a different team," Krzyzewski said in a TV interview of the Razorbacks' final run early in the second half.
With two more victories, the Blue Devils can send off Coach K with his sixth national title.
In the national semifinals, the Blue Devils will face the winner of the Saint Peter’s-North Carolina game, to be played Sunday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coach K’s farewell tour will end at his record-setting 13th Final Four.
Coach K will try to follow the path of the only coach to win more NCAA men’s titles as John Wooden won his 10th championship in his final season at UCLA in 1975.
Krzyzewski broke the tie he had with Wooden for most Final Four appearances with the commanding win over the Razorbacks.
Arkansas is still seeking its first Final Four appearance since losing the title game in 1995 to UCLA.
The Razorbacks won their only national championship the previous season against Duke.

     Summary: 4 seed Arkansas, Krzyzewski would break the tie for most Final Fours in a career with the legendary John Wooden.
The last time Duke and Arkansas played it was on a stage bigger than this: the 1994 national championship game.
Had this Duke team been constructed with a different set of personalities, they wouldn't have responded the way they have.
"Jon Scheyer said it yesterday when we were together as a staff, even before the game," Krzyzewski said.
The Blue Devils will get an Arkansas team that won't be intimidated, not even a little.

     Summary: Coaching in his 17th Elite Eight game with Duke, the 75-year-old Krzyzewski has led the Blue Devils (32-6) to the Final Four for the 13th time.
Krzyzewski’s final Duke team before associate head coach Jon Scheyer takes over next season intended to collect as many new banners for Cameron Indoor Stadium’s crowed rafters as it could.
Krzyzewski called timeout and the Blue Devils ditched their traditional man-to-man for a zone.
But after Arkansas led 9-6, Williams scored eight consecutive Duke points and the Blue Devils never trailed again.
When Trevor Keels scored after a drive to the rim with 10:14 to play, Duke led 22-14.
