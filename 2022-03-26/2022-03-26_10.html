     Notre Dame women‘s basketball falls to North Carolina State in Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame women’s basketball suffered a heartbreaking loss in the Sweet Sixteen, falling 66-63 to North Carolina State.
The Irish led the contest for most of the day before a steal and layup by Wolfpack guard Raina Perez with 14 seconds left gave North Carolina State a lead they would preserve until the final buzzer.
A combination of deflected passes and smart tactical fouling by North Carolina State ensured the Irish continually struggled to even start their offensive possession.
North Carolina State head coach Wes Moore said after the game his team was just looking to frustrate the Irish any way they could on that fateful possession.
It takes energy, it takes urgency and that can cover up even a coach that makes mistakes.

     N.C.A.A. Women’s Tournament: N.C. State Somehow Escapes Notre Dame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. — Raina Perez, a North Carolina State guard, charged toward the basket and glanced behind her, her eyes searching for the kind of Saturday afternoon chaos she had just started back at midcourt.
But with no one all that near, the aftermath of that moment — an electrifying steal with her team, the Bridgeport region’s top seed, trailing Notre Dame with less than 20 seconds to play — was nearly certain: Perez would score on a layup and single-handedly renew N.C. State’s ambition to return to the round of 8 for the first time since 1998.
She later added a pair of free throws to push the score to 66-63 and stun a fifth-seeded Notre Dame that had led for nearly 32 minutes and largely stifled one of women’s basketball’s most prolific offenses.
For much of the afternoon, in fact, N.C. State’s offense teetered toward the hapless by its extraordinary standards.
Although the Wolfpack cultivated a 4-point lead to end the first quarter, they had squandered it by halftime, when they trailed, 38-30.
