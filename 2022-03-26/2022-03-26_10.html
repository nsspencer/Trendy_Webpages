     Summary: Can Miami Heat Ace The Test Of Adversity?
The Miami Heat would proceed to be outscored, 69-43, in the second and third periods.
The Miami Heat came into Saturday’s game off of three straight defeats, looking to bounce back.
So, while these last four contests haven’t been pretty, they also haven’t really been the Miami Heat team that we’ve seen for 80 percent of the season thus far.
Even with that though, you have to believe this Miami Heat team will shake back.

That could start with a deep playoff run and continue with a big contract extension this offseason.
Just a couple of months ago, with all the internal turmoil that the Brooklyn Nets were facing, there was no guarantee that Kyrie Irving was going to be back with the team next season.
[via ESPN] “To be honest, I signed up for this for the long run,” Irving said.
