     Summary: Harry Kane puts England ahead on the penalty kick as they lead 2-1 vs. Switzerland.
(0:48)England needed a late Harry Kane penalty to seal a 2-1 comeback victory over Switzerland in a friendly match at Wembley on Saturday.
The Swiss took a first-half lead through Breel Embolo but Luke Shaw levelled before the break and Kane grabbed the winner from the spot late on.
Kane's strike made it 10 wins and three draws against the Swiss since a World Cup qualifying defeat in 1981.
England captain Kane stepped up to convert the spot kick and Gareth Southgate's side held on for the win.

Sommer's absence is big, as the shot-stopper was the one to deny Jorginho during World Cup qualifying, a contributing factor in Italy's shock elimination from World Cup contention.
Still, Switzerland was worth its weight during World Cup qualifying, winning its group ahead of European champions Italy.

     Summary: (AFP via Getty Images)If the purpose of these international friendlies in the no man’s land between qualifying and a major tournament is to experiment and learn lessons, then mission accomplished for England and Gareth Southgate.
The England captain completed the turnaround with an emphatically converted 78th-minute penalty, awarded against Steven Zuber for handball after a lengthy VAR check.
Breel Embolo had initially put Switzerland in front, capitalising on a Benjamin White error, and deservedly so.
To be honest, there was not much of a rhythm to the game before that either.

     England vs Switzerland - friendly: Live score, team news and updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the reminders didn’t just stop with the Shaw goal.
England have just played in a World Cup semi-final and a Euro final under his stewardship, unimaginable heights for England fans under the age of 60.
And that might yet be the weakness which costs England their best shot at World Cup glory in 56 years.
Switzerland, once they realised they had the measure of England, and had been granted the freedom of the midfield, simply over-ran the hosts.
England were incoherent, Shaqiri and Renato Steffen constantly running in behind them, whilst Switzerland looked dynamic and dominant.
