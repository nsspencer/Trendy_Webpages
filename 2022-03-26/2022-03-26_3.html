Kolkata reached their target in 18.3 overs with new skipper Shreyas Iyer unbeaten on 20 at the start of the Indian Premier League.
Fast bowler Dwayne Bravo claimed three wickets to equal veteran Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 170 scalps.

     Summary: New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) this year will earn a little over Rs 1,000 crore from the Indian Premier League (IPL 2022) central sponsorships, Inside Sport reported.
Vivo had agreed to pay Rs 484 crore for IPL 2022 and Rs 512 crore for IPL 2023 on account of increase in the number of matches during the two forthcoming seasons.
Vivo was supposed to pay Rs 996 crore to the BCCI over next two seasons.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IPL 2022 Highlights, CSK vs KKR: Kolkata Knight Riders defeated Chennai Super Kings by six wickets in the blockbuster season opener of the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Earlier, Umesh Yadav plucked two early wickets before Varun Chakaravarthy and Andre Russell entered the wicket-takers column, leaving CSK tottering at 61/5.
But Ravindra Jadeja (26*) and MS Dhoni (50*) did a brilliant job to resurrect Chennai's innings after early blows.
On the bowling front, Umesh picked up two while Russell and Chakaravarthy registered one wicket each.
Chennai, one of the most consistent sides since the tournament's inception in 2008, had defeated Kolkata to lift their fourth IPL title last year.

     Summary: He ran away in delirium, arms spread like wings – the ball and the celebration has seen encores ever since.
It’s one thing for Lasith Malinga to bowl it; not that it’s easier but with that side-arm slinging action, it’s understandable.
Malinga’s side-arm release allows him to slice and release the ball like a frisbee in a naturally flowing unimpeded action.
As in, T20 bowling was unchartered territory.
More than most, Bravo has cracked the T20 bowling code.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Immediately after their Ashes humiliation at the start of the year, many former England players and a few English Board officials apportioned blame on the IPL.
After all, out of the 18 players England used in their 4-1 hammering by Australia, only four - Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes and Dawid Malan - were part of the last IPL.
Further, it is worth remembering that these players didn’t defy their board, they were given NOCs by Cricket South Africa to take part in the IPL.
But on their own, they have all acknowledged the IPL’s pull and attempted to tweak their international schedules to facilitate their players’ IPL participation.
But the BCCI and other Boards can come to an understanding to ensure the seamless conduct of IPL and international cricket, an arrangement that can benefit everyone.
