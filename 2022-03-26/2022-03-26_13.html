     Eagles agree to sign linebacker Kyzir White to a one-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Chargers outside linebacker Kyzir White (44) is being introduced before an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings Sunday, Nov. 14, 2021, in Inglewood, Calif. Read moreThe Eagles agreed to terms on Saturday with former Chargers linebacker Kyzir White on a one-year deal.
Appearing primarily from the starting middle linebacker spot, White tallied 144 tackles, which ranked eighth most in the NFL, and two interceptions across 17 games.
Following the departure of Alex Singleton in free agency, White is a likely candidate to start at linebacker alongside T.J. Edwards.
Besides Edwards and White, the Eagles have linebackers Davion Taylor, Patrick Johnson, Shaun Bradley, JaCoby Stevens, Christian Elliss, and Joe Ostman on the roster.
Considering White’s short-term deal, the Eagles could still add more depth to the position in the upcoming NFL draft.

     LB Kyzir White signs one-year deal with Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two weeks into this year’s free agency and linebacker Kyzir White finally has a home for the 2020 season.
On Saturday morning, NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported that White is signing a one-year contract worth up to $5 million with the Eagles.
The #Eagles are signing LB Kyzir White and giving him a 1-year deal worth up to $5M, source said.
He finished his final season in Los Angeles with 144 total tackles, seven tackles for loss, one sack, two interceptions, and two forced fumbles.
White signing elsewhere for only $5 million is quite the surprise.

     Eagles Sign LB Kyzir White
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles made a somewhat significant move during the second wave of free agency Saturday, signing off-ball linebacker Kyzir White to a one-year, $5 million deal.
Last season, ProFootballFocus.com graded out White as the 20th best off-ball LB in the league while Edwards finished at No.
The signing of White also makes it unlikely Philadelphia will look toward off-ball LB in the first round of the draft again despite the luxury of three first-round picks.
The current depth chart at off-ball LB for the Eagles after Edwards and White also includes special-teams standout Shaun Bradley and another college safety making the transition in 2021 sixth-round pick JaCoby Stevens.

     Eagles agree to terms with LB Kyzir White
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A safety in his college days at West Virginia, White is one of seven siblings, three of whom reached the NFL (Kevin and Ka'Raun are former wide receivers).
So, it's all about football and family for White, who agreed to terms on a one-year contract with the Eagles on Saturday and who adds depth to the linebacker corps.
Philadelphia continues to build – we're early in the process here, and the team understands the work ahead – and bringing White on board to compete for playing time at linebacker makes every bit of sense.
White is here to prove something to the team and to the NFL.
But White is an intriguing player who began his career with the Chargers as a WILL (weakside) linebacker in a 4-3 front and then transitioned inside in the 3-4 front Los Angeles employed last season.

     Summary: Technically, the Philadelphia Eagles already addressed their linebacking corps this offseason.
Kyzir White, let’s hope you work out better than the last linebacker the Philadelphia Eagles signed from the Los Angeles Chargers.
Let’s hope Kyzir White actually sees the field for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Do you remember Philadelphia Eagles legend Jatavis Brown?
Will the addition of Kyzir White work?
