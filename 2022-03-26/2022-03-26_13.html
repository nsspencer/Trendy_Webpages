     Summary: The University of Memphis men's basketball program is facing several major allegations of breaking NCAA rules and its coach, Penny Hardaway, is charged with wrongdoing in documents obtained by multiple media outlets Saturday.
The response shows Hardaway is facing accusations of at least one Level I and two Level II violations, both considered severe violations by the NCAA.
In the notice of allegations, Hardaway is said to have failed to establish a culture of compliance as part of head coach responsibility and failed to monitor.
The IARP in its investigation also accused Memphis of not properly preserving the hard drive from the computer of ex-assistant coach Mike Miller, the contents of which were later deleted.
Allegations of violations levied against the program stem from the IARP's ongoing investigation into the recruitment and short stint at Memphis of former No.
