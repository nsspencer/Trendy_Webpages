     Summary: Harry Kane puts England ahead on the penalty kick as they lead 2-1 vs. Switzerland.
(0:48)England needed a late Harry Kane penalty to seal a 2-1 comeback victory over Switzerland in a friendly match at Wembley on Saturday.
The Swiss took a first-half lead through Breel Embolo but Luke Shaw levelled before the break and Kane grabbed the winner from the spot late on.
Kane's strike made it 10 wins and three draws against the Swiss since a World Cup qualifying defeat in 1981.
England captain Kane stepped up to convert the spot kick and Gareth Southgate's side held on for the win.

     Summary: Harry Kane scored the winner from the penalty spot as England came from behind to defeat Switzerland 2-1 at Wembley after Luke Shaw had earlier struck the equaliser.
Before his opening 45 minutes were through, he had played his part in a goal - his interception crucial to England's equaliser.
His pass through to Harry Kane for a chance in the second half was even better.
