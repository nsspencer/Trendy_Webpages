     Bella Thorne Gets Honest About Getting Called Names Like ‘Slut’ And People Thinking She’s ‘Controversial’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thorne recently got blunt about people regularly calling her a “slut” and labelling her as “controversial.”Bella Thorne has certainly pushed the envelope with her work over the last few years.
The actress had a major public upheaval after she joined OnlyFans that led the service to make changes, and she later apologized to sex workers.
Here’s her reaction to being called “controversial” as of late:It’s so funny that people say that I’m ‘controversial’ when you’re exactly right—I haven’t been arrested.
While the actress and singer certainly isn’t averse to sharing more explicit content, her motivations stem from creating more sex-positive content starring women.
Thorne has been engaged to Benjamin Mascolo since early 2021 following the couple dating for nearly two years.
