     NCAA Basketball: Ranking the Elite 8 teams in 2022 NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’re down to just eight NCAA Basketball teams in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, with quite a few surprises to this point.
We have the Cinderella of the Big Dance still alive in Saint Peter’s who is the first-ever 15 seed to get this far.
Saint Peter’s PeacocksI hate that I even have to put this team here because it feels disrespectful.
Saint Peter’s has one of the better defenses in the country and that has been evident by their ability to stop both Zach Edey and Trevion Williams.
They’ll need it against North Carolina in the Elite 8 matchup but after beating a 2, 3, and 7 seed, beating an 8 seed shouldn’t be that difficult.

     How to bet Villanova-Houston in the Elite 8 of the 2022 NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villanova has held its three NCAA Tournament opponents to an average of 58.7 points on 39.8 percent shooting.
Houston’s resume doesn’t look much different — holding NCAA Tournament opponents to 60.3 points and 38.1 percent shooting through three games.
I can see something similar happening but not to that extent, and probably not to the point in which the two teams can’t combine to hit the over on the points total (128.5).
I’ll feel even more confident in this after a few early Collin Gillespie and Justin Moore threes drop.

     Summary: Duke finished the season second in KenPom’s offensive rankings, while Arkansas clocked in at 11th on defensive rankings.
Williams recorded 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting, eight rebounds and three blocks.
With poise and determination that wasn't always in evidence during the season, Banchero scored a game-high 22 points, including a clutch three-pointer that put the Dukies up for good.
Williams' final line against the tournament’s top overall seed was 15 points on 5-of-12 shooting, 12 rebounds, three assists and one block.
Arkansas has allowed 40.9 percent shooting on average this season and 38.9 percent in the tournament.

It’s safe to say that the ranking exercise of the Sweet 16 teams goes to show that predicting March Madness is a fool’s errand.
Now that the Elite Eight is set, how would these teams rank today in terms of national championship odds?

The Wildcats will get a different test as they play a very physical Houston team in San Antonio, which should be a hostile environment for them.

Some basketball fans may be surprised to see Houston in the Elite Eight, but most analytics rankings are not.
5 seed in the Big Dance, the Cougars are second in both KenPom’s and BartTorvik’s efficiency rankings.
Of all teams in the nation, the Cougars allow the second fewest points per possession on pick-and-roll sets.
Look for the Cougars to win and cover as they book a trip to the Final Four.
