    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MUMBAI, March 26 (Reuters) - The expanded Indian Premier League (IPL) got underway with Kolkata Knight Riders beating defending champions Chennai Super Kings by six wickets in the tournament opener on Saturday.
Twice champions Kolkata reached the target with nine balls to spare in their first match under Shreyas Iyer, who replaced Eoin Morgan as the captain.
For Kolkata, Umesh Yadav began with a no ball but soon made amends with double strikes to rattle Chennai's top order.
Kolkata, in contrast, got off to a rollicking start with Ajinkya Rahane (44) leading their chase.
After Sam Billings (25) departed, Iyer, who made 20 not out, stayed put to hit the winning runs on his Kolkata debut.

     Summary: The Yadav roar:The usually-restrained Kuldeep Yadav let out a ripping roar after he dismissed Rohit Sharma.
The ball was far from spectacular—unlike the many gems he has produced (Babar Azam in World Cup for one).
The ball was on the shorter side, one Sharma would usually ferry to the roof of the Brabourne Stadium.
Then, it’s not about how Sharma missed (rarely ever) a pull shot, but how Yadav celebrated and what the wicket might have meant for him.
And he let the world know how it meant to him.

Jackson took the ball and immediately removed the bails, which left Uthappa way short of the crease.
