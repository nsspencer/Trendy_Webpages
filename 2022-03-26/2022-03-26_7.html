Race organizers said this attack won't dispel plans to continue with the second-ever Jeddah Grand Prix.
The missile and drone attacks Friday targeted the Saudi Aramco oil facility in Jeddah.
Pictures taken immediately following the attack showed huge balls of fire and smoke just miles from the Formula 1 venue.
According to the Associated Press, the attack targeted the same fuel depot Houthis had attacked in recent days.

     Yemen’s Houthis announce three-day ceasefire after Saudi attacks

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Statement comes a day after a wave of drone and missile attacks hit targets across Saudi Arabia.
Yemen’s Houthi group has announced a three-day truce and dangled the prospect of a “permanent” ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition ends its operations against the impoverished country.
The statement came a day after a wave of drone and missile attacks hit targets across Saudi Arabia, including an oil plant near the Formula One race in Jeddah, triggering an inferno.
On Saturday, at least seven people were reported to have been killed in air raids conducted by the Saudi-led coalition on Sanaa and Hodeidah.
Annelle Sheline, a Middle East research fellow at the Quincy Institute in the US, said that the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels might be close to a long-term deal.

     Yemen's Houthis suspend strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIYADH, March 26 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi group said on Saturday it was suspending missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days, in a peace initiative it said could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen stopped air strikes and lifted port restrictions.
Saudi Arabia says there is no blockade on the ports and that it is only preventing arms smuggling.
The Saudi-led coalition offered a unilateral ceasefire last year.
Mashat said the group was ready to release all prisoners, including the brother of Yemen's president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but the Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

     Summary: Yemen’s Houthi rebel leader on Saturday announced a three-day halt to hostilities after an escalation of missile, drone and ground attacks on Saudi Arabia over the past week, the rebel-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
The unilateral truce was announced by Mahdi Al-Mashat, president of the Houthi ruling political council.
In a speech marking the seventh anniversary of the war, Al-Mashat said the rebels are “ready to turn the halt of the confrontations into a final commitment if Saudi Arabia announces the withdrawal of all foreign troops from our land and water territories.”

     F1 race in Saudi Arabia to go ahead despite nearby attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Saturday, March 26, 2022 7:13 pmJIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Formula One said its race in Saudi Arabia will go ahead as scheduled this weekend despite attacks on the kingdom by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
The announcement came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot located about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the F1 circuit.
It caused a raging fire that rattled the drivers enough to hold extraordinary talks regarding F1's presence in Saudi Arabia.
The attack targeted the North Jiddah Bulk Plant, the same fuel depot the Houthis had attacked five days earlier.
The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida — both held by the Houthis — followed an attack by rebels on an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jiddah.

The State of Israel expresses its sorrow to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the horrific attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
This attack is further proof that Iran’s regional aggression knows no bounds &amp; reinforces the concern of Iran’s IRGC being removed from the FTO list.
The coalition said earlier on Saturday it was carrying out airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeidah in reaction to Houthi attacks on Saudi oil facilities.
The conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

On Friday night, all 20 F1 drivers were on the brink of boycotting this year's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after a missile attack on a nearby oil depot raised security concerns.
Details of how that agreement was reached have remained private between those involved, but some drivers made clear Saturday that they want to revisit the topic of racing in Saudi Arabia once the race weekend is done.
"Obviously, there's going to need some clarity after this race weekend where we go from here.

Deadly airstrikesOn Friday, Yemen’s Houthi forces, also known as Ansar Allah, launched aerial attacks on civilian and energy facilities in Saudi Arabia, including on an oil facility in Jeddah that triggered a huge fire, which sent up a column of black smoke.
“These airstrikes also resulted in damage to the UN staff residential compound in Sana’a,” Mr. Dujarric added.
Stop the hostilitiesThe UN chief is calling for “a swift and transparent investigation into these incidents to ensure accountability,” the statement continued.
The group upheld that the unilateral peace initiative could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition stopped airstrikes and lifted port restrictions.

     Summary: JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Sergio Perez won the first pole of his career Saturday at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where Formula One has been under heavy scrutiny for continuing its race weekend following an attack on a nearby oil depot.
But most of Saturday was focused on F1’s decision to continue at a circuit about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the bombed, smoke-covered depot.
Sainz said racing was the right decision but that F1′s controversial participation in Saudi Arabia can’t be ignored once the series globe-trots away to Australia and then Europe.
Team principals were adamant Saturday it is safe to race in Saudi Arabia despite the attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
The Houthis acknowledged the attacks Friday evening and Saudi Arabia state TV called it a “hostile operation.”Hamilton and other drivers previously expressed their concerns about racing in the region, mainly concerning Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.

The UAE is allied with Saudi Arabia against the Houthis and has also been targeted by the rebels.
Gen. Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the strikes targeted “sources of threat” to Saudi Arabia, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency or SPA.
