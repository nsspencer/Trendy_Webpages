     Killer Who Was 13 When He Killed 4-Year-Old Released From Prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 41-year-old man has been released from prison after spending 28 years behind bars for the murder of a four-year-old.
Eric Smith was 13 years old when he killed Derrick Robie in August 1993, but he was tried as an adult and sentenced to nine years to life in prison.
He was transferred from a juvenile detention centre to an adult prison after he turned 21 and was denied his first parole hearing almost nine years after the killing took place, but following a series of other unsuccessful hearings he was released on parole in February 2022.
Marlene Heskell called Smith's mother and they took the teenager to meet with investigators, where Smith is said to have 'totally enjoyed' speaking about the murder.
Advert 10Smith's release was delayed until he had secured approved housing, but he is now living in Queens, New York.
