     Dhoni's 50 in vain as Chennai lose to Kolkata in IPL opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mumbai (AFP) – Mahendra Singh Dhoni rolled back the years with an unbeaten 38-ball 50 but his team Chennai Super Kings went down to Kolkata Knight Riders by six wickets in the IPL opener on Saturday.
Kolkata reached their target in 18.3 overs with new skipper Shreyas Iyer unbeaten on 20 at the start of the Indian Premier League.
Fast bowler Dwayne Bravo claimed three wickets to equal veteran Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 170 scalps.
It was Dhoni's first half-century since April 2019 when he smashed 84, although in a losing cause against Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Delhi Capitals take on five-time winners Mumbai Indians in the first match on Sunday while Punjab Kings meet Bangalore in the evening game.

It’s one thing for Lasith Malinga to bowl it; not that it’s easier but with that side-arm slinging action, it’s understandable.
Malinga’s side-arm release allows him to slice and release the ball like a frisbee in a naturally flowing unimpeded action.
As in, T20 bowling was unchartered territory.
More than most, Bravo has cracked the T20 bowling code.

     Summary: Immediately after their Ashes humiliation at the start of the year, many former England players and a few English Board officials apportioned blame on the IPL.
After all, out of the 18 players England used in their 4-1 hammering by Australia, only four - Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes and Dawid Malan - were part of the last IPL.
Further, it is worth remembering that these players didn’t defy their board, they were given NOCs by Cricket South Africa to take part in the IPL.
But on their own, they have all acknowledged the IPL’s pull and attempted to tweak their international schedules to facilitate their players’ IPL participation.
But the BCCI and other Boards can come to an understanding to ensure the seamless conduct of IPL and international cricket, an arrangement that can benefit everyone.
