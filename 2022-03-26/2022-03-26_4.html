     Summary: Kohli will take the field as non-captain for RCB for the first time since 2012.
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar on Saturday opined that with change in leadership, fans can expect Kohli from the 2016 season.
This season, we might actually see the Kohli of 2016 where he got almost 1000 runs in the IPL season.”Talking about Glenn Maxwell, Gavaskar said the Australia all-rounder’s cricket depends on how he “approaches every innings”.
Last season, he was in a team with Virat Kohli and ABD, two of the finest batsmen that the game has seen and so maybe he lifted his game.
If he says to himself I am going to do what ABD has done for RCB, then RCB could be in for a real magic season from Maxwell.”
