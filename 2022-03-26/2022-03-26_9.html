     Summary: THE Quezon City Police District (QCPD) is investigating the case of 57-year-old American singer-songwriter Keith Eric Martin, who popularized the song "Because of You", after he was found dead on Friday at a condominium unit in Barangay Bagumbayan.
Lt. Col. Cristine Tabdi, Bagumbayan Police Station chief, said Christine Lleno, 40, property manager of Lafayette 1 Condominium in Eastwood City, also in the same barangay, reported the incident to authorities.
Prior to this, Tabdi said a resident from a neighboring unit reported to Lleno the pungent odor coming from the sixth floor of the building.
At about 10:46 a.m., barangay officials, led by Jesus Estanislao and Lafayette, officer-in-charge Samuel Magno entered the unit and saw the body of Martin on the bed.
QCPD's Public Information Office told The Manila Times that the CIDU has yet to release a report.
