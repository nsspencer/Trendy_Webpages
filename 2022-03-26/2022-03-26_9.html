     UN chief condemns attacks on civilian facilities in Saudi Arabia and Yemen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Secretary-General @antonioguterres strongly condemns recent escalation of conflict in Yemen, including attacks in Saudi Arabia and Sana'a: https://t.co/XnLi0fjGzS — UN Spokesperson (@UN_Spokesperson) March 26, 2022Over 23 million Yemenis face hunger, disease, and other life-threatening risks as the country’s basic services and economy are collapsing, the UN Office for Humanitarian Coordination (OCHA) had said.
Deadly airstrikesOn Friday, Yemen’s Houthi forces, also known as Ansar Allah, launched aerial attacks on civilian and energy facilities in Saudi Arabia, including on an oil facility in Jeddah that triggered a huge fire, which sent up a column of black smoke.
“These airstrikes also resulted in damage to the UN staff residential compound in Sana’a,” Mr. Dujarric added.
Stop the hostilitiesThe UN chief is calling for “a swift and transparent investigation into these incidents to ensure accountability,” the statement continued.
The group upheld that the unilateral peace initiative could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition stopped airstrikes and lifted port restrictions.

     Yemen Rebels Announce 3-Day Halt to Attacks on Saudi Arabia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yemen’s Houthi rebel leader on Saturday announced a three-day halt to hostilities after an escalation of missile, drone and ground attacks on Saudi Arabia over the past week, the rebel-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
The unilateral truce was announced by Mahdi Al-Mashat, president of the Houthi ruling political council.
In a speech marking the seventh anniversary of the war, Al-Mashat said the rebels are “ready to turn the halt of the confrontations into a final commitment if Saudi Arabia announces the withdrawal of all foreign troops from our land and water territories.”

     Yemen's Houthis suspend strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIYADH, March 26 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi group said on Saturday it was suspending missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days, in a peace initiative it said could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen stopped air strikes and lifted port restrictions.
Saudi Arabia says there is no blockade on the ports and that it is only preventing arms smuggling.
The Saudi-led coalition offered a unilateral ceasefire last year.
Mashat said the group was ready to release all prisoners, including the brother of Yemen's president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but the Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

     F1 race in Saudi Arabia to go ahead despite nearby attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Saturday, March 26, 2022 7:13 pmJIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Formula One said its race in Saudi Arabia will go ahead as scheduled this weekend despite attacks on the kingdom by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
The announcement came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot located about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the F1 circuit.
It caused a raging fire that rattled the drivers enough to hold extraordinary talks regarding F1's presence in Saudi Arabia.
The attack targeted the North Jiddah Bulk Plant, the same fuel depot the Houthis had attacked five days earlier.
The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida — both held by the Houthis — followed an attack by rebels on an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jiddah.

     F1 drivers want talks on future of Saudi Arabian GP after race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Leading Formula One drivers have made clear that they want to revisit the topic of Formula One's presence in Saudi Arabia once the Sunday race is over.
On Friday night, all 20 F1 drivers were on the brink of boycotting this year's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after a missile attack on a nearby oil depot raised security concerns.
Details of how that agreement was reached have remained private between those involved, but some drivers made clear Saturday that they want to revisit the topic of racing in Saudi Arabia once the race weekend is done.
"Obviously, there's going to need some clarity after this race weekend where we go from here.
"I think the drivers are stakeholders in the sport, as are the teams and the commercial rights holder," he said.

     Perez on pole for Saudi Arabian GP day after nearby attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Sergio Perez won the first pole of his career Saturday at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where Formula One has been under heavy scrutiny for continuing its race weekend following an attack on a nearby oil depot.
But most of Saturday was focused on F1’s decision to continue at a circuit about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the bombed, smoke-covered depot.
Sainz said racing was the right decision but that F1′s controversial participation in Saudi Arabia can’t be ignored once the series globe-trots away to Australia and then Europe.
Team principals were adamant Saturday it is safe to race in Saudi Arabia despite the attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
The Houthis acknowledged the attacks Friday evening and Saudi Arabia state TV called it a “hostile operation.”Hamilton and other drivers previously expressed their concerns about racing in the region, mainly concerning Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.
