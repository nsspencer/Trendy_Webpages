     Justin Moore injury: Villanova G hurt in Elite Eight win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villanova is headed to its third Final Four since 2016, but the program could be making the trip to New Orleans without one of its star players.
Junior guard Justin Moore suffered a potentially serious lower leg injury in the closing moments of Saturday’s 50–44 win over Houston in the Elite Eight.
Moments after the final whistle, a visibly distraught Moore was consoled by teammates as the celebration commenced.
The play resulted in a turnover as Houston forced a jump ball possession with Villanova leading 48–44.
Moore, a second-team All-Big East selection in 2022, entered Saturday averaging 14.7 PPG on 42% shooting during March Madness.

     Villanova Reaches Final Four After Almost Letting Houston Come Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2-seeded Villanova and No.
5-seeded Houston was reminiscent of the college basketball games played decades ago: Two dogged, rebound-devouring defensive behemoths scratching and clawing and barreling through defenders for tough-to-come by points.
The other, Villanova, has been looking to reposition itself as one of Division I’s most feared programs after a few dismal tournament seasons.
In the end, Coach Jay Wright’s Villanova team was too aggressive, too poised and too focused for Houston, which seemed ill-prepared to face an opponent it had so much in common with.
“It was like playing against our own selves,” said Caleb Daniels, Villanova’s redshirt-senior guard, after the game.

     Villanova fends off Houston in 'street fight,' as Jay Wright and the Wildcats land Final Four trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though the players are different these days, the result was familiar Saturday in the South Regional final.
Villanova earned coach Jay Wright’s fourth trip to the Final Four with a 50-44 victory over Houston, withstanding the Cougars’ ultra-physical style and their massive crowd advantage to earn a trip to New Orleans next week.
After a timeout by Wright, Gillespie drained a 17-foot jumper with a hand in his face — one of many moments where Villanova made a play to blunt Houston’s momentum.
"I felt like it was playing against our own selves," Villanova guard Caleb Daniels said.
Wright said Moore would get an MRI when the team returned to Philadelphia but acknowledged that it did not look promising.

     Summary: Villanova escapes with a 50-44 win after a gritty affair against Houston to advance to the Final Four.
Taze Moore was the top scorer for Houston, going for 15 points and 10 rebounds.
Houston had landed the first punch against every team it had played in the NCAA tournament until this point.
Through the first 17 minutes, Houston had just one offensive rebound and forced just two turnovers, neither of which were live-ball turnovers.
A pair of Gillespie free throws pushed the Villanova lead to six, and Houston wouldn't get any closer.
