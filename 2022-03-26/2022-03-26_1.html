     Summary: Arkansas is coming off an impressive and commanding win over the pre-tournament favorite Gonzaga Bulldogs, who entered March Madness as the overall No.
They’ll carry that momentum into a matchup against Duke, who many wrote off heading into the Big Dance after some surprising losses.
Getty ImagesDuke (-3.5) over ArkansasThe majority of Mike Krzyzewski’s five national championships — the second-most all-time — were captured when the Blue Devils weren’t expected to win it all.
In 2010, Krzyzewski’s least-talented title team was overshadowed by the other three No.
When this year’s bracket was unveiled, Duke was tied for the sixth-best odds to win the national title.
