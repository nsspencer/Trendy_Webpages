     Summary: At the now-defunct Charlotte Coliseum, a last-minute three from Arkansas’ Scotty Thurman brought Duke to its knees less than 150 miles from its home campus in the final of the 1994 NCAA tournament.
Now, 28 years on, the Razorbacks and Blue Devils are set for another high-stakes game—this time at San Francisco’s Chase Center.
Williamson also took Arkansas to the 1995 title game, but couldn’t help Richardson and company repeat against historic blue-blood UCLA.
“We played against a great team and one of the great coaches in our sport in Nolan [Richardson],” said Krzyzewski of the 1994 title game at Friday's media availability.
Or will Arkansas continue its one-up on the Blue Devils and send itself to the first national semifinal of the Musselman era?
