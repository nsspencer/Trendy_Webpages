Somehow there are still two double digits seed amongst the field, as the No.
Saint Peter’s Peacocks are 40 minutes away from the Final Four.
1 seed remaining, and that’s the Kansas Jayhawks.

     Elite Eight teams, ranked by their national title chances in the men’s NCAA tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The men’s NCAA tournament is annually defined by its unpredictability, and it has lived up to that reputation once again this year.
Before the regional finals begin, we ranked the eight teams remaining in the men’s NCAA tournament field by how likely they are to win the national championship.
15 seed to ever reach the regional final of the men’s NCAA tournament.
If North Carolina and Duke both win their Elite Eight games, the first ever NCAA tournament meeting between the archrivals will happen in the Final Four.
It would be easy to excuse Duke players for cracking under the enormous pressure of Coach K’s farewell tour, but somehow they’ve risen to the occasion from the moment the NCAA tournament started.
