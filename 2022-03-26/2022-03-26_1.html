     Mike Krzyzewski advances to record-setting 13th Final Four as Duke defeats Arkansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jacob Lev, CNNDuke men’s basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski advanced to his record-setting 13th Final Four appearance Saturday after the No.
With the win, Krzyzewski passes Hall of Famer and former UCLA head coach John Wooden for the most Final Four appearances in NCAA history.
Duke associate coach and former Blue Devils player Jon Scheyer will take over as head coach next season.
“Coach K,” as he is affectionately known, has coached at Duke for 42 seasons and is the NCAA’s all-time winningest head coach.
He led the Duke men’s program to five national championships in 1991, 1992, 2001, 2010 and the last one came in 2015.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blue Devils grew again, proving their talent was as irrepressible as this storybook narrative itself.
The Blue Devils got 46 points in the paint against Arkansas, continuing a trend that has defined Duke's teamwork instincts.
The Blue Devils have gotten by with 52% of their points through four games in the paint, according to ESPN research.
A mere 10 3-point attempts for the Blue Devils vs. Arkansas, but four of them feel true.
The Blue Devils and Tar Heels have played 257 times in their history, but never in the NCAA Tournament.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every game begins the same way, with Duke's players taking the court, followed by the assistant coaches and, finally, Mike Krzyzewski.
Krzyzewski has made this walk 1,569 times as a head coach, an astounding 1,437 of them in 42 years as Duke's head coach.
The next week in college basketball, like much of the past nine months in college basketball, will be about him.
Enough about doing it for the old man here.
Coach K's 13th Final Four will be the culmination of a long, seemingly fulfilling final goodbye.

     Summary: Coach Mike Krzyzewski’s farewell tour is headed to his record-setting 13th Final Four after Duke overwhelmed Arkansas 78-69 Saturday.
Coach K's farewell tour will end at his record-setting 13th Final Four.
Krzyzewski broke the tie he had with Wooden for most Final Four appearances with the commanding win over the Razorbacks.
Arkansas is still seeking its first Final Four appearance since losing the title game in 1995 to UCLA.
The Razorbacks won their only national championship the previous season against Duke.

     Why Duke’s 13th Final Four berth is among Coach K’s sweetest | Raleigh News &amp; Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In ‘86, when Krzyzewski first led Duke to the Final Four, he was a much younger man — not even 40.
They were a consistent top-10 team throughout the season, yes, but they melted down during that humiliating defeat against North Carolina in Krzyzewski’s final home game.
And besides, before Thursday Duke had never won a game out West in the NCAA tournament in Krzyzewski’s 42-year career.
Krzyzewski’s final March would stretch into April.

Eric Musselman is 6-2 in NCAA Tournament games as Arkansas’ coach and 8-5 overall, including a 2-3 record with Nevada.
SWC rememberedArkansas is among six teams that played in the now-defunct Southwest Conference to make the NCAA Tournament field.
