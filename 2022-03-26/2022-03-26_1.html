     Justin Moore injury update: Villanova's Elite Eight win dampened by loss to key contributor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That storyline will take a backseat, however, to the injury suffered to Justin Moore in the victory.
Moore, who averages 15 points, 4.9 rebounds and 34.1 minutes played per game, appeared to suffer an Achilles injury in the waning moments of the game.
ESPN's Jeff Borzello reported that Villanova coach Jay Wright said it Moore doesn't have any broken bones, but said it is "probably not good for Justin."
Jay Wright on Justin Moore's injury: "The X-ray was fine.

     Villanova Reaches Final Four After Almost Letting Houston Come Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2-seeded Villanova and No.
5-seeded Houston was reminiscent of the college basketball games played decades ago: Two dogged, rebound-devouring defensive behemoths scratching and clawing and barreling through defenders for tough-to-come by points.
The other, Villanova, has been looking to reposition itself as one of Division I’s most feared programs after a few dismal tournament seasons.
In the end, Coach Jay Wright’s Villanova team was too aggressive, too poised and too focused for Houston, which seemed ill-prepared to face an opponent it had so much in common with.
“It was like playing against our own selves,” said Caleb Daniels, Villanova’s redshirt-senior guard, after the game.

     Men’s basketball: Villanova headed back to Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ugly at times, the final result was beautiful for the Wildcats, who are going to their third Final Four in the past six NCAA Tournaments.
Jermaine Samuels had 16 points and 10 rebounds as Villanova grinded out a 50-44 victory over gritty and athletic Houston in the South Region final Saturday.
After Villanova missed three shots on the same possession – and was still without any second-chance points in the game – Moore got the long rebound on the break.
BIG PICTUREHouston: The Cougars had advanced to the Final Four all previous six times they had played in a regional final: 1967, 1968, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 2021.
Villanova: This is the fourth time in a row that Villanova won when getting to a regional final, following 2009, 2016 and 2018.

     Summary: Villanova escapes with a 50-44 win after a gritty affair against Houston to advance to the Final Four.
Taze Moore was the top scorer for Houston, going for 15 points and 10 rebounds.
Houston had landed the first punch against every team it had played in the NCAA tournament until this point.
Through the first 17 minutes, Houston had just one offensive rebound and forced just two turnovers, neither of which were live-ball turnovers.
A pair of Gillespie free throws pushed the Villanova lead to six, and Houston wouldn't get any closer.

     Summary: SAN ANTONIO – Villanova guard Collin Gillespie grabbed the final rebound and sprinted across the court at the AT&amp;T Center.
Villanova guard Justin Moore (5) is helped off the floor during the second half.
Despite losing three starters from last year’s Final Four team, then losing both its top scorer (Marcus Sasser) and its most talented Cougar (Tramon Mark) before Christmas, this Houston team wowed.
Houston guard Taze Moore (4) shoots the ball against Villanova guard Collin Gillespie (2) during the second half.
This Villanova team wasn’t all that deep to begin with.
