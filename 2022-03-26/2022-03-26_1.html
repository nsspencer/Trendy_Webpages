     Villanova fends off Houston in 'street fight,' as Jay Wright and the Wildcats land Final Four trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though the players are different these days, the result was familiar Saturday in the South Regional final.
Villanova earned coach Jay Wright’s fourth trip to the Final Four with a 50-44 victory over Houston, withstanding the Cougars’ ultra-physical style and their massive crowd advantage to earn a trip to New Orleans next week.
After a timeout by Wright, Gillespie drained a 17-foot jumper with a hand in his face — one of many moments where Villanova made a play to blunt Houston’s momentum.
"I felt like it was playing against our own selves," Villanova guard Caleb Daniels said.
Wright said Moore would get an MRI when the team returned to Philadelphia but acknowledged that it did not look promising.

     Villanova Reaches Final Four After Almost Letting Houston Come Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2-seeded Villanova and No.
5-seeded Houston was reminiscent of the college basketball games played decades ago: Two dogged, rebound-devouring defensive behemoths scratching and clawing and barreling through defenders for tough-to-come by points.
The other, Villanova, has been looking to reposition itself as one of Division I’s most feared programs after a few dismal tournament seasons.
In the end, Coach Jay Wright’s Villanova team was too aggressive, too poised and too focused for Houston, which seemed ill-prepared to face an opponent it had so much in common with.
“It was like playing against our own selves,” said Caleb Daniels, Villanova’s redshirt-senior guard, after the game.

     Men’s basketball: Villanova headed back to Final Four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ugly at times, the final result was beautiful for the Wildcats, who are going to their third Final Four in the past six NCAA Tournaments.
Jermaine Samuels had 16 points and 10 rebounds as Villanova grinded out a 50-44 victory over gritty and athletic Houston in the South Region final Saturday.
After Villanova missed three shots on the same possession – and was still without any second-chance points in the game – Moore got the long rebound on the break.
BIG PICTUREHouston: The Cougars had advanced to the Final Four all previous six times they had played in a regional final: 1967, 1968, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 2021.
Villanova: This is the fourth time in a row that Villanova won when getting to a regional final, following 2009, 2016 and 2018.

     Summary: Villanova escapes with a 50-44 win after a gritty affair against Houston to advance to the Final Four.
Houston had landed the first punch against every team it played in the NCAA tournament until this point.
But early on, Villanova wouldn't let Houston win where it likes to win: on the offensive glass and in transition.
Through the first 17 minutes, Houston had just one offensive rebound and forced just two turnovers -- neither of which were live-ball turnovers.
A pair of Gillespie free throws pushed the Villanova lead to six, and Houston wouldn't get any closer.
