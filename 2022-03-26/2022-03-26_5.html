     Summary: Mick Schumacher loses control at high speed and slams into the wall during qualifying at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
(0:30)JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Mick Schumacher was taken to hospital for precautionary checks after crashing heavily during qualifying for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
Schumacher was conscious when the medical car arrived on the scene and, although he appeared physically fine, was taken to the circuit's medical centre for checks and on to hospital via helicopter.
"Assessment at the medical centre revealed no injuries, and he has been transferred to King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah, for precautionary checks," an FIA statement said.
The impact of the crash broke Schumacher's car in two pieces, with the gearbox assembly falling off as the wreckage was lifted onto a recovery truck.

The 37-year-old Briton will line up 16th on the grid for Sunday's race after failing to make the cut by just 0.087 seconds.
The result marked the first time since the 2017 Brazilian Grand Prix that Hamilton had failed to make it past the first qualifying phase.

Hamilton, the winner in Saudi Arabia last year, has put in stirring drives from the back in the past but he is braced for a hard race on Sunday.

Race organizers said this attack won't dispel plans to continue with the second-ever Jeddah Grand Prix.
The missile and drone attacks Friday targeted the Saudi Aramco oil facility in Jeddah.
Pictures taken immediately following the attack showed huge balls of fire and smoke just miles from the Formula 1 venue.
According to the Associated Press, the attack targeted the same fuel depot Houthis had attacked in recent days.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lewis Hamilton is no stranger to making history in Formula One, but on Saturday evening, he looked far from his record-breaking form in qualifying at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
The Mercedes driver struggled to find pace in the car throughout the early stages of the evening in Jeddah.
He ended up 16th after the first round of qualifying, a mere 0.087 seconds off of Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, who finished in 15th place.
Hamilton hovered around the elimination zone before moving into 15th just before time expired in the first round.
It’s the first time that Hamilton has failed to make the second round of qualifying since the Brazil Grand Prix in 2017.

(0:26)JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said it would have been wrong for Formula One's drivers to boycott Sunday's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and leave the country in response to a missile attack 10 km from the circuit on Friday.
I think there was no right reason to leave the country after the facts that happened and with the assurance that we get.
"We had quite a few [meetings with] high-ranked authorities yesterday, and they explained us the situation," Aston Martin team principal Mike Krack said.
Haas team principal Guenther Steiner said he felt reassured by members of the Saudi Arabian government bringing their families to the race.

Conversations between drivers, team principals and F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali centered on safety and security conditions.
Hamilton and other drivers previously expressed their concerns about racing in the region, mainly concerning Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.

Soon after the accident Haas reported that Schumacher was "physically fine" and had spoken to his mother, adding that medical centre checks had revealed no injuries.
Schumacher was still airlifted to the King Fahad Armed Forces hospital for precautionary checks.
"Mick is physically in a good condition but will be flown by helicopter to hospital for further precautionary check-ups," Haas said.

Schumacher ran deep onto the curb at Turn 10 which unsettled his car and spun it backwards in a shower of sparks.
Leclerc inverted the order at the end of their second laps, but it was Sergio Perez who pipped the lot, jumping from third to first.
The Williams swapped ends as the Canadian tipped into the corner and made heavy side-on impact with the barrier.
The Japanese driver’s AlphaTauri was running a host of new power unit components after an engine failure during Friday practice.
