     NCAA Tournament 2022: Miami's Jim Larrañaga says Kansas' brand of basketball is 'simple' entering Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Hurricanes are in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history, and an upset of No.
1 seed Kansas is the Midwest Regional is all that separates Jim Larrañaga's group from advancing to the NCAA Final Four next weekend in New Orleans, Louisiana.
11 seed Iowa State Friday was the latest victory in the Hurricanes' improbable NCAA Tournament run, and now it's on to a second consecutive matchup against a Big 12 school in the Windy City.
But Larrañaga is keeping the message simple as his team prepares to face its biggest hurdle yet this March.
"The most important thing -- and I tell them this every day, and have since the tournament began -- smile and stay loose," Larrañaga said.

Moore, who’d played for the Jayhawks from 2017-19 before transferring away, and the Miami Hurricanes had already beaten USC and Auburn in the NCAA Tournament.
Moore, a sixth-year redshirt senior guard for the Hurricanes, will go up against the team he played for before going to DePaul and now Miami.

     Summary: MIAMI (AP) — Goran Dragic looked up at the overhead screen and watched the video that paid tribute to his seven seasons with the Miami Heat, then waved to acknowledge the loud cheers from his former home crowd.
It was the start of a great night for the Brooklyn Nets.
Kevin Durant scored 23 points, Seth Curry added 17 and the Nets overwhelmed Miami 110-95 on Saturday night, sending the Heat to their season-worst fourth consecutive loss.
Bam Adebayo scored 14 points for Miami, which trailed by as many as 37 — its biggest deficit of the season.
The Heat were without coach Erik Spoelstra, who missed the game because of a family matter, and assistant Chris Quinn took his place.
