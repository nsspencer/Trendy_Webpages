     Yemen’s Houthis suspend strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days – political office head
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIYADH (Reuters) – Yemen’s Houthi group said on Saturday it was suspending missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days, in a peace initiative it said could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen stopped air strikes and lifted port restrictions.
The group also announced a three-day suspension of ground offensive operations in Yemen, including in the gas producing region of Marib, said Mahdi al-Mashat, the head of the Houthis’ political office, in a speech broadcast on television.
Mashat said the group was ready to release all prisoners, including brother of Yemen’s President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Race organizers said this attack won't dispel plans to continue with the second-ever Jeddah Grand Prix.
The missile and drone attacks Friday targeted the Saudi Aramco oil facility in Jeddah.
Pictures taken immediately following the attack showed huge balls of fire and smoke just miles from the Formula 1 venue.
According to the Associated Press, the attack targeted the same fuel depot Houthis had attacked in recent days.

     Summary: Statement comes a day after a wave of drone and missile attacks hit targets across Saudi Arabia.
Yemen’s Houthi group has announced a three-day truce and dangled the prospect of a “permanent” ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition ends its operations against the impoverished country.
On Saturday, at least seven people were reported to have been killed in air raids conducted by the Saudi-led coalition on Sanaa and Hodeidah.
The Houthis said the attack by the coalition hit a power plant, a fuel supply station and the state-run social insurance office in the capital.
Later, Houthi political leader Mahdi al-Mashat announced the suspension of missile and drone attacks and all military actions for a period of three days.

     F1 race in Saudi Arabia to go ahead despite nearby attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Saturday, March 26, 2022 6:46 pmJIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Formula One said its race in Saudi Arabia will go ahead as scheduled this weekend despite attacks on the kingdom by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
The announcement came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot located about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the F1 circuit.
It caused a raging fire that rattled the drivers enough to hold extraordinary talks regarding F1's presence in Saudi Arabia.
The attack targeted the North Jiddah Bulk Plant, the same fuel depot the Houthis had attacked five days earlier.
The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida — both held by the Houthis — followed an attack by rebels on an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jiddah.

     Summary: Sergio Perez takes his first career pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as Formula One races on amid heavy scrutiny, the day after an attack on a nearby oil depotJIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Sergio Perez won the first pole of his career Saturday at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where Formula One has been under heavy scrutiny for continuing its race weekend following an attack on a nearby oil depot.
But most of Saturday was focused on F1's decision to continue at a circuit about 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the bombed, smoke-covered depot.
Sainz said racing was the right decision but that F1′s controversial participation in Saudi Arabia can’t be ignored once the series globe-trots away to Australia and then Europe.
Team principals were adamant Saturday it is safe to race in Saudi Arabia despite the attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels.
The Houthis acknowledged the attacks Friday evening and Saudi Arabia state TV called it a “hostile operation.”Hamilton and other drivers previously expressed their concerns about racing in the region, mainly concerning Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.

The State of Israel expresses its sorrow to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the horrific attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
This attack is further proof that Iran’s regional aggression knows no bounds &amp; reinforces the concern of Iran’s IRGC being removed from the FTO list.
The coalition said earlier on Saturday it was carrying out air strikes on Sanaa and Hodeidah in reaction to Houthi attacks on Saudi oil facilities.
The conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

The State of Israel expresses its sorrow to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the horrific attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
Unlike those four Arab nations, Saudi Arabia does not have formal ties with Jerusalem.
The UAE is allied with Saudi Arabia against the Houthis and has also been targeted by the rebels.
Gen. Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the strikes targeted “sources of threat” to Saudi Arabia, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency or SPA.
