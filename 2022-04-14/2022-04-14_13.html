     Summary: Every year it usually works out about 24 hours before the event, and she ends up in someone’s home.
“The problem is, I do have to think about it.”Many Jews have family and friends they spend the Passover Seders with every year.
But for others, Passover, which begins on Friday, can feel like the ultimate game of musical chairs, with everyone rushing to score a seat.
Those without family nearby, or who are recent converts to Judaism, often struggle with finding a seat at someone’s Seder table.
Some people want an invitation so badly that they are turning to social media to advertise their desire to attend a Seder and hopefully find their Passover match.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A parallel question echoes through Jewish households this year as we busily prepare for the holiday and remove from our homes even the most minute amount of leavening and wheat products (part of the holiday ritual): Why is this Passover different from other Passovers?
Optically, our tables will likely look very different this year since we are finally able to return to the bustling family seders that are part and parcel of the holiday.
After two Passovers enduring eerily quiet seders, 2022’s lessening of COVID regulations comes in just the nick of time.
In Israel this Passover, many families are taking Ukrainian refugees into their homes for the seders and beyond, thus making good on this liturgical offer.
At the end of it all, this Passover we are thankful to be alive, free, healthy, and most of all, together.

If you are looking to impress your host and feel seder-ready this year, here are five tips to keep in mind.
That being said, Koenig reminds us that “Passover is also a night dedicated to question-asking”—so no need to hold back.
“A bottle of great kosher wine (anything from Covenant Wines), though, is a safe bet, and particularly useful since it is customary to drink four glasses of wine during the Passover seder,” she says.
Be prepared to participateDuring the seder, the story of Passover is told through readings, songs, prayers, drinking wine, and eating specific foods.

     A Passover Tradition to Promote Jewish Unity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Because the Jewish calendar is a lunar one, Passover always falls on a full Moon, in March or April of the Gregorian calendar.
On the evening before every Passover during the Roman occupation of Jerusalem, Jewish leaders asked the Roman governor to free a single convict, who likely would have been a political prisoner.
The Hasmonean Civil War (67–63 BCE), a war of succession to determine who would be the next ruler of the Hasmonean Jewish Crown, had turned Jewish people against one another.
This act of Jewish unity would demonstrate that they could put their political differences aside for celebrating and honoring their Jewish ancestors—an issue still affecting Jewish families today.
ΔThe Hasmonean Civil War ultimately led to Roman intervention and loss of Jewish control over Jerusalem and its surroundings.

     A new Passover prayer connects Jewish tradition to Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adding a prayer to Passover, the widely observed Jewish holiday that begins at sundown Friday, seemed to Schonfeld like a way to draw that connection.
The wise child, the rebellious child, the simple child and the child who doesn’t even know how to ask are entry points to explaining the Passover story in different ways.
“The Fifth Child” urges believers to see not only themselves, but also contemporary refugees, as the Israelites in the Passover story and to take action to protect them.
Advertisement“By reading the Haggadah at the Passover Seder, we acknowledge that the Exodus is not only a story from ancient times but a story for all times,” the prayer says.
AdvertisementThe refugee prayer, Schonfeld said, stands in contrast to the four preceding prayers that use children as a framework for teaching the Passover story.

Some Protestants claim it is a unique tradition, like Maundy Thursday, a meal celebrating the Last Supper (which some mistakenly believe was actually a Passover seder).

I also want to say that I celebrate Passover a bit differently now than I did when I was younger.
Lawson: The thing that makes my wife's and my seder plate different is that we have a vegan house.
And early on, I was trying to figure out how to make a vegan seder plate and started doing some research.
When preparing for this interview, I saw that some people have suggested that for interfaith families you can have an artichoke on your seder plate.
