     Twitter stock soars after Elon Musk discloses buyout bid at 18% premium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.08% soared 12.2% in premarket trading Thursday, after Tesla Inc. TSLA, -2.63% "Technoking" Elon Musk disclosed a proposal to buy all of the outstanding shares of the social media company he doesn't already own for $54.20 each.
With 800.64 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 10, Musk's bid would value Twitter at $43.39 billion.
The disclosure comes in a 13D/A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission early Thursday, in which Musk confirmed his previous disclosure of owning 73.12 million Twitter shares, or 9.1% of the shares outstanding.
The filing said Musk had delivered a letter containing the "non-binding proposal" to Twitter, but says there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed.
Twitter's stock has gained 6.1% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.46% has lost 6.7%.

     Elon Musk Wants All of Twitter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder and biggest agitator, offered this morning to buy the rest of the social media company and take it private.
Twitter offered him a board seat, but he turned it down, removing any restrictions on his actions.
Musk said he had lost confidence in Twitter’s management to fulfill the company’s “societal imperative” as a platform for free speech.
“Twitter has extraordinary potential,” Musk said.
(Silver Lake’s Egon Durban, a Twitter director, has experience taking technology companies private, but his private equity firm has a standstill agreement with Twitter that seemingly limits it from participating in a takeover.)

ET on Thursday after Elon Musk offered to buy the short-form messaging platform for $54.20 per share, or around $43 billion.
His bid today, announced with the tweet "I made an offer," shows in what direction he wants to go.
I made an offer https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 14, 2022Now whatWith the stock only rising 3% at the market's open, it's fair to suggest there's not a lot of faith that Twitter will accept the bid.
Musk had also said that was his "best and final" offer for the company, and if it wasn't accepted, he would consider dumping all of his stock in the company.

     Summary: Elon Musk is offering to buy Twitter for $43 billion in cashEnlarge this image toggle caption Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty ImagesLast week, Elon Musk became Twitter's largest shareholder.
Now the world's richest person is offering to buy the company for $43 billion in cash, according to a regulatory filing dated Wednesday.
"I made an offer," Musk tweeted to his 81 million followers on Thursday.
"It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter," Ives said.
The next day, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced Musk would join the company's board — and had agreed to limit how much more Twitter stock he could buy.

     Summary: The bid also represents a 53.7% premium to the $35.27 closing price on Jan. 28, which was the trading session before Musk starting buying Twitter shares.
“I will unlock it.”With 800.64 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 10, Musk’s bid would value Twitter at about $43.39 billion.
Twitter’s stock slipped 0.1% in afternoon trading, paring intraday gains of as much as 5.8%, and earlier premarket gains of as much as 17.8%.
Musk had disclosed in early April that he had spent $2.64 billion to buy 73.12 million shares of Twitter, or 9.1% of the shares outstanding, to become Twitter’s largest shareholder.
Speaking at a Ted2022 conference in Canada, Musk said he offered to buy Twitter because it has become a defacto town square, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
