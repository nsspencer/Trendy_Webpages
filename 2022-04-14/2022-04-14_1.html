     What does “Maundy Thursday” mean?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maundy Thursday is derived from the words of Jesus in the Gospel of John, referring to the "new commandment" he gave his apostles.
In the English speaking world, many call Holy Thursday “Maundy Thursday.”What does that mean?
The word Maundy is related to the Latin word, “mandatum,” and is found in the liturgy during the washing of the feet.
This antiphon is taken from the Gospel of John and repeats the words of Jesus to his Apostles.
John 13:34“Maundy Thursday” is then translated as “Commandment Thursday,” a reference to the “new commandment” Jesus proclaimed, focused on loving others as Jesus loves us.

Maundy money is made up of coins that have been specially minted for the occasion – they are legal tender and are highly collectable.
By Mary Gillick, Maundy money depicts her in the same likeness as the first coins, which were issued in the year of her coronation in 1953.
This year, it has been confirmed that the Queen, 95, will not attend a Royal Maundy service at St George's Chapel, Windsor.
Some 95 men and 95 women will receive the Maundy money from Her Majesty.

     OPINION | Ted Talley: Overlooked Maundy Thursday a crucial piece of journey through Holy Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But what of the odd term "Maundy"?
In fact, I don't recall hearing the term Maundy until well into adulthood when I crossed the street to Methodism when my wife Linda, children and I lived in Connecticut.
Now up north, Southern Baptist churches are as scarce as grits at a Greek diner.
I could have become angry recalling the needless pestering of Linda and me to join a Southern Baptist congregation.
I suppose I was following Jesus' Maundy mandate: "Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another."

     Memory and mandate: A meditation on Maundy Thursday – Baptist News Global

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Passover’s observance in first century Palestine was like President’s Day, Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and Independence Day all rolled up into one.
In some parts of the church, Holy Week’s Maundy Thursday service is one where Jesus’ initiative in washing his disciples’ feet is replicated.
“Maundy” (mandatum in Latin) means mandate, commission, injunction.
In the Jesus story, the memory coheres with the mandate.
