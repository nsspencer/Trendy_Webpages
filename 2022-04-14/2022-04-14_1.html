     Ukraine claims its Neptune missiles hit Russian naval flagship Moskva
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian officials have claimed that its homemade anti-ship missiles struck the Russian Black Sea fleet's flagship cruiser, Moskva, Reuters reported.
According to the Ukrainian governor of the Odesa region, the Moskva was hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles that were first fielded in March last year.
These cruises' missiles are inspired by the Soviet-era Kh-35 (AS-20) 'Kayak' anti-ship missiles that can be launched from helicopters, surface ships, or defense batteries on the shores.
AdvertisementWhether the result of a fire or missile strike, the unavailability of its missile cruiser will set the Russian attack back.
Last month, a Russian landing ship was hit by a ballistic missile at the port of Berdyansk and reduced to ashes.

No way will Turkey allow one of the remaining two 'Slava'- class cruisers into the Black Sea to replace 'Moskva'", he tweeted.
"This is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and it's getting a bit long in the tooth but it is the symbol of Russian naval power in the Black Sea.

     Ukraine says it struck Russia’s top warship in Black Sea in missile attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late Wednesday, Odessa state regional administrator Maxim Marchenko said a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missile had struck the Moskva, causing serious damage.
Hours later, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged that a key ship in its Black Sea fleet had suffered significant damage but did not address the Ukrainian claims.
All of the ship’s approximately 500 crew members were evacuated to other Black Sea Fleet ships in the area, Russia said.
Ukraine said in an update that the Moskva “was severely damaged” by a Neptune missile that caused a fire.
“The flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva cruiser, was indeed attacked by the Neptune anti-ship missiles from the coastline between Odessa and Nikolaev,” it said.
