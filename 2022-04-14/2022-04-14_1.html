     Tesla Stock Drops After Elon Musk Offers to Buy Twitter. This Is Why.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to buy the social- media platform Twitter on Thursday, sending shares of the car maker lower.
Investors might be worried about distraction for Musk as Tesla (ticker: TSLA) ramps up production at new plants, but there are other potential concerns as well.
Twitter (TWTR) stock rose early in the day, but was down...

     Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter for $43 billion, so it can be 'transformed as private company'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in a filing published Thursday, saying the social media company needs to be transformed privately, a little over a week after revealing a 9.1% stake in the company.
According to Musk, the social media company needs to go private because it can "neither thrive nor serve" free speech in its current state.
Musk first disclosed his stake in the social media giant on April 4.
The Tesla CEO has previously criticized the social media giant publicly, polling people on Twitter last month about whether the company abides by free speech principles.
He also said he was considering building a new social media platform.

     Elon Musk Wants All of Twitter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder and biggest agitator, offered this morning to buy the rest of the social media company and take it private.
Twitter offered him a board seat, but he turned it down, removing any restrictions on his actions.
Musk said he had lost confidence in Twitter’s management to fulfill the company’s “societal imperative” as a platform for free speech.
“Twitter has extraordinary potential,” Musk said.
(Silver Lake’s Egon Durban, a Twitter director, has experience taking technology companies private, but his private equity firm has a standstill agreement with Twitter that seemingly limits it from participating in a takeover.)

     Summary: Elon Musk is offering to buy Twitter for $43 billion in cashEnlarge this image toggle caption Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty ImagesLast week, Elon Musk became Twitter's largest shareholder.
Now the world's richest person is offering to buy the company for $43 billion in cash, according to a regulatory filing dated Wednesday.
"I made an offer," Musk tweeted to his 81 million followers on Thursday.
"It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter," Ives said.
The next day, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced Musk would join the company's board — and had agreed to limit how much more Twitter stock he could buy.

     Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter in a deal valuing the social-media company at more than $43 billion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bid also represents a 53.7% premium to the $35.27 closing price on Jan. 28, which was the trading session before Musk starting buying Twitter shares.
“I will unlock it.”With 800.64 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 10, Musk’s bid would value Twitter at about $43.39 billion.
Twitter said it would “carefully review” Musk’s “unsolicited” bid and determine what it believes would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.
Twitter’s stock rose 2.8% in morning trading, paring earlier premarket gains of as much as 17.8%.
Musk had disclosed in early April that he had spent $2.64 billion to buy 73.12 million shares of Twitter, or 9.1% of the shares outstanding, to become Twitter’s largest shareholder.
