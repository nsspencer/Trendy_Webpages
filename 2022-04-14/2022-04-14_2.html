     Ukraine claims its Neptune missiles hit Russian naval flagship Moskva
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian officials have claimed that its homemade anti-ship missiles struck the Russian Black Sea fleet's flagship cruiser, Moskva, Reuters reported.
According to the Ukrainian governor of the Odesa region, the Moskva was hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles that were first fielded in March last year.
These cruises' missiles are inspired by the Soviet-era Kh-35 (AS-20) 'Kayak' anti-ship missiles that can be launched from helicopters, surface ships, or defense batteries on the shores.
AdvertisementWhether the result of a fire or missile strike, the unavailability of its missile cruiser will set the Russian attack back.
Last month, a Russian landing ship was hit by a ballistic missile at the port of Berdyansk and reduced to ashes.

No way will Turkey allow one of the remaining two 'Slava'- class cruisers into the Black Sea to replace 'Moskva'", he tweeted.
"This is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and it's getting a bit long in the tooth but it is the symbol of Russian naval power in the Black Sea.

     Russia to tow crippled warship back to port after what Ukraine says was a missile hit

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A satellite image shows a view of Russian Navy's guided missile cruiser Moskva at port, in Sevastopol, Crimea, April 7, 2022.
Russia's defence ministry said the fire on the Soviet-era missile cruiser Moskva had been contained, but left the ship badly damaged.
read moreUkraine's southern military command said that it hit the warship with a Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship missile and that it had started to sink.
Authorities in Transdniestria, which borders southern Ukraine, have previously denied Russia was preparing forces there to deploy in Ukraine.
Western-led sanctions have triggered the worst economic crisis in Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, say analysts.

     Ukraine says it struck Russia’s top warship in Black Sea in missile attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late Wednesday, Odessa state regional administrator Maxim Marchenko said a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missile had struck the Moskva, causing serious damage.
Hours later, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged that a key ship in its Black Sea fleet had sustained significant damage but did not address the Ukrainian claims.
All of the ship’s approximately 500 crew members were evacuated to other Black Sea Fleet ships in the area, Russia said.
Ukraine said in an update that the Moskva “was severely damaged” by a Neptune missile that caused a fire.
“The flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva cruiser, was indeed attacked by the Neptune anti-ship missiles from the coastline between Odessa and Nikolaev,” it said.

The Moskva's crew was evacuated onto other ships in the area, Russia's defence ministry said, admitting earlier that it was badly damaged.
"As a result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated," it said in comments reported by the Tass news agency.
At first it was thought the Ukrainian soldiers had been killed but the country's navy later said they had been captured alive by Russia.
Ukrainian soldiers trying to defend the strategically-important city have been fighting for weeks while running out of food, water, and ammunition.
