     Outer Range Challenges Expectations While it Entertains
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Does God exist?
And if he does, why does he let bad things happen?
“Outer Range” is one of those series in which you can’t pinpoint its origin, but it strikes a nerve.
Initially, Royal can’t figure out why Wayne suddenly wants the land.
One of the great pleasures of “Outer Range” derives from the known yet unknown, or the comprehension of incomprehensible questions.

     Outer Range review – Josh Brolin faces the unknown in maddening mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a giant empty space at the centre of Amazon’s splashy new sci-fi series Outer Range, literally at first and then figuratively by the end.
In the great expanse of Wyoming, in between two rival ranches, lies a confounding hole in the ground, meaning unknown.
Despite unusually grand visuals and a hard-at-work cast insisting otherwise, there’s really nothing at the bottom.
The oddities pile up thick and fast, both in the show’s scrappy plotting (which in some episodes feels less like plotting and more like a weird thing followed by a weird thing followed by another weird thing) and in how the story is told and performed, with one character repeatedly breaking into song to sing pop and soft rock classics, and other actors often resorting to long, overacted screams at the sky.
As is now too commonly the case with the exasperating expansion of the world of television to far, far beyond breaking point, there’s probably, nay definitely, a more effective two-hour movie buried here, drowned in padding.

     Cowboy up: Josh Brolin's 'Outer Range' continues TV's wild Western ride with 'Yellowstone,' '1883'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin had a 10-gallon-sized decision to make before taking on Amazon's Western series "Outer Range."
Executive producer Taylor Sheridan's "1883" spinoff, the settler origin story of the Duttons' Yellowstone Ranch, proved to be a runaway wagon train Paramount+ success with its explosive February finale.
On the heels of the eight-week "Outer Range" run, Epix's "Billy the Kid" begins an eight-episode ride April 24, highlighting the famed cowboy outlaw.
In "Outer Range," Tillerson sets up a modern Hatfield-McCoy feud against Brolin's Abbott clan.
But with a mysterious time-travel portal appearing on Abbott's rural grazing pasture, "Outer Range" veers distinctly paranormal, with bizarre happenings reminiscent of ABC's "Lost."
