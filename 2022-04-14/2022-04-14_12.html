     Atlanta Rapper Archie Eversole Shot Dead At 37
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archie Eversole, the Atlanta-based rapper best-known for the 2002 crunk hit “We Ready,” has been killed.
TMZ reports that Eversole died on Sunday after being shot at an Atlanta gas station about a week ago.
Archie Eversole was born on an American military base in Germany, and he was 17 when he recorded his 2002 debut album Ride Wit Me Dirty South Style.
