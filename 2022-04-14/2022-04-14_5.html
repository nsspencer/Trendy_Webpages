     The Kardashians on Hulu: Biggest differences from KUWTK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first episode premiered today, and is also available to stream on Disney +, with Kim Kardashian’s sex tape drama and her stint on Saturday Night Live taking centre stage.
We also got a front-row seat to Kourtney Kardashian’s budding romance with Travis Barker, as well as the fall-out from Scott Disick’s leaked DMs.
Biggest differences in KUWTK and the KardashiansThe style of filmingThe first difference that viewers will notice is the sleeker style of filming in the Kardashians.
KUWTK started as a warts-and-all reality series, lifting the curtain on Kim and co in 2007.
‘[It] kind of goes with the news cycle, if that makes sense, you just kind of see it all in real time.’The Kardashians is available to stream on Hulu and Disney + now.

     Hulu/Star Original Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 20 years of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”, the family took over a year off before returning with a brand new show, “The Kardashians”.
Which follows the lives of the infamous family members Kris, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie, who live in million-dollar houses in Los Angeles, and we get to be a fly on the wall during all of their drama.
This was the first time I’ve ever sat through an entire episode of “The Kardashians”, but my wife has watched the previous seasons.
Though, someone did get a drone for Christmas and was adamant that it is used as much as possible!
The family members really don’t seem to worry about the cameras being around, talking openly about all kinds of subjects, yet they still seem obsessed with how they look and dress.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘The Kardashians’ On Hulu, A New Series That Treads The Exact Same Ground As Their E! Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Hulu series The Kardashians is more or less a continuation of E!’s long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where Kris Jenner, her daughters, their kids, and various boyfriends/husbands interact and talk about, well, they talk about what’s going on with the Kardashians.
But things don’t work that way with Kris Jenner and her family.
The show has always been about the Kardashians arguing and gossiping about each other, and that’s exactly what you’re going to get with this new show.
That schtick got old years ago, especially as all of the Kardashian sisters and Kylie Jenner became mothers.
Even if you’re a fan of the Kardashians, the whole more-of-the-same vibe of The Kardashians is just a crashing bore.

     The Kardashians Series-Premiere Recap: Bodysuits and Lawsuits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It turns out it essentially meant the continuation of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, sans those first three words.
And with that recalibration and new home came the longest gap that the family has been off television in 15 years.
After a ten-month absence, the Kardashian family is back on our screens, and what better way to start this new chapter than with drones?
But things didn’t seem so splintered with Kourtney and Scott at the end of Keeping Up — so what changed?
And in true reality television fashion, as a fight bubbles up, in comes those three magic words: To be continued.
