     Summary: Dianne Feinstein, 88, is a giant of California politics.
The former mayor of San Francisco is the oldest sitting U.S. senator.
She's held the office since 1992.
Now, five members of Congress — including four Democrats — have told The Chronicle that they're concerned that her memory is rapidly deteriorating, and that it appears she can no longer represent the state without her staff doing much of the work.

Senators in a single term, if in fact Senator Dianne Feinstein is further pushed to retire following a damning new investigative report by the SF Chronicle.

     Summary: “It’s bad,” one Democratic senator told the paper, referring to Feinstein’s memory.
All of that is gone,” the congressional Democrat told the Chronicle.
“She was an intellectual and political force not that long ago, and that’s why my encounter with her was so jarring.
Feinstein, the longest-serving senator in California history who in November will become the longest-tenured female senator in U.S. history, has consistently defended her capacity to lead.
“I don’t feel my cognitive abilities have diminished,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2020, following the publication of the New Yorker report.

     Summary: Four senators told the San Francisco Chronicle they're worried about Sen. Feinstein's memory.
At a memorial service in June, Feinstein spoke of the dead person in present tense.
One unnamed member of Congress said Sen. Dianne Feinstein's mental acuity raised such concern for them that they considered staging "some kind of intervention" to get the 88-year-old California Democrat to retire, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday.
Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, called Feinstein "a workhorse for the people of California."
The first time up, she made generic comments about the city of San Francisco and incorrectly gave Pelosi a shoutout as "the Democratic leader in the United States Senate."

     ‘Bad and Getting Worse’: Dianne Feinstein Is Losing Her Memory, Concerned Senate Sources Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colleagues are worried Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who turns 89 in June, is no longer fit to serve, according to a new report from the San Francisco Chronicle.
Because there was just no trace of that.”“It’s bad and it’s getting worse,” added a Democratic senator, noting that Feinstein has had difficulty keeping up conversations.
The Chronicle points to 2020 when it was possible that she could head up the Senate Judiciary Committee should Biden win and Democrats control the Senate (Sen. Dick Durbin is the current chair).
Feinstein would be third in line for the presidency if Democrats retain control of the Senate in November, as Sen. Patrick Leahy’s retirement would make her Senate pro tempore.
The only way Feinstein could be removed from office is through her retirement or a two-thirds vote in the Senate.
