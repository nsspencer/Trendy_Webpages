     ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’ Review: The Plot Against Muggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Dumbledore grappling with a family full of grievances, the story barely has any room for Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the fluttery animal caregiver who tends to the fantastic beasts of the title.
“Secrets of Dumbledore” gestures toward themes of frailty, thwarted intentions and forgiveness.
(A brief detour to Hogwarts serves as a startling reminder that these movies used to rely on actors under 30.)
The image is a reminder that fiction is not just a history lesson, but a means of escape.
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of DumbledoreRated PG-13 for some fantasy violence, particularly toward magic animals.

     Review: ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’: More beasts, slightly less fantastic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although subtitled “The Secrets of Dumbledore,” the movie is only nominally about Dumbledore family secrets: not just those involving the great wizard Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) in the years before he became headmaster of Hogwarts, but those concerning other branches of his family tree.
To be sure, the film does open with Albus having a genteel tea with his unlikely paramour, evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen, replacing Johnny Depp).
But their romance – which includes a blood oath whereby neither man can attack the other – is no secret by now.
These plot points involving human relationships are fascinating.
It might not be the most spellbinding of the prequels so far, but it does advance this saga in an entertaining, if less than fantastic, way.

     Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore: New Wizard Hitler Fails to Enliven Dying Franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wait, Dumbledore spent a summer hooking up with Wizard Hitler?
), Law and Mikkelsen provide the only watchable moments in Secrets of Dumbledore, allowing their genuine chemistry to complicate their ideological animosity.
These are justified as such because that damned Wizard Hitler can see the future, and thus they must act in unplanned and chaotic ways.
If you’re on the run from some kind of Wizard Hitler, J.K., you can give us a sign, perhaps by donating a large sum of money to a trans rights organization.
These political scenes are particularly dopey because they predominantly take place in Berlin, just in case we didn’t get the Wizard Hitler thing…after spending an entire literary and film series with Voldemort, her other Wizard Hitler.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Third time's a charm for the "Fantastic Beasts" series, which took three tries to — finally — produce something that feels like a complete movie.
"The Secrets of Dumbledore" takes a few scenes to get going.
After the introduction of a dizzying array of characters and story lines, things don't really click until Jessica Williams' Lally Hicks shows up to summarize what happened in "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald."
At least for its straight characters, "Secrets" insists, love is stronger than magic.
'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore'*** out of 4 starsRated: PG-13 for violence.
