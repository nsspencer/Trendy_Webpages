     Kim Kardashian Praised for Handling of Sex Tape Drama in 'The Kardashians'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kim Kardashian is being praised by fans for her handling of a new sex tape drama in her new reality show.
The Kardashians on Hulu has arrived and the very first episode saw Kim Kardashian's infamous sex tape come back to haunt her, prompting the reality TV star to pledge to "burn them all to the f****** ground."
The episode showed a distressed Kardashian calling her lawyer and insisting that she will not endure another sex tape scandal.
Later, in an episode confessional, Kardashian explained that the pop up was a "click-bait" link that advertised "super inappropriate" footage of the sex tape.
"I love seeing @KimKardashian stand in her power with the Roblox sex tape scandal, refusing to allow herself and her brand to be shamed or clouted off," reads one tweet.

     Summary: Hulu's 'The Kardashians' continues a modern saga: a family famous for being famousEnlarge this image toggle caption Hulu HuluI never really understood why viewers showed up to watch the Kardashians until I saw Hulu's The Kardashians.
Which means it also still showcases the elements of reality TV that irritate me most as a critic.
Kim humanizes and energizes 'The Kardashians'At the center of all this is Kim Kardashian, the most famous family member and the person who most embodies this bizarre dynamic.
Through it all, because of the duplicitous nature of so-called reality TV, it is difficult to know how to process any of this.
Honestly, if you hated this family before now, Hulu's The Kardashians won't change your mind.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘The Kardashians’ On Hulu, A New Series That Treads The Exact Same Ground As Their E! Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Hulu series The Kardashians is more or less a continuation of E!’s long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where Kris Jenner, her daughters, their kids, and various boyfriends/husbands interact and talk about, well, they talk about what’s going on with the Kardashians.
But things don’t work that way with Kris Jenner and her family.
The show has always been about the Kardashians arguing and gossiping about each other, and that’s exactly what you’re going to get with this new show.
That schtick got old years ago, especially as all of the Kardashian sisters and Kylie Jenner became mothers.
Even if you’re a fan of the Kardashians, the whole more-of-the-same vibe of The Kardashians is just a crashing bore.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And as Khloé Kardashian notes in the series premiere, everything comes full circle when Kim Kardashian has to address her sex tape once again 20 years later.
If you’ve been a fan of the family since the beginning, you’ll know the sex tape was the subject of Keeping Up With the Kardashian‘s pilot episode.
They’re not married or even engaged yet in The Kardashians series premiere, but viewers learn how they fell in love.
It’s a good thing Saint can’t read yet, because the caption on the photo of Kim’s crying face claimed there was no footage of her sex tape soon to be released.
The Roblox ad claimed there was never-before-seen footage of the sex tape that made Kim infamous.
