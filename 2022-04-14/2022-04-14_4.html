    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

in 2021, they've returned with a flashy, upgraded series (dubbed simply The Kardashians) that you can now stream on Hulu.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘The Kardashians’ On Hulu, A New Series That Treads The Exact Same Ground As Their E! Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Hulu series The Kardashians is more or less a continuation of E!’s long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where Kris Jenner, her daughters, their kids, and various boyfriends/husbands interact and talk about, well, they talk about what’s going on with the Kardashians.
But things don’t work that way with Kris Jenner and her family.
The show has always been about the Kardashians arguing and gossiping about each other, and that’s exactly what you’re going to get with this new show.
That schtick got old years ago, especially as all of the Kardashian sisters and Kylie Jenner became mothers.
Even if you’re a fan of the Kardashians, the whole more-of-the-same vibe of The Kardashians is just a crashing bore.

     Summary: Hulu's 'The Kardashians' continues a modern saga: a family famous for being famousEnlarge this image toggle caption Hulu HuluI never really understood why viewers showed up to watch the Kardashians until I saw Hulu's The Kardashians.
Which means it also still showcases the elements of reality TV that irritate me most as a critic.
Kim humanizes and energizes 'The Kardashians'At the center of all this is Kim Kardashian, the most famous family member and the person who most embodies this bizarre dynamic.
Through it all, because of the duplicitous nature of so-called reality TV, it is difficult to know how to process any of this.
Honestly, if you hated this family before now, Hulu's The Kardashians won't change your mind.

     ‘The Kardashians’ Showrunner Teases How Hulu Series Will Navigate Family Drama (EXCLUSIVE)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They’re really delightful.
What is something about them that you don’t think the public might recognize?
I think that’s something that maybe the public doesn’t appreciate enough.
It just speaks to the curiosity that people have with the family, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing.
They’re really good about not censoring themselves, and always looking at it as a producer, not as a person who is in the show.
