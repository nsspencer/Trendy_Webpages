     The Kardashians on Hulu: Biggest differences from KUWTK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first episode premiered today, and is also available to stream on Disney +, with Kim Kardashian’s sex tape drama and her stint on Saturday Night Live taking centre stage.
We also got a front-row seat to Kourtney Kardashian’s budding romance with Travis Barker, as well as the fall-out from Scott Disick’s leaked DMs.
Biggest differences in KUWTK and the KardashiansThe style of filmingThe first difference that viewers will notice is the sleeker style of filming in the Kardashians.
KUWTK started as a warts-and-all reality series, lifting the curtain on Kim and co in 2007.
‘[It] kind of goes with the news cycle, if that makes sense, you just kind of see it all in real time.’The Kardashians is available to stream on Hulu and Disney + now.

     Hulu/Star Original Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 20 years of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”, the family took over a year off before returning with a brand new show, “The Kardashians”.
Which follows the lives of the infamous family members Kris, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie, who live in million-dollar houses in Los Angeles, and we get to be a fly on the wall during all of their drama.
This was the first time I’ve ever sat through an entire episode of “The Kardashians”, but my wife has watched the previous seasons.
Though, someone did get a drone for Christmas and was adamant that it is used as much as possible!
The family members really don’t seem to worry about the cameras being around, talking openly about all kinds of subjects, yet they still seem obsessed with how they look and dress.

     Summary: It turns out it essentially meant the continuation of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, sans those first three words.
And with that recalibration and new home came the longest gap that the family has been off television in 15 years.
After a ten-month absence, the Kardashian family is back on our screens, and what better way to start this new chapter than with drones?
But things didn’t seem so splintered with Kourtney and Scott at the end of Keeping Up — so what changed?
And in true reality television fashion, as a fight bubbles up, in comes those three magic words: To be continued.

     Fans go wild over The Kardashians branding the new show 'perfect'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another person thought it was funny how the new series was again starting with talk of Kim's sex tape.
The first season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in the aftermath of Kim Kardashian's leaked sex tape with ex-boyfriend Ray J back in 2007.
‘It was a game that someone made of Roblox and it said Kim’s New Sex Tape when you clicked on it.
Kim tells someone that she ‘likes all of these,’ before getting into her car and taking off as the title card is shown.
He added in confession, ‘Kourtney has all right to despise me and the way I treated her, cause it was horrible.
