     Summary: “I meet regularly with leaders,” Feinstein said Thursday in a call with Chronicle editorial board leaders.
And so I’m rather puzzled by all of this.”Feinstein, 88, is a stalwart of California politics and a trailblazing woman.
California officials were quiet on The Chronicle’s reporting, as well as Feinstein’s performance.
Gavin Newsom, who would name a replacement should Feinstein leave office before the end of her term, declined to comment.
“Term Limits wouldn’t be entirely bad,” tweeted Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College.

     Summary: “It’s bad,” one Democratic senator told the paper, referring to Feinstein’s memory.
All of that is gone,” the congressional Democrat told the Chronicle.
“She was an intellectual and political force not that long ago, and that’s why my encounter with her was so jarring.
Feinstein, the longest-serving senator in California history who in November will become the longest-tenured female senator in U.S. history, has consistently defended her capacity to lead.
“I don’t feel my cognitive abilities have diminished,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2020, following the publication of the New Yorker report.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Nov. 27, 1978, Dianne Feinstein – then the 45-year-old president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and two-time failed mayoral candidate – effectively announced her retirement from politics.
But San Francisco was always her home, even after three decades in Washington.
Feinstein is not from the San Francisco of hippies, new tech wealth, radical politics or LGBTQ activism.
Mayor Feinstein’s generally conservative demeanor was also a target of our teenage derision, and other people’s as well.
Feinstein’s legacyAfter leaving the San Francisco mayor’s office in 1987, Feinstein ran for governor of California in 1990.

     Sen. Dianne Feinstein Responds After Colleagues' Accounts That Her Memory Is Deteriorating
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a statement to PEOPLE shared by her press team, Feinstein pushed back on these accounts of infirmity.
Politico reported in 2020, for example, that some lawmakers felt then that she could no longer effectively lead — in particular as the potential Judiciary Committee chair presiding over hearings.
Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992, becoming one of the first two women (along with former Sen. Barbara Boxer) to serve there.
"As someone who sees her multiple times a week, including on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I can tell you she's still doing the job and doing it well," he said.
"Senator Feinstein is a workhorse for the people of California and a respected leader among her colleagues in the Senate," she said.

     US Senator Dianne Feinstein, 88, will NOT step down before her term ends in 2024
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: California Senator Dianne Feinstein said she won't step down from her position before it ends in 2024, despite democratic colleagues saying they're concerned she's 'mentally unfit to serve.'
Feinstein, 88, said she 'regularly' meets with leaders and isn't 'isolated,' after four senators - three of them Democrats - a California Congress member, and three former staffers said that her short-term memory is deteriorating.
Talk has been floated of persuading her to resign before her current term ends in 2024.
California's junior senator Padilla said he'd 'heard some of the same concerns' but brushed them off when asked by the Chronicle.
'Senator Feinstein is a workhorse for the people of California and a respected leader among her colleagues in the Senate,' Pelosi said, adding that Feinstein was 'constantly traveling' across the country to fulfill her duties.
