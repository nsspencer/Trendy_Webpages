     Hulu/Star Original Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 20 years of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”, the family took over a year off before returning with a brand new show, “The Kardashians”.
Which follows the lives of the infamous family members Kris, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie, who live in million-dollar houses in Los Angeles, and we get to be a fly on the wall during all of their drama.
This was the first time I’ve ever sat through an entire episode of “The Kardashians”, but my wife has watched the previous seasons.
Though, someone did get a drone for Christmas and was adamant that it is used as much as possible!
The family members really don’t seem to worry about the cameras being around, talking openly about all kinds of subjects, yet they still seem obsessed with how they look and dress.

     Summary: Another person thought it was funny how the new series was again starting with talk of Kim's sex tape.
The first season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in the aftermath of Kim Kardashian's leaked sex tape with ex-boyfriend Ray J back in 2007.
‘It was a game that someone made of Roblox and it said Kim’s New Sex Tape when you clicked on it.
Kim tells someone that she ‘likes all of these,’ before getting into her car and taking off as the title card is shown.
He added in confession, ‘Kourtney has all right to despise me and the way I treated her, cause it was horrible.
