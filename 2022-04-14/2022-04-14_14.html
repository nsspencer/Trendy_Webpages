     Summary: 1 A warm welcome for Ukrainian refugeesMore than 4.6 million Ukrainians have left the country, with many fleeing into neighboring states such as Poland and Romania.
Not all of these governments had laid out the red carpet for refugees in the past, but to accommodate this influx, European leaders installed a new playbook, forging political consensus and streamlining the asylum-seeking process.
Farther away, even Japan has moved to accept dozens of displaced Ukrainians — a remarkable move by a country that historically has been unwelcoming to asylum seekers.
As of early April, Tokyo has welcomed more than 400 people — with some flying on a government-chartered plane from Poland.

     The Russia-Ukraine war provides an opportunity to reform the UN
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Russia-Ukraine war is forcing the world to acknowledge critical failings in how our international institutions operate.
Yet, evoking the Geneva or Hague Conventions, as well as the UN charter, requires the UN Security Council to issue a resolution to establish a tribunal.
This will not happen because Russia is on the Security Council and has the power to veto any resolution.
For these reasons, now, the Russian invasion could propel reform of how the veto is exercised in the Security Council.
The reform would be hard, as 2/3 of the UN General Assembly and all the members of the Security Council would have to approve it.

     Why the Term 'Genocide' Matters in Ukraine War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden declares Russia's Ukraine war “genocide,” it isn't just another strong word.
That’s partly because of a genocide treaty approved by the U.N. General Assembly after World War II, signed by the United States and more than 150 other nations.
A Jewish lawyer from Poland, Raphael Lemkin, coined it at the height of World War II and the Holocaust.
An international tribunal charged Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic with war crimes, although Milosevic died before his trial concluded.
Starting in 2005, world also leaders embraced – in principle – responsibility for collective action to stop genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
