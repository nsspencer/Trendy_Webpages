    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Dumbledore grappling with a family full of grievances, the story barely has any room for Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the fluttery animal caregiver who tends to the fantastic beasts of the title.
“Secrets of Dumbledore” gestures toward themes of frailty, thwarted intentions and forgiveness.
(A brief detour to Hogwarts serves as a startling reminder that these movies used to rely on actors under 30.)
The image is a reminder that fiction is not just a history lesson, but a means of escape.
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of DumbledoreRated PG-13 for some fantasy violence, particularly toward magic animals.

     Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These “Fantastic Beasts” movies are just not good.
They’re all chasing the dragon of that astronomical, worldwide, once-in-a-generation “Harry Potter” success, but each new movie in this spinoff franchise reminds us of how unnecessary and inferior they are.
David Yates is back once again as director, having helmed the previous two “Fantastic Beasts” and the final four “Harry Potter” movies.
Despite all that expertise—or perhaps because of it—“The Secrets of Dumbledore” feels overstuffed as it lumbers from one plotline to another.
But “The Secrets of Dumbledore” has weightier matters on its mind, which it tries to convey awkwardly between big, action set pieces and lighthearted bits of physical comedy.

     ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’ Review: Mangy Malaise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of them is Albus Dumbledore, the Hogwarts headmaster played as a younger man by Jude Law.
The other is his nemesis, the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, who now wants to dominate the world.
He was supposed to be played, as in the two previous installments of the franchise, by Johnny Depp, who left the role in the aftermath of a widely publicized libel suit.
His replacement, Mads Mikkelsen, looks like he rues the day he signed the contract, and who can blame him?
There’s nothing to play because there’s nothing of any interest in the character, or in the whole mysteriously turgid film.

JUDE LAW, left, as Albus Dumbledore and EDDIE REDMAYNE as Newt Scamander in Warner Bros. Pictures' fantasy adventure "FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release.
Aside from that, this staring contest-like “Fantastic Beasts” is not very bewitching at all.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Editors's Notes: The following contains Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore spoilers.
The third installment in the Harry Potter prequel series certainly had a lot of questions to answer.
Thankfully, The Secrets of Dumbledore is a much stronger film that provided some needed clarity after the confusing second film.
He walks down the chilly street, in a parallel to the opening moments of the first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
The Fantastic Beasts series still has a ways to go before it reaches the Harry Potter timeline.

     Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third “Fantastic Beasts” film, “The Secrets of Dumbledore” has started casting its spell.
“Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” reminds viewers of Albus Dumbledore’s shrouded family history.
This is a huge thing, from the very first scene of “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” – a magical locket that Dumbledore has wrapped around his wrist that painfully constricts (sometimes drawing blood).
There is a brief scene of her watching the Wizarding World election take place.
Whether or not Tina and Newt will continue their relationship (while protecting the Wizarding World) remains to be seen.

     Movie Review: FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, the putative central figure of the FANTASTIC BEASTS films remains Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), zoologist and protector of, well, fantastic beasts.
Director David Yates and screenwriters Rowling &amp; Steve Kloves make FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE an immersive experience, if not a consistent one.
Parents should be advised that, despite its HARRY POTTER connections, FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE is not for little ones.
FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE is uneven, but what’s good about it is very good indeed.
