     Toronto Blue Jays: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. puts MLB pitchers on notice

     Summary: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. #27 of the Toronto Blue Jays runs the bases after his first inning home run against the New York Yankees.
(Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images)Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is showing that last season was just the beginning for the Toronto Blue Jays slugger after a special night at Yankee Stadium.
It also shows how Guerrero Jr. can take over a game like only a few stars in the league can.
Safe to say that just one week into the season, Blue Jays fans have been getting full value whenever they tune into a game.
That’s because there aren’t many in MLB right now who make it look as easy as Guerrero Jr. does.
