     Sammy Watkins agrees to one-year, $4M contract with Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 receiver, Watkins struggled with injuries early in his career before being traded from Buffalo to Los Angeles.
He caught eight touchdown passes in 15 games with the Rams, leading to Watkins signing a healthy three-year, $48 million deal with the Chiefs in 2018, but he's since gone from a quality No.
Playing with Rodgers, Watkins could also see an increase in targets after getting just 49 of them in Baltimore last season, the lowest total of his career.
In the Ravens' run-first offense, Watkins caught just 27 passes for 394 yards and one touchdown in 2021.
All of those marks were career-lows for Watkins, who at 28 years old didn't receive much attention from prospective teams.

     Green Bay Packers sign veteran wide receiver Sammy Watkins

     Summary: Keyshawn Johnson and Damien Woody break down whether Sammy Watkins is a quality pickup for the Green Bay Packers.
(1:10)The Green Bay Packers are finally adding to their receiver room by signing veteran Sammy Watkins.
A source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Watkins' contract is for one year and worth up to $4 million.
Packers coach Matt LaFleur coached Watkins with the Rams in 2017, and Packers receivers coach Jason Vrable was in Buffalo when the Bills drafted him fourth overall in 2014.
In his eight-year career, Watkins has totaled 348 receptions for 5,059 yards receiving and 34 touchdown catches for the Bills, Los Angeles Rams, Kansas City Chiefs and Ravens.

     NFL free agency 2022: Packers sign Sammy Watkins to reported one-year, $4 million deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's no secret the Green Bay Packers need to add multiple wide receivers this offseason, especially after the Davante Adams trade.
The Packers are expected by many to draft a wideout with one of their two first-round picks, but Green Bay is also still working in free agency.
Watkins spent the 2021 season with the Baltimore Ravens, catching 27 passes for 394 yards and one touchdown in 13 games played.
Watkins caught just eight touchdowns in three seasons with the Chiefs, but did get a Super Bowl ring to cap the 2019 campaign.
All five of our CBS Sports NFL Draft experts have Green Bay taking at least one receiver in the opening round.

     Packers sign veteran wide receiver Sammy Watkins to a one-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Green Bay Packers have a veteran receiver familiar with coach Matt LaFleur’s offense in the fold.
The Packers need veteran help at wide receiver after trading Davante Adams (Las Vegas) and losing Marquez Valdes-Scantling (Kansas City) and Equanimeous St. Brown (Chicago) in free agency.
Though they have $15 million in cap space, the Packers weren't looking to spend a lot and may view Watkins similarly to Devin Funchess, the veteran receiver they took a chance on two seasons ago.
The 6-1, 211-pound receiver has battled injuries throughout his career and hasn’t appeared in 16 games in a season since his rookie season of 2014.
Over his eight seasons, Watkins has 348 catches for 5,059 yards (14.5 average) and 34 touchdowns.

     Packers sign WR Sammy Watkins to one-year contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The newest Packers receiver is Sammy Watkins, the eight-year veteran who played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2021.
Watkins signed a one-year contract on Thursday, which according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter is worth up to $4 million.
Although Watkins has spent eight years in the NFL, he will still be just 29 years old for the 2022 season.
The Packers’ wide receiver room now adds Watkins to a group that consists of Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb, Amari Rodgers, Malik Taylor, and Juwann Winfree.
That should still allow the Packers to select a pair of wideouts in the 2022 NFL Draft, particularly if one or both of them can contribute on special teams.
