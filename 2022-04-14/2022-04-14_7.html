     Yankees news: Aaron Judge's 5-word truth bomb on Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In case you needed further proof that Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is the real deal, the Toronto Blue Jays’ first baseman went full Babe Ruth Wednesday night against Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees in the Bronx.
In six games to date this 2022 MLB season, Guerrero already has four home runs and eight RBIs, while batting .391.
Vladimir Guerrero Jr. of the @BlueJays is the youngest player in MLB history to go 4-for-4 (or better) with 3+ HR and 4+ XBH in a game.
It’s also worth noting that Judge was fourth in the voting with the Yankees outfielder gaining 41 percent share of the votes.
If anything, Guerrero is 0 of 2 with a strikeout in his career against the Yankees’ righty.

     Yankees’ Aaron Hicks doubts this Vladimir Guerrero Jr. home run is legit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Aaron Boone still wasn’t sure exactly what happened.
New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks, however, was pretty adamant that Vladimir Guerrero’s first homer of the trio he rushed shouldn’t have counted in a 6-4 loss to the Blue Jays on Wednesday night.
“I still don’t feel like it went out,” Hicks told reporters after the game.
“They were telling me that the guys (in the league office) were saying it was a home run and that it hit something back there,” Hicks said.
“I felt like the ball came out of my glove and hit the top of the wall and came right back in,” he said.

     Blue Jays: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. tears down the House that Ruth Built
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guerrero hit three home runs, two of them off Yankees ace Gerrit Cole, and added a double to propel the Blue Jays to a 6-4 win.
Guerrero’s 14 total bases on Wednesday were the second-most in Blue Jays history, behind only Delgado’s four homers in 2003.
In the second inning, Hicks was running out an infield single when he stepped on Guerrero’s exposed hand.
Guerrero was rushed back to the Blue Jays dugout, and two stitches were applied to his bleeding hand.
It may be the House That Ruth Built, but on Wednesday, it belonged to Guerrero and the Blue Jays.
