     Opinion | What Good Friday and Easter Mean for Black Americans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since the time of the hush harbors, Black Christians have found solace in the idea that the God they worshiped knew the trouble we’d seen.
The body that God raised was the same body that was on the cross.
When my body is raised, it will be a Black body.
The resurrection of Black bodies will be the definitive rejection of all forms of racism.
If a Black body can be hanged from a tree and burned, never to be restored again, what kind of victory is the survival of a soul?

     Summary: Here’s everything you need to know about why we eat fish on Good Friday.
Why should you eat fish on Good Friday?
According to Christianity Jesus sacrificed his own flesh on Good Friday, so the rule is to avoid eating meat on this day.
This was changed in the 1960s by The Second Vatican Council, which decreed that it is now only guidance to avoid meat on Fridays during Lent, including Good Friday as well as Ash Wednesday.
Although often referred to as a bank holiday, Good Friday was in fact an existing common law holiday, and so didn’t require to be officially denoted as such with the introduction of the Bank Holidays Act in 1871.
