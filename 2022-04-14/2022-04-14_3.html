     Prince Charles takes on centuries old tradition at Maundy Thursday service
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prince Charles has taken on an “ancient” tradition at this year’s Maundy Thursday service after the Queen pulled out of this annual occasion.
The Prince of Wales took a major role in the Maundy Thursday service as the Queen didn’t attend for the first time since 1970.
Prince Charles reportedly handed out the Maundy coins – something Her Majesty has traditionally done throughout her reign.
Following the announcement from Buckingham Palace that the Queen would miss the Maundy Thursday service this year, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla have stepped up at this major Easter occasion.
It’s wonderful to see this “ancient” Royal Maundy ceremony continue, especially given its huge significance to the Queen.

Instead of washing people’s feet, the Queen marks the date by giving out special commemorative coins called Maundy money, a tradition with its origins in medieval times.
Charles and Camilla will take the Queen’s place at today’s Royal Maundy service at St George’s Chapel.
The white purse is filled with uniquely minted Maundy money – silver 10p and 3p pieces – to the value of 96 pence.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Passover’s observance in first century Palestine was like President’s Day, Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and Independence Day all rolled up into one.
In some parts of the church, Holy Week’s Maundy Thursday service is one where Jesus’ initiative in washing his disciples’ feet is replicated.
“Maundy” (mandatum in Latin) means mandate, commission, injunction.
In the Jesus story, the memory coheres with the mandate.

Maundy money is made up of coins that have been specially minted for the occasion – they are legal tender and are highly collectable.
By Mary Gillick, Maundy money depicts her in the same likeness as the first coins, which were issued in the year of her coronation in 1953.
This year, it has been confirmed that the Queen, 95, will not attend a Royal Maundy service at St George's Chapel, Windsor.
Some 95 men and 95 women will receive the Maundy money from Her Majesty.

     Prince Charles and Camilla step in for Queen at Maundy Thursday service after she pulls out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The traditional Maundy money has been handed out by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall after the Queen was forced to cancel her attendance today.
The Royal Maundy Service is held each year when, ordinarily, it is the Queen who offers ‘alms’ to senior citizens in recognition of their service to their churches and communities.
When the Queen first carried out this tradition, she gave Maundy money to just 26 men and women, which was her age in 1952.
Today, each of the 96 male and 96 females pensioners received two purses of Maundy money - one red and one white.
The White Purse contains 96 pennies of minted Maundy Money in nine sets of 10p and two three pences, for the Queen’s age.
