    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual Royal Maundy service—where the monarch distributes Maundy money to retired pensioners on the Thursday before Easter—has been a staple in the Queen’s calendar since she ascended to the throne in 1952.
Queen Elizabeth II distributes the traditional Maundy money during the Royal Maundy service at St George’s Chapel on March 29, 2018.

     Prince Charles takes on centuries old tradition at Maundy Thursday service
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prince Charles has taken on an “ancient” tradition at this year’s Maundy Thursday service after the Queen pulled out of this annual occasion.
The Prince of Wales took a major role in the Maundy Thursday service as the Queen didn’t attend for the first time since 1970.
Prince Charles reportedly handed out the Maundy coins – something Her Majesty has traditionally done throughout her reign.
Following the announcement from Buckingham Palace that the Queen would miss the Maundy Thursday service this year, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla have stepped up at this major Easter occasion.
It’s wonderful to see this “ancient” Royal Maundy ceremony continue, especially given its huge significance to the Queen.

     What does “Maundy Thursday” mean?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maundy Thursday is derived from the words of Jesus in the Gospel of John, referring to the "new commandment" he gave his apostles.
In the English speaking world, many call Holy Thursday “Maundy Thursday.”What does that mean?
The word Maundy is related to the Latin word, “mandatum,” and is found in the liturgy during the washing of the feet.
This antiphon is taken from the Gospel of John and repeats the words of Jesus to his Apostles.
John 13:34“Maundy Thursday” is then translated as “Commandment Thursday,” a reference to the “new commandment” Jesus proclaimed, focused on loving others as Jesus loves us.

Instead of washing people’s feet, the Queen marks the date by giving out special commemorative coins called Maundy money, a tradition with its origins in medieval times.
Charles and Camilla will take the Queen’s place at today’s Royal Maundy service at St George’s Chapel.
The white purse is filled with uniquely minted Maundy money – silver 10p and 3p pieces – to the value of 96 pence.

     Summary: Passover’s observance in first century Palestine was like President’s Day, Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and Independence Day all rolled up into one.
In some parts of the church, Holy Week’s Maundy Thursday service is one where Jesus’ initiative in washing his disciples’ feet is replicated.
“Maundy” (mandatum in Latin) means mandate, commission, injunction.
In the Jesus story, the memory coheres with the mandate.
