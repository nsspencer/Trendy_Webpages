     Pope Francis Washes Prisoners’ Feet at Mass on Holy Thursday 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pope offered the Mass on April 14 in Civitavecchia, a port city around 50 miles northwest of Rome.
The Holy See Press Office said that the Pope preached in the prison chapel on the day’s Gospel reading (John 13:1-15), which describes how Jesus washed the feet of his disciples.
In 2020, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pope offered the Mass of the Lord’s Supper in a nearly empty St. Peter’s Basilica.
Pope Francis began Thursday by celebrating a chrism Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica attended by around 2,500 people.
The Pope then went to a visiting room where he greeted about 50 people representing the inmates, officers and staff of the prison, the press office said.
