    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 A warm welcome for Ukrainian refugeesMore than 4.6 million Ukrainians have left the country, with many fleeing into neighboring states such as Poland and Romania.
Not all of these governments had laid out the red carpet for refugees in the past, but to accommodate this influx, European leaders installed a new playbook, forging political consensus and streamlining the asylum-seeking process.
Farther away, even Japan has moved to accept dozens of displaced Ukrainians — a remarkable move by a country that historically has been unwelcoming to asylum seekers.
As of early April, Tokyo has welcomed more than 400 people — with some flying on a government-chartered plane from Poland.

     Summary: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak speaks to the press in this file photo from March 29, after the first talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul.
"Consultations on what legal obligations need to be made, how it will be in terms of a multilateral treaty are ongoing now," he said in televised remarks.
Podolyak added: "We have to understand that the Russians categorically do not want to increase the number of countries that can be guarantors of security.
It is important for us to have as many of those countries as possible."
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week described that negotiating process as being at a "dead end," but Podolyak said work has continued.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Russia-Ukraine war is forcing the world to acknowledge critical failings in how our international institutions operate.
Yet, evoking the Geneva or Hague Conventions, as well as the UN charter, requires the UN Security Council to issue a resolution to establish a tribunal.
This will not happen because Russia is on the Security Council and has the power to veto any resolution.
For these reasons, now, the Russian invasion could propel reform of how the veto is exercised in the Security Council.
The reform would be hard, as 2/3 of the UN General Assembly and all the members of the Security Council would have to approve it.

     Summary: The car had been booby-trapped, and his family and local authorities blamed Russian soldiers.
Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesUkraine’s emergency services agency has deployed a small army of about 550 mine specialists to clear the areas recently occupied by Russian forces.
After Russian forces retreated from a nearby village, neighbors found an abandoned vehicle and turned it over to him.
Retreating armies often bury land mines in order to slow the advance of enemy armies.
But experts say Russian forces have a well-earned reputation for booby-trapping areas they have vacated in order to kill and maim returning civilians.
