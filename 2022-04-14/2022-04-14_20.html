     Ed Buck Is Sentenced to 30 Years for Fatally Drugging 2 Men
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ed Buck, a onetime Democratic donor and activist, was sentenced by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Thursday to 30 years in prison for giving two men fatal doses of methamphetamine at his West Hollywood apartment, prosecutors said.
The two men, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, died 18 months apart at what the Justice Department had called “party and play” sessions at Mr. Buck’s apartment.
Prosecutors said he lured men to sex-fueled parties and drugged them from 2011 to 2019.
The judge scheduled a hearing next month to determine how much restitution Mr. Buck would owe.
Mr. Buck had faced between 20 years and life in federal prison, the Justice Department said last year.

“What happened here was reprehensible conduct.”Moore and Dean died of methamphetamine overdoses 18 months apart — Moore in July 2017 and Dean in January 2019.
I was hoping for a longer sentence, but I am relieved that he is going to Federal Prison and justice has been served.
A great amount of gratitude belongs to the activists who fought so hard and are part of “Justice for Gemmel + All of Ed Bucks Victims”.
I hope this is the last we hear of this horrible tragedy while remembering the good names of Mr Moore and Mr Dean.” — Councilmember John D’AmicoWEHOville is awaiting a response from Councilmember Lindsey Horvath.

     Ed Buck Sentenced to 30 Years in Federal Prison for Providing Methamphetamine to Two Victims Who Suffered Fatal Overdoses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once the men were at his apartment, Buck prepared syringes containing methamphetamine, sometimes personally injecting the victims with or without their consent.
Buck also injected victims with more narcotics than they agreed to take, and sometimes he injected victims while they were unconscious.
In September 2018, Buck similarly purchased a plane ticket for another victim to fly from Iowa to Los Angeles.
This sentence will effectively remove a predator and hopefully deliver a degree of justice to the families of the victims.”“As the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, I stand with the victims of crime,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva.
“This has been a long and very thorough investigation which began with our Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau.

     Summary: The wealthy political activist and Democratic donor Ed Buck was sentenced to 30 years in prison on charges that he supplied and personally injected gay men with methamphetamine in exchange for sex, leading to two deaths and multiple other overdoses.
The encounters involved Buck paying men to use drugs, injecting large amounts and performing sex acts on them.
Officials said Buck would inject methamphetamine with or without the men’s consent and sometimes when they were unconscious.
One victim said he was “unable to move” after Buck injected him with a tranquilizer.
Brown, who was homeless, moved into Buck’s apartment, where Buck frequently injected him with meth, often several times a day.
