     Free agent WR Sammy Watkins is meeting with Packers Thursday, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s possible that veteran help might be on the way for the Green Bay Packers at wide receiver after all.
The Packers are reportedly hosting a free agent wide receiver for a visit today, welcoming Sammy Watkins into the facility.
Watkins then spent three years in Kansas City before signing a one-year deal with the Baltimore Ravens last spring.
He was the Rams’ fourth-leading receiver that season behind Cooper Kupp, Todd Gurley, and Robert Woods, each of whom exceeded 750 yards.
Whether Watkins will sign with the Packers remains to be seen, and this visit could simply be the Packers testing the waters to see if there is indeed mutual interest between the two parties.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's no secret the Green Bay Packers need to add multiple wide receivers this offseason, especially after the Davante Adams trade.
