     Lamar Jackson didn't travel with Baltimore to Cincinnati for playoff game, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Ravens starting quarterback Lamar Jackson didn't travel with the team to Cincinnati for Sunday night's playoff showdown between the AFC North rivals, NBC Sports sideline reporter Melissa Stark said during the "Sunday Night Football" broadcast.
Jackson started Baltimore's regular-season win against Cincinnati, and Anthony Brown started the Ravens' Week 18 loss in Cincinnati.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported earlier that both Huntley and Brown were expected to play QB in Sunday night's game.
Last week, ESPN's Scott Van Pelt addressed Jackson's situation with the Ravens.
"If Jackson doesn't play against the Bengals - which seems unlikely - and the Ravens were to lose, then it's time to negotiate," Van Pelt said.

     Lamar Jackson Doesn't Travel for Ravens vs. Bengals While Sitting Out with Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesThe Baltimore Ravens are playing Sunday's AFC Wild Card Game against the Cincinnati Bengals without star quarterback Lamar Jackson as he nurses a knee injury, but he's also noticeably absent from the sidelines.
Jonas Shaffer of the Baltimore Banner relayed an NBC broadcast report that Jackson didn't travel with the Ravens to Cincinnati for the game.
Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season after suffering a knee injury in Week 13.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Saturday that the Ravens "haven't changed their stance" regarding Jackson and plan to resume negotiations with him whenever their season comes to an end.
If Jackson is truly ready to move on from the Ravens, he will be the most coveted player available during the 2023 offseason.

     On Lamar Jackson’s contract, all options are on the table for Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe situation between the Ravens and quarterback Lamar Jackson came to a head this week.
At this point, all options are on the table for the offseason.
The Ravens recently showed that they’re capable of working out a fair deal with an unrepresented player, via the contract done with linebacker Roquan Smith.
The contract signed by quarterback Deshaun Watson with the Browns cemented Jackson’s expectations for a five-year, fully-guaranteed deal of his own.
Which would make it much harder to get a long-term deal done.

     Michael Vick calls out Ravens' Lamar Jackson for missing NFL playoff game with PCL sprain: 'Put a brace on it'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick did not hold back on his feelings about Lamar Jackson sitting out the Ravens' playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Baltimore's quarterback remains out due to a PCL sprain, and Vick has no sympathy for No.
The injury was initially not categorized as season-ending as head coach John Harbaugh listed him then as "week to week."
Former head coach Sean Payton does not agree with Jackson tweeting out his injury status.
With Jackson out, the Ravens will reportedly use both Tyler Huntley and Anthony Brown vs. Cincinnati.

     Lamar Jackson didn't travel to Cincinnati to be with his Ravens teammates amid contract dispute
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson has poured fuel on speculation surrounding his Baltimore Ravens future after it was reported he opted against travelling to Cincinnati with the team for Sunday's playoff defeat against the Bengals.
Star quarterback Jackson is injured and was therefore unable to play in the Wild Card match-up, but it came as a surprise that he didn't travel with the team, as reported by NBC's Melissa Stark before kickoff.
Jackson, 26, is currently at a contract impasse with the Ravens after negotiations were called off at the start of the season so the team could concentrate on the season.
Now, though, if Jackson cannot come to an agreement with the Ravens, he may well have played his last game for the franchise.
As it stands, he is heading into the offseason without a contract, while the Ravens could yet use their franchise tag to keep him on their books.

     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.
