     Robert Griffin III Backs Lamar Jackson, Says Knee Injury Changed Career Trajectory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Griffin shared a message of his own knee injury that he said "changed the trajectory of my career" and supported the Baltimore Ravens quarterbacks' decision:Jackson has not played since the Ravens' Dec. 4 win over the Denver Broncos because of a knee injury.
On Thursday, Jackson tweeted that his knee is still "unstable" because of a PCL Grade 2 sprain that is close to a Grade 3-level injury.
For his part, Griffin was the 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year and a Pro Bowler.
However, he suffered the knee injury in a playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks that season and was never a Pro Bowler again for the rest of his career.
It is apparent he wants Jackson, who was the 2019 NFL MVP, to avoid a similar fate.

     Lamar Jackson raises more questions with travel decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson raises more questions with travel decisionWhether intended or now, Lamar Jackson made one move for Sunday’s playoff game that sparked a lot of questions about his relationship with the Baltimore Ravens.
NBC’s broadcast of Sunday’s AFC wild-card game revealed that Jackson did not travel to Cincinnati with the Ravens for their game against the Bengals.
https://t.co/a7tV5EoaX1 — Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 16, 2023Jackson was already ruled out for the game due to a knee injury that has lingered for several weeks.
Speculation about Jackson and his commitment to the Ravens is particularly relevant with his upcoming free agency.
Reports indicate that the Ravens still see him as their long-term quarterback, but he certainly seems to be rubbing some the wrong way.

     Lamar Jackson didn't travel with Baltimore to Cincinnati for playoff game, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Ravens starting quarterback Lamar Jackson didn't travel with the team to Cincinnati for Sunday night's playoff showdown between the AFC North rivals, NBC Sports sideline reporter Melissa Stark said during the "Sunday Night Football" broadcast.
Jackson started Baltimore's regular-season win against Cincinnati, and Anthony Brown started the Ravens' Week 18 loss in Cincinnati.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported earlier that both Huntley and Brown were expected to play QB in Sunday night's game.
Last week, ESPN's Scott Van Pelt addressed Jackson's situation with the Ravens.
"If Jackson doesn't play against the Bengals - which seems unlikely - and the Ravens were to lose, then it's time to negotiate," Van Pelt said.

     On Lamar Jackson’s contract, all options are on the table for Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe situation between the Ravens and quarterback Lamar Jackson came to a head this week.
At this point, all options are on the table for the offseason.
The Ravens recently showed that they’re capable of working out a fair deal with an unrepresented player, via the contract done with linebacker Roquan Smith.
The contract signed by quarterback Deshaun Watson with the Browns cemented Jackson’s expectations for a five-year, fully-guaranteed deal of his own.
Which would make it much harder to get a long-term deal done.

     Michael Vick calls out Ravens' Lamar Jackson for missing NFL playoff game with PCL sprain: 'Put a brace on it'

     Summary: Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick did not hold back on his feelings about Lamar Jackson sitting out the Ravens' playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Baltimore's quarterback remains out due to a PCL sprain, and Vick has no sympathy for No.
The injury was initially not categorized as season-ending as head coach John Harbaugh listed him then as "week to week."
Former head coach Sean Payton does not agree with Jackson tweeting out his injury status.
With Jackson out, the Ravens will reportedly use both Tyler Huntley and Anthony Brown vs. Cincinnati.

     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.
