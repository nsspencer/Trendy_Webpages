     Kirk Cousins Disappoints Vikings Fans Yet Again After Crushing Playoff Loss to Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesMinnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins put up some solid stats in Sunday's NFC Wild Card Game against the New York Giants, but his final pass of the day will haunt him for quite some time.
With the Vikings' season on the line late in the fourth quarter, Cousins threw a checkdown pass on fourth down.
Cousins threw for 273 yards and two touchdowns on 31-of-39 passing, and he ran for another score.
He kept his team afloat while the Vikings defense had a lackluster showing against a scrappy Giants offense.
However, his decision to throw a short pass on a potential game-tying drive destroyed Minnesota's chances of continuing its postseason run.

     Summary: The defense faltered on the big stage, and so did Cousins with the game on the line.
What was Kirk Cousins thinking when he chose to throw short of the sticks on 4th-and-8 with the game on the line?
Why have any player run a route short of the line to gain with the season on the line?
I can't go down with a sack so I kick it out to T.J.," Cousins said.
Cousins finished the game 31-of-39 for 273 yards and two touchdown.

     Vikings HC Kevin O'Connell, QB Kirk Cousins explain fourth-and-8 throw short of sticks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Why was Hockenson running such a short route in that situation and why was he Cousins' read?
I just felt like throwing short of the sticks isn't the end of the world, and it was obviously tight coverage.
O'Connell said that the pocket "may or may have not been collapsed" and that Cousins wanted to give someone a chance to make a play.
…"(Cousins) knew it was fourth down, and he wanted to make sure he put the ball in play.
"The intent as a play-caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where it's short of the sticks to gain," O'Connell said.

     Anatomy of a Play: Kirk Cousins' game-ending fourth-down throw wasn't his fault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The funniest part about this is if Cousins threw a lower ball leading Hockenson, he had a chance to break the tackle.
It didn’t help that Hockenson’s route was the only one that wasn’t long-developing.
In this case, Cousins didn’t for long.
“I can’t be too high on it, but I made the play, and we got off the field and won the game.
That was the play to win it.”It was, but what it wasn’t was Kirk Cousins’ fault.

     What Went Wrong for Kirk Cousins, Vikings on the Decisive Fourth Down Play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's the one that's going to stick with people.
Still, one imagines the Vikings wish they found more ways to get Jefferson going in Sunday's game.
Even if Cousins didn't want to target a double-covered Jefferson there, how about giving Osborn another chance against single coverage over the middle?
"There was always belief (that we'd win the game)," Cousins said.
Throughout a 13-win regular season, Cousins came up clutch for the Vikings in the big moments time and time again.
