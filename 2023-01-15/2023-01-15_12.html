     NFL Playoffs: 5 bold predictions for Cowboys vs Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cowboys need to figure out the puzzle of Tom Brady to win this weekend.
Tom Brady has been a thorn in the Cowboys‘ side during his NFL career.
Here are five bold predictions on how the Cowboys will play against the Buccaneers.
Diggs is going to win at least one battle to give his team a big boost in the turnover department.
The downside for Dallas is that he’s likely to give up more than one big play to Brady and Tampa Bay’s prolific aerial attack.

     Cowboys vs Buccaneers Playoff Preview: Ground and Pound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a hard fought regular season the Dallas Cowboys find themselves in the playoffs yet again for the second year in a row.
Adding Biadasz back in at center will be crucial to getting the ground game established against the Bucs.
On the flip side Vander Esch and Hankins will be doing the opposite by returning to keep the Tampa ground game in check.
As for Tampa, stopping the ground attack for the Cowboys won’t be a walk in the park either.
It’s time for the Dallas Cowboys to show everyone that this year is actually different.

The issue facing the Brady bunch is that the Cowboys rank 4th in points per game.
