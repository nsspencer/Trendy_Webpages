     Joe Burrow QB sneaks a touchdown, Bengals lead Ravens 17-10
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And he nearly had a touchdown pass to tight end Hayden Hurst with a deep pass over the middle, but Hurst was tackled just short of the goal line.
But that was no matter, as Burrow took a QB sneak in for the touchdown on the next play.
The Bengals won’t have left tackle Jonah Williams for at least the rest of Sunday’s game as he’s been ruled out with a left knee injury.
That means Cincinnati is now down its starting left tackle, right guard, and right tackle along the offensive line.
Right tackle La’el Collins tore his ACL in the Week 16 win over the Patriots.

     Joe Burrow on playing for Bengals: 'My plan is to be here my whole career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow has developed into one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL since he was taken first overall in the 2020 draft.
Ahead of another playoff game, Burrow made clear how he wants to spend the rest of his NFL career – in the orange and black.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM"My plan is to be here my whole career, and hopefully Zac [Taylor] is here my whole career," Burrow told NBC Sports in an interview with Maria Taylor that aired Saturday.
Burrow was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time and led Cincinnati to a second straight AFC North title.
Burrow is likely to command a pretty penny when he hits the negotiating table with the Bengals' front office.

     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow has officially arrived at Paycor Stadium for his team’s wild card playoffs showdown with the Baltimore Ravens.
As always, Burrow’s attire caught the attention of onlookers in the now-viral post.
This time he sported a bucket hat as one of the main features of his pre-game fit.
Burrow was then seen on the field warming up a little under three hours before kickoff via footage from WCPO’s Marshall Kramsky.

     Pregame Notebook: T.J. And Chad Loving Bengals Vibe; T.J. Talks Joe Burrow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SMOKEY JOE: A week after quarterback Joe Burrow puffed the AFC North victory cigar, Bengals fans were lighting up with news of his NBC interview before the network televised the game.
The Bengals are going to be paying more than Burrow after back-to-back AFC titles and he's confident they'll keep the good times rolling.
All of which doesn't surprise Houshmandzadeh, who has known Burrow since he caught balls from him before the 2020 draft.
Burrow's quarterbacks tutor, Jordan Palmer, is a former Bengals teammate of Houshmandzadeh and Houshmandzadeh didn't get a chance to deliver a message to Burrow.
He saw Burrow briefly Friday, but, like Burrow, didn't say much and he didn't offer to take him to lunch.
