     Dolphins: Tua Tagovailoa major update for playoffs, 2023 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins will be facing an uphill battle on Sunday without quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.
While the short-term future for Tua remains a mystery given his injuries, his long-term prospects appear to be solid as ever in Miami.
Tagovailoa is expected to remain the starting quarterback for the Dolphins next season, according to the latest report from ESPN insider Adam Schefter.
The 2023 season may be secure for Tua Tagovailoa, but that doesn’t mean he won’t try to work his way back from injury to make an impact this season should the Dolphins manage to upset the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.
As long as he makes the full recovery like everyone hopes he could, Tagovailoa will have all the support he needs.

     Report: Tua Tagovailoa “expected” back as Dolphins starter in 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesPublicly, the Dolphins will say nothing about when or if quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will be cleared to return after at least two and possibly three concussions in 2022.
Adam Schefter of ESPN.com, citing unnamed sources, reports that Tagovailoa is “expected” to be the team’s starting quarterback in 2023.
And, at the risk of being even more painfully obvious than usual, until he’s cleared, he’s not.
If he’s the starter in 2023, Tua will need to be aggressively coached on better protecting himself.
And as to the possibility of Tua playing next week, the Dolphins will have a different question to answer.

Tagovailoa, who was placed in the league's protocol on Dec. 26, missed the Dolphins' final two regular-season games after suffering his second concussion of the 2022 season.
Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel unlocked Tagovailoa's potential in his first season in Miami.
In games Tagovailoa has started and finished this year, the Dolphins own an 8-4 record while averaging 26.4 points per game and have a 25:8 TD-INT ratio.
Without Tagovailoa starting or finishing games, the Dolphins are 1-4 with a 16.0 PPG average and have a 5:7 TD-INT ratio.

     Report: Tua Tagovailoa expected to return to Dolphins next season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tua Tagovailoa is expected to return as the Miami Dolphins' starting quarterback for the 2023 season, ESPN reported early Sunday morning.
Per the network, the Dolphins have been pleased with Tagovailoa's development this season under first-year coach Mike McDaniel.
Tagovailoa is in the protocol for the third time this season after self-reporting symptoms following a Week 16 loss to the Green Bay Packers.
Tagovailoa, 24, had a strong start to the season, with the Dolphins going 8-0 in the first eight games he started and finished.
This season, he threw for 3,548 yards and 25 touchdowns, both career highs in his third NFL season, along with eight interceptions.

     Despite concussions, Tua Tagovailoa expected to return as Dolphins’ 2023 starter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a three-point loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday that ended the Dolphins’ season, the absence of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa maybe stuck out the most in an afternoon of missed opportunities.
And while Tagovailoa’s latest concussion has prompted questions about his future in Miami and beyond, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel confirmed an ESPN report that Tagovailoa is expected to return as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback for the 2023 season.
However, he sustained two concussions this season that forced him to sit out five games, including the Dolphins’ season-ending loss.
When Tagovailoa started this season, the Dolphins averaged 25 points and were among the most explosive and efficient offenses in the league.
If the Dolphins don’t pick up the option, Tagovailoa would be set to become an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the 2023 season.
