The aircraft, operated by Nepal’s Yeti Airlines, was holding 68 passengers and four crew members, officials said.
“Pained by the tragic air crash in Nepal in which precious lives have been lost, including Indian nationals,” tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.
Yeti Airlines said they would be canceling all flights on Monday to mourn the victims of the crash.
Since 2000, nearly 350 people have died in a plane or helicopter crash in Nepal, according to Reuters.

     At least 68 dead in Nepal plane crash, many burned beyond recognition; search for the missing underway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixty-eight deaths were confirmed and four people were missing after a plane crashed Sunday in a Nepal ravine, the wreckage burning so hot that rescue workers were unable to aid at least one screaming victim.
Yeti Airlines Flight NYT691 crashed near the resort town of Pokhara at about 10:50 a.m. local time, the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority said.
Prem Nath Thakur, general manager of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the plane had been granted landing clearance.
The Russian Ambassador to Nepal, Alexei Novikov, confirmed the death of four Russian citizens who were on the plane.
In July 2014, a TransAsia ATR 72-500 flight crashed while trying to land on the scenic Penghu archipelago between Taiwan and China, killing 48 people onboard.

     At least 68 killed in Nepal's worst air crash in three decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KATHMANDU, Jan 15 (Reuters) - At least 68 people were killed on Sunday when a domestic flight of Yeti Airlines crashed in Pokhara in Nepal, the worst air crash in three decades in the small Himalayan nation.
The weather had been clear and there was no immediate indication of what caused the crash.
It was Nepal's deadliest air crash since 1992, the Aviation Safety Network database showed, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A300 crashed into a hillside upon approach to Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board.
Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said on Twitter the Yeti Airlines aircraft was 15 years old and equipped with an old transponder with unreliable data.
Yeti Airlines has a fleet of six ATR72-500 planes, according to its website.

     Summary: It was also the third-worst aviation accident in Nepal’s history, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network.
The Yeti Airlines flight Sunday had nearly finished its short journey from the capital Kathmandu to Pokhara when it lost contact with a control tower.
Some 15 foreign nationals were aboard, according to the country’s civil aviation authority.
In 2015, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, prioritized helping Nepal through its Aviation Safety Implementation Assistance Partnership.
And in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the aircraft that was lost Sunday.
