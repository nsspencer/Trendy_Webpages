     PSG undoing positive start to season as Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe kept quiet in loss at Rennes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain's difficult return to club soccer since the FIFA 2022 World Cup continues after a 1-0 loss away at Stade Rennais in Ligue 1 on Sunday.
Had Gianluigi Donnarumma not made several impressive and important saves, PSG would have been buried by two or three goals instead of just one.
The capital outfit's attack featured world champion Lionel Messi and Brazilian superstar Neymar from the off and had French golden boy Kylian Mbappe added to it before the hour mark.
These points will count at the end of the season -- especially away from home."
With four games against beatable opponents before UCL return, Galtier and his men cannot afford to let this malaise deepen further.

     PSG suffer another defeat as Ligue 1 lead cut to three points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Paris St Germain suffered their second defeat of the season in a 1-0 loss to Stade Rennais on Sunday as their Ligue 1 lead was slashed to three points.
Despite the win, Rennes slipped down to fifth on 37 points, behind Monaco on goal difference after the principality side destroyed AC Ajaccio 7-1 earlier on Sunday with a Wissam Ben Yedder hat-trick.
If we find it again it will be fine," said PSG captain Marquinhos.
Midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery, 16, became the youngest player to start a Ligue 1 game for PSG and was nowhere near the Italian's level.
A homophobic banner was also displayed in the stands, which will likely trigger sanctions from the French league (LFP).

Rennes fans held up a banner with “Martin, all the Rennes fans are with you,” and chanted his name.

     Summary: This was the first time that Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar had appeared on the pitch together since PSG's superstar attacking trio returned from the World Cup.
Without their leading scorer PSG were blunt up front and Rennes goalkeeper Steve Mandanda did not have a save of note to make until he kept out a Danilo Pereira header three minutes into the second half.
Mbappe replaced Ekitike in the 56th minute and did so to applause from the home fans.
Rennes, who recently lost top scorer Martin Terrier for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury, have now won nine successive home league games.
Marseille are third, two points behind Lens and five clear of both Monaco and Rennes, after defeating Lorient 3-1 on Saturday.

     Rennes 1-0 Paris Saint-Germain: Traore stuns PSG as Mbappe misses out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe fluffed a golden chance on his 200th Ligue 1 appearance as leaders Paris Saint-Germain stumbled to a 1-0 defeat against bogey team Rennes.
Substitute Mbappe squandered a clear opportunity for a leveller after being played in behind the Rennes defence soon afterwards, sweeping a powerful shot over the bar when he only had Steve Mandanda to beat.
PSG pushed for a leveller, but Rennes had their number once again at Roazhon Park, which has been the way of things in recent seasons.
Neymar was similarly subdued, but PSG had a weapon up their sleeve with Mbappe among their substitutes.
However, the opening goal went to Rennes, with captain Traore lashing a stabbed cutback from Adrien Truffert low and past the reaches of Donnarumma from 12 yards.
