     ‘No survivors’ in Nepal plane crash, official says

     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareKATHMANDU, Nepal — There are “no survivors” from the Yeti Airlines plane that crashed near Nepal’s new Pokhara Airport on Sunday, authorities said.
Rescuers reached the crash site at the gorge early Monday after halting the rescue mission that evening when night fell.
Other videos posted online showed the plane on fire, with large plumes of smoke emerging from the crash site as dozens of people crowded around it.
In May of last year, 22 people were killed in a crash on a flight involving another twin-propeller plane operated by Tara Air, a subsidiary of Yeti Airlines.
The plane departed from Pokhara’s old airport and was headed for Jomson, a tourist town about 20 minutes away.

     Summary: Sixty-eight deaths were confirmed and four people were missing after a plane crashed Sunday in a Nepal ravine, the wreckage burning so hot that rescue workers were unable to aid at least one screaming victim.
Yeti Airlines Flight NYT691 crashed near the resort town of Pokhara at about 10:50 a.m. local time, the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority said.
Prem Nath Thakur, general manager of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the plane had been granted landing clearance.
The Russian Ambassador to Nepal, Alexei Novikov, confirmed the death of four Russian citizens who were on the plane.

     Search resumes for missing people as Yeti Airlines disaster highlights dangers of flying in Nepal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of the 72 people on board, at least 68 were killed when a Yeti Airlines flight crashed near the city of Pokhara Sunday.
It is also the third-worst aviation accident in Nepal’s history, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network.
The Yeti Airlines flight Sunday had nearly finished its short journey from the capital Kathmandu to Pokhara when it lost contact with a control tower.
In 2015, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, prioritized helping Nepal through its Aviation Safety Implementation Assistance Partnership.
And in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the aircraft that was lost Sunday.
