     Lamar Jackson Doesn't Travel for Ravens vs. Bengals While Sitting Out with Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesThe Baltimore Ravens are playing Sunday's AFC Wild Card Game against the Cincinnati Bengals without star quarterback Lamar Jackson as he nurses a knee injury, but he's also noticeably absent from the sidelines.
Jonas Shaffer of the Baltimore Banner relayed an NBC broadcast report that Jackson didn't travel with the Ravens to Cincinnati for the game.
Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season after suffering a knee injury in Week 13.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Saturday that the Ravens "haven't changed their stance" regarding Jackson and plan to resume negotiations with him whenever their season comes to an end.
If Jackson is truly ready to move on from the Ravens, he will be the most coveted player available during the 2023 offseason.

     Mike Vick Gives Questionable Advice To Injured Lamar Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Vick believes Lamar Jackson should be on the field Sunday night at Paycor Stadium.
Jackson hasn’t practiced, let alone played in a game, since he injured his knee in the Ravens’ Dec. 4 win over the Denver Broncos.
That trend will continue in the wild-card round, as the star quarterback will watch from the sideline as Tyler Huntley and/or Anthony Brown quarterback Baltimore against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Vick, however, believes Jackson should play through the pain now that the stakes are raised.
Further damaging his injured knee could be career- and, quite frankly, life-altering for Jackson, who is set to hit free agency in March.

     Sean Payton ‘doesn’t like’ Lamar Jackson injury update and makes HUGE prediction for his Ravens future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUPER Bowl-winning head coach Sean Payton isn't a fan of how Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is handling his injury.
Jackson, 26, hasn't played since their Week 13 win over the Denver Broncos, after suffering a sprained PCL.
Payton wasn't quite on the same wavelength with this mindset, saying "I understand if he's not ready, but with a lower-body injury he's going to be up in the press box, he's not going to be o the field for me."
An early season MVP favorite, Jackson was key to Baltimore's successes yet again this season.

     Lamar Jackson doesn't travel with Ravens to playoff game vs. Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.
