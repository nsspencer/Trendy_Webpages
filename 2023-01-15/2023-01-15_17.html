     Aaron Donald’s Twitter bio briefly reads ‘former’ member of Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams may not be defending their Super Bowl title in the playoffs, but Aaron Donald became a talking point.
As the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills squared off during wild card weekend on Sunday, social media users caught Donald’s Twitter biography being changed.
However, Erica Donald, Aaron’s wife, may have put the rumors of a possible retirement or trade request to rest with a tweet shortly after.
The Rams finished the campaign with a dismal 5-12 record, a year in which the roster was mired with injuries and poor form.
Head coach Sean McVay briefly considered stepping away, but later confirmed he’d return to the sidelines next season.

     Is Aaron Donald retiring? Rams star causes confusion after briefly changing Twitter bio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald confused NFL fans on Sunday with an edit to his Twitter bio, which briefly described him as a "former" lineman for the Rams.
The edit suggested Donald, a future Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the most dominant defensive players in the league's history, had hung up the cleats for good.
He later reworked his contract, netting him a $40 million raise through the 2024 season with the Rams.
He was the 2014 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, a seven-time first-team All-Pro selection and three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, 2018 and 2020.
His Twitter bio, for now, has only been a source of confusion in regard to that question.

     Rams’ Aaron Donald Stuns NFL World With Apparent Reference to Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald shocked the NFL world for a few minutes on Sunday with an apparent mixup in his Twitter bio.
Fans noticed that the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year’s Twitter bio briefly said “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99” on Sunday.
This all comes on the heels of Donald contemplating retirement after the 2021 season.
France then pivoted to working toward a pay raise for the defensive tackle.
Donald missed the last six games of the 2022 season after suffering a high ankle sprain in Week 12.

     Aaron Donald changes Twitter bio to “former NFL D lineman for the Rams,” then changes it back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald has changed his Twitter bio to say “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99.” And then, just as people were noticing it, he changed it back.
Donald was serious about retiring without that contract; he supposedly submitted a retirement letter to the Rams days before inking his new deal.
Regardless, only two days after the sudden Sean McVay resignation drama ended, there’s a second annual Aaron Donald retirement drama.
And maybe that’s the play for Donald.
He said he’s a “former NFL D Lineman for the Rams.” Maybe, this year, he wants to be traded to a team that is in better position to contend in 2023.

     Has Rams DL Aaron Donald Quietly Retired From NFL?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What in the world is going on with Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald?
Did Aaron Donald just quietly retire from the NFL and the Los Angeles Rams?
Last season, Donald recorded 49 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, 11 quarterback hits, and five sacks, nearly half of his production of 2021, when he had 84 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 19 tackles for loss and 26 quarterback hits.
But make no mistake, losing arguably the NFL's best defensive player in Donald would undoubtedly make that re-tooling project a much, much heftier task.

     Los Angeles Rams Defensive Lineman Aaron Donald Reportedly Teases Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams‘ star defensive lineman, Aaron Donald might have just let it slip that he is entertaining the idea of retirement.
Adam Schefter caught the change on Twitter, posting to his own account the before and after bio update.
Donald has never been one to shy away from the conversation around retirement.
After the Los Angeles Rams won the Super Bowl last year, Donald, who is a three-time Defensive Player of the Year, admitted that he is highly considering retiring.
HotNewHipHop recounters his past statement where Donald said, “I’ll be fine regardless, but me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl.

     Summary: For a few minutes on Sunday, it looked like Aaron Donald might have quietly announced his retirement.
Out of nowhere, he changed his Twitter bio to read “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99,” which caused fans to panic that he was no longer a member of the Rams.
After Twitter was buzzing with speculation about his future, Donald quickly changed his bio back to remove the word “former.”Was he hacked?
