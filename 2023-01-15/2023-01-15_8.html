     Joe Burrow QB sneaks a touchdown, Bengals lead Ravens 17-10
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And he nearly had a touchdown pass to tight end Hayden Hurst with a deep pass over the middle, but Hurst was tackled just short of the goal line.
But that was no matter, as Burrow took a QB sneak in for the touchdown on the next play.
The Bengals won’t have left tackle Jonah Williams for at least the rest of Sunday’s game as he’s been ruled out with a left knee injury.
That means Cincinnati is now down its starting left tackle, right guard, and right tackle along the offensive line.
Right tackle La’el Collins tore his ACL in the Week 16 win over the Patriots.

Taylor sat down with Burrow ahead of Sunday night’s Wild Card playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens.
“My plan is to be here my whole career, and hopefully Zac is here my whole career, and hopefully a lot of our guys are around for as long (in) my career as they can be,” Burrow said in the interview, which was posted to YouTube on Saturday.
“I have a lot of confidence in the front office doing their jobs in the offseason.
We’ve drafted well, we brought in great free agents, we claimed guys off waivers that have really made an impact on our team.

     Joe Burrow on playing for Bengals: 'My plan is to be here my whole career'
    </h2>

     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow has developed into one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL since he was taken first overall in the 2020 draft.
Ahead of another playoff game, Burrow made clear how he wants to spend the rest of his NFL career – in the orange and black.

Burrow was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time and led Cincinnati to a second straight AFC North title.
Burrow is likely to command a pretty penny when he hits the negotiating table with the Bengals' front office.

     Pregame Notebook: T.J. And Chad Loving Bengals Vibe; T.J. Talks Joe Burrow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SMOKEY JOE: A week after quarterback Joe Burrow puffed the AFC North victory cigar, Bengals fans were lighting up with news of his NBC interview before the network televised the game.
The Bengals are going to be paying more than Burrow after back-to-back AFC titles and he's confident they'll keep the good times rolling.
All of which doesn't surprise Houshmandzadeh, who has known Burrow since he caught balls from him before the 2020 draft.
Burrow's quarterbacks tutor, Jordan Palmer, is a former Bengals teammate of Houshmandzadeh and Houshmandzadeh didn't get a chance to deliver a message to Burrow.
He saw Burrow briefly Friday, but, like Burrow, didn't say much and he didn't offer to take him to lunch.
