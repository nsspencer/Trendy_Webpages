     Nick Kyrgios pulls out of Australian Open with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brad Gilbert and Caroline Wozniacki react to Nick Kyrgios pulling out of the Australian Open with a knee injury.
(1:30)MELBOURNE, Australia -- Nick Kyrgios was forced to withdraw from the Australian Open on Monday -- just 24 hours ahead of his scheduled first-round match against Roman Safiullin -- because of an injury to his left knee that will require arthroscopic surgery.
Kyrgios, 27, had faced nine-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in a charity match Friday evening at Melbourne Park.
His physiotherapist, Will Maher, said Kyrgios "didn't pull up great" from the exhibition and was in no state to take part in a Grand Slam event.
Kyrgios was coming off a career-best year in which he won the Australian Open doubles title alongside compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis before reaching the Wimbledon final, which Kyrgios ultimately lost to Djokovic.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Home favorite Nick Kyrgios has pulled out of the Australian Open due to a knee injury, the tournament announced on Monday.
During Monday’s press conference, Kyrgios’ physiotherapist Will Maher said the injury is not career-ending.
“It won’t interrupt his year tremendously, despite the fact it’s a great disappointment to withdraw from the Australian Open home slam,” Maher said.
Kyrgios, who is ranked 21st in the world, was the runner-up at Wimbledon in the men’s singles last year and won the men’s doubles title at the 2022 Australian Open with partner Thanasi Kokkinakis.
An injury also forced Kyrgios to withdraw at the last minute from the inaugural United Cup in December.

     Australian Open: Fears for Novak Djokovic as practice session is CANCELLED
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Novak Djokovic has cancelled his Australian Open practice session on Monday - sparking fears he could become the latest star to withdraw from the tournament.
The news comes after a 'devastated' Nick Kyrgios pulled out of his home tournament on Monday because of a knee injury.
High-profile star Kyrgios won the doubles title with compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis at last year's Australian Open and reached the final of the singles at Wimbledon.
I mean, you normally, as a professional tennis player on the highest level, don't have much time to really have a longer training block,' Djokovic told reporters on Saturday.
However, he was warmly received by a packed crowd at Rod Laver Arena on Friday night during a practice match against home hero Nick Kyrgios.
