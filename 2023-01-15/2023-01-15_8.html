    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant threw down the best dunk of the NBA season on Saturday night against the Indiana Pacers.
He cut through the Pacers defense, drove to the rim, lept toward Indiana center Jalen Smith, and threw down a monster jam.
That was one of them," Pacers point guard T.J. McConnell said of the play after the game.
Morant said it was his top dunk ever after the game due to its difficulty.

     Ja Morant doesn't need the Slam Dunk Contest if he keeps throwing down in-game jams like this
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Ja Morant threw down another of his show-stopping slams on Saturday night against the Indiana Pacers, there was one immediate and wide-ranging response: can the Memphis Grizzlies star please sign up for the Slam Dunk Contest?
If he reconsiders his stance at any point, no one will complain, but as long as he keeps throwing down in-game jams like the one against the Pacers on Saturday night, he doesn't need to do the Slam Dunk Contest.
What could he do at All-Star Weekend that would mean as much or inspire such surprise and pure joy?
The Slam Dunk Contest is an awesome spectacle of athleticism and creativity, but it can't match the emotional high of an outrageous in-game dunk, certainly not at this stage of its history.
Morant, it seems, would rather save his moments of magic for games, and more power to him.

     Ja Morant’s Vicious Dunk vs. Pacers Might Be Best of NBA Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja Morant Says Vicious Dunk vs. Pacers Is Best of His CareerGrizzlies star Ja Morant never fails to amaze with his high-flying play and jaw-dropping dunks.
But on Saturday night, the 23-year-old uncorked a slam that even he said was the best of his career.
With just over four minutes left in the third quarter of a road game against the Pacers, Morant easily carved his way past a pair of defenders, clearing himself a runway to the rim.
Morant and Smith both jumped, with the former cradling the ball with his right hand before unleashing a vicious, one-handed dunk over the Pacers center.
The thunderous dunk extended the Grizzles’ lead to 20 points and was the exclamation point of Morant’s 23-point, 10-assist performance in the 130–112 win.

     Summary: MIAMI — The home of the Miami Heat has yet another name: Miami-Dade Arena.
The Heat and Miami-Dade County announced the new name Friday, two days after a bankruptcy court terminated the county’s naming rights deal with collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
“Effective immediately, Miami-Dade County and the Miami Heat have agreed that, until such time as there is a new naming rights partner, to refer to the arena as Miami-Dade Arena,” the parties said in a joint statement.
The county owns the arena and negotiated what was to be a 19-year, $135 million naming rights deal with FTX.
Before the FTX deal, the building had been referred to as AmericanAirlines Arena since its opening in 1999.
