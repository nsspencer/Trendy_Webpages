     Summary: View Schedule | View Singles DrawDefending champion and top seed Nadal arrives at Melbourne Park in a relative slump by his own lofty standards.
The Spaniard has lost six of his past seven matches and faces a difficult proposition first up in Melbourne in fast-rising Briton Jack Draper.
“[It is] probably one of the toughest first rounds possible, being seeded,” acknowledged Nadal when asked about the Draper clash.
Although they have never faced off in a tour-level match, Halys defeated the Greek in an ITF Futures match in 2014 and an ATP Challenger Tour match in 2018.
He takes on Alex Molcan in his first Australian Open match since 2021 after missing last year due to injury.

     Summary: Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff breezed through their Australian Open first-round matches, beginning what each hopes is a run to end the longest Grand Slam singles title drought for the U.S. in more than 50 years.

She began the Australian Open as one of the top challengers to top-ranked Iga Świątek, having beaten the dominant Pole 6-2, 6-2 earlier this month.
Gauff, who at 18 is the youngest player in the WTA top 50, won her Australian Open lead-in tournament last week without dropping a set.

     Summary: On the eve of the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of 2023, tennis finds itself at a crossroads.
And while it’s all going down, Netflix’s cameras will be eagerly capturing everything: The first five episodes of the streaming giant’s new series, “Break Point” — which documents professional tennis’ 2022 season — went live on Friday.
“Tennis players are emotionally reflecting on every point of every game at every time, and that’s what makes them fascinating,” Box to Box co-founder Paul Martin says.
“Tennis is a process of mental torture in some ways.”“A good story is ultimately a good story,” says “Break Point” showrunner Kari Lia.
“Sponsors and money, it’s important because it brings this financial security,” Sharapova says on “Break Point.” “You get a sponsorship and you think it’s forever, but guess what?

Swiatek's first Australian Open title seems more than in reach.
Fernandez: Djokovic is the favorite and one to beat, His nine Australian Open titles give him a tremendous amount of confidence.
Djokovic will likely advance and go on to win a 10th Australian Open title.
