     Martin Luther King Jr. statue in Boston draws online mockery, disdain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sculpture commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King was unveiled in Boston on Jan. 13.
On Friday, a collection of civic organizations unveiled a 22-foot-tall bronze statue in Boston Common, the nation’s oldest public park, honoring the relationship between the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King.
“Given that I am not White, I am safe from ANY charges of racism for saying the MLK embrace statue is aesthetically unpleasant.
“That MLK statue looks obscene from certain angles, but when you see the whole thing you realize it’s supposed to depict the result of Martin Luther King Jr. and [Coretta] Scott King having gone through the teleporter in The Fly together,” tweeted the Daily Wire’s Frank J. Fleming.
