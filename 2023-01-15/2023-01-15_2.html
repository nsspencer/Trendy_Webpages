     The Last of Us premieres today on HBO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here’s a sentence that I never thought I’d type: The Last of Us airs its first episode tonight on HBO and HBO Max.
I’m incredibly grateful to the team at Naughty Dog, HBO, Sony Pictures Entertainment, PlayStation Productions, and of course the cast and crew members that helped get us to this historic moment.
From myself and everybody at Naughty Dog, thank you!
The HBO show follows the broad beats of the overall story from the game, and is quite faithful in tone and spirit.
But rest assured, The Last of Us stays true to the soul of the games.

     Every The Last of Us Easter egg in the HBO show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO’s The Last of Us is a way to revisit the iconic and beloved video game of the same name — to revel in the ways it’s both unchanged and entirely different.
Video games are known for their Easter eggs, the small and obscure references hidden as little surprises in the game.
In the video game, you control Sarah, and she’s looking through her house in the dark.
There’s one page marked off with a piece of paper — the radio code for Joel and Tess’ smuggling operation.
No one knows yet of Ellie’s true condition — that she’s immune — and she’s sworn to keep it a secret.

     The Last of Us review: HBO breaks an age-old Hollywood curse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those who are familiar with the property, though, watching the HBO series’ 9-episode first season may be an unexpectedly odd experience.
On the one hand, it’s undeniably refreshing to see a video game adaptation that is genuinely confident in the strength of its source material.
The new HBO series is primarily set in a post-apocalyptic world that has become overrun with fungi-covered, zombie-like humans.
The new HBO series even features appearances from a handful of the voice actors who helped bring The Last of Us to life for the first time, including both Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker.
However, those flaws don’t prevent The Last of Us from ranking solidly as the best and most emotionally rich video game adaptation that Hollywood has ever produced.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Premiere Recap: Welcome to the Apocalypse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All of the season’s episodes are covering familiar ground in some way or other, but the premiere is perhaps crossing the most familiar of that ground.
Which isn’t to say that material is bad; just more generic than what’s to come, especially in later episodes.
But the most compelling parts of the episode come before and after the nightmare that blankets the world over a late September weekend of 2003.
In those scenes, Sarah comes across as a typical teenager — at times lost in her own head, at others outgoing and friendly and generous to others, including her dad and their neighbors.
