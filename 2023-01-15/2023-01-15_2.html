     Summary: Physicality is the name of the Ravens-Bengals Wild Card game by Jake LippmanDo the Baltimore Ravens have a fighting chance against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday night?
Recent reports reveal that the Ravens could play both their quarterbacks in the Wild Card game, perhaps trying to catch Lou Anarumo and the Bengals’ defense off guard.
We spoke to Stripe Hype’s Leigh Oleszczak about her thoughts on the upcoming Wild Card game, and she mentioned the Bengals’ rushing attack as one of the team’s glaring weaknesses.
Joe Mixon is still really good as a pass-catcher, but the run game has not been able to get going.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Playing both Huntley and Brown would allow Baltimore to take advantage of Huntley's running ability, while also using the strong-armed Brown to challenge Cincinnati's secondary.
Huntley was a full participant in Friday's practice and started throwing in practice on Thursday.
However, Huntley has battled tendonitis in his throwing shoulder all season, although he said Friday that he felt close to 100 percent.
For the Bengals, starting right guard Alex Cappa (ankle) was ruled out on Friday, and the Bengals had already lost starting right tackle La'el Collins (knee) for the year.
The Bengals are expected to start Max Scharping at right guard and have replaced Colins with Hakeem Adeniji.

     Bengals' defensive TD fuels wild-card win over Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:51)CINCINNATI -- Without Lamar Jackson, the Baltimore Ravens weren't expected to give the Cincinnati Bengals much of a struggle Sunday night in their wild-card matchup.
A 98-yard touchdown return of Tyler Huntley's fumble at the goal line in the fourth quarter proved decisive.
The two AFC North teams met for the second straight week after the Bengals beat a short-handed Ravens team and celebrated back-to-back division titles.
It squirted free and defensive end Sam Hubbard scooped it up for a 98-yard return touchdown, which is the longest in NFL history.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: Ravens are 6-1 all-time on the road in the wild-card round.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Baltimore Ravens, 24-17, to advance to the AFC Divisional Round for the second consecutive year.
Sunday night's AFC North matchup lived up to its billing and was close throughout, with the Bengals trailing, 10-9, at halftime and entering the fourth quarter tied at 17.
But Joe Burrow and Co. persevered during the final frame, in large part due to defensive end Sam Hubbard's 98-yard fumble-recovery touchdown, to keep the dream of a second straight Super Bowl berth alive.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.

A final pass by Huntley to the end zone barely fell incomplete as time expired and the Bengals survived.
