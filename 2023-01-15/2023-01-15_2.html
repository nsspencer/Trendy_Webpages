     Bills vs. Dolphins: Crucial Drops - But Big TD Catches from Cole Beasley, Gabe Davis Entering 4th Quarter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins both had their fair share of dropped passes in the first half of Sunday's AFC Wild Card, but Buffalo is getting big plays late.
Call it playoff jitters, the sunlight or just cold hands, but the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins both had their fair share of drops in the first half of Sunday's AFC Wild Card matchup at Highmark Stadium ...
As Buffalo enters the fourth quarter, those two receivers' TD catches have put the Bills up 34-24.
Miami running back Jeff Wilson Jr. had his own drop later on, though it was on short check-down pass.

     Bills vs Dolphins Game Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the early afternoon game the Buffalo Bills host the Miami Dolphins.
The Dolphins have three wins this season against winning teams, including an early season victory over the Bills.
With Tagovailoa out for this game this looks like an uphill battle for the Dolphins to keep this game close.
While any team can win on any given Sunday, there is little reason to expect a Dolphins team without its starting quarterback will be able to stay with this juggernaut Bills team.
Itâ€™s the Bills and the Dolphins in the Wild Card Round on Sunday afternoon.

     Top 3 Things We Learned from Bills vs. Dolphins | Wild Card Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, the Bills defense wasn't perfect by any stretch, but Allen's turnover woes put the defense in unfavorable positions throughout the second quarter and into the third.
After Allen's first INT, the Dolphins had the ball in Bills territory at the 48-yard line.
A Bills punt followed by a big return by the Dolphins special teams unit put the ball just outside the red zone.
Miami's offensive drives in the second half: punt, punt, interception, punt, touchdown, punt, turnover on downs.
The interception in the second half came from rookie CB Kaiir Elam and the Bills took the lead on the ensuing drive.
