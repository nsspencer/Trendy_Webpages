     The Last of Us premieres today on HBO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here’s a sentence that I never thought I’d type: The Last of Us airs its first episode tonight on HBO and HBO Max.
I’m incredibly grateful to the team at Naughty Dog, HBO, Sony Pictures Entertainment, PlayStation Productions, and of course the cast and crew members that helped get us to this historic moment.
From myself and everybody at Naughty Dog, thank you!
The HBO show follows the broad beats of the overall story from the game, and is quite faithful in tone and spirit.
But rest assured, The Last of Us stays true to the soul of the games.

     Do You Need To Have Played ‘The Last Of Us’ To Watch The HBO Show?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, The Last of Us is based on a video game, which may lead to a question many may ask themselves.
Do I need to have played this game to appreciate or understand this show?
The result is an almost resounding “no,” because The Last of Us, and its HBO series, are a pretty unique case in the medium of video game adaptations.
The Last of Us on HBO is a direct adaptation of the game, the same storyline, the same sequences, even the same script, in many parts.
That’s also true of bad video game adaptations we’ve seen like Doom, Assassin’s Creed, Netflix’s Resident Evil show, Paramount’s Halo show.

     Review: HBO's 'The Last of Us' is the best video game adaptation ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Which is why it feels like HBO's adaptation of acclaimed PlayStation game "The Last of Us" (Sunday, 9 EST/PST, ★★★ out of four) is such a big achievement.
Starring "Game of Thrones" alums Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, it brings the visceral, intimate quality of a video game without feeling like you're stuck in an uncanny valley playing one.
Ramsey and Pascal are fantastic, well-suited to their roles and bursting with cheeky chemistry in their every scene.
We're simply not used to getting smart, visually arresting and even watchable video game adaptations.
"Us" might be the best one yet, even if it's just a darn good TV show.

     The Last of Us review: HBO breaks an age-old Hollywood curse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those who are familiar with the property, though, watching the HBO series’ 9-episode first season may be an unexpectedly odd experience.
On the one hand, it’s undeniably refreshing to see a video game adaptation that is genuinely confident in the strength of its source material.
The new HBO series is primarily set in a post-apocalyptic world that has become overrun with fungi-covered, zombie-like humans.
The new HBO series even features appearances from a handful of the voice actors who helped bring The Last of Us to life for the first time, including both Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker.
However, those flaws don’t prevent The Last of Us from ranking solidly as the best and most emotionally rich video game adaptation that Hollywood has ever produced.

     How HBO’s ‘The Last of Us’ Avoided the ‘Mistake’ of Video Game Adaptations: ‘Let’s Only Have as Much Violence in This Story as Is Required’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But he understood innately that it would be a “mistake” to try to replicate the way the game is played on the show itself.
“It’s the mistake other people have made, I think, in adaptation [of video games], because they think that’s what connects people to a game,” Mazin says.
“But ‘The Last of Us,’ more than any other video game I’ve ever played, connected me to character and relationship.
In the game, Marlene only shows up “when Joel meets Marlene and no other time,” he says.
“These characters that sometimes hunt you in the game, we get to humanize them in the show,” he says.

     'Last of Us' preview: Why it could live up to the hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Walking Dead” had concluded its third season, “World War Z” was expected to be a summer blockbuster and “Resident Evil” was still perhaps the best-known zombie-starring video game.
“The Last of Us” is now widely recognized as one of the best video games of all time.
Ten years after its release, the team behind the game is attempting to make a TV version the best video game adaptation of all time, too.
The bar for video game adaptations is fairly low, given the abundance of disappointments and duds made in the past.
The game, originally a PlayStation 3 exclusive, won near-unanimous acclaim when it debuted in 2013, with early reviews calling it the best game of the year and, potentially, one of the greatest of all time.
