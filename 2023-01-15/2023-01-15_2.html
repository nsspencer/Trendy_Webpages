     Summary: Jeffrey Brown:Marie St. Fleur, Martin Luther King Jr. is, of course, well remembered often for his work in the South, for the March on Washington, the "I Have a Dream" speech, perhaps less so for his time and his work in the North.
How important was Boston to him?
Marie st. Fleur, Former Executive Director, King Boston: Well, the wonderful thing is, it started here, right, because this is here where Martin and Coretta met.
And it celebrates that for us, as communities of color, as Black people, that we are more than just our struggle.
And that, to me, gets represented at the center of the oldest park in this country.

     Summary: “The Embrace” Martin Luther King Jr. monument downtown is taking flak both for the purportedly pornographic appearance some angles give it and some of the aesthetic choices that went into its creation.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King locked in a hug.
Martin Luther King III then approved it.
“It doesn’t sit well with me that Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King are reduced to body parts — just their arms.
“In making MLK a whitewashed symbol of love, the Embrace statue is both safe AND grotesque.

These pictures get worse and worse lol — Malynda Hale (@MalyndaHale) January 15, 2023Boston's statue of George Washington, vs. Boston's sculpture of ML King and Coretta Scott King in an embrace.
For such a large statue, dismembering MLK and Coretta Scott King is... a choice.

     Martin Luther King Jr monument in Boston prompts mockery and criticism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King’s legacy in Boston was unveiled.
The 20-foot tall, 40-foot wide “The Embrace” statue was unveiled Friday on Boston Common, where King gave a speech on April 23, 1965, to a crowd of 22,000.
The statue was inspired by a photograph of King and Scott King which captured them hugging after he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.
Seneca Scott, a community organizer in Oakland, California, and cousin of Scott King, told CNN the statue was insulting to his family.
“I think that’s a huge representation of bringing people together,” King said.
