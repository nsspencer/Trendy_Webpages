First downs will turn into a priority as the time of possession will most likely dictate the game.
Stopping the run game early and making the Bengals one-dimensional will be the goal here.
Entering this Wild Card matchup, Edwards’ quote really does ring true: the pads will do the talking.
If the Ravens’ season ends this week, many fans may not be surprised.

     Ravens to play both Tyler Huntley, Anthony Brown vs. Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI -- With Lamar Jackson sidelined, the Baltimore Ravens are preparing to go with an unusual strategy at quarterback to start the playoffs.
The Ravens are planning to use both of their quarterbacks -- banged-up backup Tyler Huntley and undrafted rookie Anthony Brown -- in Sunday night's wild-card game against the Cincinnati Bengals, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Huntley is more proficient at orchestrating the same run-oriented offense as Jackson, while Brown is the better passer who can push the ball downfield.
When Baltimore rested Huntley in last Sunday's 27-16 loss to the Bengals, Brown impressed the coaches with his confidence to make tough throws.
The sixth-seeded Ravens, who are 6-0 all time on the road in wild-card games, are 8.5-point underdogs to the third-seeded Bengals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet early in the fourth quarter, the Ravens and Bengals were tied and Baltimore was driving behind the inspired play of backup QB Tyler Huntley.
On third-and-goal, the Ravens called a QB sneak.
Huntley attempted to reach over the pile to cross the goal line with the football, but the Bengals defense swatted it away.
The Bengals won the game, 24-17, with this play as the game-deciding touchdown.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:51)CINCINNATI -- Without Lamar Jackson, the Baltimore Ravens weren't expected to give the Cincinnati Bengals much of a struggle Sunday night in their wild-card matchup.
A 98-yard touchdown return of Tyler Huntley's fumble at the goal line in the fourth quarter proved decisive.
The two AFC North teams met for the second straight week, and the Bengals beat a short-handed Ravens team to celebrate back-to-back division titles.
It squirted free and defensive end Sam Hubbard scooped it up for a 98-yard fumble return touchdown, which is the longest in NFL postseason history.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: The Ravens are 6-1 all-time on the road in the wild-card round.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much like the second half of their Week 18 meeting, the Bengals encountered a defense that was difficult to solve.
Thanks to some timely and opportunistic defense, the Bengals are moving on.
Baltimore was a yard from taking a lead in a game most expected the Ravens to lose.
The results were immediate: Nine Ravens defenders registered one or more QB pressures Sunday night, negatively affecting a Bengals offense that underperformed.
With 1:17 left in the game, J.K. Dobbins gained 11 yards on a short pass, reaching the Bengals' 17-yard line.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe situation between the Ravens and quarterback Lamar Jackson came to a head this week.
At this point, all options are on the table for the offseason.
The Ravens recently showed that they’re capable of working out a fair deal with an unrepresented player, via the contract done with linebacker Roquan Smith.
The contract signed by quarterback Deshaun Watson with the Browns cemented Jackson’s expectations for a five-year, fully-guaranteed deal of his own.
Which would make it much harder to get a long-term deal done.

     Stunning fumble return TD for Bengals beats Ravens, keeps Cincinnati's postseason alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Logan Wilson must have known the old "jump and stretch the ball over the goal line" play was coming.
Wilson knocked the ball out, then defensive end Sam Hubbard took the fumble and raced 98 yards for a touchdown.
A final pass by Huntley to the end zone barely fell incomplete as time expired and the Bengals survived.
The Bengals will play a divisional round game at the Buffalo Bills next Sunday.
Baltimore Ravens quarterback Tyler Huntley (2) fumbles the ball as it is knocked away by Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson.
