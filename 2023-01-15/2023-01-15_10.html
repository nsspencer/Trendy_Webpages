    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Republicans pounced on the discovery on Saturday of more classified documents at Joe Biden’s residence, accusing the president of hypocrisy and questioning why the records were not brought to light earlier.
Biden lawyers have discovered at least 20 classified documents at his residence outside Wilmington, Delaware, and at an office in Washington used after he left the Obama administration, in which he was vice-president.
It is not yet clear what exactly the documents are, but Biden lawyers have said they immediately turned over the documents to the National Archives.
“Why didn’t we hear about this on 2 November, when the first batch of classified documents were discovered?” he said.
The White House has said the 20 or so Biden documents were inadvertently misplaced and turned over as soon as they were discovered.

     Summary: Dr. King’s life and legacy show us the way, and we should pay attention,” Biden said.
The White House has faced increasing criticism for its lack of transparency with the public over the finding of classified material at Biden’s home and his former private office.
At the church, Biden spoke about King’s legacy and a number of issues, including civil and voting rights.

     Summary: “So the administration hasn’t been transparent about what’s going on with President Biden’s possession of classified documents.
The White House revealed the discovery on Saturday.
“It is troubling that classified documents have been improperly stored at the home of President Biden for at least six years, raising questions about who may have reviewed or had access to classified information,” Comer wrote in the letter.
“Look, we still don’t know what type of documents President Trump had.”“My concern is how there’s such a discrepancy in how former President Trump was treated by raiding Mar-a-Lago, by getting the security cameras, by taking pictures of documents on the floor.
Why didn’t we hear about this on November 2, when the first batch of classified documents were discovered?” he added.

     Biden: ‘Intimidating’ to speak at MLK’s church
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Specifically, work remains on economic rights, voting rights and protecting American democracy, Biden said Sunday, on what would have been King’s 94th birthday.
King is one of Biden’s two heroes, along with late Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, Biden said.
“We come to contemplate his moral vision and commit ourselves to his path,” the president said of King.
Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) spoke at the service before Biden.
On ABC’s “This Week,” Warnock said Sunday he was “honored” Biden would speak in King’s “spiritual home.”Warnock, himself a senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist, largely focused on bipartisanship rather than allegiance to Biden during the lead-up to last year’s election, in which Warnock eventually earned his first full six-year term in office.
