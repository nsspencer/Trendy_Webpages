     Kirk Cousins perfect on opening drive as Vikings take 7-0 lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Vikings had a textbook 12-play, 75-yard drive to open Sunday’s wild card game in Minnesota.
With most of the nation still watching the end of the Bills’ victory over the Dolphins, which went almost four hours, the Vikings took the opening kickoff and marched right down the field.
They had only one third down, a third-and-two from the Giants 10 that they converted on a 4-yard pass from Kirk Cousins to tight end T.J. Hockenson.
He scored from the 1 on a quarterback sneak after Justin Jefferson was ruled just short of the end zone after lunging for the pylon after a 5-yard gain.
He had 12 catches for 133 yards and a touchdown against the Giants in Week 16.

     Summary: Kirk Cousins and T.J. Hockenson worked together on a big fourth down play to keep the Minnesota Vikings drive alive late in the third quarter.
Minnesota found themselves on fourth down with two yards to go needing a big play.
Cousins &amp; Hockenson convert on 4th &amp; 2 and we’re going to the 4th quarter.
Both Cousins and Hockenson are primed for a great finish.
Cousins has over 200 yards passing, while Hockenson leads all Minnesota receivers with over 100 yards receiving.

     Kirk Cousins’ Vikings playoff feat vs. Giants not seen in Minnesota for 19 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins got off to a historic start in their Wild Card showdown with the New York Giants on Sunday, putting him in elite company in franchise history.
The 34-year-old Cousins took it to the end zone after getting into the one-yard line in the first quarter.
It gave the Vikings the lead, though the Giants fought back and responded with a 14-point run for the lead.
In the second quarter and with the Giants ahead 17-7, it took some time for the Vikings to find the end zone again.
It is certainly incredible for Kirk Cousins to replicate a feat not seen in nearly 20 years.

     NFL World Reacts To Kirk Cousins' Performance On Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA - JANUARY 05: Kirk Cousins #8 of the Minnesota Vikings reacts to a play during the first half against the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card Playoff game at Mercedes Benz Superdome on January 05, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)It's become a meme through the years that Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins can never step up and play great in primetime or the postseason.
The Vikings still trail 17-14 at the half, but Cousins is hardly to blame for that.
Postseason trips have been few and far between for Kirk Cousins since he became a starter in 2015.
But these past few years with the Minnesota Vikings have really seen him emerge as a bonafide top 15 quarterback - at least when he's not playing in primetime.

     Kirk Cousins perfect on opening drive, caps it with touchdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Vikings started the game off in perfect fashion, driving 75 yards in 12 plays to take a 7-0 lead.
The key to the touchdown was quarterback Kirk Cousins who was perfect on the opening drive going 8-8 for 64 yards, including four completions to Justin Jefferson.
The early passing concepts were set up to take advantage of holes in the zone right in front of defenders.
The Giants are trying to hit Jefferson every split second they can with multiple players hitting him after the catch.
The screen game is already starting to get established, as Ed Ingram led Dalvin Cook on one inside the red zone.
