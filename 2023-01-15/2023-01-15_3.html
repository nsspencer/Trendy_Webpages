     NY Giants 24, Vikings 21: Big Blue clinging to lead as back and forth game continues

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Daniel Jones took advantage of perfect execution on a play fake that caught the Vikings' Harrison Smith peeking in the backfield.
The Vikings responded when Kirk Cousins hit tight end Irv Smith for a 3-yard touchdown, and now possession is back to Daniel Jones and the Giants.
Daniel Jones dominatingEli Manning's advice to Daniel Jones this week: treat this game, his first in the playoffs, like any other game.
Daniel Jones had two critical runs on the series, and Barkley made a nice cut behind Jon Feliciano for his first postseason score.
In the aftermath of a victory over the Eagles, the Giants learned of a neck injury that was going to sideline Daniel Jones.

     Summary: A source informed Giants Baseball Insider that he received a $2.7 million signing bonus.
The source also informed Giants Baseball Insider that Rivas received a $1 million bonus.
Jesse Sanchez of MLB.com first reported that the Giants had signed Arias early Sunday morning, but he reported a $2.8 million bonus.
A scout with a National League team (not the Giants) told Giants Baseball Insider they were high on Arias' offensive upside.
Clearly, the Giants believe both players have the potential to be top prospects, and time will tell if they can live up to those expectations.
