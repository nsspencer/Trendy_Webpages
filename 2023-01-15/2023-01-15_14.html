     Democrat Schiff says national security may have been jeopardized by Biden’s mishandling of classified docs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is not ruling out the possibility that national security may have been jeopardized by President Joe Biden’s mishandling of classified documents.
Schiff appeared on ABC’s "This Week" on Sunday after a third batch of classified documents was found at Biden’s residence in Wilmington, Delaware.
ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Schiff whether it was possible national security had been jeopardized – an assessment Schiff made after the FBI seized classified documents from former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in August.
White House lawyer Richard Sauber said Saturday that six pages of classified documents were found during a search of Biden's private library.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Republicans pounced on the discovery on Saturday of more classified documents at Joe Biden’s residence, accusing the president of hypocrisy and questioning why the records were not brought to light earlier.
Biden lawyers have discovered at least 20 classified documents at his residence outside Wilmington, Delaware, and at an office in Washington used after he left the Obama administration, in which he was vice-president.
It is not yet clear what exactly the documents are, but Biden lawyers have said they immediately turned over the documents to the National Archives.
“Why didn’t we hear about this on 2 November, when the first batch of classified documents were discovered?” he said.
The White House has said the 20 or so Biden documents were inadvertently misplaced and turned over as soon as they were discovered.

The White House has faced increasing criticism for its lack of transparency with the public over the finding of classified material at Biden’s home and his former private office.
At the church, Biden spoke about King’s legacy and a number of issues, including civil and voting rights.
“So often, when people hear about Dr. King, people think his ministry and the movement were most about the epic struggle for civil rights and voting rights.

     Stabenow says discovery of Biden's classified records 'embarrassing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington ― Michigan U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow said Sunday it was "embarrassing" for President Joe Biden to have classified documents found at his Delaware home, while emphasizing that the White House has been cooperating with authorities.
The documents Biden had have been turned over either to the National Archives or the Department of Justice.
Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, last week appointed a special counsel, former Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, to investigate the matter.
More:Additional classified documents found at President Biden's home, White House saysStabenow, who is not seeking reelection next year, said Sunday that what she's most concerned about is that "this is the kind of thing that the Republicans love."
"The special counsel should evaluate the facts and the law, look at DOJ policies and make a recommendation to the AG about whether or not prosecution is warranted," Rosenstein said.
