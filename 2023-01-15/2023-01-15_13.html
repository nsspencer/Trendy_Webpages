     Tua Tagovailoa expected to return as Miami Dolphins starter for 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BUFFALO, N.Y. ― Tua Tagovailoa is expected to return as Dolphins' starting quarterback next season.
According to the report, doctors feel Tagovailoa should be able to resume his career next season, if not sooner.
It may even be possible for Tua to play this postseason if Miami advances.
Except for concerns about Tagovailoa's healthy and long-term durability, there is really no reason Miami would consider looking elsewhere this offseason.
But if Tua stays on an expected course of recovery, he is their top choice to start in 2023.

     Report: Tua Tagovailoa “expected” back as Dolphins starter in 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesPublicly, the Dolphins will say nothing about when or if quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will be cleared to return after at least two and possibly three concussions in 2022.
Adam Schefter of ESPN.com, citing unnamed sources, reports that Tagovailoa is “expected” to be the team’s starting quarterback in 2023.
And, at the risk of being even more painfully obvious than usual, until he’s cleared, he’s not.
If he’s the starter in 2023, Tua will need to be aggressively coached on better protecting himself.
And as to the possibility of Tua playing next week, the Dolphins will have a different question to answer.
