     Bills take lead on Cole Beasley TD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesCole Beasley is back for the Bills.
Beasley, the veteran receiver who came out of retirement to try to go on a playoff run with his old team, scored a six-yard touchdown in the third quarter today as Buffalo took a 27-24 lead.
The Bills’ touchdown drive came on a short field after Dolphins quarterback Skylar Thompson threw an ugly interception.
A seventh-round rookie who is playing only because both Tua Tagovailoa and Teddy Bridgewater are hurt, Thompson has been struggling.
The Dolphins need to give Thompson some help to pull off this upset.

     Kaiir Elam interception sets up Cole Beasley TD reception for Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins had the lead in the third quarter and whatever momentum existed in the NFL Wild-Card Game between AFC East foes Sunday in Buffalo.
The strategy backfired as Thompson’s throw down the left side was intercepted by Bills rookie Kaiir Elam.
It took Josh Allen 5 plays to negotiate the 33 yards, finishing the drive with a short pass to Cole Beasley, who slipped into the end zone from 6 yards.
The Bills, who had seen a 17-0 lead disappear were back in front, 27-24.
Thompson was 10-of-28 for 104 yards and 2 TDs with 5 minutes left in the third quarter.
