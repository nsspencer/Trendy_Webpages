As they do that, Damar Hamlin will be cheering them on from his home.
He noted that his "heart is with my guys as they compete today" and he'll watch them from home as he continues to focus on his recovery.
Days later, Hamlin awoke and doctors noted he was marking remarkable progress and was neurologically intact.
Of course, Hamlin's remarkable progress and continued support should help propel a Bills team that has aspirations of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy next month in Glendale, Arizona.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, the Bills defense wasn't perfect by any stretch, but Allen's turnover woes put the defense in unfavorable positions throughout the second quarter and into the third.
After Allen's first INT, the Dolphins had the ball in Bills territory at the 48-yard line.
A Bills punt followed by a big return by the Dolphins special teams unit put the ball just outside the red zone.
Miami's offensive drives in the second half: punt, punt, interception, punt, touchdown, punt, turnover on downs.
The interception in the second half came from rookie CB Kaiir Elam and the Bills took the lead on the ensuing drive.
