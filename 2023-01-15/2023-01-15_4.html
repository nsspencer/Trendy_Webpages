     Dolphins vs. Bills - NFL Game Recap - January 15, 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- — Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills opened the season with Super Bowl aspirations.
Allen shrugged off a three-turnover outing, and the three-time defending AFC East champion Bills avoided a major collapse by rallying for a 34-31 victory over the AFC’s seventh-seeded and injury-depleted Miami Dolphins in a wild-card playoff game on Sunday.
The Dolphins beat Buffalo 21-19 at Miami in September, with the Bills rallying to beat Miami 32-29 last month.
Three weeks earlier, the Bills' game against the Bengals in Cincinnati was canceled when Buffalo safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field.
Miami’s most recent playoff win was a 23-17 overtime victory over Indianapolis on Dec. 30, 2000 in the wild-card round.

     Top 3 Things We Learned from Bills vs. Dolphins | Wild Card Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, the Bills defense wasn't perfect by any stretch, but Allen's turnover woes put the defense in unfavorable positions throughout the second quarter and into the third.
After Allen's first INT, the Dolphins had the ball in Bills territory at the 48-yard line.
A Bills punt followed by a big return by the Dolphins special teams unit put the ball just outside the red zone.
Miami's offensive drives in the second half: punt, punt, interception, punt, touchdown, punt, turnover on downs.
The interception in the second half came from rookie CB Kaiir Elam and the Bills took the lead on the ensuing drive.
