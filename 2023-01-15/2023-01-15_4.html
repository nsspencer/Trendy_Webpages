     Summary: Alexander Isak was Newcastle's matchwinner against Fulham.
Photo by Stu Forster/Getty ImagesClub-record signing Alexander Isak came off the bench to earn Newcastle United a last-gasp 1-0 win over Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday, with the hosts grateful for an extraordinary penalty slip from visiting forward Aleksandar Mitrovic.
Newcastle, without a goal in their previous two league matches, again struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at St. James' Park, with Callum Wilson twice denied by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno.
The victory ensured Newcastle climbed back above Manchester United into third in the standings on goal difference, one point behind champions Manchester City in second.
"So many things to say about the ref's performance," Fulham coach Marco Silva told Sky Sports.

     Explained: Why Mitrovic had penalty goal ruled out in Newcastle vs Fulham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic thought he had opened the scoring against Newcastle from the spot on Sunday, but the goal was disallowed.
Mitrovic slipped but scored penaltyGoal ruled out as he touched ball twiceNewcastle went on to a 1-0 victoryWHAT HAPPENED?
Fulham were awarded a second-half penalty after a VAR intervention adjudged Kieran Trippier to have tripped Bobby Decordova-Reid just inside the box.
Mitrovic's penalty was ruled out as his slip meant that he touched the ball twice before it hit the back of the net.
WHAT NEXT FOR MITROVIC: The Serbian will be hoping to lead the line again when Fulham host Tottenham at Craven Cottage next Sunday.
