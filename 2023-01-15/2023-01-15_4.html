     At least 68 dead in Nepal plane crash, many burned beyond recognition; search for the missing underway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixty-eight deaths were confirmed and four people were missing after a plane crashed Sunday in a Nepal ravine, the wreckage burning so hot that rescue workers were unable to aid at least one screaming victim.
Yeti Airlines Flight NYT691 crashed near the resort town of Pokhara at about 10:50 a.m. local time, the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority said.
Prem Nath Thakur, general manager of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the plane had been granted landing clearance.
In July 2014, a TransAsia ATR 72-500 flight crashed while trying to land on the scenic Penghu archipelago between Taiwan and China, killing 48 people onboard.
An emergency meeting of the Nepal Council of Ministers was held Sunday at the prime minister's official residence in Kathmandu.
