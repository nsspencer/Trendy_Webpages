     Lamar Jackson Doesn't Travel for Ravens vs. Bengals While Sitting Out with Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesThe Baltimore Ravens are playing Sunday's AFC Wild Card Game against the Cincinnati Bengals without star quarterback Lamar Jackson as he nurses a knee injury, but he's also noticeably absent from the sidelines.
Jonas Shaffer of the Baltimore Banner relayed an NBC broadcast report that Jackson didn't travel with the Ravens to Cincinnati for the game.
Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season after suffering a knee injury in Week 13.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Saturday that the Ravens "haven't changed their stance" regarding Jackson and plan to resume negotiations with him whenever their season comes to an end.
If Jackson is truly ready to move on from the Ravens, he will be the most coveted player available during the 2023 offseason.

     Report: Tyler Huntley to start for Ravens vs. Bengals with Lamar Jackson out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyler Huntley reportedly will start at quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night against the Cincinnati Bengals.
It is my understanding per source that Tyler âSnoopâ Huntley will start tonight for the #RavensFlock.
Jackson has missed the team’s last five games, last starting for the Ravens on Dec. 4 in a 10-9 win over the Denver Broncos.
Huntley, who played most of that Dec. 4 game, started every game for Jackson before missing the team’s Week 18 contest with a wrist injury.
The Ravens, losers of three of their last four games, failed to score more than 20 points in both December and January without Jackson.

     Ex-NFL star advises Ravens' Lamar Jackson to play through PCL strain: 'Put a brace on it'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens will be without Lamar Jackson for the sixth consecutive week as he deals with a grade 2 PCL strain, putting a damper on the team’s playoff hopes as they get ready to play the Cincinnati Bengals.
Hall of Famer Charles Woodson said he didn’t know if he would have the "b----" to sit out a playoff game like that.
Former NFL coach Sean Payton said he didn’t like that Jackson gave the update days before the Ravens' playoff game and didn’t expect the quarterback in Baltimore next season.
Jackson and the Ravens failed to agree on a contract extension in the offseason.
The Ravens quarterback is set to be a free agent at the end of the season.

     On Lamar Jackson’s contract, all options are on the table for Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe situation between the Ravens and quarterback Lamar Jackson came to a head this week.
At this point, all options are on the table for the offseason.
The Ravens recently showed that they’re capable of working out a fair deal with an unrepresented player, via the contract done with linebacker Roquan Smith.
The contract signed by quarterback Deshaun Watson with the Browns cemented Jackson’s expectations for a five-year, fully-guaranteed deal of his own.
Which would make it much harder to get a long-term deal done.

     Summary: Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick did not hold back on his feelings about Lamar Jackson sitting out the Ravens' playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Baltimore's quarterback remains out due to a PCL sprain, and Vick has no sympathy for No.
The injury was initially not categorized as season-ending as head coach John Harbaugh listed him then as "week to week."
Former head coach Sean Payton does not agree with Jackson tweeting out his injury status.
With Jackson out, the Ravens will reportedly use both Tyler Huntley and Anthony Brown vs. Cincinnati.

The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official on Friday.
But his injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Then came Jackson's announcement on Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game.
