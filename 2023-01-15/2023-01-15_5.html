     ‘The Last of Us’ zombie fungus is real, and it’s found in health supplements
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The zombie apocalypse depicted in the popular video game series and newly adapted HBO series “The Last of Us” derives from a mutation to a type of fungus called cordyceps.
Cordyceps is real, and some 600 variations of it can be found around the world, primarily in Southeast Asia.
Cordyceps has long been studied by the scientific community and these days can be found in a number of health supplements.
This should probably come as no surprise, though: Unlike in the games and show, cordyceps, as we currently know it, will not turn you into a zombie.
But here’s what you should know about “The Last of Us” and its depiction of the zombie fungus.

     TV tonight: unmissable new post-apocalyptic thriller The Last of Us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us9pm, Sky AtlanticFor decades, video games have borrowed the narrative dynamics and visual grammar of film and TV thrillers.
When teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey) enters the scene, it leads to a genuinely thrilling escape sequence which feels like an intense first-person shooter game.
It’s essentially a post-apocalyptic drama, but thanks to its origins, the story has real white-knuckle jeopardy.
It is set in a Japanese region where all dogs have been banished to an offshore rubbish dump due to disease.

     The Last of Us: How the Cordyceps Infection Works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whether passed through a bite or airborne spores from contaminated food, the Cordyceps infection will take over the host’s brain completely after two days, transforming them into this creature.
StalkersThe next stage of infection is the Stalker, categorized by fungal plates that have begun to grow over the eyes.
This stage of Cordyceps can occur anywhere between two weeks to a year after infection as the fungus takes further control over the host’s body.
Clickers also have enhanced strength, and the thick fungal plates covering their face and body make them tough to kill.
The creators of The Last of Us games have excelled at creating a horrific yet realistic infection, and we can’t wait to see how this strain of the Cordyceps fungus evolves in the series.

“If the world were to get slightly warmer, then there is reason to evolve,” he said.
“It’s real — it’s real to the extent that everything he says that fungus do, they do,” Mazin says.
I don’t think so.
I needed to have be foreboding, and ideally, without being super on the nose, give me a comment.

With Ellie, Joel is offered a path toward redemption, as well as a chance to become more than the sum of his gruff heroics.
When Joel and Ellie pack provisions from a rare well-stocked home, she makes sure to prioritize toilet paper—a big improvement from the pages of old magazines.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Premiere Recap: Welcome to the Apocalypse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All of the season’s episodes are covering familiar ground in some way or other, but the premiere is perhaps crossing the most familiar of that ground.
As I believe Leo Tolstoy once said, all zombie apocalypses are alike, but every post-apocalypse is unhappy in its own way.
Which isn’t to say that material is bad; just more generic than what’s to come, especially in later episodes.
But the most compelling parts of the episode come before and after the nightmare that blankets the world over a late September weekend of 2003.
In those scenes, Sarah comes across as a typical teenager — at times lost in her own head, at others outgoing and friendly and generous to others, including her dad and their neighbors.

     Summary: HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us is already changing things up in exciting and smart ways after ... [+] one episode.
Even when it’s a game that’s as cinematic as The Last of Us.
Thanks in part to some of the different paths it takes, HBO’s adaptation of the 2013 game is off to a stellar start.
In the same way, a movie that adapted any of the core Mario games exactly would quickly fall flat.
If you want an experience that’s exactly the same as Naughty Dog’s game, you can simply play The Last of Us.
