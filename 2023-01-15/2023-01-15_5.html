     At least 68 dead in Nepal plane crash, many burned beyond recognition; search for the missing underway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixty-eight deaths were confirmed and four people were missing after a plane crashed Sunday in a Nepal ravine, the wreckage burning so hot that rescue workers were unable to aid at least one screaming victim.
Yeti Airlines Flight NYT691 crashed near the resort town of Pokhara at about 10:50 a.m. local time, the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority said.
Prem Nath Thakur, general manager of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the plane had been granted landing clearance.
In July 2014, a TransAsia ATR 72-500 flight crashed while trying to land on the scenic Penghu archipelago between Taiwan and China, killing 48 people onboard.
An emergency meeting of the Nepal Council of Ministers was held Sunday at the prime minister's official residence in Kathmandu.

     At least 68 killed in Nepal's worst air crash in three decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KATHMANDU, Jan 15 (Reuters) - At least 68 people were killed on Sunday when a domestic flight of Yeti Airlines crashed in Pokhara in Nepal, the worst air crash in three decades in the small Himalayan nation.
The weather had been clear and there was no immediate indication of what caused the crash.
It was Nepal's deadliest air crash since 1992, the Aviation Safety Network database showed, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A300 crashed into a hillside upon approach to Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board.
Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said on Twitter the Yeti Airlines aircraft was 15 years old and equipped with an old transponder with unreliable data.
Yeti Airlines has a fleet of six ATR72-500 planes, according to its website.
