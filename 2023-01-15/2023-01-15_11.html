The Spaniard has lost six of his past seven matches and faces a difficult proposition first up in Melbourne in fast-rising Briton Jack Draper.
“[It is] probably one of the toughest first rounds possible, being seeded,” acknowledged Nadal when asked about the Draper clash.
Although they have never faced off in a tour-level match, Halys defeated the Greek in an ITF Futures match in 2014 and an ATP Challenger Tour match in 2018.
