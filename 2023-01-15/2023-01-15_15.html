     Summary: Alabama basketball player Darius Miles and another man have been charged with capital murder after a fatal shooting near campus.
Captain Jack Kennedy of Tuscaloosa Police said that the shooting occurred early on Sunday morning near the university’s campus.
Miles, 21, a forward from Washington DC, and Michael Lynn Davis, 20, of Charles county, Maryland, were charged with capital murder.
The capital murder charge arose because the death involved shots fired into a vehicle, Kennedy said.
“The University of Alabama’s utmost priority is the safety and well-being of the campus community,” a university statement said.
