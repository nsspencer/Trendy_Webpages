     Summary: With Mykhailo Mudryk looking set to join Chelsea instead of Arsenal, Steve Nicol thinks the Ukrainian is taking a big risk.
(1:12)Chelsea earned their first victory of 2023 as they edged Crystal Palace 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
From the stands, Mudryk watched his new team start to grow into the game and test Palace's resilience.
Palace boss Patrick Vieira bemoaned the referee Peter Bankes' performance saying "too many decisions" went against his side.
Too many decisions went against us, and frustration has grown game after game and this is something I cannot accept."

     Summary: Sloppy in the first half and much better in the second half.
A Tottenham fan just kicked Aaron Ramsdale in the back as he went to get his drinks bottle behind the goal.
Spurs are lucky it is only 2-0 and will be hoping for one of their rousing second half comebacks.
We know how good they are in the second half of games…GOALLL!
Brilliant save from Aaron Ramsdale to deny Heung min-Son.
