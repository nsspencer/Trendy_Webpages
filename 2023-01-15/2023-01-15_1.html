     Giants brutally troll Vikings on Twitter after playoff upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On 4th-and-8 late in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins throws it three yards to T.J. Hockenson, clinching the win for the Giants.
(0:33)The New York Giants beat the Minnesota Vikings in a stunning playoff upset ... and then added some salt to the wound on Twitter.
The Giants only punted once the entire game, and while the Vikings tied things up early in the fourth quarter, a Saquon Barkley touchdown run five minutes later proved to be the deciding factor.
The Vikings had a chance to tie things up late in the fourth, but Kirk Cousins threw short on fourth and eight and the Giants hung on.
As befitting as the Giants' first playoff win since 2011, and in response to a Vikings tweet celebrating their wins over the Giants, New York Jets and Buffalo Bills this season by calling themselves "New York's Favorite Team", the Giants' Twitter account went very hard on Minnesota after the game, repurposing their opponents' "Skol Vikings" chant in brutal fashion.

     Minnesota Vikings' season ended on hopeless Kirk Cousins pass on fourth down vs. New York Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When your season comes down to a single play, you absolutely have to give your team a chance to succeed.
Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins did not do that in Sunday's critical fourth-down play against the New York Giants.
And let me tell ya — Cousins is going to have a long offseason thinking about that pass.
Needing eight yards to pick up the first down, Cousins instead checked down to T.J. Hockenson a good five yards short of the marker.
NFL fans were not exactly pleased with Cousins' pass, either.

     Kirk Cousins Disappoints Vikings Fans Yet Again After Crushing Playoff Loss to Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesMinnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins put up some solid stats in Sunday's NFC Wild Card Game against the New York Giants, but his final pass of the day will haunt him for quite some time.
With the Vikings' season on the line late in the fourth quarter, Cousins threw a checkdown pass on fourth down.
Cousins threw for 273 yards and two touchdowns on 31-of-39 passing, and he ran for another score.
He kept his team afloat while the Vikings defense had a lackluster showing against a scrappy Giants offense.
However, his decision to throw a short pass on a potential game-tying drive destroyed Minnesota's chances of continuing its postseason run.

I just felt like throwing short of the sticks isn't the end of the world, and it was obviously tight coverage.
O'Connell said that the pocket "may or may have not been collapsed" and that Cousins wanted to give someone a chance to make a play.
…"(Cousins) knew it was fourth down, and he wanted to make sure he put the ball in play.
"The intent as a play-caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where it's short of the sticks to gain," O'Connell said.

     Summary: So, naturally, they opened the playoffs with a one-score loss, falling 31-24 to the Giants in the wild card round of the postseason.
A Darius Slayton drop forced the Giants to punt it back to the Vikings, who trailed by a touchdown with three minutes left.
Fair or not, that's all anyone is going to remember from Cousins' first home playoff game with the Vikings.
The Vikings' defense couldn't stop a nosebleed in the first half, and really, all game.
In between Vikings touchdown drives at the start and end of the half, the Giants went on a 17-0 run.

     Summary: Jones' 2022 season has been a revelation, and Sunday was the high-water mark for him.
Jones led the Giants in rushing, scrambling for extra yards when necessary and turning designed runs into positive gains.
Unlike the first meeting, though, New York decided Jefferson wouldn't be the one to beat them a second time around.
Wink Martindale's game plan worked to perfection, keeping the star -- and the rest of Minnesota's offense -- from hurting them, sending the Giants to the Divisional Round.
But for the first time this season, Cousins and the Vikings couldn't win the tight one.

O'Connell said he was watching the routes down the field and didn't get a good look at whether the pocket collapsed.
"The intent as a play caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where somebody is short of the sticks to gain, especially on fourth down," O'Connell said.
