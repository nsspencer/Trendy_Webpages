     Vikings-Giants inactives: Safety Harrison Smith returning to lineup for Minnesota
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Safety Harrison Smith and edge rusher Za'Darius Smith will return to the lineup, as anticipated, for a Vikings defense that is essentially at full strength for Sunday afternoon's NFC wild-card game against the Giants.
Harrison Smith ‚Äî the longest-tenured Vikings player in his 11th season ‚Äî is starting in his seventh playoff game.
Harrison Smith was out because of knee soreness that continued to limit him this week; Za'Darius Smith was out because of a personal matter, although he said this week a Week 10 knee injury limited him throughout the second half of this season.
"Just to make sure guys are going through the same routine with the game plan," Tomlinson said this week.
Safety Xavier McKinney is also playing his second game since returning from a broken hand.
