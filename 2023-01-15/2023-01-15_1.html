     Giants brutally troll Vikings on Twitter after playoff upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On 4th-and-8 late in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins throws it three yards to T.J. Hockenson, clinching the win for the Giants.
(0:33)The New York Giants beat the Minnesota Vikings in a stunning playoff upset ... and then added some salt to the wound on Twitter.
The Giants only punted once the entire game, and while the Vikings tied things up early in the fourth quarter, a Saquon Barkley touchdown run five minutes later proved to be the deciding factor.
The Vikings had a chance to tie things up late in the fourth, but Kirk Cousins threw short on fourth and eight and the Giants hung on.
As befitting as the Giants' first playoff win since 2011, and in response to a Vikings tweet celebrating their wins over the Giants, New York Jets and Buffalo Bills this season by calling themselves "New York's Favorite Team", the Giants' Twitter account went very hard on Minnesota after the game, repurposing their opponents' "Skol Vikings" chant in brutal fashion.

     Vikings HC Kevin O'Connell, QB Kirk Cousins explain fourth-and-8 throw short of sticks

     Summary: Why was Hockenson running such a short route in that situation and why was he Cousins' read?
I just felt like throwing short of the sticks isn't the end of the world, and it was obviously tight coverage.
O'Connell said that the pocket "may or may have not been collapsed" and that Cousins wanted to give someone a chance to make a play.
…"(Cousins) knew it was fourth down, and he wanted to make sure he put the ball in play.
"The intent as a play-caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where it's short of the sticks to gain," O'Connell said.

     Summary: That's the one that's going to stick with people.
Still, one imagines the Vikings wish they found more ways to get Jefferson going in Sunday's game.
Even if Cousins didn't want to target a double-covered Jefferson there, how about giving Osborn another chance against single coverage over the middle?
"There was always belief (that we'd win the game)," Cousins said.
Throughout a 13-win regular season, Cousins came up clutch for the Vikings in the big moments time and time again.

O'Connell said he was watching the routes down the field and didn't get a good look at whether the pocket collapsed.

    </h2>

     Summary: Jones' 2022 season has been a revelation, and Sunday was the high-water mark for him.
Jones led the Giants in rushing, scrambling for extra yards when necessary and turning designed runs into positive gains.
Unlike the first meeting, though, New York decided Jefferson wouldn't be the one to beat them a second time around.
Wink Martindale's game plan worked to perfection, keeping the star -- and the rest of Minnesota's offense -- from hurting them, sending the Giants to the Divisional Round.
But for the first time this season, Cousins and the Vikings couldn't win the tight one.

Cousins said the missed opportunity on the previous play plagues him even more.
"I felt like, getting man coverage, the ball needed to be a little more out front of K.J.
It was right on him in the sense that the DB was able to break it up, but if the ball's out front, the DB can't do that in man coverage."
O'Connell confirmed that the "primary concept" never intended for a catch five yards short – at least in that situation.

     Summary: Giants upset Vikings in wild card game, advance to play Eagles originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonA New York Giants team that entered the season with a new head coach, an unproven quarterback, a yet-to-return-to-form running back and rather low expectations are now moving on to the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.
3 Minnesota Vikings 31-24 in the NFC wild card game on Sunday, giving New York its first postseason victory since winning the Super Bowl in 2011.
Jones later found Isaiah Hodgins for a 14-yard touchdown pass to give the Giants a 14-7 lead.
After a 35-yard field goal by the Giants' Graham Gano, Kirk Cousins connected with T.J. Hockenson for two big gains to set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to K.J.
The Vikings made it a one-possession game when Irv Smith Jr. caught a three-yard touchdown pass from Cousins to pull within 24-21 with 7:46 left in the third.
