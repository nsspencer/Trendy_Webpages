     Summary: 3 Minnesota Vikings 31-24 in the NFC wild card game on Sunday, giving New York its first postseason victory since winning the Super Bowl in 2011.
They advance to play the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round next weekend.
Jones later found Isaiah Hodgins for a 14-yard touchdown pass to give the Giants a 14-7 lead.
After a 35-yard field goal by the Giants' Graham Gano, Kirk Cousins connected with T.J. Hockenson for two big gains to set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to K.J.
The Vikings made it a one-possession game when Irv Smith Jr. caught a three-yard touchdown pass from Cousins to pull within 24-21 with 7:46 left in the third.

     'We have an elite quarterback': Giants laud Jones after victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:17)MINNEAPOLIS -- In his first career playoff game, Daniel Jones made history.
Jones became the first quarterback in NFL history to have 300 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and at least 70 rushing yards in a playoff game.
"Played good," coach Brian Daboll said nonchalantly after winning his first playoff game as a head coach.
He called Manning late last week for advice on what a playoff game would be like.
The Giants didn't do it often in the previous meeting, when Jones had only four carries.

     Giants HC Brian Daboll 'proud' of Daniel Jones for record-setting performance in win vs. Vikings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the second half, he joined five other quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era to have 200-plus passing yards, two-plus passing TDs and 70-plus rushing yards in a playoff game, per NFL Research.
By the final whistle, he surpassed his four peers by being the first QB in postseason history to eclipse 300 passing yards along with those accolades.
The Giants needed every bit of the 379 yards Jones accounted for.
That's when Jones responded again with the game-winning, 67-yard touchdown drive, which was only the Giants' fifth-longest possession of the game.
Two plays before Barkley would eventually punch it in for New York, Jones converted a fourth-and-1 from the 7-yard line.

     Summary: Jones' 2022 season has been a revelation, and Sunday was the high-water mark for him.
Jones led the Giants in rushing, scrambling for extra yards when necessary and turning designed runs into positive gains.
Unlike the first meeting, though, New York decided Jefferson wouldn't be the one to beat them a second time around.
Wink Martindale's game plan worked to perfection, keeping the star -- and the rest of Minnesota's offense -- from hurting them, sending the Giants to the Divisional Round.
But for the first time this season, Cousins and the Vikings couldn't win the tight one.

In that one, a 10-year-old Daniel Jones was smiling while wearing Eli Manning's blue No.
"I know he's honored just to have the opportunity, and he's coming to learn, and he's going to earn this."
Daniel Jones, carrying the Giants with his words and his actions.
And that identity, much like Eli Manning before him, has now been established in every way by Daniel Jones.

     Summary: "When I went to progress, I just felt like I was about to get sacked and felt like, 'I've got to put the ball in play.
I can't go down with a sack,' so I just thought I'd kick it out to T.J.," Cousins said.
O'Connell said he was watching the routes down the field and didn't get a good look at whether the pocket collapsed.
"The intent as a play caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where somebody is short of the sticks to gain, especially on fourth down," O'Connell said.
"If it's third down, and you can catch, convert and make it a fourth-and-2-or-3, that's OK.
