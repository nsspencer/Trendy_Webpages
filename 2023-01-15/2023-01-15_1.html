    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal, like an ex who feels cheated, must now try to forget about Mykhailo Murdyk.
The 22-year-old has “flirted” with Arsenal about joining them in recent months, but this weekend he reportedly agreed to join their rivals Chelsea.
You don’t know Arsenal, if you thought they were going to be a hopeless “ex”.
The Gunners, as per the Evening Standard, have already set their sights on their new fling, or should we say old flame, Raphinha, and are in contact with his agent Deco over the swoop.
Raphinha moved to Barcelona six months ago, but Rivaldo has revealed that the La Liga giant’s financial difficulties force them to consider offers for the Brazilian winger.

     Piers Morgan slams ‘weak’ Arsenal over Mudryk transfer ‘fiasco’ as fans rage after being gazumped by Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PIERS MORGAN has revealed his frustrations after Arsenal appeared to be beaten to the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk.
Chelsea look set to confirm the 22-year-old as their latest star name after agreeing a stunning £97million transfer.
But the Blues blasted their rivals out of the water and look set to pay nearly £100m for the Ukrainian winger.
Sun columnist and Arsenal fan Piers has taken aim at his "weak" club over their approach.
These deals come on top of a dizzying summer transfer window which saw Chelsea buy over £270m worth of talent.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Matchday 20 weekend will wrap up with another installment of the North London Derby as Tottenham play host to league leaders Arsenal.
Let’s take a closer look at this derby matchup with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.
Many expected Arsenal to struggle after the break with the absence of Gabriel Jesus, who suffered a knee injury during the World Cup.
The Gunners are 2-1-0 since resuming play, with their most recent result ending in a scoreless draw against third place Newcastle.
Given how Spurs have been struggling over their last few matches, I’m expecting Arsenal to pull out another win in this one.

There was a time when Arsenal winning at Tottenham felt like an everyday occurrence.
But when the derby is at Tottenham, it’s been white for a long time now.
Tottenham went on to claim fourth spot, with Arsenal having to settle for another season in the Europa League.

Mikel Arteta's side make a short trip to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium five points clear of second-placed Manchester City, after Pep Guardiola's side faltered in their derby against United on Saturday.
Spurs, on the other hand, are fifth in the league and have lost five of their last 11, including October's 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium.
Antonio Conte's side are a much tougher outfit on home soil, however, and will be hoping to win four consecutive home matches against Arsenal for the first time.

     Summary: Arsenal brush off devastating Mykhailo Mudryk snub by opening talks to sign Barcelona forward insteadRaphinha, Ansu Fati Barcelona Credit: AlamyArsenal have reportedly opened talks with the agent of a Barcelona star as they look to quickly brush off the disappointment of Chelsea hijacking their move for Mykhailo Mudryk.
Raphinha has largely been unimpressive since moving to Spain and will be offloaded, alongside the likes of Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres.
“With Ansu Fati that would be even more incomprehensible, since he has been seen as Lionel Messi’s successor for a while.
Arsenal can stretch their lead to eight points at the top of the table with victory at Tottenham on Sunday.

     Summary: (ES Composite)Arsenal are set to be boosted by the fitness of Bukayo Saka for today’s north London derby against Tottenham.
Saka took a painful kick to the leg during Monday’s FA Cup third-round victory at Oxford and was replaced by Emile Smith Rowe in the closing stages.
“The update is that he is progressing really well,” said Arteta, who has seen Eddie Nketiah step up to the plate in Jesus’ absence.
“He is in the right place in his recovery regarding to the time that we set for him, but he’s still a bit far to be fair.”Predicted Arsenal XI (4-3-3): Ramsdale; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko; Odegaard, Partey, Xhaka; Saka, Nketiah, Martinelli.
