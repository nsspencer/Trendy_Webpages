    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articleThe Minnesota Vikings host the New York Giants in the NFC Wild Card Playoffs at 3:30 p.m. Sunday in a game you can watch on Fox 9.
The Vikings will be without defensive back Cam Dantzler, who was declared inactive 90 minutes before kickoff.
Dantzler did not practice all week, and has been listed on the team’s injury report with an ankle issue.

Harrison Smith and Za’Darius Smith are also back after missing last Sunday’s game at Chicago.

     Giants brutally troll Vikings on Twitter after playoff upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On 4th-and-8 late in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins throws it three yards to T.J. Hockenson, clinching the win for the Giants.
(0:33)The New York Giants beat the Minnesota Vikings in a stunning playoff upset ... and then added some salt to the wound on Twitter.
The Giants only punted once the entire game, and while the Vikings tied things up early in the fourth quarter, a Saquon Barkley touchdown run five minutes later proved to be the deciding factor.
The Vikings had a chance to tie things up late in the fourth, but Kirk Cousins threw short on fourth and eight and the Giants hung on.
As befitting as the Giants' first playoff win since 2011, and in response to a Vikings tweet celebrating their wins over the Giants, New York Jets and Buffalo Bills this season by calling themselves "New York's Favorite Team", the Giants' Twitter account went very hard on Minnesota after the game, repurposing their opponents' "Skol Vikings" chant in brutal fashion.

     Summary: Cameron Dantzler is inactive for the Vikings after dealing with a serious personal matter this week.

Later in the drive – with 13 minutes left in the game – the Vikings faced 4th-and-1 from the New York 16-yard line.

     Summary: So, naturally, they opened the playoffs with a one-score loss, falling 31-24 to the Giants in the wild card round of the postseason.
A Darius Slayton drop forced the Giants to punt it back to the Vikings, who trailed by a touchdown with three minutes left.
Fair or not, that's all anyone is going to remember from Cousins' first home playoff game with the Vikings.
The Vikings' defense couldn't stop a nosebleed in the first half, and really, all game.
In between Vikings touchdown drives at the start and end of the half, the Giants went on a 17-0 run.

     Vikings-Giants inactives: Safety Harrison Smith returning to lineup for Minnesota
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Safety Harrison Smith and edge rusher Za'Darius Smith will return to the lineup, as anticipated, for a Vikings defense that is essentially at full strength for Sunday afternoon's NFC wild-card game against the Giants.
Harrison Smith — the longest-tenured Vikings player in his 11th season — is starting in his seventh playoff game.
Harrison Smith was out because of knee soreness that continued to limit him this week; Za'Darius Smith was out because of a personal matter, although he said this week a Week 10 knee injury limited him throughout the second half of this season.
"Just to make sure guys are going through the same routine with the game plan," Tomlinson said this week.
Safety Xavier McKinney is also playing his second game since returning from a broken hand.

     Summary: The Minnesota Vikings’ defense and special teams unit received some bad news as they came out of halftime.
Rookie linebacker Brian Asamoah has been ruled out for the remainder of the game with a concussion.
The team medical staff quickly helped Asamoah off the field and then took him to the medical tent.
As the team emerged from the locker room after halftime, the team ruled Asamoah out for the game.
The Vikings’ defense will need to get creative in this second half to help fill the void left by Asamoah.
