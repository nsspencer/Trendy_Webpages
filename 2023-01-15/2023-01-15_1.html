     Giants brutally troll Vikings on Twitter after playoff upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On 4th-and-8 late in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins throws it three yards to T.J. Hockenson, clinching the win for the Giants.
(0:33)The New York Giants beat the Minnesota Vikings in a stunning playoff upset ... and then added some salt to the wound on Twitter.
The Giants only punted once the entire game, and while the Vikings tied things up early in the fourth quarter, a Saquon Barkley touchdown run five minutes later proved to be the deciding factor.
The Vikings had a chance to tie things up late in the fourth, but Kirk Cousins threw short on fourth and eight and the Giants hung on.
As befitting as the Giants' first playoff win since 2011, and in response to a Vikings tweet celebrating their wins over the Giants, New York Jets and Buffalo Bills this season by calling themselves "New York's Favorite Team", the Giants' Twitter account went very hard on Minnesota after the game, repurposing their opponents' "Skol Vikings" chant in brutal fashion.

     Vikings HC Kevin O'Connell, QB Kirk Cousins explain fourth-and-8 throw short of sticks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Why was Hockenson running such a short route in that situation and why was he Cousins' read?
I just felt like throwing short of the sticks isn't the end of the world, and it was obviously tight coverage.
O'Connell said that the pocket "may or may have not been collapsed" and that Cousins wanted to give someone a chance to make a play.
…"(Cousins) knew it was fourth down, and he wanted to make sure he put the ball in play.
"The intent as a play-caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where it's short of the sticks to gain," O'Connell said.

     Vikings' Defense Gashed in Season-Ending 31-24 Playoff Loss to Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, naturally, they opened the playoffs with a one-score loss, falling 31-24 to the Giants in the wild card round of the postseason.
A Darius Slayton drop forced the Giants to punt it back to the Vikings, who trailed by a touchdown with three minutes left.
Fair or not, that's all anyone is going to remember from Cousins' first home playoff game with the Vikings.
The Vikings' defense couldn't stop a nosebleed in the first half, and really, all game.
In between Vikings touchdown drives at the start and end of the half, the Giants went on a 17-0 run.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jones' 2022 season has been a revelation, and Sunday was the high-water mark for him.
Jones led the Giants in rushing, scrambling for extra yards when necessary and turning designed runs into positive gains.
Unlike the first meeting, though, New York decided Jefferson wouldn't be the one to beat them a second time around.
Wink Martindale's game plan worked to perfection, keeping the star -- and the rest of Minnesota's offense -- from hurting them, sending the Giants to the Divisional Round.
But for the first time this season, Cousins and the Vikings couldn't win the tight one.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's the one that's going to stick with people.
Still, one imagines the Vikings wish they found more ways to get Jefferson going in Sunday's game.
Even if Cousins didn't want to target a double-covered Jefferson there, how about giving Osborn another chance against single coverage over the middle?
"There was always belief (that we'd win the game)," Cousins said.
Throughout a 13-win regular season, Cousins came up clutch for the Vikings in the big moments time and time again.

     Summary: "But the intent was to continue having a chance to win the football game and push the ball down the field.
Cousins said the missed opportunity on the previous play plagues him even more.
"I felt like, getting man coverage, the ball needed to be a little more out front of K.J.
It was right on him in the sense that the DB was able to break it up, but if the ball's out front, the DB can't do that in man coverage."
O'Connell confirmed that the "primary concept" never intended for a catch five yards short – at least in that situation.

Cheryl Nelson is the loudest and most profane in her section of the bar, cheering every play.
As the clock ran out on this Vikings season, the Nelsons sighed.
She swore, scrolled her Twitter feed to see what her other online Vikings friends were saying, and swore a couple more times for good measure.
The love for the Vikings community doesn't mean she wasn't a little bit upset with the Vikings on Sunday night.
