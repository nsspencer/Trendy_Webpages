    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal, like an ex who feels cheated, must now try to forget about Mykhailo Murdyk.
The 22-year-old has ‚Äúflirted‚Äù with Arsenal about joining them in recent months, but this weekend he reportedly agreed to join their rivals Chelsea.
You don‚Äôt know Arsenal, if you thought they were going to be a hopeless ‚Äúex‚Äù.
The Gunners, as per the Evening Standard, have already set their sights on their new fling, or should we say old flame, Raphinha, and are in contact with his agent Deco over the swoop.
Raphinha moved to Barcelona six months ago, but Rivaldo has revealed that the La Liga giant‚Äôs financial difficulties force them to consider offers for the Brazilian winger.

     Mykhailo Mudryk Transfer: Chelsea Beats Arsenal to Shakhtar Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a shocking turn of events, Chelsea has swooped in for a ‚Ç¨100 million ($108.4 million) deal to sign Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhailo MudrykThe blockbuster move for Chelsea comes after fellow London-based club Arsenal had long been anticipated to be the frontrunner to land Mudryk.
The bid is reportedly comprised of a fixed fee of ‚Ç¨70 million with an additional ‚Ç¨30 million in add-ons, which matches the valuation that the Ukrainian club set for the 22-year-old‚Äôs transfer, per The Athletic..
According to ESPN, the Blues‚Äô latest offer awarded Mudryk a better wage package and a longer contract than the final offer that Arsenal put forth.
Mudryk has impressed this season in the Ukrainian Premier League, tallying seven goals and six assists while helping to power Shakhtar to second in the table.
Chelsea hasn‚Äôt won a Premier League match in three outings thus far in 2023 and has plummeted to 10th in the table through 18 matches.

It did not take the club long to establish that a touch-up or exact replacement was not what they wanted.
They arrived at their answer via an elaborate and meandering wander through the world of art, design and supporter consultation.
The artwork showcases different concepts, different artists and different motifs, and the result aims to be visually striking while also bringing together what Arsenal means.
For a football club to go down the art road in such a large-scale context is extremely ambitious.
