     Summary: Los Giants viajaron a Minnesota y vencieron a los Vikings, 31-24, en la Ronda de Comodines.
Este resultado prepara un tercer enfrentamiento de los Giants contra sus rivales de la NFC Este, Philadelphia Eagles, en el Lincoln Financial Field en la Ronda Divisional del próximo fin de semana.
Detrás de una actuación dominante del quarterback Daniel Jones, los Giants ganaron un juego de playoffs desde su triunfo en el Super Bowl XLVI sobre los New England Patriots tras la temporada del 2011.
Consideren esto una obra maestra de los Giants ya que esta unidad parece haber entrado en ritmo en el momento adecuado.
Daniel Jones llevó a los New York Giants a su primer triunfo en los playoffs desde el 2011.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:17)MINNEAPOLIS -- In his first career playoff game, Daniel Jones made history.
Jones became the first quarterback in NFL history to have 300 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and at least 70 rushing yards in a playoff game.
"Played good," coach Brian Daboll said nonchalantly after winning his first playoff game as a head coach.
He called Manning late last week for advice on what a playoff game would be like.
The Giants didn't do it often in the previous meeting, when Jones had only four carries.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jones' 2022 season has been a revelation, and Sunday was the high-water mark for him.
Jones led the Giants in rushing, scrambling for extra yards when necessary and turning designed runs into positive gains.
Unlike the first meeting, though, New York decided Jefferson wouldn't be the one to beat them a second time around.
Wink Martindale's game plan worked to perfection, keeping the star -- and the rest of Minnesota's offense -- from hurting them, sending the Giants to the Divisional Round.
But for the first time this season, Cousins and the Vikings couldn't win the tight one.

     Summary: "When I went to progress, I just felt like I was about to get sacked and felt like, 'I've got to put the ball in play.
I can't go down with a sack,' so I just thought I'd kick it out to T.J.," Cousins said.
O'Connell said he was watching the routes down the field and didn't get a good look at whether the pocket collapsed.
"The intent as a play caller, you're not going to call a primary concept where somebody is short of the sticks to gain, especially on fourth down," O'Connell said.
"If it's third down, and you can catch, convert and make it a fourth-and-2-or-3, that's OK.

     Giants HC Brian Daboll 'proud' of Daniel Jones for record-setting performance in win vs. Vikings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the second half, he joined five other quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era to have 200-plus passing yards, two-plus passing TDs and 70-plus rushing yards in a playoff game, per NFL Research.
By the final whistle, he surpassed his four peers by being the first QB in postseason history to eclipse 300 passing yards along with those accolades.
The Giants needed every bit of the 379 yards Jones accounted for.
That's when Jones responded again with the game-winning, 67-yard touchdown drive, which was only the Giants' fifth-longest possession of the game.
Two plays before Barkley would eventually punch it in for New York, Jones converted a fourth-and-1 from the 7-yard line.
