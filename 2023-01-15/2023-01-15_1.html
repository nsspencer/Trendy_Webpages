     Maybe Arsenal should go back for this Brazilian old flame that’s back on the market?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal, like an ex who feels cheated, must now try to forget about Mykhailo Murdyk.
The 22-year-old has “flirted” with Arsenal about joining them in recent months, but this weekend he reportedly agreed to join their rivals Chelsea.
You don’t know Arsenal, if you thought they were going to be a hopeless “ex”.
The Gunners, as per the Evening Standard, have already set their sights on their new fling, or should we say old flame, Raphinha, and are in contact with his agent Deco over the swoop.
Raphinha moved to Barcelona six months ago, but Rivaldo has revealed that the La Liga giant’s financial difficulties force them to consider offers for the Brazilian winger.

     Piers Morgan slams ‘weak’ Arsenal over Mudryk transfer ‘fiasco’ as Gunners fan rage after being gazumped by Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PIERS MORGAN has revealed his frustrations after Arsenal appeared to be beaten to the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk.
Chelsea look set to confirm the 22-year-old as their latest star name after agreeing a stunning £97million transfer.
But the Blues blasted their rivals out of the water and look set to pay nearly £100m for the Ukrainian winger.
Sun columnist and Arsenal fan Piers has taken aim at his "weak" club over their approach.
These deals come on top of a dizzying summer transfer window which saw Chelsea buy over £270m worth of talent.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Matchday 20 weekend will wrap up with another installment of the North London Derby as Tottenham play host to league leaders Arsenal.
Let’s take a closer look at this derby matchup with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.
Many expected Arsenal to struggle after the break with the absence of Gabriel Jesus, who suffered a knee injury during the World Cup.
The Gunners are 2-1-0 since resuming play, with their most recent result ending in a scoreless draw against third place Newcastle.
Given how Spurs have been struggling over their last few matches, I’m expecting Arsenal to pull out another win in this one.

     Summary: Arsenal are once again chasing the signature of Barcelona winger Raphinha after seeing Mykhaylo Mudryk edge towards Chelsea.
It’s stated that Arsenal are ‘looking for possible alternatives’ to Shakhtar winger Mudryk and whilst no offer has been made for Raphinha, Edu wants him.

Edu wanted to sign Raphinha from Leeds United and the Whites did think that the battle for his signature would come down to Tottenham or Arsenal.

    </h2>

     Summary: ARSENAL will head to Spurs with a point to prove after suffering their darkest day in last season's North London derby.
The Gunners were beaten 3-0 and ultimately went on to throw away a Champions League spot, as Antonio Conte's side sneaked into fourth.
Rivals Spurs have been perennially slow starters, conceding the first goal in ten straight games before their 4-0 win at Crystal Palace last week.
By the same token however, Arsenal will need to be on it from start to finish as Conte's teams are known for providing late fireworks.

     Summary: The Gunners have gone nine years without winning at the home of their north London rivals - are Mikel Arteta's table-toppers about to change that?
There was a time when Arsenal winning at Tottenham felt like an everyday occurrence.
But when the derby is at Tottenham, it’s been white for a long time now.
Tottenham went on to claim fourth spot, with Arsenal having to settle for another season in the Europa League.
“It’s not that I don’t care, but I care a lot more when I’m at home.

     Summary: Arsenal brush off devastating Mykhailo Mudryk snub by opening talks to sign Barcelona forward insteadRaphinha, Ansu Fati Barcelona Credit: AlamyArsenal have reportedly opened talks with the agent of a Barcelona star as they look to quickly brush off the disappointment of Chelsea hijacking their move for Mykhailo Mudryk.
Raphinha has largely been unimpressive since moving to Spain and will be offloaded, alongside the likes of Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres.
“With Ansu Fati that would be even more incomprehensible, since he has been seen as Lionel Messi’s successor for a while.
Arsenal can stretch their lead to eight points at the top of the table with victory at Tottenham on Sunday.
