     Summary: The Ravens, on the other hand, can boast about their run game and hard-nosed defense.
First downs will turn into a priority as the time of possession will most likely dictate the game.
Stopping the run game early and making the Bengals one-dimensional will be the goal here.
Entering this Wild Card matchup, Edwards’ quote really does ring true: the pads will do the talking.
If the Ravens’ season ends this week, many fans may not be surprised.

     Tyler Huntley, Anthony Brown Both Ready for Action vs. Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Playing both Huntley and Brown would allow Baltimore to take advantage of Huntley's running ability, while also using the strong-armed Brown to challenge Cincinnati's secondary.
Huntley was a full participant in Friday's practice and started throwing in practice on Thursday.
However, Huntley has battled tendonitis in his throwing shoulder all season, although he said Friday that he felt close to 100 percent.
For the Bengals, starting right guard Alex Cappa (ankle) was ruled out on Friday, and the Bengals had already lost starting right tackle La'el Collins (knee) for the year.
The Bengals are expected to start Max Scharping at right guard and have replaced Colins with Hakeem Adeniji.

     Bengals' defensive TD fuels wild-card win over Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:51)CINCINNATI -- Without Lamar Jackson, the Baltimore Ravens weren't expected to give the Cincinnati Bengals much of a struggle Sunday night in their wild-card matchup.
A 98-yard touchdown return of Tyler Huntley's fumble at the goal line in the fourth quarter proved decisive.
The two AFC North teams met for the second straight week, and the Bengals beat a short-handed Ravens team to celebrate back-to-back division titles.
It squirted free and defensive end Sam Hubbard scooped it up for a 98-yard fumble return touchdown, which is the longest in NFL postseason history.
Under-the-radar stat that matters: The Ravens are 6-1 all-time on the road in the wild-card round.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much like the second half of their Week 18 meeting, the Bengals encountered a defense that was difficult to solve.
Thanks to some timely and opportunistic defense, the Bengals are moving on.
Baltimore was a yard from taking a lead in a game most expected the Ravens to lose.
The results were immediate: Nine Ravens defenders registered one or more QB pressures Sunday night, negatively affecting a Bengals offense that underperformed.
With 1:17 left in the game, J.K. Dobbins gained 11 yards on a short pass, reaching the Bengals' 17-yard line.

     Bills and Bengals will meet in playoffs after regular season game canceled
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It took 22 seasons for the Cincinnati Bengals to finally end their playoff win drought last year, shocking the world by reaching the Super Bowl after a remarkable run through the AFC playoffs.
The Bills receive the benefit of the neutral site because they could have held onto the one seed with a MNF win.
Cincinnati took an early 9-0 lead following a Huntley interception in the first quarter, but the Bengals allowed the Ravens to come back for a 10-9 halftime lead.
“We’re gonna have our hands full with them, but we’ve been in these moments,” said Burrow on the NBC post-game interview.
Yes, the Bengals were in four big playoff moments a year ago.

     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals are headed to Buffalo to play the Bills in the divisional round, thanks to some bizarre late-game management by the Baltimore Ravens during a 24-17 win on Sunday night.
Joe Mixon averaged 3.5 yards per attempt, struggling to find running lanes behind the Bengals’ beleaguered offensive line.
Story continuesThe Bengals’ offense struggling doesn't mean they're doomed as they get ready for the Bills.
The Ravens match up well against them and the Bengals still have the talent to catch fire in any game they play.
There’s just too much talent on the Bengals’ offensive roster to keep them in check for an entire game.

     Summary: National Football League Bengals hold on to beat Ravens behind historic fumble return 2 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkJust when it looked like backup quarterback Tyler Huntley would give the Ravens an unlikely lead over the Bengals in the fourth quarter, things went starkly in the opposite direction.
Hubbard then went 98 yards for a touchdown, the pivotal play in the Bengals' 24-17 win to eliminate the Ravens on Sunday night.
Given one more shot with 3:14 to play, the Ravens got into Cincinnati territory, with Huntley converting a fourth-and-1 to the Bengals' 33 inside the two-minute warning.
Baltimore responded with a Huntley 41-yard touchdown pass to receiver Demarcus Robinson to tie the game at 17-17.
