     Bills vs Dolphins Game Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the early afternoon game the Buffalo Bills host the Miami Dolphins.
The Dolphins have three wins this season against winning teams, including an early season victory over the Bills.
With Tagovailoa out for this game this looks like an uphill battle for the Dolphins to keep this game close.
While any team can win on any given Sunday, there is little reason to expect a Dolphins team without its starting quarterback will be able to stay with this juggernaut Bills team.
It’s the Bills and the Dolphins in the Wild Card Round on Sunday afternoon.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins both had their fair share of dropped passes in the first half of Sunday's AFC Wild Card, but Buffalo got the most brutal end of these mistakes.
The theme started with the Dolphins, who had both of their star receivers drop passes early on.
Miami running back Jeff Wilson Jr. had his own drop later on, though it was on short check-down pass.
The Bills got a late field goal to take the 20-17 lead, but dropped passes had clearly hurt Buffalo more, especially in the second quarter.

     Summary: The Buffalo Bills will begin what the organization hopes to be a deep postseason run on Sunday when they host the Dolphins on Super Wild Card Weekend.
As they do that, Damar Hamlin will be cheering them on from his home.
He noted that his "heart is with my guys as they compete today" and he'll watch them from home as he continues to focus on his recovery.
Days later, Hamlin awoke and doctors noted he was marking remarkable progress and was neurologically intact.
Of course, Hamlin's remarkable progress and continued support should help propel a Bills team that has aspirations of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy next month in Glendale, Arizona.
