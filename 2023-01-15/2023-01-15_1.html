     Terron Armstead’s final injury update vs. Bills is good news for Skylar Thompson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s obviously not ideal that the Miami Dolphins have been forced to name a seventh-round rookie as their starting quarterback for Sunday’s playoff game against the Buffalo Bills.
At least now there’s a better chance Skylar Thompson will have the pass protection needed to pull off a major upset.
Armstead was named to his fourth Pro Bowl this season after missing out on the honor in 2021.
Thompson started two games during the regular season, going 1-1, and appeared in five others in relief for injured starter Tua Tagovailoa.
Though veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is active on Sunday, he’s backing up Thompson while dealing with a dislocated pinky finger.

     Summary: by Leo Sells | Dolphins Correspondent | Sun, Jan 15th 11:55am ESTSkylar Thompson is set to start in Sunday's Wild-Card matchup against the Buffalo Bills.
(Adam Schefter on Twitter)Fantasy Impact:Thompson will get the start on Sunday with Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) being ruled out and Teddy Bridgewater (knee/finger) being limited to a backup role.
He doesn't project to be a very productive DFS option against a tough Buffalo defense, and him starting is also less than ideal for Miami pass catchers on Sunday.

     Summary: Now, we have three games to dive into on Sunday, and I’m looking to place some prop bets on the action.
Skylar Thompson UNDER 189.5 Passing YardsRookie seventh-round pick Skylar Thompson is getting the start for the Miami Dolphins against the Buffalo Bills on Wild Card Weekend, and I think his passing yards prop is way too inflated in this game.
So, you’re telling me he’s going to clear this in his first playoff game against one of the best teams in the NFL?
Ja’Marr Chase Anytime Touchdown ScorerCincinnati Bengals star Ja’Marr Chase missed time this season with a hip injury, but he hasn’t missed a beat since returning to the lineup.
Chase has scored in three of his last four games, picking up at least seven catches and 60 yards in each of those games.

     Summary: Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa remains in concussion protocol and is out for the team's wild card game against the Buffalo Bills.
If the Dolphins defeat the Bills on Sunday, Tagovailoa could return and see playing time in the playoffs.
According to medical professionals, Tagovailoa will be able to return for next season, or sooner if applicable, per ESPN.
Whether the Dolphins' season continues after Sunday or their offseason begins, the team is satisfied with Tagovailoa's performance this season.
These AFC East teams met twice in the regular season with the series tied at one win each.

     Summary: That does not bode well at all for his participation next week if the Miami Dolphins advance."
Tagovailoa, who was placed in the league's protocol on Dec. 26, missed the Dolphins' final two regular-season games after suffering his second concussion of the 2022 season.
Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel unlocked Tagovailoa's potential in his first season in Miami.
In games Tagovailoa has started and finished this year, the Dolphins own an 8-4 record while averaging 26.4 points per game and have a 25:8 TD-INT ratio.
Without Tagovailoa starting or finishing games, the Dolphins are 1-4 with a 16.0 PPG average and have a 5:7 TD-INT ratio.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the Miami Dolphins offense takes the field for its Wild Card playoff matchup against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, it will be led by an unfamiliar name.
The Miami Dolphins picked him up as a developmental passer behind starter Tua Tagovailoa and veteran backup Teddy Bridgewater.
He did not exactly shine — Thompson went 19-for-33 for 166 yards with one interception — but he still got his first career start the following week.
Thompson returned to the bench the following week, seeing only marginal action over the next few games until a Week 17 game in New England.
As mentioned above, Thompson is now in the starting lineup because of injuries higher up on the depth chart.
