     Rams' Aaron Donald Sparks Retirement Buzz After Temporary Change to Twitter Bio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David Eulitt/Getty ImagesLos Angeles Rams star defensive tackle Aaron Donald gave many a scare on Sunday when he appeared to have hinted that his career is coming to an end with a slight edit to his social media profile.
Donald edited his Twitter bio to "former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99," leaving many to wonder if the 2022 NFL season was his last and retirement is on the horizon.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported in September that the 31-year-old seriously contemplated ending his career last offseason and even submitted a retirement letter to the Rams.
However, the team never sent the letter to the NFL and later negotiated a deal for him to return.
Donald and the Rams had a tumultuous 2022 season in which the defending champions failed to make the playoffs and finished with a 5-12 record.

     Aaron Donald changes Twitter bio to “former NFL D lineman for the Rams,” then changes it back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald has changed his Twitter bio to say “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99.” And then, just as people were noticing it, he changed it back.
Donald was serious about retiring without that contract; he supposedly submitted a retirement letter to the Rams days before inking his new deal.
Regardless, only two days after the sudden Sean McVay resignation drama ended, there’s a second annual Aaron Donald retirement drama.
And maybe that’s the play for Donald.
He said he’s a “former NFL D Lineman for the Rams.” Maybe, this year, he wants to be traded to a team that is in better position to contend in 2023.

     Aaron Donald sends Twitter into uproar with Rams retirement tease
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean McVay is returning to the Los Angeles Rams for the 2023 season, but Aaron Donald just sent Twitter into a frenzy when he seemed to suggest he was retiring.
Right in the middle of the Miami Dolphins-Buffalo Bills Wild Card Round game, people on Twitter noticed that Donald’s verified account said he’s a “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99.”See for yourself:Did Aaron Donald just retire?
Unfortunately for Donald and the Rams, their Super Bowl defense was a total disaster.
While it seems as if this is a false alarm for Aaron Donald and a possible retirement, there will surely be more speculation about his future after what happened this season.
Stay tuned to see what happens with the Rams star, who’s a future Hall of Famer no matter what happens.

     Is Aaron Donald retiring? Rams star causes confusion after briefly changing Twitter bio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald confused NFL fans on Sunday with an edit to his Twitter bio, which briefly described him as a "former" lineman for the Rams.
The edit suggested Donald, a future Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the most dominant defensive players in the league's history, had hung up the cleats for good.
He later reworked his contract, netting him a $40 million raise through the 2024 season with the Rams.
He was the 2014 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, a seven-time first-team All-Pro selection and three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, 2018 and 2020.
His Twitter bio, for now, has only been a source of confusion in regard to that question.

     Rams’ Aaron Donald Stuns NFL World With Apparent Reference to Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald shocked the NFL world for a few minutes on Sunday with an apparent mixup in his Twitter bio.
Fans noticed that the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year’s Twitter bio briefly said “former NFL D Linemen for the Rams #99” on Sunday.
This all comes on the heels of Donald contemplating retirement after the 2021 season.
France then pivoted to working toward a pay raise for the defensive tackle.
Donald missed the last six games of the 2022 season after suffering a high ankle sprain in Week 12.

     Has Rams DL Aaron Donald Quietly Retired From NFL?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What in the world is going on with Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald?
Did Aaron Donald just quietly retire from the NFL and the Los Angeles Rams?
Last season, Donald recorded 49 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, 11 quarterback hits, and five sacks, nearly half of his production of 2021, when he had 84 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 19 tackles for loss and 26 quarterback hits.
But make no mistake, losing arguably the NFL's best defensive player in Donald would undoubtedly make that re-tooling project a much, much heftier task.
