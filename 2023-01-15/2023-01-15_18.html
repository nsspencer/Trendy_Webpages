     Summary: Getty / Dia DipasupilHulu’s miniseries “Pam &amp; Tommy” earned Lily James an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe nomination, but the real Pamela Anderson has no interest in watching the actor’s performance.
According to Anderson, James sent her a handwritten letter to let her know she wanted to honor her in “Pam &amp; Tommy.” But the 55-year-old opted not to read it.
“It was already hurtful enough the first time,” Anderson said of having her private home video stolen and sold.
In addition to releasing a new memoir, “Love, Pamela,” on Jan. 31, the activist and former model also participated in a Netflix documentary about her life, “Pamela, a Love Story,” which will premiere on the same day her book is released.
“It’s such a confusing, big conversation,” James told Gold Derby of playing a person who is still alive in a July 2022 interview.
