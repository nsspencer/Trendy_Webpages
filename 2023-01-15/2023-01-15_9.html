     Summary: Here‚Äôs a sentence that I never thought I‚Äôd type: The Last of Us airs its first episode tonight on HBO and HBO Max.
I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to the team at Naughty Dog, HBO, Sony Pictures Entertainment, PlayStation Productions, and of course the cast and crew members that helped get us to this historic moment.
From myself and everybody at Naughty Dog, thank you!
The HBO show follows the broad beats of the overall story from the game, and is quite faithful in tone and spirit.
But rest assured, The Last of Us stays true to the soul of the games.

     Summary: Everything is captured with excruciating detail, including Joel, played now by Pedro Pascal.
But in The Last of Us TV show, Joel isn‚Äôt quite the man he was ‚Äî and that‚Äôs by design.
Dispelling that means showing all the damage a guy like Joel had taken on, physically and emotionally, after Sarah died.
Pascal‚Äôs Joel isn‚Äôt sneaking around the same way Joel does in the game.
With a long, arduous journey ahead of him, the Joel on TV has a different path to walk than his character.

     Summary: The infected, who slowly hybridize with the parasites to become more impervious, may well be ineradicable as a species.
Neil Druckmann, who wrote and co-directed the award-winning third-person shooter, created the TV series with Mazin.
(Provocatively, a late sequence structured like a conventional shooter game makes us reconsider the morality of the gunman.)
With Ellie, Joel is offered a path toward redemption, as well as a chance to become more than the sum of his gruff heroics.
When Joel and Ellie pack provisions from a rare well-stocked home, she makes sure to prioritize toilet paper‚Äîa big improvement from the pages of old magazines.

     Summary: Of course, The Last of Us is based on a video game, which may lead to a question many may ask themselves.
Do I need to have played this game to appreciate or understand this show?
The result is an almost resounding ‚Äúno,‚Äù because The Last of Us, and its HBO series, are a pretty unique case in the medium of video game adaptations.
The Last of Us on HBO is a direct adaptation of the game, the same storyline, the same sequences, even the same script, in many parts.
That‚Äôs also true of bad video game adaptations we‚Äôve seen like Doom, Assassin‚Äôs Creed, Netflix‚Äôs Resident Evil show, Paramount‚Äôs Halo show.

     Summary: Baker and Johnson were also given different, but important, parts to make their own.
'The Last of Us' Boss Teases Tory Baker and Ashley Johnson's Roles in HBO ShowFor Druckmann, who is co-creator, writer and executive producer on the HBO show, it was essential to find a significant part for Baker and Johnson to play, because it would have been a shame not to give them something more substantial than just a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo.
"And, immediately, we both had this thought separately, and we contacted each other like, 'it has to be Ashley Johnson.'
There's no other person that could play Ellie's mom except for Ashley Johnson."
ET on HBO, and it will be available to stream on HBO Max.

     'Last of Us' preview: Why it could live up to the hype
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù had concluded its third season, ‚ÄúWorld War Z‚Äù was expected to be a summer blockbuster and ‚ÄúResident Evil‚Äù was still perhaps the best-known zombie-starring video game.
‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù is now widely recognized as one of the best video games of all time.
Ten years after its release, the team behind the game is attempting to make a TV version the best video game adaptation of all time, too.
The bar for video game adaptations is fairly low, given the abundance of disappointments and duds made in the past.
The game, originally a PlayStation 3 exclusive, won near-unanimous acclaim when it debuted in 2013, with early reviews calling it the best game of the year and, potentially, one of the greatest of all time.

     How ‚ÄòThe Last of Us‚Äô changed gaming, strained relationships and spawned an empire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The game went on to sell about 20 million copies for Sony‚Äôs PlayStation consoles and spawned both a limited-run comic and a hit sequel.
‚ÄúYou almost never showed a kid dying in a video game,‚Äù Druckmann says when asked about the game‚Äôs difficult opening moments.
Long before pitching it to Sony-owned development studio Naughty Dog, at the time known best for its ‚ÄúIndiana Jones"-inspired ‚ÄúUncharted‚Äù series, Druckmann had tried to spin the story into a comic.
At the time of its release, no major big-budget action game had been as patient.
‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt real enough about the level of anxiety and tension that all of the characters would have had in that world,‚Äù Straley says.
