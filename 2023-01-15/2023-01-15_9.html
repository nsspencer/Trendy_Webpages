     Summary: Brad Gilbert and Caroline Wozniacki react to Nick Kyrgios pulling out of the Australian Open with a knee injury.
(1:30)MELBOURNE, Australia -- Nick Kyrgios was forced Monday to withdraw from the Australian Open, just 24 hours ahead of his scheduled first-round match against Roman Safiullin, because of a knee injury.
Kyrgios had faced nine-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in a charity match Friday evening at Melbourne Park.

Kyrgios was coming off a career-best year in which he won the Australian Open doubles title alongside compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis before reaching the Wimbledon final, which he ultimately lost to Djokovic.

     Summary: Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios revealed he had suffered a torn meniscus and decided to withdraw after a hitting practice session with doubles partner Thanisi Kokkinakis.
"Obviously, I'm extremely disappointed, this is one of the most important tournaments of my career, it hasn't been easy at all," Kyrgios told reporters at Melbourne Park.
With Kyrgios gone and Ash Barty retired, the chances of a another home champion for local fans are greatly diminished.
There were loud cheers from the Margaret Court Arena crowd when Cristian held serve in the second set to avoid the dreaded 'double bagel'.

     Nick Kyrgios out of Australian Open, will have knee surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australia's Nick Kyrgios, left, and Serbia's Novak Djokovic shake hands following an exhibition match on Rod Laver Arena ahead of the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne, Australia, Friday, Jan. 13, 2023.
(AP Photo/Mark Baker) APA “devastated” Nick Kyrgios pulled out of the Australian Open on Monday — the day before he was scheduled to play his first-round singles match — because of an injured left knee that needs arthroscopic surgery.
Kyrgios, a 27-year-old from Australia, was the runner-up to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year in singles and teamed with good friend Thanasi Kokkinakis to claim the men's doubles championship at the 2022 Australian Open.
The Australian Open was supposed to mark Kyrgios' official season debut after he withdrew from tuneup play earlier in January.
Maher said that an MRI exam after Kyrgios felt discomfort in his knee revealed a cyst and a small tear in the lateral meniscus ligament.
