     Summary: Coco Gauff advances to the 2nd round of the Australian Open (0:35)MELBOURNE, Australia -- Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff made strong starts to their quests for a first Grand Slam singles title as they reached the second round of the Australian Open on Monday.
Third-seeded Pegula overwhelmed Jaqueline Cristian of Romania 6-0, 6-1, while seventh-seeded Gauff overcame a second-set wobble to beat Katerina Siniakova 6-1, 6-4.
A quarterfinalist in Melbourne in each of the past two years, Pegula needed just 59 minutes to get past the 161st-ranked Cristian, who was appearing in her third Grand Slam event.
The Czech player led 4-2 in the second set, but Gauff rallied and clinched victory on her seventh match point.
"I was not expecting to open the tournament on Rod Laver," Gauff said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: View Schedule | View Singles DrawDefending champion and top seed Nadal arrives at Melbourne Park in a relative slump by his own lofty standards.
The Spaniard has lost six of his past seven matches and faces a difficult proposition first up in Melbourne in fast-rising Briton Jack Draper.
“[It is] probably one of the toughest first rounds possible, being seeded,” acknowledged Nadal when asked about the Draper clash.
Although they have never faced off in a tour-level match, Halys defeated the Greek in an ITF Futures match in 2014 and an ATP Challenger Tour match in 2018.
He takes on Alex Molcan in his first Australian Open match since 2021 after missing last year due to injury.

Fernandez: Djokovic is the favorite and one to beat, His nine Australian Open titles give him a tremendous amount of confidence.
Djokovic will likely advance and go on to win a 10th Australian Open title.
