Brady is also 22-7-2 ATS (76%) lifetime as an underdog of three or less, including a perfect 6-0 SU since 2014.
The spread may say Tampa Bay is an underdog, but I have to back Brady and the Bucs.
With a full game total of 45.5, that should favor more second-half scoring.
Tampa Bay had the highest early down pass frequency in the league, and Brady set an NFL record for pass attempts.
