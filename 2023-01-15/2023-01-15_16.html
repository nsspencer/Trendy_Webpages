     Robert Griffin III Backs Lamar Jackson, Says Knee Injury Changed Career Trajectory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Griffin shared a message of his own knee injury that he said "changed the trajectory of my career" and supported the Baltimore Ravens quarterbacks' decision:Jackson has not played since the Ravens' Dec. 4 win over the Denver Broncos because of a knee injury.
On Thursday, Jackson tweeted that his knee is still "unstable" because of a PCL Grade 2 sprain that is close to a Grade 3-level injury.
For his part, Griffin was the 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year and a Pro Bowler.
However, he suffered the knee injury in a playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks that season and was never a Pro Bowler again for the rest of his career.
It is apparent he wants Jackson, who was the 2019 NFL MVP, to avoid a similar fate.

     Mike Vick Gives Questionable Advice To Injured Lamar Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Vick believes Lamar Jackson should be on the field Sunday night at Paycor Stadium.
Jackson hasn’t practiced, let alone played in a game, since he injured his knee in the Ravens’ Dec. 4 win over the Denver Broncos.
That trend will continue in the wild-card round, as the star quarterback will watch from the sideline as Tyler Huntley and/or Anthony Brown quarterback Baltimore against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Vick, however, believes Jackson should play through the pain now that the stakes are raised.
Further damaging his injured knee could be career- and, quite frankly, life-altering for Jackson, who is set to hit free agency in March.

     Lamar Jackson doesn't travel with Ravens to playoff game vs. Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamar Jackson wasn't on the sideline for Baltimore's playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
The Ravens quarterback all but ruled himself out on Thursday with his lingering knee injury before Baltimore made it official Friday.
His injury didn't preclude the franchise quarterback from joining his team for a playoff game.
Jackson remained sidelined for the rest of the regular season as the Ravens went 2-3 in his absence while fighting for playoff positioning.
Then came Jackson's announcement Thursday that his injured knee remains "unstable," implying that he would miss Sunday's playoff game, which Baltimore lost, 24-17.
