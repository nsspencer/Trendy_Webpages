     Biden: ‘Intimidating’ to speak at MLK’s church
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Specifically, work remains on economic rights, voting rights and protecting American democracy, Biden said Sunday, on what would have been King’s 94th birthday.
King is one of Biden’s two heroes, along with late Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, Biden said.
“We come to contemplate his moral vision and commit ourselves to his path,” the president said of King.
Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) spoke at the service before Biden.
On ABC’s “This Week,” Warnock said Sunday he was “honored” Biden would speak in King’s “spiritual home.”Warnock, himself a senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist, largely focused on bipartisanship rather than allegiance to Biden during the lead-up to last year’s election, in which Warnock eventually earned his first full six-year term in office.

     Summary: Biden becomes the first sitting president to deliver a Sunday sermon at MLK's churchEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski /AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski /AFP via Getty ImagesJoe Biden delivered a sermon on Sunday at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, becoming the first sitting president to do so at the church where Martin Luther King Jr. was a pastor.
Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is the church's current pastor, invited the president to deliver the sermon on what would have been King's 94th birthday.
But the sermon quickly turned political, as Biden discussed economic issues and voting rights.
Prior to the sermon, Biden released a proclamation on Friday, reflecting on the holiday and similarly touching on voting rights and health care.
During his speech, Biden said that "the battle for the soul of this nation" continues today.

     Summary: “I believe Dr King’s life and legacy show us the way and we should pay attention,” Biden said.
Unlike some of his other speeches on the topic, Biden did not mention Donald Trump or Republicans directly.
Since then, there has been no federal action on voting rights.
In advance of Biden’s visit to Atlanta, White House officials said he was committed to advocating for meaningful voting rights action.
King fueled passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965.

     Biden delivers sermon drawing on legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King: ‘This is a time of choosing’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. King’s life and legacy show us the way, and we should pay attention,” Biden said.
The White House has faced increasing criticism for its lack of transparency with the public over the finding of classified material at Biden’s home and his former private office.
At the church, Biden spoke about King’s legacy and a number of issues, including civil and voting rights.
“So often, when people hear about Dr. King, people think his ministry and the movement were most about the epic struggle for civil rights and voting rights.
On Monday, when the nation honors King on his eponymous holiday, Biden will deliver the keynote address during the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Breakfast in Washington, DC, on the invitation of Rev.
