     Jae Crowder, Bucks reportedly get permission from Suns to meet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns have given the Milwaukee Bucks permission to meet with Jae Crowder, who remains a member of the Suns but is seeking a trade elsewhere, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.
Milwaukee is the only team that has reportedly received permission to speak with Crowder, the former Suns starter who has not been with the team this season due to a rift with the franchise.
Also included in Charania’s piece: The Suns apparently have interest in Toronto Raptors forward O.G.
Most likely for the Suns before then is to find something in return for Crowder, who is on an expiring $10.2 million deal.
The Bucks, Miami Heat and Atlanta Hawks have been linked to Crowder as the Suns have remained patient regarding his situation.

     Phoenix Suns need to get Jae Crowder deal done as NBA trade deadline approaches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns forward Jae Crowder hasn’t participated in an NBA game since last postseason.
Trade rumors have floated around all year about Crowder, and Shams Charania recently reported on the leading candidate to land Crowder by the association’s trade deadline of Thursday, Feb 9.
Crowder is a great role player, one of the best in the NBA at what he does.
Anytime you can go 10 players deep that can give you significant minutes on an NBA team, you’re usually looking at a serious contender.
If Crowder is moved by Phoenix, he’d be headed for his eighth team in 10 years in the league.

     Phoenix Suns: Saben Lee 'grateful' as second 10-day expires Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns point guard Saben Lee has provided more than most do on 10-day contracts.
Averaging seven points and shooting 50% from 3 in his 10 games with the Suns, Lee arrived when the team was extremely short-handed, but posted four straight double-figure scoring efforts.
They went 6-4 the 10 games Lee has played, winning six of the last seven.
Now he’s in the rotation as a 10-day contract player.”The Suns have to sign Lee for the remainder of the season to keep him.
Paul has worked with Lee on running the pick-and-roll and provided him “some little tricks” on playing defense, Lee said.

(Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Getty ImagesEver since Jae Crowder and the Phoenix Suns agreed to go their separate ways during training camp, rumors have swirled about the veteran forward eventually landing with the Milwaukee Bucks.
Those rumors only intensified this week when the Suns reportedly granted the Bucks permission to meet with Crowder and his agent to discuss a potential deal ahead of the Feb. 9 trade deadline.
Crowder is earning $9.2 million this season, the last under a three-year, $29 million deal he signed with Phoenix in 2020.
To complete a deal, the Bucks would have to clear enough payroll space to take on the remainder of Crowder’s contract .
