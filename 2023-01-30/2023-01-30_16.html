     MLB The Show '23: Marlins' Jazz Chisholm unveiled as cover athlete for upcoming video game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jazz Chisholm Jr. is the latest baseball star to appear as the cover athlete for the MLB The Show video game franchise.
On Monday, it was announced that Chisholm will be the first player in Miami Marlins history to appear on the cover of the American version of the video game series when MLB The Show '23 is released on March 28.
"As a kid, I always wanted to be on the cover of MLB the Show," Chisholm told the Associated Press on Monday.
Chisholm added that he has actually been an avid fan of the video game franchise since 2006, when Boston Red Sox legend David Ortiz appeared on the cover of the game's very first edition.
Entering his fourth professional season, Chisholm has a career batting average of .243 to go along with 34 home runs, 104 RBIs and 117 runs scored.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jazz Chisholm is Eurostepping his way into video game history.
The Miami Marlins outfielder became the first Bahamian-born athlete to grace the cover of a sports video game with the announcement of MLB The Show 23 on Monday.
While his desire for personal self-expression has rubbed some in baseball the wrong way, Chisholm said he's determined to remain himself regardless of the setting.
"You're gonna get bashed, you're gonna go on Twitter or Instagram and see stuff.
So I'm trying to channel everything from basketball to the Negro Leagues.
