     The 7 Deadly Sins Of Corporate Black History Month Programming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If your organization is like many—scrambling to assemble Black History month (BHM) programming in the days, hours, minutes before the month begins—please consider these all too common yet tragic missteps.
Sin #2 – Expecting free training/speakersAn interesting thing happens when companies seek out experts or thought leaders to speak about Black history.
Sin #4 – Treating Black History Month as isolated, not part of a broader initiativeWhile it’s great to celebrate a heritage month that is recognized in broader society, it’s utterly ridiculous to think that a Black History month movie showing, book discussion, speaker or similar event on its own will ameliorate long standing racial inequities.
“Today, Black History Month programming at most companies is rarely relevant to the experiences of Black staff and clients.
Don’t pour salt in the wound by selectively forgetting to acknowledge Black History month at all.
