     Summary: SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Dollar bonds issued by entities of India's Adani Group rose on Tuesday after a sharp dive in the past few days following a scathing report by a U.S. short seller that triggered a rout in the conglomerate's listed firms.
U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone continued their fall into a second week, with the bond maturing in August 2027 gainingabout 4.3 cents to 78.05 cents, coming off multi-year lows it touched on Monday.
International bonds issued by Adani Green Energy, Adani Economic Zone (APSE.NS), Adani Transmission (ADAI.NS) and Adani Electricity Mumbai also edged higher.

     Adani stocks in focus as flagship entity's share sale enters last day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm, was trading 4% higher at 3,000 rupees, still below the lower end of the share sale's price band of 3,112 rupees.
But other group stocks, including Adani Power (ADAN.NS), Adani Green (ADNA.NS) and Adani Total Gas (ADAG.NS), were down 5%-10%, extending their falls after Adani's 413-page response to Hindenburg's allegations failed to boost investor confidence.
An unsuccessful share sale would be a stunning setback for Adani whose group has in recent days repeatedly said investors were standing by its side and the share offering will go through.
The share sale needs at least 90% subscription to go through.
Hindenburg said in its report it has shorted U.S.-bonds and non-India traded derivatives of the Adani Group.

     Summary: Hindenburg Research is not part of a giant conspiracy to defame Adani, the Indian economy, or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Adani Group shouldn’t be declared guilty on the basis of one report from one research group.
But that report has caused the world to look closely at not just Adani but also the environment within which Adani operates.
Otherwise, Indian companies that intend to raise money from capital inflows into the equity markets will suffer.

     Adani Faces Deadline as Fraud Allegations Spook Investors

     Summary: The same investment group controlled by the emirate's royal family invested nearly $2 billion in Adani companies last year.
Key Takeaways U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research has accused the Indian conglomerate Adani Group of fraud.
Adani companies, controlled by the richest man in Asia, have lost $68 billion in market value over the past week.
Hindeberg has acknowledged concerns over the beneficial ownership of offshore funds investing in Adani companies were previously raised in 2021 by an Indian opposition lawmaker.
Similarly, Hindenburg's report cited criticism of Adani companies' leverage published last year by the unrelated research firm CreditSights, which is owned by Fitch Ratings.
