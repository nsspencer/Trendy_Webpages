     Lisa Loring, Wednesday Addams in ‘The Addams Family,’ Dies at 64
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lisa Loring, whose creepy yet cherubic portrayal of Wednesday Addams in the 1960s television series “The Addams Family” originated a role that has been revived in films and, most recently, a popular Netflix series, died on Saturday in Burbank, Calif. She was 64.
Her death, in a hospital, was confirmed by her daughter Vanessa Callies Dominguez, who said Ms. Loring had been removed from a ventilator after a stroke.
Ms. Loring auditioned for the role of Wednesday when she was 5.
Through those connections, Ms. Loring did some child modeling work before she was offered the role on “The Addams Family” in 1964.
“I got it because of my pout,” Ms. Loring said in an interview with Daytimers, a soap opera magazine, in 1980.
