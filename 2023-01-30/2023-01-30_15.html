     Sixers allow Magic to storm back as winning streak ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia 76ers came into Monday’s matchup against the Orlando Magic as winners of a league-high seven straight games.
Early in the game, the Sixers dominated Orlando thanks to a stifling performance by Philadelphia’s defense which only allowed 17 points in the first quarter.
From there, the Sixers began to unravel, losing the second quarter by three points before falling apart in the third quarter.
Come the fourth quarter; the Sixers would open on a seven-to-one run allowing the Sixers to retake the lead early on.
The Sixers did themselves no favors in this game, turning the ball over 19 total times, five alone in the fourth quarter.

     Summary: The Sixers are setting themselves up for a big stretch run leading into the postseason led by Joel Embiid and James Harden.
The Sixers have been terrific on both ends as the chemistry with this group and the way they play has been established.
Therefore, there need to be good habits built for the Sixers.
“I think playing the right way and being ourselves because we’re talented enough to win games and, fortunately or unfortunately, we’re talented enough to win games and not play the right way,” added Matisse Thybulle.
“So doing it the right way and building the habits for playoffs I think is really the biggest thing for us at this point.”It’s important for the Sixers to be able to build these good habits and get it done in the playoffs.

     Summary: But that was 15 points the Sixers trailed by before outworking the Denver Nuggets Saturday, 126-119.
But the way the Sixers had been going full-service rope-a-dope in recent games is more than a passing fad.
We thought it was going to be an offensive game where we were just going to trade baskets with them.
There is Embiid, Harris, Harden, P.J.
But Daryl Morey’s eye for that kind of player, stemming in large part from Embiid yelling that the Sixers needed Tucker, has been a benefit, too.

     Summary: The Sixers’ seven-game winning streak was snapped when they blew a 21-point lead to the Orlando Magic at home Monday night.
Markelle Fultz had 12 points and 10 assists in his first game back at the Wells Fargo Center, as the Magic won 119-109.
First QuarterIt was surprising to see Markelle Fultz booed as loudly as he was at the start of the game.
Tobias Harris led all scorers with nine points in the opening quarter as the Sixers got out to a 13-point lead.
Four turnovers at the beginning of the quarter made it too easy for the Magic to get into a run.

And, instead of subbing out in the middle of the first quarter, Embiid played the night’s first 10 minutes.
That corresponded with an extended run for the Sixers’ all-bench crew late in the first and early in the second quarter.
Fultz pushed the pace, kept his dribble alive smartly, and found his teammates frequently late in the second quarter.
And, though the Sixers built their lead back up to 18 points early in the third quarter, Banchero and Franz Wagner didn’t lose steam.
