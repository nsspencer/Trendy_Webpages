     Summary: Milltown Groundhog Day event canceled after organizers fail to procure a groundhogThe borough of Milltown will not have a Groundhog Day event this year because officials were unable to get a new groundhog.
Milltown Mel died last year before the big day, causing officials to cancel the 2022 celebration.
But the event will not take place again this year.
“The new groundhog we originally scheduled to have made his debut is currently not allowed to be here according to a state of New Jersey statute.
A Groundhog Day event has not taken place in Millville since 2020.

     Groundhog Day to be without N.J.’s Milltown Mel again due to unexpected snag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just days remaining before Groundhog Day 2023, it appears the tiny New Jersey borough of Milltown has hit a snag — again.
The event organizers vowed to find a replacement for Milltown Mel for this year’s ceremony, and they did.
However, an unspecified state regulation is preventing the new Milltown Mel from taking part in this year’s festivities, according to the event organizers.
So for the second consecutive year, the borough won’t be having a Groundhog Day ceremony.
Lady Edwina, an Essex County groundhog, who last year replaced Essex Ed, will be taking part in a Groundhog Day ceremony Thursday morning, Feb. 2, at the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Groundhog Day, on Feb. 2, is both a timing milestone -- marking six weeks until spring -- and a tale of folklore, which can be dated back to the fifth century, a post from the National Weather Service says.
The earliest known American reference to Groundhog Day, the NWS says, was in a Morgantown, Pennsylvania shopkeeper's journal entry dated Feb. 4, 1841.
"Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas Day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks nap," the entry reads.
"If he sees his shadow, it means there will be 6 more weeks of winter," a description of the event reads.
"This is our re-enactment of the Groundhog Day ceremony that as a weatherman, Bill Murray reported on; over and over again.

The Fort Thomas Forest Conservancy is hosting a short day hike from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 2, in Tower Park.
Participants can check in at Shelter 3 in the park for the self-led hike through the woods looking for groundhog “shadows.”Each shadow along the trail reveals a groundhog fact and those who find all the shadows will receive a price — a craft from Fort Thomas’s own groundhog.
In the event of inclement weather, the event will be held in the Armory in Tower Park starting at 4:30 p.m.Tower Park is located at 900 S Ft Thomas Ave., Fort Thomas.
Organizers ask that everyone be on the trail by 5:30 p.m.

Even if you’re a ‘Groundhog Day’ expert and watched the movie as many times as Phil relived the same day, you may be surprised to learn these little known fun facts.
Instead, the comedic Bill Murray would add ‘Groundhog Day’ to his roster of hit films such as ‘Ghostbusters’.
