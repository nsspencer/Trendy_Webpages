     Summary: SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Dollar bonds issued by entities of India's Adani Group rose on Tuesday after a sharp dive in the past few days following a scathing report by a U.S. short seller that triggered a rout in the conglomerate's listed firms.

International bonds issued by Adani Green Energy, Adani Economic Zone (APSE.NS), Adani Transmission (ADAI.NS) and Adani Electricity Mumbai also edged higher.

     Summary: Hindenburg Research is not part of a giant conspiracy to defame Adani, the Indian economy, or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Adani Group shouldn’t be declared guilty on the basis of one report from one research group.
But that report has caused the world to look closely at not just Adani but also the environment within which Adani operates.
Otherwise, Indian companies that intend to raise money from capital inflows into the equity markets will suffer.

     Campaigners urge bond investors to shun Adani Group on green concerns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - An advocacy group focused on the impact of debt markets on climate change called on Monday for major bond investors to shun India's Adani Group, saying a critical report by a short-seller had undermined confidence in the company's governance.
Billionaire chairman Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, dismissed these as baseless.
Spokespeople for the Adani Group, BlackRock, Allianz and Pimco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Green bonds, used to raise funds for specific projects that are seen to benefit the environment, are one of Adani's sources of financing.
"The interconnected financial nature of the Adani Group makes it clear that buying debt from any subsidiary of Adani, is by extension supporting Adani's mining businesses," Haines said in the letter.

     Adani Faces Deadline as Fraud Allegations Spook Investors

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The same investment group controlled by the emirate's royal family invested nearly $2 billion in Adani companies last year.
Key Takeaways U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research has accused the Indian conglomerate Adani Group of fraud.
Adani companies, controlled by the richest man in Asia, have lost $68 billion in market value over the past week.
Hindeberg has acknowledged concerns over the beneficial ownership of offshore funds investing in Adani companies were previously raised in 2021 by an Indian opposition lawmaker.
Similarly, Hindenburg's report cited criticism of Adani companies' leverage published last year by the unrelated research firm CreditSights, which is owned by Fitch Ratings.
