     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets continued to climb the Eastern Conference standings with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night.
Royce O’Neale got the Nets going early on with three quick buckets and Brooklyn flew out to a double digit lead.

Brooklyn meanwhile are just looking to hang with the top teams in the East as they wait for Kevin Durant to return from injury.
Durant said he has the All-Star game circled as a potential return game, but time will tell if he can return before.
