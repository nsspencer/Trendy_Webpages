     Dangerous ice storm to spread from Texas to the Ohio Valley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareA potentially significant ice storm is underway across the south-central United States and will spread northeast and affect parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys by Monday afternoon.
While some 15 million Americans are under winter storm and ice storm warnings, the hardest hit will be Texas, where up to two-thirds of an inch of ice buildup is likely to bring down power lines and tree limbs over the next 48 hours.
Freezing rain is precipitation that falls as liquid rain but freezes on contact with a surface at or below 32 degrees.
Chain-reaction crashes are very common during freezing rain events (more so than during any other type of weather).
By the evening, that first batch of freezing rain should slide into northern Arkansas, extreme southern Missouri, southwest Kentucky and western Tennessee.
