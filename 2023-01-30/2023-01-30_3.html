    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt has responded to the viral video of him right after his team‚Äôs loss in the AFC title game to the Kansas City Chiefs.
In that video, Pratt was seen walking to the locker room screaming, asking why teammate Joseph Ossai would touch the quarterback on that now-infamous roughing-the-passer penalty that put the Chiefs in field goal range.
On an Instagram video of that moment, Pratt wrote the following in the comment:‚ÄúYep ppl will post anything on social media for likes and views.
So while this might paint Pratt in a bad light, there has never been a negative peep out of the organization about him or the locker room as a whole.
Given that, it was nice to see Pratt respond quickly once the moment got out.
