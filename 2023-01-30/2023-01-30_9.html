     Empire State Building roasted for lighting up in Philadelphia Eagles' colors: "Treacherous, traitorous, and unforgivable"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of New York City's most iconic buildings may have lost some of its status on Sunday night after lighting up in the colors of the New York Giants' biggest rival ‚Äî the Philadelphia Eagles.
pic.twitter.com/RNiwbCIkt7 ‚Äî Empire State Building (@EmpireStateBldg) January 29, 2023But the building's tweet was swiftly met with backlash, with some even labeling the act of symbolic solidarity as "treason."
"For anyone who finds this as treacherous, traitorous, and unforgivable as we do ‚Äì just pretend it's green and white for #NewYorksStrongest," the department tweeted.
But the building's tweet was welcomed, of course, by Pennsylvania, whose Department of General Services tweeted a photoshopped image of the Empire State Building's green glow next to the state's green-lit Capitol Complex.
The backlash didn't go unnoticed by the iconic New York building's social media team.
