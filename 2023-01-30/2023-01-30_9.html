     Campaigners urge bond investors to shun Adani Group on green concerns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - An advocacy group focused on the impact of debt markets on climate change called on Monday for major bond investors to shun India's Adani Group, saying a critical report by a short-seller had undermined confidence in the company's governance.
Billionaire chairman Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, dismissed these as baseless.
Spokespeople for the Adani Group, BlackRock, Allianz and Pimco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Green bonds, used to raise funds for specific projects that are seen to benefit the environment, are one of Adani's sources of financing.
"The interconnected financial nature of the Adani Group makes it clear that buying debt from any subsidiary of Adani, is by extension supporting Adani's mining businesses," Haines said in the letter.

     Summary: [1/2] Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) logo is seen displayed in this illustration taken February 20, 2022.
REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/FilesNEW DELHI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - State-run Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) (LIFI.NS), India's largest insurer, is reviewing Adani Group's response to scathing criticism by a U.S. short-seller and will hold talks with the group's management within days to seek clarifications.
Adani, founded by Asia's richest person, Gautam Adani, says it complies with all local laws and has made the necessary regulatory disclosures.
LIC said in a statement it had invested 364.7 billion rupees ($4.47 billion) in Adani companies, about 1% of its assets under management.
It added that Adani debt securities held by LIC were rated AA and above, which was in compliance with India's investment regulations for life insurance companies.

     Adani Faces Deadline as Fraud Allegations Spook Investors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The same investment group controlled by the emirate's royal family invested nearly $2 billion in Adani companies last year.
Key Takeaways U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research has accused the Indian conglomerate Adani Group of fraud.
Adani companies, controlled by the richest man in Asia, have lost $68 billion in market value over the past week.
Hindeberg has acknowledged concerns over the beneficial ownership of offshore funds investing in Adani companies were previously raised in 2021 by an Indian opposition lawmaker.
Similarly, Hindenburg's report cited criticism of Adani companies' leverage published last year by the unrelated research firm CreditSights, which is owned by Fitch Ratings.
