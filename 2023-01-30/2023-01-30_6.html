     Cincinnati streetcar reached record ridership last year. Take a look üöé
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Downtown streetcar, which transports riders on a 3.6-mile loop between Over-the-Rhine and The Banks, reached an all-time annual ridership record in 2022, according to data provided by the city.
‚ÄúThis new annual record is a gratifying accomplishment,‚Äù Lori Burchett, deputy director of streetcar services for Cincinnati's transportation and engineering department, said in a press statement.
Not only did the Connector reach an all-time annual record last year, it also broke ridership records almost every month.
The single best month for ridership was October, when Blink Cincinnati took place, as 103,700 passengers used the streetcar.
The city took over daily operations of the Connector from the Southwestern Ohio Regional Transit Authority in January 2020.

     A year ago, Cincinnati committed to mostly buying electric vehicles. Turns out it's not that easy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati officials promised to only buy electric vehicles for the city fleet, as long as that option was available.
City Manager Sheryl Long says just this month, Ford canceled the city‚Äôs order for two electric vehicles for the police department.
It's a common tactic for other city needs, like ordering road salt through the Ohio Department of Transportation instead of independently.
The city fleet already has about 30 electric vehicles, more than a hundred hybrids, and more than 500 using alternative fuels like propane or a high ethanol blend.
Two requests for proposals are now active: one to focus on charging needs for the city fleet, and another to look at public charging infrastructure.
