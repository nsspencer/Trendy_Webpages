     Groundhog Day to be without N.J.’s Milltown Mel again due to unexpected snag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just days remaining before Groundhog Day 2023, it appears the tiny New Jersey borough of Milltown has hit a snag — again.
The event organizers vowed to find a replacement for Milltown Mel for this year’s ceremony, and they did.
However, an unspecified state regulation is preventing the new Milltown Mel from taking part in this year’s festivities, according to the event organizers.
So for the second consecutive year, the borough won’t be having a Groundhog Day ceremony.
Lady Edwina, an Essex County groundhog, who last year replaced Essex Ed, will be taking part in a Groundhog Day ceremony Thursday morning, Feb. 2, at the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Groundhog Day, on Feb. 2, is both a timing milestone -- marking six weeks until spring -- and a tale of folklore, which can be dated back to the fifth century, a post from the National Weather Service says.
The earliest known American reference to Groundhog Day, the NWS says, was in a Morgantown, Pennsylvania shopkeeper's journal entry dated Feb. 4, 1841.
"Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas Day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks nap," the entry reads.
"If he sees his shadow, it means there will be 6 more weeks of winter," a description of the event reads.
"This is our re-enactment of the Groundhog Day ceremony that as a weatherman, Bill Murray reported on; over and over again.
