     Summary: Morgan Stanley economists forecast its stock market will be the world’s third largest before the end of 2030.
Adani has dismissed allegations of fraud and stock manipulation levelled by Hindenburg Research.
For those who passively track stock market indexes, the controversy engulfing Adani, briefly the world’s third richest man, may act as a deterrent from an already expensive market.
The newish chair of India’s securities regulator, Madhabi Puri Buch, has already wielded a stick at credit rating agencies to instil better market discipline.
In the meantime, the turmoil is a reminder to investors of the danger of investing blindly in emerging markets.

     Summary: Hindenburg Research is not part of a giant conspiracy to defame Adani, the Indian economy, or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Adani Group shouldn’t be declared guilty on the basis of one report from one research group.
But that report has caused the world to look closely at not just Adani but also the environment within which Adani operates.
Otherwise, Indian companies that intend to raise money from capital inflows into the equity markets will suffer.

     Billionaire Gautam Adani Gets Vote Of Confidence From Abu Dhabi Firm’s $400 Million Investment

     Summary: INDRANIL MUKHERJEE / AFPGautam Adani has won a vote of confidence from a $400 million investment by International Holding Co. (IHC)—an Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate controlled by a key member of the United Arab Emirates’ royal family—into Adani Enterprises.
The U.S.-based short seller has accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud.
This is IHC’s second investment deal with the group after investing $2 billion in April last year across Adani Enterprises and its clean energy companies such as Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.
“Our interest in Adani Group is driven by our confidence and belief in the fundamentals of Adani Enterprises,” Syed Basar Shueb, CEO of IHC, said in a statement.
Adani Enterprises’ follow-on share sale is scheduled to close today, with other Middle East investors including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Mubadala Investment expected to participate, according to a recent Bloomberg News report.

Key Takeaways U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research has accused the Indian conglomerate Adani Group of fraud.
Adani companies, controlled by the richest man in Asia, have lost $68 billion in market value over the past week.
Hindeberg has acknowledged concerns over the beneficial ownership of offshore funds investing in Adani companies were previously raised in 2021 by an Indian opposition lawmaker.
Similarly, Hindenburg's report cited criticism of Adani companies' leverage published last year by the unrelated research firm CreditSights, which is owned by Fitch Ratings.
