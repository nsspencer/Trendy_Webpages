After the first Addams Family ended, Loring appeared in various short-lived shows, including The Pruitts of Southhampton, Fantasy Island and The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., as well as low-budget horror films such as Iced.
Loring semi-retired from acting in the mid-1990s following a friend's suicide and her own drug addictions, according to IMBD.

     Lisa Loring, the Original Wednesday Addams, Dies at 64
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lisa Loring, who at age five originated the onscreen role of Wednesday Addams on TV’s The Addams Family, has died at the age of 64.
After 64 episodes on The Addams Family, nearly all of the original cast (including Loring) would reunite in 1977 for the NBC TV movie Halloween With the New Addams Family.
When Ortega’s performance inspired a viral dance similar to moves Loring had once displayed, the younger actor thanked Loring for her creative influence.
After The Addams Family, Loring secured roles on series such as Phyllis Diller’s sitcom The Pruitts of Southampton, The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., Fantasy Island, and Barnaby Jones.
When The Addams Family aired on ABC, its most obvious competitor was the monster-centered CBS sitcom The Munsters.
