     Could Linda Ronstadt’s ‘Long Long Time’ become the next surprise hit after ‘The Last of Us’ episode?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Linda Ronstadt in the '70s.
It's because her melancholic, Grammy-nominated ballad "Long, Long Time" from 1970 was used to fantastic effect in Sunday night's beautifully haunting third episode of the HBO hit series "The Last of Us."
So, just as "Stranger Things" turned Kate Bush's 1985 song "Running Up That Hill" into a current hit, we can probably expect the same for "Long, Long Time."
The song enjoyed a 220 per-cent boost in streams after the episode, according to the British music site NME.
With viewership of the post-apocalyptic series growing, as Variety recently reported, there's a good chance that "Long Long Time" will do even better.

     Why The Last of Us Picked That Linda Ronstadt Song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Linda Ronstadt’s “Long, Long Time” likely won’t become a TikTok trend like Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)” in Stranger Things, or The Cramps’s “Goo Goo Muck” from Wednesday, HBO’s The Last of Us still knows the power of choosing the right song.
When Bill (Nick Offerman) allows another man, Frank (Murray Bartlett) into his home after three years of isolation, he reveals his loneliness after somberly playing "Long, Long Time" on the piano.
And it can’t be a song that we all know.
'” After texting Seth Rudetsky, a buddy he had who hosts Sirius XM's On Broadway, Mazin “described what I needed and within 30 seconds, it was [incoming text noise] ‘Long, Long Time by Linda Ronstadt,’” he recalled.
“But I was wrong, because there was one person worth saving.” No matter what happens next in The Last of Us, it was an hour of television that will stay with us for a long, long time.

     Linda Ronstadt's Significance in The Last of Us Episode 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third episode of The Last of Us had viewers wiping away tears throughout its hour-plus run.
As Frank is about to leave, he goes over to a piano in Bill’s house and finds the sheet music for the song “Long Long Time” in a “Best of Linda Ronstadt” songbook.
The song marks the beginning of a long, beautiful, and unexpected relationship in the midst of a zombie apocalypse and holds major significance in the episode.
While “Long Long Time,” a track on Ronstadt’s 1970 album Silk Purse, is about a love that never was, Bill only sings the first two verses about loving someone and how time heals wounds.
This is Linda Ronstadt” and “Long Long Time” plays as the two drive west.

     How ‘The Last of Us’ Picked That Heartbreaking Linda Ronstadt Song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Editor’s note: The following contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Episode 3, “Long, Long Time.”]It’s not often that a song is so crucial to a TV episode that it ends up becoming the title, too.
But given how important the Linda Ronstadt song “Long, Long Time” is to the love story of Bill (Nick Offerman) and Frank (Murray Bartlett) in this week’s episode of “The Last of Us,” it’s the title that makes most sense.
An early, pivotal moment in the episode sees Frank and Bill sing the 1970 Linda Ronstadt hit while playing it on an antique piano.
“I described what I needed and within 30 seconds, it was [incoming text noise] ‘Long, Long Time by Linda Ronstadt.’ I kinda remembered that song.
'”The song came from Ronstadt’s sophomore album, “Silk Purse,” and led to her first of nearly 30 eventual Grammy nominations.
