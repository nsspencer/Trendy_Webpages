     Why The Last of Us Picked That Linda Ronstadt Song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Linda Ronstadt’s “Long, Long Time” likely won’t become a TikTok trend like Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)” in Stranger Things, or The Cramps’s “Goo Goo Muck” from Wednesday, HBO’s The Last of Us still knows the power of choosing the right song.
When Bill (Nick Offerman) allows another man, Frank (Murray Bartlett) into his home after three years of isolation, he reveals his loneliness after somberly playing "Long, Long Time" on the piano.
And it can’t be a song that we all know.
'” After texting Seth Rudetsky, a buddy he had who hosts Sirius XM's On Broadway, Mazin “described what I needed and within 30 seconds, it was [incoming text noise] ‘Long, Long Time by Linda Ronstadt,’” he recalled.
“But I was wrong, because there was one person worth saving.” No matter what happens next in The Last of Us, it was an hour of television that will stay with us for a long, long time.

     How ‘The Last of Us’ Picked That Heartbreaking Linda Ronstadt Song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Editor’s note: The following contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Episode 3, “Long, Long Time.”]It’s not often that a song is so crucial to a TV episode that it ends up becoming the title, too.
But given how important the Linda Ronstadt song “Long, Long Time” is to the love story of Bill (Nick Offerman) and Frank (Murray Bartlett) in this week’s episode of “The Last of Us,” it’s the title that makes most sense.
An early, pivotal moment in the episode sees Frank and Bill sing the 1970 Linda Ronstadt hit while playing it on an antique piano.
“I described what I needed and within 30 seconds, it was [incoming text noise] ‘Long, Long Time by Linda Ronstadt.’ I kinda remembered that song.
'”The song came from Ronstadt’s sophomore album, “Silk Purse,” and led to her first of nearly 30 eventual Grammy nominations.

     How this Linda Ronstadt song ended up in HBO’s ‘The Last Of Us’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: People are rediscovering Linda Ronstadt’s music after her Grammy-nominated 1970 ballad “Long Long Time” was featured prominently in episode 3 of HBO’s postapocalyptic series “The Last of Us” on Sunday, Jan. 29.
