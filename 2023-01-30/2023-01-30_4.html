(Getty Images)AUSTIN (KXAN) — Austin Public Health will run its overnight cold weather shelters Monday and Tuesday as a “significant icing threat” rolls through Central Texas early this week.
The city’s cold weather shelters are mainly used by people experiencing homelessness, but they are offered to anyone seeking warm shelter, officials said.
Periods of rain and freezing drizzle are both possible Monday afternoon into the evening, with increased icing threats.
Up to half an inch of ice is possible, which could lead to power outages, downed trees and school delays or cancelations.
