     Paramount to integrate Showtime with Paramount+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 30 (Reuters) - Paramount Global (PARA.O) on Monday said it would integrate Showtime with Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later this year, rebranding the premium tier of its streaming service to “Paramount+ With Showtime.”Later this year, the Showtime streaming service - now available for $10.99 per month - will no longer be available, and instead will be combined into the Paramount+ streaming service.
Paramount Global, like other media companies, is prioritizing its streaming services while also distributing content through pay-TV cable providers.
Paramount Global has relied on Showtime as an edgier complement to the general market Paramount+ brand.
Paramount+ streaming services added 4.6 million subscribers in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, compared to the 4.9 million added in the preceding quarter.
That figure includes subscribers to BET+ and the Noggin children’s app, in addition to Paramount+ and Showtime.
