     Islanders acquire Canucks' captain Bo Horvat in trade for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Räty, 2023 draft pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Islanders GM Lou Lamoriello made a big move on Monday by acquiring proven scorer Bo Horvat.
In exchange for their captain, the Vancouver Canucks are receiving forwards Anthony Beauvillier and Aatu Räty, as well as a protected 2023 first-round draft pick.
Horvat, who was selected ninth overall by the Canucks in the 2013 NHL Draft, was a pending unrestricted free agent.
Leaving the team was not a big surprise, as he and the Canucks could not come to an agreement.
The 27-year-old center has already tied his career high of 31 goals, to go along with 23 assists this season.

     NHL trade rumors: Bo Horvat drawing interest from Bruins, lots of contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins have a strong locker room, so making a move or two at the trade deadline isn't likely to alter their team chemistry in a negative way.
The Bruins are one of many contending teams that have shown interest in Horvat, per Dave Pagnotta of The Fourth Period.
The Bruins' interest in Horvat did not begin during this season, per Daily Faceoff's Frank Seravalli.
The Bruins have been pretty active at the trade deadline since Don Sweeney took over as general manager in the summer of 2015.
Therefore, Sweeney would be smart to be aggressive in looking for roster upgrades ahead of the March 3 trade deadline.

     Summary: Dom Luszczyszyn: It’s not often that we see a lose-lose trade in this league but the Canucks and Islanders may have pulled it off here.
For the Islanders, it’s a move that reeks of desperation for a team that’s farther out from the playoff race than meets the eye.
Team analysis of the Bo Horvat trade from me, @ThomasDrance and @scottcwheeler https://t.co/hIlPnuaIvD — Kevin Kurz (@KKurzNHL) January 31, 2023The Canucks did well to get that first from the Islanders.
Everyone knows the chaos that’s going on with Vancouver, their cap situation, and the fact that negotiations for an extension weren’t going swell.
