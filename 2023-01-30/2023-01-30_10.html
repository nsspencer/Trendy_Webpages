     Islanders acquire Canucks' captain Bo Horvat in trade for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Räty, 2023 draft pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Islanders GM Lou Lamoriello made a big move on Monday by acquiring proven scorer Bo Horvat.
In exchange for their captain, the Vancouver Canucks are receiving forwards Anthony Beauvillier and Aatu Räty, as well as a protected 2023 first-round draft pick.
Horvat, who was selected ninth overall by the Canucks in the 2013 NHL Draft, was a pending unrestricted free agent.
Leaving the team was not a big surprise, as he and the Canucks could not come to an agreement.
The 27-year-old center has already tied his career high of 31 goals, to go along with 23 assists this season.

     NHL trade rumors: Bo Horvat drawing interest from Bruins, lots of contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins have a strong locker room, so making a move or two at the trade deadline isn't likely to alter their team chemistry in a negative way.
The Bruins are one of many contending teams that have shown interest in Horvat, per Dave Pagnotta of The Fourth Period.
The Bruins' interest in Horvat did not begin during this season, per Daily Faceoff's Frank Seravalli.
The Bruins have been pretty active at the trade deadline since Don Sweeney took over as general manager in the summer of 2015.
Therefore, Sweeney would be smart to be aggressive in looking for roster upgrades ahead of the March 3 trade deadline.

     Summary: Bo Horvat understands why the New York Islanders made waves around the hockey world on Monday night to acquire him from the Vancouver Canucks for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty, and a 2023 conditional first-round draft pick.
I think I can add that to this group.
The 27-year-old center has already tied a career-high of 31 goals this season in just 49 games.
Eleven of those have come on the power play, which will be a welcomed addition for an Islanders man-advantage unit that is 3-for-its-last-64 going into the break.
I really like the build of this team and the leadership group and how everything is built here.

     Summary: It became a reality on Monday, with the Canucks trading their captain to the New York Islanders.
The Islanders closed the weekend two points behind the Metropolitan Division foe Pittsburgh Penguins for the final Eastern Conference wild-card spot.
He also gives the Islanders another forward who can be trusted in a number of situations.
Horvat led all Canucks forwards in 5-on-5 ice time and short-handed minutes, and he was second in power-play minutes, according to Natural Stat Trick.
Parting ways with Horvat is also the latest in what has been a challenging season for the Canucks.

     LeBrun: Islanders GM Lou Lamoriello bets big on Bo Horvat — will it pay off?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementOn a call with the media Monday evening, Lamoriello said the Islanders “really haven’t had any discussions yet” with Horvat’s camp, led by veteran agent Pat Morris.
I later asked him how much urgency there was, given the gamble that he’s an unrestricted free agent on July 1.
Having Horvat in your lineup past this season is a big deal in many ways for the Islanders, who sit two points out of a playoff spot as of the time of the trade.
Bo Horvat is off the market, injuries are pilling up and more updates on top deadline targets ⤵️https://t.co/m9rRB0e1HI — The Athletic NHL (@TheAthleticNHL) January 31, 2023That the Islanders ended up with Horvat?
My sense is Lamoriello is sending a message with Monday’s trade: that he absolutely believes his team is playoff caliber.
