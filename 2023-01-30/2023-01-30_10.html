     Summary: Shania Twain was just 22 years old when, in 1987, she lost both her parents in a single, devastating moment.
Shania Twain's parents, Jerry and Sharon Twain.
My whole life history was there, with them, and many of the associations fell along the way, away, after my parents died.
"My younger sister was still living at home and my two younger brothers were still, you know, 13 and 14 years old," she said.
In 1993, six years after her parents' deaths and when her younger siblings were adults, Twain released her first album, which marked the first big step in her hugely successful career.

It was just a real nightmare for him.”Once they found a bed, Twain, 57, said she was placed in isolation and given plasma therapy drugs during a frightening episode.
“It took several days to start building up any antibodies at all, so it was a very dangerous time and very scary,” she said.
