     Islanders acquire Canucks' captain Bo Horvat in trade for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Räty, 2023 draft pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Islanders GM Lou Lamoriello made a big move on Monday by acquiring proven scorer Bo Horvat.
In exchange for their captain, the Vancouver Canucks are receiving forwards Anthony Beauvillier and Aatu Räty, as well as a protected 2023 first-round draft pick.
Horvat, who was selected ninth overall by the Canucks in the 2013 NHL Draft, was a pending unrestricted free agent.
Leaving the team was not a big surprise, as he and the Canucks could not come to an agreement.
The 27-year-old center has already tied his career high of 31 goals, to go along with 23 assists this season.

     NHL trade rumors: Bo Horvat drawing interest from Bruins, lots of contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins have a strong locker room, so making a move or two at the trade deadline isn't likely to alter their team chemistry in a negative way.
The Bruins are one of many contending teams that have shown interest in Horvat, per Dave Pagnotta of The Fourth Period.
The Bruins' interest in Horvat did not begin during this season, per Daily Faceoff's Frank Seravalli.
The Bruins have been pretty active at the trade deadline since Don Sweeney took over as general manager in the summer of 2015.
Therefore, Sweeney would be smart to be aggressive in looking for roster upgrades ahead of the March 3 trade deadline.

     Islanders acquire Bo Horvat from Canucks for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty, 1st-rounder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Islanders have pulled off one of its largest trades in years, acquiring Vancouver Canucks star Bo Horvat for Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty, and a conditional first-round draft pick, the team announced Monday night.
The 27-year-old center will provide the immensely needed promise of an offensive spark for an Islanders team that is starving for consistent offensive production.
However, general manager Lou Lamoriello and his veteran Islanders team that made two consecutive Stanley Cup semifinals three and two years ago understand that their window of contention was rapidly decreasing.
He scored just 12 goals in 75 games last season and has nine with 11 assists so far in 2022-23.
