     Summary: “She was sort of an optimist, kindhearted, repressed, temperamental, fun-loving person,” Ms. Williams once said of her character.
“That was the sadness of those characters to me,” Ms. Williams added.
“I’m what you might call a ‘Valley Girl,’” Ms. Williams wrote in her 2015 memoir, “Shirley, I Jest!
Ms. Williams went on to perform in commercials for deodorant and sunglasses, some of which never aired, she said in an interview with the Television Academy.
Fonzie claimed Laverne for himself, while Shirley was meant for Richie, reuniting Ms. Williams with her “American Graffiti” co-star, Mr. Howard, who had played her boyfriend in that film.

     Summary: Listen Gift Article ShareCindy Williams, an actress best remembered for her long-running TV role as Shirley opposite Penny Marshall’s Laverne on the sitcom “Laverne &amp; Shirley,” died Jan. 25 in Los Angeles.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Early in her career, Ms. Williams had supporting but notable screen roles in George Lucas’s nostalgic comedy-drama “American Graffiti” (1973) and Francis Ford Coppola’s paranoia thriller “The Conversation” (1974).
Ms. Williams’ and Marshall’s chant of “schlemiel, schlimazel” as they skipped together became a cultural phenomenon and oft-invoked piece of nostalgia.
In 1982, Ms. Williams became pregnant and wanted her working hours curtailed.
Ms. Williams had two children, but a complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

     Summary: “We sort of had telepathy,” Williams told the TV Academy Foundation in 2013.
None of it would compare to her time on Laverne &amp; Shirley, however.
“Penny said yes and I said yes and we went and did it,” Williams told the Los Angeles Times in 1995.
They settled out of court, and Williams was written out of the series, leaving Penny Marshall’s Laverne a solo act for the show’s final 20 episodes.
In a statement, the Walk of Fame invited fans to place flowers on Williams’ star on Tuesday, according to CBS News.
