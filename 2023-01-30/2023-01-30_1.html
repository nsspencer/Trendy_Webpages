     Summary: Blackhawks Hall of Famer Bobby Hull has reportedly passed away at the age of 84.
And Bobby scored another 303 in another league during the second half of his prime.
Indeed, some owners didn’t want any NHL players to participate but Blackhawks ownership led the charge to keep NHL players involved in that historic event.
One of the first things Rocky Wirtz did when he assumed leadership with the Blackhawks organization was bringing Bobby Hull back into the fold.
On behalf of the entire Wirtz family, I offer our deepest condolences on the loss of Bobby Hull, the Golden Jet.
