     ‘The Last Of Us’ Causes Linda Ronstadt’s ‘Long, Long Time’ To Surge In Streams On Spotify
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us aired a pivotal episode and caused Linda Ronstadt’s “Long, Long Time” hit song to surge in streams on Spotify.
The real version would then get played at the end of the episode with Ronstadt’s voice in full glory.
“On Sunday, January 29th, between 11PM and midnight ET, there was more than 4900% increase in U.S. streams of “Long Long Time” by Linda Ronstadt,” read a tweet from the streamer.
The longevity of Ronstadt’s song resurgence is yet to be seen but bringing the song back into a new generation is a great feat.
“Long, Long Time,” which was written by Gary White, was released in 1970 as a single off of Ronstadt’s Silk Purse album.

     Why The Last of Us Picked That Linda Ronstadt Song
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Linda Ronstadt’s “Long, Long Time” likely won’t become a TikTok trend like Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)” in Stranger Things, or The Cramps’s “Goo Goo Muck” from Wednesday, HBO’s The Last of Us still knows the power of choosing the right song.
When Bill (Nick Offerman) allows another man, Frank (Murray Bartlett) into his home after three years of isolation, he reveals his loneliness after somberly playing "Long, Long Time" on the piano.
And it can’t be a song that we all know.
'” After texting Seth Rudetsky, a buddy he had who hosts Sirius XM's On Broadway, Mazin “described what I needed and within 30 seconds, it was [incoming text noise] ‘Long, Long Time by Linda Ronstadt,’” he recalled.
“But I was wrong, because there was one person worth saving.” No matter what happens next in The Last of Us, it was an hour of television that will stay with us for a long, long time.

     Linda Ronstadt's Significance in The Last of Us Episode 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third episode of The Last of Us had viewers wiping away tears throughout its hour-plus run.
As Frank is about to leave, he goes over to a piano in Bill’s house and finds the sheet music for the song “Long Long Time” in a “Best of Linda Ronstadt” songbook.
The song marks the beginning of a long, beautiful, and unexpected relationship in the midst of a zombie apocalypse and holds major significance in the episode.
While “Long Long Time,” a track on Ronstadt’s 1970 album Silk Purse, is about a love that never was, Bill only sings the first two verses about loving someone and how time heals wounds.
This is Linda Ronstadt” and “Long Long Time” plays as the two drive west.

     It's been a "Long, Long Time" for Linda Ronstadt, whose hit song transforms "The Last of Us"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Long, Long Time" was a song Ronstadt allegedly had to persuade her record company to include.
(Ed Perlstein/Redferns/Getty Images)The lyrics of "Long, Long Time" paint the picture of a love that didn't work out but will forever burn in the singer's heart: "And I think I'm gonna love you for a long, long time."
The single of "Long, Long Time" stayed on the Billboard's Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks, though it never reached the top spot.
It was also responsible for Ronstadt's first Grammy nomination; in 1971 she was nominated for Best Contemporary Female Vocal Performance for "Long, Long Time."
Mazin sought the help of a friend, Sirius XM host Seth Rudetsky, whose first and only suggestion was "Long, Long Time."
