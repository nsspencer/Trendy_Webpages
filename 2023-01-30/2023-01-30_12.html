     Black History Month 2023: Learn, Enjoy and Take Action
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ​Black History Month is a time to recognize achievements, reflect on history and come together.
​Every February, Americans celebrate Black history with in-person and online events and in ways that range from educating themselves about current events to shopping at Black-owned businesses and taking action on important issues.
That’s reflected in the 2023 theme for the month — Black Resistance — chosen by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH).
In 1976, President Gerald Ford officially recognized February as Black History Month.
​​While Black History Month is an important marker, Adams says, reflecting on accomplishments and pushing for equality should extend beyond February.
