     Groundhog Day to be without N.J.’s Milltown Mel again due to unexpected snag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just days remaining before Groundhog Day 2023, it appears the tiny New Jersey borough of Milltown has hit a snag — again.
The event organizers vowed to find a replacement for Milltown Mel for this year’s ceremony, and they did.
However, an unspecified state regulation is preventing the new Milltown Mel from taking part in this year’s festivities, according to the event organizers.
So for the second consecutive year, the borough won’t be having a Groundhog Day ceremony.
Lady Edwina, an Essex County groundhog, who last year replaced Essex Ed, will be taking part in a Groundhog Day ceremony Thursday morning, Feb. 2, at the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange.

In the event of inclement weather, the event will be held in the Armory in Tower Park starting at 4:30 p.m.Tower Park is located at 900 S Ft Thomas Ave., Fort Thomas.
