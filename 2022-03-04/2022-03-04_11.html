     Vince McMahon Recalls Promoters Putting A "Hit" Out On Him In The 80s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon joined The Pat McAfee Show yesterday for a rare, hour-long interview.
Among the many stories Vince McMahon relayed was how many times he had received death threats over the years.
In particular, he claimed to have heard a story from Jim Ross that several of his competitors in the 80s, including Cowboy Bill Watts and other NWA promoters, talked up ideas to threaten him.
McMahon claimed Ross covertly hid in a bathroom stall, hearing all about how these other promoters were plotting against him.
He’s thinking, he doesn’t give a sh-t about Vince McMahon.

Vince McMahon has explained and defended WWE’s decision to release close to 200 wrestlers over the last two years.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, WWE has released well over 200 wrestlers and behind-the-scenes staff.
Now, in a rare interview with Pat McAfee, Vince McMahon has explained why so many wrestlers were let go.
McMahon told the former NFL star that the decisions he makes on who cuts released are not personal, but are purely based on what’s best for business.

     Vince McMahon Admits He Expected More From His Family Members
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Throughout WWE's history, Vince McMahon's family have been heavily involved in the running of the company.
Vince's wife Linda McMahon previously served as the company's CEO, while daughter Stephanie previously worked on WWE creative and is currently the promotion's Chief Brand Officer.
The question of who will succeed Vince McMahon as CEO of WWE remains unanswered despite the WWE Chairman now being 76-years-old but Pat McAfee did press McMahon on the issue during their interview on Thursday.
Vince revealed he ultimately does not think about it before he admitted he expected more from his family members.
And quite frankly, I've probably expected more, you know out of my family members, which is probably not the right thing to say.

     Vince McMahon Discusses His Mindset Behind Releasing Stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vince McMahon says it’s nothing personal when he has to release talent from their contracts; it’s simply business.
WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has proven himself to be a master at turning his wrestling company into an international corporation, and he recently spoke about some of his business strategies.
‘Yeah, maybe I really felt that way, maybe I didn’t, but it doesn’t matter.’ What’s the best thing for business.
When you’re a public company, you go, ‘stockholders.’ It is the business end.
That’s part of the job.”Elsewhere in the interview, Vince McMahon spoke about the time Jim Ross was in a men’s room and overheard a plot to kill the WWE Chairman as he was encroaching on other promoters’ territories.

     WWE chairman Vince McMahon has revealed rival promoters wanted to put a hit on him after 'invading their turf' early in his career.
McMahon chose to take WWE national and poached top stars from each territory - something that angered senior promoters.
"'This guy knows this guy, I know a guy who can do this, this guy [carried out a hit], it was really impressive.'
