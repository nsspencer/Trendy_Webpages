     'Pieces of Her' assembles a Netflix mystery around Toni Collette's mom with a past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "Pieces of Her" assembles another one of those small-boned thrillers that Netflix serves up in abundance, teasing out a fairly disposable mystery just good enough to get you to the end.
Then, in one sudden flash, a disturbed young man starts shooting up the diner where they're having lunch.
Laura leaps into action to save her child, revealing a side of her mom that takes Andy aback.
Directed by Minkie Spiro, "Pieces of Her" cuts back and forth between Laura's younger days and the present, unearthing shadowy figures as Andy begins peeling back the various layers.
That includes the younger Laura's messed-up family situation, her domineering father (Terry O'Quinn), and an earlier mother-daughter dynamic that might help explain their prickly relationship now.

     Pieces of Her review – Toni Collette is a mum with a murderous past in this fun spy saga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Such is the tasty question posed by Pieces of Her, a new Netflix thriller based on the 2018 Karin Slaughter bestseller.
The Grant County and Will Trent series are in development but have not yet seen the light of day.
Pieces of Her opens with depressed low-achiever Andy (Bella Heathcote) celebrating – though that’s not really the word – her 31st birthday with her concerned mother Laura (Toni Collette) at a local diner.
Laura saves herself and bundles Andy out of the house with a burner phone and instructions on how to get to safety.
She’s not to come home until and unless she hears Laura’s own voice on that very phone, saying it’s OK. Capisce?

     Review: Netflix thriller ‘Pieces of Her’ never adds up, despite a terrific Toni Collette
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The most shocking thing about "Pieces of Her" isn't its nail-biting first episode.
Adapted from Karin Slaughter's 2018 novel, Netflix's new thriller (now streaming; ★ ½ out of four) is the latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Now recovered from breast cancer, Laura urges Andy to go back to school and pursue her passions.
Despite a capable leading turn by Heathcote ("Relic"), "Pieces" also suffers whenever Collette isn't on screen.
Unfortunately, creator Charlotte Stoudt ("Homeland") merely pricks those sharper edges, leaving us a grab bag of set pieces that never come together.

     Pieces Of Her review: Toni Collette elevates no-frills thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The media attention draws shady figures from Laura’s past into their quiet suburban life, forcing Andy to go on the run with extremely specific instructions from her mother.
Laura and Andy’s tumultuous bond and respective emotional journeys ground the convoluted premise and back-and-forth between timelines.
AdvertisementAndy’s adventures as she looks into Laura’s life before Belle Isle become the show’s other enticing factor.
Pieces Of Her spends a lot of time building up to the obvious final reveal, but the payoff doesn’t remotely live up to expectations.
Despite its foreseeable conclusion, Pieces Of Her is still a pleasant thriller, especially due to Collette and Heathcote’s work.

     ‘Pieces of Her’ Review: Even a Pissed-Off Toni Collette Can’t Salvage a Silly Netflix Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     David Cronenbeg’s 2005 film “A History of Violence” entwines itself around a nasty little premise.
His wife, Edie (Maria Bello), wonders why — until a gangster (Ed Harris) comes calling, alleging that Tom isn’t Tom at all, but a hitman named Joey Cusack who disappeared years ago under suspicious circumstances.
Her husband’s once serene identity is streaked in danger; a danger that only grows as his past comes to light.
As far as 30th birthdays go, Andy’s isn’t ideal.
Having left her life in the Big Apple to help her mother Laura (Toni Collette) through chemotherapy, Andy (Bella Heathcote) is living in the guest house and working as a 9-1-1 operator.

     Column: Netflix’s new thriller ‘Pieces of Her’ is puzzle you might not want to solve
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For lovers of TV thrillers, the list of possible murder suspects is long, if somewhat predictable.
For makers of TV thrillers, however, the show-killer list is short, but also predictable.
The latest victim of the Too Many Episodes Killer is “Pieces of Her,” a new drama debuting today on Netflix.
Maybe the thriller and the TV series are two pop-culture forces that should never meet, for fear that mutual destruction will ensue.
Having watched just five of its eight episodes, I can’t say if “Pieces of Her” comes together in the end or not.

     Netflix’s ‘Pieces of Her’ is a tidy and effective thriller to binge this weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Pieces of Her,” premiering Friday on Netflix and based on the 2018 Karin Slaughter novel of the same name, is a tidy and effective thriller without much to say about the state of anything at all.
As exposition will make clear as they sit in a diner on Andy’s 30th birthday, Laura is concerned that Andy is not concerned enough about Andy and too concerned about Laura, and Andy is concerned that Laura is too concerned with Andy not being concerned enough about Andy and too concerned about Andy being concerned about Laura.
(Jessica Barden does nice work as Laura’s younger self, while resembling Collette not at all.)
At the same time, the series does a fair job of distracting you from such thoughts while events are in play, as on a roller coaster where you are too busy screaming to consider its construction.
Some of the payoffs seem a little too tidy; but they are tidy, at least.
