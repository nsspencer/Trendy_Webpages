    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ohio State’s duo of Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson hit the field for their NFL Combine workouts Thursday night.
Both shine in the 40-yard dash but it was Olave’s unofficial time of 4.26 that had people talking.
After the official times were announced late in the evening, Olave still came in with a sub-4.4 time but it was Wilson who clocked in just a hair faster.
When the official times were announced, Wilson finished with a 4.38 time while Olave was a shade behind at 4.39.
The official adjustment from Olave’s 4.26 time was among the largest changes in times for the day.

     Former Ohio State wide receivers Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson both clocked 40-yard dash times under 4.4 seconds at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.
The official times were 4.38 seconds for Wilson and 4.39 seconds for Olave, making them the seventh and eighth-fastest receivers who ran on Thursday night.
ESPN reported they’re only the second pair of teammates since 2006 to post sub-4.4 second times during the same combine.
In 2019, Parris Campbell ran the 40-yard dash in 4.31 seconds, and Terry McLaurin finished in 4.35 seconds.
Baylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton had the fastest 40-yard dash time this week at 4.28 seconds.

     Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Garrett Wilson (5) celebrates a 51-yard touchdown with wide receiver Chris Olave (2) during the second quarter of the NCAA football game against the Purdue Boilermakers at Ohio Stadium in Columbus on Saturday, Nov. 13, 2021.
Purdue 2The Ohio State football team has been producing really good receivers over the last few years.
Hartline has recruited and developed a number of great guys, including Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson who are both at the NFL Combine.
Olave ran a blazing fast 4.26 unofficial 40-yard dash.
I’m sure more former Ohio State football players will put up silly numbers during this Combine.

     Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave put on a clinic at the NFL Combine.
Would the speedster be a good fit for the Las Vegas Raiders?
Depending on what the Raiders do during NFL free agency, they could surely be looking to draft a wide receiver with the 22nd pick.
Should the Raiders be considering Chris Olave with their first-round pick?
As Adam Hill of the Las Vegas Review-Journal pointed out, Olave might’ve performed his way out of the Raiders’ hands on Thursday.

     WATCH: Chris Olave puts down blazing 40-time at NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That’s because the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine is taking place and there are plenty of Ohio State players showing off for the upcoming 2022 NFL draft.
That, of course, meant that OSU receivers Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson were literally on the clock.
Olave has been known to be a smooth route runner that can take the top off of defenses and we have video of Olave’s blistering 4.39 40-time.
Olave has always gotten credit for his smooth route running and ability to take the top off of defenses, but he never really got the credit for his top-end speed.

     This offseason, a glaring need for the Black and Gold comes at the wide receiver position.
New Orleans has begun their due diligence reviewing a deep receiving class and meeting with Ohio State's wide receiver Chris Olave.
College Football Playoff Ohio State Faces Clemson In Sugar BowlIn 2021, the Buckeyes' 6-1 wideout hauled in 65 receptions for 936 yards and 13 touchdowns.
New Orleans and Mickey Loomis have a long history of drafting players from Ohio State.
If available, Chris Olave would become the New Orleans second-ever 18th overall selection joining another Ohio State Buckeye, the late Will Smith.

     Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson Show Why They’re First-Round Picks With Standout Performances at NFL Scouting Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It took less than 4.4 seconds for Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson to solidify their status as first-round draft picks at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Combining what they did in receiver drills with their 40 times, their draft stocks should have only improved on Thursday night.
Although there were seven other wide receivers who also broke 4.4 in the 40, Wilson and Olave were the fastest of the wide receivers who have been widely projected as first-round picks.
While Wilson beat Olave by just one one-hundredth of a second on the official 40 times, Olave beat Wilson by just one inch in the broad jump, leaping 10-foot-4 to Wilson’s 10-foot-3.
If they weren’t already both locks to be selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft on April 28, they should be now.
