     RT America production company ceases operations amid backlash to Kremlin-funded media

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Posted Friday, March 4, 2022 8:55 amThe production company behind RT America will close up shop and lay off employees, signaling a potential end for the Kremlin-funded media outlet aimed at U.S. audiences.
Misha Solodovnikov, general manager and chief creative officer for T&amp;R Productions, attributed the decision to “cease production” to “unforeseen business interruption events,” according to a memo he sent to employees Thursday that was reviewed by The Washington Post.

     Report: RT America Is Pulling Plug
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     RT America, which has been putting a pro-Russian spin on the news of the day, including the country's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, is shuttering its operations and is laying off most of its staff, according to a memo obtained by CNN.
The memo cited "unforeseen business interruption events" and signaled the shuttering and layoffs would be permanent.
The European Union this extended its sanctions on Russia to RT Russia and Sputnik.
Also: NAB Urges Broadcasters to Drop Russian State-Sponsored ContentThe European council said Wednesday that given Russia's "unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine," RT broadcasts were suspended in the EU ((RT English, RT UK, RT Germany, RT France, and RT Spanish).
The EU said both outlets are under either direct of indirect control of the Russian Federation.

     Russia's RT America To Shut Down After Being Dropped By DirecTV And Roku
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     RT America, the U.S.-based unit of Russia’s state-sponsored RT television network, announced that it is ending operations after being dropped from the channel line-ups on Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and DirecTV, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T).
RT America runs bureaus out of New York, Washington, D.C., Miami and Los Angeles.
Although RT America featured third-party-produced shows starring Dennis Miller, William Shatner and the late Larry King, the channel has been widely regarded in the media industry as a Russian propaganda tool.
In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, efforts have been made across broadcast and online media to restrict the access by Russia’s state-owned media to wider audiences.
The European Union announced it was banning distribution among its member nations of RT and Sputnik, another state-owned Russian media outlet.

     RT America Ceases Production, Lays Off Staff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Several TV operators and tech platforms worldwide have dropped RT or curtailed its reach.
RT America is pulling the plug.
T&amp;R Productions, the company behind the Kremlin-backed network, sent a memo to staff Thursday announcing that it is ceasing production and laying off most of its staff as a result of “unforeseen business interruption events.”Several TV operators and tech platforms worldwide have dropped RT or curtailed its reach since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Holland Cooke, who was a host on the network, wrote in a column for an industry trade publication that some RT employees began bailing from the broadcaster last week.
“We’ve been canceled, by cable/satellite/online distribution platforms.”RT representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

     Russia-backed RT America to cease production, internal memo says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The U.S. arm of Russian state-backed media outlet RT will be effectively shutting down, CNN reported Thursday, citing an internal memo from the production company behind RT America.
The general manager of Washington, D.C.-based production company T&amp;R Productions, Misha Solodovnikov, wrote in a note to employees that it would be ceasing production because of “unforeseen business interruption events,” CNN said.
RT America has been steadily sidelined in the U.S. DirecTV pulled the channel Tuesday, ahead of a contract that was going to expire later this year.
AdvertisementRT America’s YouTube channel, where it has 1.2 million subscribers, remains live.
Doing so did not restrict the channel’s content but meant it had to disclose its funding and label its content.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The definition of “fake” is, of course, left up to the Russian government.
The law prompted urgent meetings inside news outlets on Friday and pushed them to make difficult decisions.
It’s also the culmination of years and years of work from Putin aimed at curbing reporting from Russia.
“The number of independent media voices Russians can read and watch is dropping fast,” CNN’s Anna Cooban wrote.
In a statement, Roskomnadzor cited Facebook’s moves in recent days to impose restrictions on Russia-controlled media outlets.
