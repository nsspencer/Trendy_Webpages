     NBA News: Jordan Officially Joins Sixers, Could See Career Reboot Under Rivers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But a reunion with his old coach, Doc Rivers, in Philadelphia could help him recall his old form.
Jordan was officially picked up by the Philadelphia 76ers after he was cut by the Los Angeles Lakers.
The All-Star center was hardly utilized by the Lakers this season and spent most of the time on the bench.
Jordan officially signed with the Sixers and was welcomed by the Sixers on Friday, Mar.
Jordan is expected to spell top star Joel Embiid who has been having a great NBA season.

Overall, Jordan played 32 games (19 starts) for the Lakers and averaged a career-low 4.1 points and 5.4 rebounds per game.

     Shake Milton, Sixers react to the addition of big man DeAndre Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CAMDEN, N.J. — The Philadelphia 76ers made another move in the buyout market, bringing in 14-year veteran DeAndre Jordan to be the new backup to Joel Embiid.
The Sixers have been looking for someone to replace Andre Drummond, and it looks like Jordan is the guy.
But he is a veteran who can help a team looking to win a championship right now.
“I was talking to Doc about it and he talked to me like ‘It’s gonna be good for you.
I know what he’s gonna do for the team and I’m excited to learn from someone like that.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

     Doc Rivers explains why Sixers brought in DeAndre Jordan as a backup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers made a savvy move in the buyout market by bringing in 14-year veteran DeAndre Jordan on a deal after he was waived by the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Sixers have been in need of some size off their bench and the team brought in Jordan to be the guy.
Jordan is a former All-Star in 2017 and he was named to the All-NBA First Team in 2016.
With that being said, coach Doc Rivers is not yet ready to anoint him as the backup center.
“He also has a history of this past for a guy like Charles,” Rivers added.
