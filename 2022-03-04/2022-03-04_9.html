     Movie Review: Fresh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ninety-one years later, Sebastian Stan echoes Lugosi in “Fresh.” He plays the charming doctor Steve, who quickly seduces lovelorn Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) after a meet-cute in the supermarket.
On their second date, she offers him a bite of the short ribs she’s enjoying.
Fortunately, Noa has a best friend (Jonica T. Gibbs) who’s smart enough to look into the situation.
Edgar-Jones does just fine, though it’s Gibbs that truly distinguishes herself among the cast.
Cave, working from a script by Lauryn Kahn, teases out the suspense; the opening credits don’t roll for a full 33 minutes, as “Fresh” is too busy putting pieces in place to stand on ceremony.

     Fresh review: Hulu’s cannibal horror story skewers the dating game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s more likely is objectification: Dating apps encourage users to reduce each other down to parts.
The indie horror movie Fresh takes that familiar metaphor to a particularly literal extreme.
She tangles the horror and peril of dating gone wrong with the understanding that takes place when it goes right.
Cave takes a light touch with the gore in this film, but she uses it to pointed affect.
In spite of the film’s more artful moments, Steve remains an uncomplicated villain, and Noa a largely uncomplicated victim.

     Review: Horror gets a complete and undoubtedly satisfying reworking in ‘Fresh’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s something about a horror film that takes pride in being a horror film.
With a sharply energetic script from comedy screenwriter Lauryn Kahn, “Fresh” willfully borrows from both comedy and horror in a way that destabilizes the use of each.
As too does its visual style, which is just as playful, amorphous and intentional as its script.
In comparison to a film like “I, Tonya” (coincidentally another Stan vehicle), “Fresh,” despite its consistent boundary-pushing, knows how to use its visual style and tone effectively.
It doesn’t just offer up the most palatable aspects of horror as a genre; instead, it pushes it to its limits through a complete, and undoubtedly satisfying, reworking.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Fresh’ on Hulu, a Horror-Comedy in Which Sebastian Stan Wants to Eat You Alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hulu’s Fresh might confound the writers/characters in the latest Scream movie, since first-time feature director Mimi Cave’s psycho-horror bloodbath is somewhat “elevated” (hooray for feminism!)
Maybe it’s time to whip out the phrase “middlebrow horror” to define such efforts that try to have their human-liver pate and eat it too?
FRESH: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
Granted, the film isn’t always an epicurean endeavor – Cave’s cunning fizzles and fades a little in the third act, giving way to mostly rote violence and contrivances that’ll have you shouting advice at the screen.
But as the opening volley from a filmmaker with wily vision, Fresh is aptly self-descriptive.

     How to Watch ‘Fresh’: Where to Stream the New Comedy Thriller Movie?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After a series of failed dates, Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) meets Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store.
Fed up with app-based dating, Noa takes a leap of faith and goes with the flow.
Whatever way you want to look at this movie — as a lesson, a warning, or an example — Fresh does sound like a twisted comedy that might be a good watch.

The movie had great reviews for storytelling and cast performances and is a must-watch for Sebastian Stan's Stans.

     In it, Daisy Edgar-Jones stars opposite Sebastian Stan in the story of a young woman, Noa, who is increasingly fed up with app-based dating.
Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty ImagesCave also seemed over the moon to be presenting her film in front of a live audience with a buzzy party, red meat and all.
Fresh was meant to have its world premiere in Park City in January as part of this year’s Sundance Film Festival.
Stan campaigned for the role after reading that Edgar-Jones had been cast in the film via a story in Deadline.
It elevated the characters for me.”Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones have a little fun with a prom pose in front of the “Meat Cute” backdrop.
