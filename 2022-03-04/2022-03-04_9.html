    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets‘ struggles at the Barclays Center this season continued on Thursday night, but there’s reason for optimism after superstar Kevin Durant made his long-awaited return from injury and dropped 31 points on the Miami Heat in a close loss.
Playing for the first time since January 15th, Durant was still relatively sharp from the field, shooting 10-of-21 for a shooting percentage of 47.6, just a few points below his season average.
The Nets were unable to take advantage of a short-handed Heat team missing Jimmy Butler, but Miami’s Bam Adebayo had a big night, scoring 30 points on 15 shots.
Tyler Herro had another solid outing off the bench, adding 27.

     Does Kevin Durant Have Enough Help To Keep Brooklyn Nets Afloat?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s been a common sentiment surrounding the Brooklyn Nets throughout the 2021-22 NBA season.
Any team with Kevin Durant has a chance to do some serious damage.

Right now, the Brooklyn Nets are back to .500 following the loss to the Miami Heat and remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
The small ball lineups the Brooklyn Nets could deploy with Ben Simmons alongside near 7-footer Kevin Durant will be tough for teams to guard when there is chemistry established.

     Kevin Durant sends a heartfelt message amid Nets losing stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant shined in his return to the court but couldn't stop the Brooklyn Nets' freefall.
But that's assuming everybody's healthy and cleared to play, which has rarely been the case since they signed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
They're going through quite a negative stretch and would be a play-in team if the season ended today.
Kevin Durant Reacts To The Nets' Never-Ending Struggles“I just expect us to officially get out team together, get everybody healthy and find their rhythm,” Durant said after the game.
There's no denying that the Nets will still be the team to beat in the playoffs, assuming they're healthy.

     Kevin Durant return, Ben Simmons status: Why Nets making the playoffs isn't a certainty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets' playoff hopes received a big boost with the return of Kevin Durant, who suited up against the Miami Heat on Thursday after missing a month of action with an MCL sprain.
The good news for Brooklyn is Durant is good enough to carry the Nets for the home stretch on his own if he hits the ground running.
With that being said, right now, the Nets are closer to missing the playoffs altogether than guaranteeing their spot in the postseason.

     Kevin Durant has 31 points in return, but Heat rally to beat Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant's shot looked good the whole way, one that would have given the Brooklyn Nets the lead with under a minute left.
After their season went sideways when Durant went down, the Nets will need those to start falling — and he believes they will.
Durant had 31 points in his first game since Jan. 15 and his return from a 21-game absence with a sprained left knee ligament inspired the Nets to a 16-point lead.
"Spo tricks us with that zone," said Goran Dragic, the former Heat guard who made his first start for the Nets.
