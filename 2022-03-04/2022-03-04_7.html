     Olathe East High School in Kansas: Suspect in custody after school resource officer and administrator shot and injured, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A Kansas high school principal and school resource officer were shot at Olathe East High School in Kansas Friday, and Olathe Police say a student was the shooter.
The school resource officer returned fire, wounding the suspect, who is expected to survive, according to Olathe Police Department spokesman Sgt.
It was Yeldell's understanding, he said, the suspected shooter attended Olathe East High.
He had no other information on the suspect, he said, adding "We have no students injured at this time other than the suspect."
The Johnson County, Kansas, Sheriff's Office identified the school resource officer as Erik Clark, with seven years of service as an SRO.
