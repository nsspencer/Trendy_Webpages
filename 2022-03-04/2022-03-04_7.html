    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Posted Friday, March 4, 2022 8:55 amThe production company behind RT America will close up shop and lay off employees, signaling a potential end for the Kremlin-funded media outlet aimed at U.S. audiences.
Misha Solodovnikov, general manager and chief creative officer for T&amp;R Productions, attributed the decision to “cease production” to “unforeseen business interruption events,” according to a memo he sent to employees Thursday that was reviewed by The Washington Post.

     Russia Today shuts RT America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The US-arm of the Kremlin-funded Russia Today is to close after what production company T&amp;R Productions described as “a result of unforeseen business interruption events.”In a memo seen by broadcaster CNN, general manager Misha Solodovnikov said it was anticipated the layoffs would be permanent.
The closure of T&amp;R Productions follows the decision by DirecTV to cease carriage of RT America.
A similar decision was taken by streaming service Roku, which also this week suspended Russia Today in Europe.
A number of employees in both the United States and Europe had already resigned from the channel following the Russian invasion of Europe and the editorial stance taken by the channel’s management.
On Tuesday, Russia Today was removed from the vast majority of European networks after an order from the European parliament.

     Report: RT America Is Pulling Plug
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     RT America, which has been putting a pro-Russian spin on the news of the day, including the country's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, is shuttering its operations and is laying off most of its staff, according to a memo obtained by CNN.
The memo cited "unforeseen business interruption events" and signaled the shuttering and layoffs would be permanent.
The European Union this extended its sanctions on Russia to RT Russia and Sputnik.
Also: NAB Urges Broadcasters to Drop Russian State-Sponsored ContentThe European council said Wednesday that given Russia's "unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine," RT broadcasts were suspended in the EU ((RT English, RT UK, RT Germany, RT France, and RT Spanish).
The EU said both outlets are under either direct of indirect control of the Russian Federation.

     RT America Ceases Production, Lays Off Staff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Several TV operators and tech platforms worldwide have dropped RT or curtailed its reach.
RT America is pulling the plug.
T&amp;R Productions, the company behind the Kremlin-backed network, sent a memo to staff Thursday announcing that it is ceasing production and laying off most of its staff as a result of “unforeseen business interruption events.”Several TV operators and tech platforms worldwide have dropped RT or curtailed its reach since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Holland Cooke, who was a host on the network, wrote in a column for an industry trade publication that some RT employees began bailing from the broadcaster last week.
“We’ve been canceled, by cable/satellite/online distribution platforms.”RT representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

     By Oliver Darcy, CNN BusinessRT America will cease productions and lay off most of its staff, according to a memo CNN obtained from T&amp;R Productions, the production company behind the Russian state-funded network.
T&amp;R Productions operated offices in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC.
The news would mean an effective end to RT America.
“The meeting was all of about two minutes,” the attendee said, explaining that Solodovnikov told the assembled staff RT America would be stopping production and that staff would be provided two months pay.
A spokesperson for RT America did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

     Russian state-funded network RT America will halt production and lay off most of its employees.
“Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&amp;R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote.
Several employees from RT’s various networks have also publicly resigned from the outlet.
Solodovnikov reportedly delivered the grim news to several hosts, correspondents, and producers who had gathered in an RT America’s lounge for a meeting.
Other RT America employees have resigned from the network amid Putin’s unprovoked attack.
