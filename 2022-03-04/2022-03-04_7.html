     The Batman's Robert Pattinson Confirms What We All Suspected About Matt Reeves On-Set Behavior
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Asked by Rotten Tomatoes about Matt Reeves' on-set instruction, Robert Pattinson reaffirmed his trust in the director and the rapport they built while filming "The Batman."
It appears, however, that Reeves knew exactly when to call it.
"[He] does a lot of takes, but once you get onto his rhythm, you can kind of feel—because I'm kind of quite intuitive about what I'm doing ...
Every take, I don't really have that much control over it, but then ... when you felt it, Matt always felt it ...
It's now clear, though, that Reeves always knew how to help him understand the role.

     To Let Batman Begin (Again), Matt Reeves Had To Ignore All The Batmen Before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s as if all previous Caped Crusader movies were counterfeit versions of some Batman — not The Batman — and this new entry is here to correct the record.
Directed and co-written by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), The Batman represents the latest attempt by Warner Bros. to turn its best-known DC Comics superhero into a critical and commercial hit.
And The Lego Batman Movie a year later generated just two-thirds the ticket sales of its animated predecessor, The Lego Movie.
(Jonathan Olley &amp; DC Comics / © Warner Bros)Q: When you're dealing with Batman, can you pretend that this is the first Batman movie ever?
When Ben [Affleck] decided that he didn't want to continue being Batman, I realized I could begin with a new Batman, and make him younger.

     The Batman: Matt Reeves made a terrific Dark Knight movie, but we can’t ignore its third act problems
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In his single-minded quest to make a movie that honours Batman’s noir-heavy origins, director Matt Reeves forgot that he needs to be equally respectful of the Caped Crusader’s alter-ego, Bruce Wayne.
In other words, what Reeves shows us is a love story between Catwoman and the Batman, and not one between Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne.
Which brings me to my final point: While The Batman is a solid Dark Knight story, exactly as advertised; as a Bruce Wayne character study, it’s lacking.
Are we meant to simply imprint whatever information we’ve collected over the years about Bruce Wayne onto this movie?
Or are we supposed to wait for Reeves to announce what sets Batman film apart from the rest.

     ‘The Batman’: 7 Movies That Influenced Matt Reeves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Matt Reeves’ The Batman is finally upon us, after years and years of anticipation.
Ever since its moodier-than-usual trailer first premiered, The Batman has felt gloomier, stranger, and certainly more cinematic than your average superhero tentpole.
RELATED: Batman Characters and the Actors Who Played Them in Previous MoviesChinatownReeves and his collaborators have made no bones about the fact that The Batman is a straight-up noir.
Martin Scorsese’s seething masterpiece is the granddaddy of grubby urban alienation movies, which means it only makes sense as a jumping-off point for a re-imagined, far grittier Batman story.

     Matt Reeves Cut Two Iconic DC Heroes Out Of The Batman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In one fell swoop, Matt Reeves established an entirely new DC Universe of characters, one that seems like it’s been up and running for some time now.
But in establishing a new universe, one wondered if there would be references to or cameos from DC characters outside of Batman’s general comic book circle.
According to ScreenRant, originally there were costumes spotted for Superman and Wonder Woman in the background of some behind-the-scenes footage.
It was originally thought we would see Superman and Wonder Woman referenced at the beginning of The Batman which opens on Halloween night.
In all, The Batman didn’t suffer from a lack of other references to the DC Extended Universe.

     'The Batman' Director Matt Reeves Wants to Put You Off-Kilter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jonathan Olley/DCThe Batman hit theaters on Friday, sending Robert Pattinson on a moody adventure as the Dark Knight detective.
The film is directed by Matt Reeves, whose task was to come up with a fresh take on Batman after many previous movies.
It was important to me that when Batman sees the mayor's son in the wake of what happens, that he is really looking at himself.
As a Year Two Batman, he's not as conscious as he should be about what's driving him.
In that story, there's an incident early on where Batman proves his worth and that he's trustworthy to Gordon.
