     January 6 Committee Subpoenas Donald Trump Jr.'s Fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle, TV Star Allegedly 'Played A Key Role In Organizing &amp; Raising Funds For The Event'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One day earlier, the committee alleged in a court filing that Trump conspired to "defraud the United States" by telling the public that he had won the 2022 election, when in fact, he did not.
“Judges and even justices of the United States Supreme Court, are afraid to even look, as was the Attorney General of the United States, who was so petrified of being held in contempt or being impeached by the Democrats, which they were constantly threatening him with, that he was virtually a broken man who allowed for the systemic violation of election laws and other things to take place,” the statement, which was released through Save America PAC on March 3, read.

     A Text Message About January 6 Gets Kimberly Guilfoyle Subpoenaed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kimberly Guilfoyle's refusal to voluntarily comply with the House Select Committee's request is why she later received a subpoena on March 3, 2022.
Prior to Guilfoyle's ill-fated attempt at appearing in front of the Committee back in February (via CNN), text messages in which Guilfoyle allegedly brags about raising money was made public.
The text messages in question was first reported by ProPublica in November 2021.
"[I] raised so much money for this," Guilfoyle's text read.
The Julie who Guilfoyle was referring to was Publix Supermarket heiress, Julie Jenkins Fancelli.

     Jan. 6 Committee Subpoenas Kimberly Guilfoyle After She Allegedly 'Backed Out' of Voluntary Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Guilfoyle, 52, is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, who may have committed crimes, the committee alleged in court documents filed this week.
"Because Ms. Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today's subpoena that will compel her to testify," Rep. Thompson continued.
But he told the AP the committee "sabotaged" Guilfoyle's voluntary interview "by changing the terms to which she agreed and leaking confidential information to the media."
Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. From left: Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle | Credit: Astrid Stawiarz/GettyTacopina also said his client will "testify truthfully to any question," adding, "She has done nothing wrong."
"Thompson acknowledged in his letter that Guilfoyle "professed to want to cooperate" and "produced only 110 pages in response to 14 document requests."

     The Select Committee has evidence that Ms. Guilfoyle was in direct contact with key individuals, raised funds for the rally immediately preceding the violent attack on the United States Capitol, and participated in that event.
The Select Committee is seeking information from her about these and other matters.
Because Ms. Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today’s subpoena that will compel her to testify.
Based on documents and information provided to the Select Committee, Ms. Guilfoyle also has claimed to have been involved in raising funds to pay for the Ellipse rally.
