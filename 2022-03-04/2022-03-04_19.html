     By all accounts, Katie Meyer's life was moving in a positive direction.
Within hours of the conversation, Katie Meyer died by suicide.
If Katie Meyer's parents sensed no detectable signs of distress, how can other families and caregivers monitor their children for suicidal thoughts?
An online search of "suicide warning signs" yields results such as sleeping too little or too much, mood swings and withdrawing from social situations.
Katie Meyer's father, Steven, urged parents to talk to their children — no matter their age — openly about their mental health.
