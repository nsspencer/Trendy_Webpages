     Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson run 40-yard dash in under 4.4 seconds at NFL combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Ohio State wide receivers Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson both clocked 40-yard dash times under 4.4 seconds at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.
The official times were 4.38 seconds for Wilson and 4.39 seconds for Olave, making them the seventh and eighth-fastest receivers who ran on Thursday night.
ESPN reported they’re only the second pair of teammates since 2006 to post sub-4.4 second times during the same combine.
In 2019, Parris Campbell ran the 40-yard dash in 4.31 seconds, and Terry McLaurin finished in 4.35 seconds.
Baylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton had the fastest 40-yard dash time this week at 4.28 seconds.

     Ohio State football: Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson run blazing 40-yard dash times

     Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Garrett Wilson (5) celebrates a 51-yard touchdown with wide receiver Chris Olave (2) during the second quarter of the NCAA football game against the Purdue Boilermakers at Ohio Stadium in Columbus on Saturday, Nov. 13, 2021.
Purdue 2The Ohio State football team has been producing really good receivers over the last few years.
Hartline has recruited and developed a number of great guys, including Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson who are both at the NFL Combine.
Olave ran a blazing fast 4.26 unofficial 40-yard dash.
I’m sure more former Ohio State football players will put up silly numbers during this Combine.

     Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave put on a clinic at the NFL Combine.
Would the speedster be a good fit for the Las Vegas Raiders?
Depending on what the Raiders do during NFL free agency, they could surely be looking to draft a wide receiver with the 22nd pick.
Should the Raiders be considering Chris Olave with their first-round pick?
As Adam Hill of the Las Vegas Review-Journal pointed out, Olave might’ve performed his way out of the Raiders’ hands on Thursday.

     This offseason, a glaring need for the Black and Gold comes at the wide receiver position.
New Orleans has begun their due diligence reviewing a deep receiving class and meeting with Ohio State's wide receiver Chris Olave.
College Football Playoff Ohio State Faces Clemson In Sugar BowlIn 2021, the Buckeyes' 6-1 wideout hauled in 65 receptions for 936 yards and 13 touchdowns.
New Orleans and Mickey Loomis have a long history of drafting players from Ohio State.
If available, Chris Olave would become the New Orleans second-ever 18th overall selection joining another Ohio State Buckeye, the late Will Smith.

     That means that Ohio State receivers Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson were put in front of the cameras for NFL scouts and executives with one of the events being the 40-yard dash.
Ohio State’s Garrett Wilson (4.38) and Chris Olave (4.39) became the 2nd pair of WR teammates since 2006 to run sub-4.4 40 times at the same combine.
What might be of interest to you and even more impressive is that the only other time was also from two teammates from Ohio State when Parris Campbell and Terry McLaurin pulled off the same feat.
Ohio State is the place for speed when it comes to the wide receiver position.

     Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson Show Why They’re First-Round Picks With Standout Performances at NFL Scouting Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It took less than 4.4 seconds for Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson to solidify their status as first-round draft picks at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Combining what they did in receiver drills with their 40 times, their draft stocks should have only improved on Thursday night.
Although there were seven other wide receivers who also broke 4.4 in the 40, Wilson and Olave were the fastest of the wide receivers who have been widely projected as first-round picks.
While Wilson beat Olave by just one one-hundredth of a second on the official 40 times, Olave beat Wilson by just one inch in the broad jump, leaping 10-foot-4 to Wilson’s 10-foot-3.
If they weren’t already both locks to be selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft on April 28, they should be now.

     Did Ohio State's Chris Olave just run away from the Raiders at pick No. 22?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS — The Raiders are always in the market for speed at the receiver position and had to be a little excited about the prospect of landing a fast, polished route runner like Ohio State’s Chris Olave with the 22nd pick in the NFL Draft next month.That possibility might be left in the dust after Olave was one of eight receivers to run under 4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium on Thursday night.The polished Olave was thought to be a late first-round pick before he ran an unofficial 4.26 and had NFL Network analysts howling.
Whether or not they were in on all of the unofficial times being a lot faster than what seemed logical, Olave’s amended official time of 4.39 was still the eighth-fastest time of all the receivers.For someone who might be the best route runner of the bunch, Olave caught practically every pass thrown his way during drills, easily tracking deep throws.
He measured in at 6-feet and 3/8 inches and 187 pounds with a 31 1/8-inch arm length and 73 1/8-inch wingspan.“I just want to prove it to myself,” Olave said Wednesday when asked what he wanted to accomplish here.
“I’ve been training for this for so long, and to get this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is a huge blessing.“People can see how fast I can run on film, but to showcase that in front of all the scouts and all the teams is going to be huge for me this week.”One wonders whether Olave would have passed on a second 40 attempt if he knew the first time was so far off.
But NFL Network analyst and former Jaguars and Raiders running back Maurice Jones-Drew was on the field and said Olave still verified what everyone thought coming in.
