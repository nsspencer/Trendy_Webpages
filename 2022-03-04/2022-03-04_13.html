     U.S. Supreme Court reinstates death sentence for Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev – New Bedford Guide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today, the U.S. Supreme Court released a 44-page ruling whereby they reinstated the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
“On April 15, 2013, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted and detonated two homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding hundreds,” said the ruling.
The death sentence was then thrown out.
The justices were in agreement with the Biden Administration when they voted by a 6-3 margin that the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals had made the wrong decision, an action which reinstated Tsarnaev’s death sentence.

The Supreme Court on Friday reinstated the death penalty sentence imposed on Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reversing a lower federal appeals court ruling that had voided that punishment.
"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed heinous crimes," Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed," Thomas wrote.
A jury in federal district court in Massachusetts convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on 30 counts, and recommended the death penalty for six of them.

     Supreme Court reimposes death sentence for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday reinstated the death sentence of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
His attorneys acknowledge he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev detonated two homemade devices near the finish line of the Boston Marathon nearly a decade ago.
But Tsarnaev's lawyers argued Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev acted under his brother's influence.
The jury recommended, and the district court imposed, the death penalty on six of 17 capital counts.
The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.
