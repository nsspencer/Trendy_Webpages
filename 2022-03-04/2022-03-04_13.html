     Michigan State women's second-half rally falls short against Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Spartan freshman Matilda Ehk put on a heroic effort to keep Michigan State in the game.
Although Michigan State did not get the win, the highlight of the game was provided by a Spartan.
Michigan State's Alisia Smith (8 points, 7 rebounds, steal) and Tamara Farquhar (6 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists, steal) had solid games as well.
Michigan State falls to 15-15 overall after finishing 8-9 in Big Ten play this season.
The Spartans are not a candidate for the women's NCAA Tournament, but Michigan State could be selected National Invitation Tournament.

     'They just never quit.' Michigan State women's basketball fights way back, fall short vs. Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Even as her Michigan State women’s basketball team has taken a number of hits this season, coach Suzy Merchant has always appreciated the constant fight and effort displayed on the court.
That once again was the case Friday as MSU nearly battled back from a 20-point deficit before suffering a 74-58 setback to top-seeded Ohio State in a Big Ten tournament quarterfinal at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.
DeeDee Hagemann's driving basket cut the Ohio State lead to 64-58 six with 4:17 remaining.
But Ohio State countered with a 10-0 run to close the contest and end MSU's stay in Indianapolis.
Jacy Sheldon had a team-high 19 points for Ohio State, which beat the Spartans for the second time in a week.

     Michigan State Basketball: It’s time for Tom Izzo to change his philosophy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan State basketball is struggling mightily for the second straight season.
Michigan State basketball was just humiliated for the second game in a row this time coming on the road to Columbus.
This marks the second disappointing season in a row for the Spartans and at this point, there is only one man to blame: Tom Izzo.
Michigan State is borderline elite when it comes to the most efficient shot in basketball yet takes relatively few 3-pointers.
While I’m sure this is drilled in most basketball fans’ heads at this point, mid-range shots are the most inefficient in the game of basketball.

     Column: MSU men’s basketball reaches its boiling point in loss to Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the seventh loss in nine games and yet another disappointing effort in the 80-69 loss to Ohio State, Izzo has reached his boiling point.
It was another game in which Michigan State looked sluggish out of the gate, a problem that has killed the team’s chances almost immediately in the last three losses.
I think he averaged 1.1 points,” Izzo said.
In the last three losses against Iowa, Michigan and now Ohio State, Michigan State has been outscored by 40 points in the first half, which has completely wiped away any winning chances.
That is not the formula for this Michigan State team.
