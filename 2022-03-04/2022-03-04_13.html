     Learn MoreThe Boys' Antony Starr Might Be Spending Too Much Time In CharacterNew Zealand-based actor Antony Starr is known for his work in movies like 2004's "Without a Paddle" and 2012's "Wish You Were Here."
He's also worked on popular TV series including "Outrageous Fortune," which was released in 2005, and most recently, the Amazon series "The Boys."
"The Boys" takes place in a universe where those with powers are considered superheroes, but not all superheroes are on the side of justice.
Starr plays the character Homelander, who just so happens to be the show's number one antagonist.
Sometimes, though, Starr gets so into the role that he might be spending too much time in character as Homelander.

     ‘The Boys’ Actor Antony Starr Arrested in Spain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Antony Starr, who stars as the morally compromised superhero on Amazon’s streaming hit “The Boys,” was arrested this week in Alicante, Spain, where he is being accused of assault.
Starr is in Spain shooting a new untitled Guy Ritchie action movie alongside Jake Gyllenhaal.
The original report indicated that Starr was given a 12-month suspended prison sentence with a $5,464.97 fine, which must be paid within 72 hours.
According to the Variety report, any conviction of under two years in Spain is automatically suspended if the guilty partner has no criminal record, which Starr does not.
Today a series of animated shorts inspired by the series, titled “The Boys: Diabolical,” debuted, and the third season of the series returns on June.

     ‘The Boys’ actor Antony Starr gets suspended prison sentence after assault in pub
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Boys actor Antony Starr has reportedly been handed a 12-month suspended prison sentence after assaulting a chef in Spain.
The sentence was the result of an agreement between the state prosecution service and the man who was subsequently convicted.
“His prison sentence is being suspended on the condition that he doesn’t commit another crime in two years and pays the compensation in the next 72 hours.”NME has reached out to Starr’s representatives for comment.
It’s believed the New Zealand actor is in Spain filming for a new Guy Ritchie movie.
Along with The Boys, Star is known for roles in Banshee and New Zealand comedy drama Outrageous Fortune.

     A suspended sentence, however, is when a judge sentences a defendant to jail or prison time, but then delays imposing the actual prison sentence in order to let the defendant serve time on probation instead, according to legal experts.
Starr, known for his role on “The Boys,” was reportedly in Spain filming a new Guy Ritchie movie.
He also shared a screenshot of an article the Sun posted that revealed the young chef will need stitches as a result of the attack.
“The sentence was the result of an agreement between the state prosecution service and the man who was subsequently convicted,” the official added.
Araujo reportedly told the local Spanish outlet that Starr punched him in the jaw and near his eye.
