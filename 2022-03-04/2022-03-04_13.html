     Rocket moon crash LIVE – Space junk ‘HITS moon’ at 5,800mph &amp; China denies responsibility after SpaceX blamed in ‘error’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AN OUT-OF-CONTROL rocket part the size of a school bus has likely smashed into the Moon's surface by now.
The rocket part was first spotted by Bill Gray, who writes the popular Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects.
He reported that the junk was a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage launched from Florida by Elon Musk's team in February 2015.
However, Bill later retracted his claim and said the rocket part most likely belonged to China.

     A much-debated piece of space junk, suspected to be part of a Chinese rocket that helped launch a 2014 lunar mission, hit the far side of the moon, scientists say.
The bus-sized third stage of a Long March 3C rocket was expected to crash into the moon at about 7:25 a.m.
Originally, astronomers thought the space junk was a SpaceX rocket launched seven years ago.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The hardware came barreling head-on at the lunar surface at 5,800 miles an hour, into an existing, enormous crater.
According to Gray, the space junk turned out to be a discarded rocket booster from a Chinese mission that sent a spacecraft toward the moon in 2014.
When you think about it that way, we’re kind of throwing trash at the moon.
Read: The moon is leaving usThis past January, Gray noticed that the rocket debris was tracing a path directly toward the moon.
The collision sparked a bunch of news stories because, well, we’re just throwing trash at the moon now, and this trash appeared to have originated with SpaceX and its divisive CEO, Elon Musk.

     3-ton rocket almost certainly just smashed into the moon at 5,771 mph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After at least seven years hurtling through space, a 3- ton (2.7 metric tons) discarded rocket stage has probably smashed into the moon today (March 4) at a blistering 5,771 mph (9,288 km/h).
This is the first time that space junk has accidentally collided with the lunar surface, according to scientists.
Chinese foreign ministry officials deny that the space junk is theirs, insisting that the Chang'e 5 rocket already burned up on re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.
Further evidence came Tuesday (March 1), when the U.S. Department of Defense's Space Command, which tracks low-Earth orbit space junk, released a statement confirming that China's 2014 rocket never deorbited.
Although this is the first piece of space junk to unintentionally collide with the moon, it isn't the first time a human-made satellite has crashed there.

     After mistaken identity and confusion, a piece of space junk slams into the Moon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After years of zooming through deep space, a presumed leftover piece of a Chinese rocket slammed into the Moon today, just as space tracking experts expected it would.
First of all, the vehicle was never intended to crash into the Moon, making it a rare piece of space debris to find its way to the lunar surface by accident.
The 18SPCS is much more focused on tracking space debris in closer orbits to Earth, as the space environment there has become much more crowded.
The 18SPCS claimed that once the Chang’e 5-T1 rocket passed more than 22,000 miles beyond Earth, their official trackers de-prioritized following the object.
The collision shouldn’t really be a cause for concern, especially since we’ve crashed plenty of objects on the lunar surface before.

     ( Supplied: NASA/Tony Gray and Tim Powers )Rocket origins disputed by ChinaMr Gray said it was likely the third stage of a Chinese rocket that sent a test sample capsule to the Moon and back in 2014.
Mr Gray, a mathematician and physicist, said he was confident now that it was China's rocket.
Mr Gray said SpaceX never contacted him to challenge his original claim.
Nobody is particularly careful about what they do with junk at this sort of orbit," Mr Gray said.
And there was no readily available database, he noted, aside from the ones "cobbled together" by himself, Mr Gray and a couple of others.
