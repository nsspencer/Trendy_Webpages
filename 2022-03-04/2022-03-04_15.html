     Everything Tom Izzo said after Michigan State's loss to Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The general mood surrounding Michigan State’s basketball team continues to sour as the Spartans wind down the regular season.
Thursday’s non-competitive road loss to Ohio State was the latest in a series of disappointing and dispiriting losses for the Spartans.
MSU let role players Joey Brunk and Jamari Wheeler go off for 18 and 16 points, respectively, while Ohio State’s regular stars, EJ Liddell and Malaki Branham, went for 19 and 21.
Ohio State, though, scored 20 points off of MSU giveaways and shot well enough to keep the Spartans at arm’s length, making 54.7% of their shots on the night, including a 50% clip in the second half.
I never thought in a million years Joey Brunk – I recruited Joey, great kid, I know he’s been through more injuries and everything.

     Michigan State women's second-half rally falls short against Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Spartan freshman Matilda Ehk put on a heroic effort to keep Michigan State in the game.
Although Michigan State did not get the win, the highlight of the game was provided by a Spartan.
Michigan State's Alisia Smith (8 points, 7 rebounds, steal) and Tamara Farquhar (6 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists, steal) had solid games as well.
Michigan State falls to 15-15 overall after finishing 8-9 in Big Ten play this season.
The Spartans are not a candidate for the women's NCAA Tournament, but Michigan State could be selected National Invitation Tournament.

     Even as her Michigan State women’s basketball team has taken a number of hits this season, coach Suzy Merchant has always appreciated the constant fight and effort displayed on the court.
That once again was the case Friday as MSU nearly battled back from a 20-point deficit before suffering a 74-58 setback to top-seeded Ohio State in a Big Ten tournament quarterfinal at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.
DeeDee Hagemann's driving basket cut the Ohio State lead to 64-58 six with 4:17 remaining.
But Ohio State countered with a 10-0 run to close the contest and end MSU's stay in Indianapolis.
Jacy Sheldon had a team-high 19 points for Ohio State, which beat the Spartans for the second time in a week.

     Michigan State Basketball: It’s time for Tom Izzo to change his philosophy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan State basketball is struggling mightily for the second straight season.
Michigan State basketball was just humiliated for the second game in a row this time coming on the road to Columbus.
This marks the second disappointing season in a row for the Spartans and at this point, there is only one man to blame: Tom Izzo.
Michigan State is borderline elite when it comes to the most efficient shot in basketball yet takes relatively few 3-pointers.
While I’m sure this is drilled in most basketball fans’ heads at this point, mid-range shots are the most inefficient in the game of basketball.

     Ohio State Men's Basketball No Longer Has Any Margin for Error
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That's the last time that the Ohio State men's basketball team won either a regular season conference title, a conference tournament title, or advanced past the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
Ohio State hadn't made the Elite Eight in back to back years since the 1960's, but they did it during that run.
For one, the Big Ten is more competitive than it has been in a long time, and secondly, Ohio State is less competitive.
Well, the chances of Ohio State getting a two-game reprieve in the Big Ten Tournament still exist, but are fleetingly small.
The Ohio State Buckeyes might not be there.
