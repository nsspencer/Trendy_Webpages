     Learn MoreThe Boys' Antony Starr Might Be Spending Too Much Time In CharacterNew Zealand-based actor Antony Starr is known for his work in movies like 2004's "Without a Paddle" and 2012's "Wish You Were Here."
He's also worked on popular TV series including "Outrageous Fortune," which was released in 2005, and most recently, the Amazon series "The Boys."
"The Boys" takes place in a universe where those with powers are considered superheroes, but not all superheroes are on the side of justice.
Starr plays the character Homelander, who just so happens to be the show's number one antagonist.
Sometimes, though, Starr gets so into the role that he might be spending too much time in character as Homelander.

     ‘The Boys” Homelander, Antony Starr arrested in Spain for alleged assault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amazon StudiosActor Antony Starr, known for playing the villainous Homelander on Amazon’s Emmy-nominated hit The Boys, will apparently avoid jail time after an allegedly drunken assault on a chef at a restaurant in Alicante, Spain.
Starr was convicted but won’t face any jail time because he has no criminal record, according to Spanish law.
Instead, he was automatically given a 12-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay $5,464.97 in fines within 72 hours.
The New Zealand-born actor was in the city filming Guy Ritchie’s action movie The Interpreter, starring Jake Gyllenhaal.
Starr can also be heard as Homelander in The Boys‘ animated spin-off, The Boys Presents: Diabolical, which premiered on Amazon Prime Friday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A suspended sentence, however, is when a judge sentences a defendant to jail or prison time, but then delays imposing the actual prison sentence in order to let the defendant serve time on probation instead, according to legal experts.
Starr, known for his role on “The Boys,” was reportedly in Spain filming a new Guy Ritchie movie.
He also shared a screenshot of an article the Sun posted that revealed the young chef will need stitches as a result of the attack.
“The sentence was the result of an agreement between the state prosecution service and the man who was subsequently convicted,” the official added.
Araujo reportedly told the local Spanish outlet that Starr punched him in the jaw and near his eye.
