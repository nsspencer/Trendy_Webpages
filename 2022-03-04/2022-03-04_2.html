     Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher vow to match $3 million in donations for Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "Proud Ukrainian" Mila Kunis and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, have pledged to match up to $3 million in donations to help refugees fleeing her native country amid the conflict with Russia.
Kunis was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine -- then part of the Soviet Union -- and moved with her family to the United States at the age of 7.
While acknowledging all that America has done for her and her family, she said she couldn't forget her roots.
"Today, I am a proud Ukrainian," the "Black Swan" star said in a statement shared on the fundraising page.
"Our family is starting this fund to help provide immediate support," she wrote, "and we will be matching up to $3 million dollars."

     Maps: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.
Much of the Russian onslaught has focused on Kyiv, but the eastern city of Kharkiv — with 1.5 million residents — is also crucial.
The response: A new iron curtain is descending across Russia’s Internet after online access was curtailed by Russian censors and Western businesses.
Russian aircraft have been banned from flying in European Union, American and Canadian airspace.
How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
