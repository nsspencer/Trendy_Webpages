     Julia Fox reveals her romance with Kanye West ‘felt like a movie’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     File FootageJulia Fox’s romance with Kanye West felt like a movie to the Uncut Gems actress but for all the wrong reasons.
Julia made the revelation in a recent interview with The New York Times, in which she shared that she was not ‘exclusive’ with Kanye during their relationship.
Responding to whether Kanye and her were ‘officially boyfriend and girlfriend’, Julia said, “I don't think those words ever came out of my mouth, actually.”She then shared, “He was the orchestrator of it all.
It really did feel like a movie,” while explaining, “It definitely felt like I was his girlfriend.
But it also felt like I was being cast in the role of his girlfriend — and he was casting me.”Julia and Kanye were first linked after meeting on New Year’s Eve, and dated throughout January 2022 before announcing that they had split up in early February.

     Julia Fox ‘felt cast’ in the role of Kanye West’s girlfriend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Julia Fox has said she “felt like she was being cast” in the role of Kanye West’s girlfriend.
Fox and West first met on 31 December 2021 at a New Year’s Eve Party in Miami.
The whirlwind romance ended last month, with Fox confirming on Instagram on 14 February that the pair had broken up.
Speaking to NYT, Fox was asked whether the pair had really referred to each other as “boyfriend and girlfriend”.
But it also felt like I was being cast in the role of his girlfriend – and he was casting me.

     It Sure Looks Like Julia Fox Is on Everyone's Makeup Mood Board for Fall 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But this same extreme eye makeup aesthetic has been absolutely dominating the Fall 2022 runways as well.
Pat McGrath — whose intricate and impactful eye makeup runway creations are the stuff of beauty legend — created a variety of goth-y makeup looks for the latter runway.
Black eye makeup is the beauty trend of the moment, to hear McGrath tell it: "As I said during [the couture shows], it's going to be a smoky spring."
(Fox's usual signature is typically much harsher and more blunt around the edges than McGrath's runway look.)
Finally, McGrath coated models' top and bottom lashes with Pat McGrath Labs Dark Star Mascara.
