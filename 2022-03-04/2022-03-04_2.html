     Free agency: Amari Cooper is a dream signing for the Tennessee Titans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amari Cooper should intrigue the Tennessee TitansAdding playmakers to the Tennessee Titans offense is the top priority this offseason, and if Amari Cooper becomes available he would be an ideal fit in Nashville.
There have been rumors that Amari Cooper might be on the chopping block in Dallas for a few reasons.
The general theory is that the Cowboys could cute Amari Cooper and use that money to bring back Michael Gallup and Dalton Schultz.
After drafting Ceedee Lamb in the first round two years ago, the long-term future of Amari Cooper has been in question.
Today, Adam Schefter reported that Amari Cooper was “likely” to be cut in the next week or so.

     Amari Cooper should be avoided by Houston Texans for one big reason

     Houston should steer clear with Amari Cooper most likely hitting the free-agent market.
Adam Schefter reported on Friday morning that the Dallas Cowboys are most likely to release star wide receiver, Amari Cooper.
Cowboys are “likely” to release WR Amari Copper by the start of the new league year, per league sources.
Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year, March 20.
This isn’t without noting that Cooper is and has been one of the best in the league for the last few years, but Houston isn’t where Cooper is headed.

     How Amari Cooper wins, and where he might win next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cooper is excellent at getting into and out of breaks, often using his full body to help sell defenders on routes.
Take this 41-yard completion against the New Orleans Saints, which finds Cooper operating as the middle receiver in a trips formation to the right side of the offense:Cooper pushes vertically, working against cornerback Bradley Roby.
That is enough for Cooper to work across Roby’s face, getting separation for the catch-and-run.
As Cooper gets vertical, he puts his eyes downfield, helping to sell the route.
That gets him more than enough separation from Jackson — one of the NFL’s best cornerbacks — for a completion.

     If the Cowboys release Amari Cooper, here are eight landing spots that could be good for fantasy value.

     In 2021, the former Alabama Crimson Tide star posted his worst fantasy season since 2017, with 68 receptions for 865 yards and eight touchdowns.
Assuming Cooper hits the open market, let’s take a closer look at some of the best fantasy landing spots for the 27-year-old:Kansas City Chiefs: Not a shock.
The presence of Cooper could only help and he’d be a good mentor to Mooney, who well exceeded last season’s expectations.
Signing Cooper could take some of the heavy expectations off the shoulders of young WR Amon-Ra St. Brown.
Assuming the Bucs opt to not re-sign him, which is likely, Cooper would be a good choice to play beside Mike Evans if the price is right.

     The Cowboys are on the verge of the unthinkable: Cutting Amari Cooper.
So, who could (and should) look to sign Cooper if we work under the assumption he will be a free agent.
Signing Cooper, while reforming the defense through the draft, could result in the offensive jump needed to get back to the Super Bowl.
4: Jacksonville JaguarsLet’s assume for a second that Amari Cooper isn’t that concerned with winning and he’d rather get PAID.
Signing Cooper would get them moving, and maybe even create some (measured) excitement.

     Cowboys will try to trade Amari Cooper, expected to release veteran WR if no deal reached
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dallas will try to trade Cooper, but will release the veteran receiver if no deal is reached, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday, per sources.
In essence, Cooper's extension will wind up being a two-year, $40 million deal.
The wideout's status in Dallas has been questioned since the Cowboys' season ended with a postseason loss to the San Francisco 49ers.
As Jones' tone suggested, all the guaranteed money on running back ﻿Ezekiel Elliott﻿'s deal is causing collateral damage to other areas of the roster.
It's possible that the Cowboys part ways with Cooper intending to re-sign Gallup, which would at least keep one stud WR alongside Lamb.

     New England Patriots Rumors: Amari Cooper would help offense explode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New England Patriots are currently busy putting in work at the NFL Combine.
The New England Patriots offense could be a top 5 unit with Amari CooperThis bombshell was dropped earlier today by Adam Schefter, and it’s a pretty interesting development.
If Jackson re-signs, you can say goodbye to any shot the New England Patriots may have at landing Cooper.
Even if the the Patriots don’t land Cooper, him being released would open things up on the wide receiver market, which is a win for New England.
Adding Cooper to the team could potentially see the New England Patriots offense become a top five unit in the league next season.
