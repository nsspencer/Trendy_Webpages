When asked if she and Kanye were officially “boyfriend” and “girlfriend”, Julia replied: “I don’t think those words ever came out of my mouth, actually.
It really did feel like a movie.”The actress went on to say she wasn’t worried that Kanye would expose more details about their relationship.
“I don’t think that he would want to open that door with me,” she said.
And I’m really good at coming for people.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Julia Fox says being around rapper Kanye West was “like a crash course on how to be famous.” And some parts were even real.
The two were, of course, involved in a whirlwind six-week relationship that by her account included about 15 days in each other’s company.
News that Fox had dumped Ye — that’s his new legal name — came on Valentine’s Day.
And now she’s changed her take on their involvement from real to something, oh, slightly to the left of real.
But it also felt like I was being cast in the role of his girlfriend — and he was casting me,” she told NYT.

     Julia Fox: I Lost 15 Lbs While Dating Kanye West for 6 Weeks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Julia Fox gained a ton of new fans during her brief romance with Kanye West, but she lost something else: a lot of weight.
“I lost, like, 15 pounds in that month.”The model and the rapper, 44, began dating after meeting on New Year’s Eve 2021.
While she was dating West, Fox was plagued by allegations that the romance was faked for publicity, but she always claimed that the duo had true feelings for each other.
“They’re not exclusive,” an insider exclusively told Us of West and Jones earlier this week.
The Skims founder, for her part, has been dating Pete Davidson, who has been a frequent target of West on social media.

     It Sure Looks Like Julia Fox Is on Everyone's Makeup Mood Board for Fall 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But this same extreme eye makeup aesthetic has been absolutely dominating the Fall 2022 runways as well.
Pat McGrath — whose intricate and impactful eye makeup runway creations are the stuff of beauty legend — created a variety of goth-y makeup looks for the latter runway.
Black eye makeup is the beauty trend of the moment, to hear McGrath tell it: "As I said during [the couture shows], it's going to be a smoky spring."
(Fox's usual signature is typically much harsher and more blunt around the edges than McGrath's runway look.)
Finally, McGrath coated models' top and bottom lashes with Pat McGrath Labs Dark Star Mascara.
