     White Men Can’t Jump Reboot Casts Rapper Jack Harlow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     by Sophie Butcher |He’d never have even auditioned for an on-screen role before now, never mind acted in one, but in his first read for 20th Century’s new take on White Men Can’t Jump, rapper Jack Harlow landed nothing but net.
As reported by Deadline, just one audition was all it took for Harlow to nab one of the lead roles, played by Woody Harrelson in the original 1992 film.
The iconic sports comedy followed Billy Hoyle (Harrelson), a man under pressure to earn some dollar from wife Gloria (Rosie Perez) and the mobsters he’s indebted to.
After pulling one over on fellow basketball hustler Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes), the two join forces to con players across the courts of Los Angeles.
NBA player Blake Griffin is executive producing, alongside Ryan Kalil and Noah Weinstein under their banner Mortal Media.
