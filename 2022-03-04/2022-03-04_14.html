     With India four down on 175, Pant and Shreyas Iyer kept the scoreboard moving to help the team reach 199/4.
On the first day of the first Test, India won the toss and chose to bat first.
The 24-year-old wicketkeeper was praised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for his brilliant knock of 96.
This is Rishabh’s 5th score in 90s…all of them stellar knocks enriching Test cricket.
— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) March 4, 2022Rishabh Pant will do to Test cricket what Adam Gilchrist did for us who grew up in 90s and 00s.

     Pant 96 off 97 as India pile up 357 on day one against Sri Lanka
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     India 357 for 6 (Pant 96, Vihari 58, Embuldeniya 2-107) vs Sri LankaSri Lanka managed to deny Virat Kohli even a fifty in his 100th Test.
They managed 44 of them on the day; Sri Lanka could string together just six maidens..
In a way, Sri Lanka were lucky they got the first five wickets with just 41 mistakes induced in the first 61.1 overs of the day.
This, though, would be the last time in a while that Sri Lanka would see a mistake from the batters.
Within 10 minutes, Sri Lanka had gone from "hang on, what if we get a couple of quick wickets" to looking completely listless.
