     A Text Message About January 6 Gets Kimberly Guilfoyle Subpoenaed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kimberly Guilfoyle's refusal to voluntarily comply with the House Select Committee's request is why she later received a subpoena on March 3, 2022.
Prior to Guilfoyle's ill-fated attempt at appearing in front of the Committee back in February (via CNN), text messages in which Guilfoyle allegedly brags about raising money was made public.
The text messages in question was first reported by ProPublica in November 2021.
"[I] raised so much money for this," Guilfoyle's text read.
The Julie who Guilfoyle was referring to was Publix Supermarket heiress, Julie Jenkins Fancelli.

     House Select Committee Files Subpoena Against Kimberly Guilfoyle

     House Select Committee Files Subpoena Against Kimberly GuilfoyleKimberly Guilfoyle, former President Trump campaign aide and fiancé to Donald Trump Jr. has been subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Capitol Riots.
Guilfoyle’s subpoena comes after an attempt by the committee to get her to cooperate voluntarily.
She appeared via video for a deposition on February 25th but ended the proceedings quickly because she was unhappy that members of the committee were participating in the deposition.
Guilfoyle’s attorney claimed the committee violated the terms of her agreement to appear by allowing committee members to be a part of the session and by leaking news of the interview to the media.
The committee has already obtained her phone records through a subpoena.

     Donald Trump Jr.’s Fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle Has Been Called to Testify About January 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kimberly Guilfoyle is discovering her luck has run out when it comes to avoiding the House Select Committee that is investigating the insurrection events on Jan. 6, 2021.
After suddenly ending proceedings on Feb. 25 because she claims she didn’t know committee members would be participating in her voluntary deposition, Guilfoyle now finds herself on the receiving end of a subpoena.
The Mississippi representative added that they “expect her to comply with the law and cooperate.”How loyal is Ivanka Trump to the rest of the Trump family?
https://t.co/c7y0c1M8R6 — SheKnows (@SheKnows) January 21, 2022With Guilfoyle’s phone records already a part of the investigation, the Select Committee is looking for her to fill in the holes of what happened that day when she communicated with the president.
With the investigation closing in on the inner Trump circle, it’s only a matter of time before a family member is brought before the committee next.

     The Select Committee has evidence that Ms. Guilfoyle was in direct contact with key individuals, raised funds for the rally immediately preceding the violent attack on the United States Capitol, and participated in that event.
The Select Committee is seeking information from her about these and other matters.
Because Ms. Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today’s subpoena that will compel her to testify.
Based on documents and information provided to the Select Committee, Ms. Guilfoyle also has claimed to have been involved in raising funds to pay for the Ellipse rally.
