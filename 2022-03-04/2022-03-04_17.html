     Keith Lee Talks Criticism from Vince McMahon, WWE Bearcat Gimmick with Chris Jericho
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Photo credit: WWENewly signed AEW star Keith Lee sat down with Chris Jericho on Friday to discuss a number of topics, including his final days in WWE before getting released.
During an appearance on Talk Is Jericho, Lee was asked about the circumstances that led up to his WWE departure in November.
He wanted some intense guy, and I think that I can be intense, but I need a reason to be intense."
The character McMahon ultimately tried to get Lee to become was Keith "Bearcat" Lee, but the gimmick was short-lived before Lee was released.
Lee divulged that he initially told McMahon he wasn't comfortable with the character, which led to him coming back under his normal Keith Lee persona in July after a five-month absence due to COVID-19 complications.

     Vince McMahon Recalls Promoters Putting A "Hit" Out On Him In The 80s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon joined The Pat McAfee Show yesterday for a rare, hour-long interview.
Among the many stories Vince McMahon relayed was how many times he had received death threats over the years.
In particular, he claimed to have heard a story from Jim Ross that several of his competitors in the 80s, including Cowboy Bill Watts and other NWA promoters, talked up ideas to threaten him.
McMahon claimed Ross covertly hid in a bathroom stall, hearing all about how these other promoters were plotting against him.
He’s thinking, he doesn’t give a sh-t about Vince McMahon.

     AEW star Keith Lee opened up about his relationship with his former boss Vince McMahon on the latest edition of Talk Is Jericho.
According to Lee, WWE CEO Vince McMahon was concerned that fans would find Lee's articulate manner of speaking distracting.
In the aforementioned chat with Chris Jericho, Lee made it clear that Vince had a very different vision for his character than Lee himself had in mind.
I can't be...I tried...I don't think I'm very good at it and that's something that facilitated that," Lee said.
Keith Lee was revealed as Isiah Kassidy's mystery opponent in a Face Of The Revolution qualifying match just moments before the match began.

     Vince McMahon Reveals Why He Hates The Term “Wrestling”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vince McMahon has revealed why he hates the term “wrestling” and how it’s all down to marketing.
For a number of years it has been said that the phrase “professional wrestling” is a dirty word in WWE.
While commentators and on-screen figures are banned from using the word “wrestling” across the company programming.
“There’s always been wrestling,” said McMahon “I wanted to separate us from everybody else.
“The Panda got us to a certain extent, because the World Wildlife Fund… I didn’t even know it existed,” said Vince.
