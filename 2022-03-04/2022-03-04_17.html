     A Text Message About January 6 Gets Kimberly Guilfoyle Subpoenaed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kimberly Guilfoyle's refusal to voluntarily comply with the House Select Committee's request is why she later received a subpoena on March 3, 2022.
Prior to Guilfoyle's ill-fated attempt at appearing in front of the Committee back in February (via CNN), text messages in which Guilfoyle allegedly brags about raising money was made public.
The text messages in question was first reported by ProPublica in November 2021.
"[I] raised so much money for this," Guilfoyle's text read.
The Julie who Guilfoyle was referring to was Publix Supermarket heiress, Julie Jenkins Fancelli.

The Select Committee is seeking information from her about these and other matters.
Because Ms. Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today’s subpoena that will compel her to testify.
Based on documents and information provided to the Select Committee, Ms. Guilfoyle also has claimed to have been involved in raising funds to pay for the Ellipse rally.

     Donald Trump Jr.’s Fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle Has Been Called to Testify About January 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kimberly Guilfoyle is discovering her luck has run out when it comes to avoiding the House Select Committee that is investigating the insurrection events on Jan. 6, 2021.
After suddenly ending proceedings on Feb. 25 because she claims she didn’t know committee members would be participating in her voluntary deposition, Guilfoyle now finds herself on the receiving end of a subpoena.
The Mississippi representative added that they “expect her to comply with the law and cooperate.”How loyal is Ivanka Trump to the rest of the Trump family?
https://t.co/c7y0c1M8R6 — SheKnows (@SheKnows) January 21, 2022With Guilfoyle’s phone records already a part of the investigation, the Select Committee is looking for her to fill in the holes of what happened that day when she communicated with the president.
With the investigation closing in on the inner Trump circle, it’s only a matter of time before a family member is brought before the committee next.

     Jan. 6 Committee Subpoenas Kimberly Guilfoyle After She Allegedly 'Backed Out' of Voluntary Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Guilfoyle, 52, is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, who may have committed crimes, the committee alleged in court documents filed this week.
"Because Ms. Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today's subpoena that will compel her to testify," Rep. Thompson continued.
But he told the AP the committee "sabotaged" Guilfoyle's voluntary interview "by changing the terms to which she agreed and leaking confidential information to the media."
Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. From left: Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle | Credit: Astrid Stawiarz/GettyTacopina also said his client will "testify truthfully to any question," adding, "She has done nothing wrong."
"Thompson acknowledged in his letter that Guilfoyle "professed to want to cooperate" and "produced only 110 pages in response to 14 document requests."
