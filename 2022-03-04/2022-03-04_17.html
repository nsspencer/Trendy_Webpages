     Here's What Kevin Durant Said After The Nets Lost To The Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets lost to the Miami Heat on Thursday night at Barclays Center, and after the game Kevin Durant spoke to reporters.
The Brooklyn Nets lost 113-107 to the Miami Heat on their home floor at Barclays Center on Thursday evening.
However, the good news was the fact that Kevin Durant played 35 minutes and scored 31 points in his first time playing since January 15.
After the loss, Durant spoke to the media, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of SNY's Nets Videos.
The Nets fell to 32-32 on the season, which currently has them as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference.

Can Kevin Durant drag the Brooklyn Nets to a championship?
Sure, getting some injured players back will help, but this Nets run will ultimately come down to one man – Kevin Durant.
Again, it’s not very likely, but if the Nets can drag themselves into the playoffs, maybe Durant can drag them all the way to a title.

     NBA Twitter reacts to Kevin Durant's return in close loss to the Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets‘ struggles at the Barclays Center this season continued on Thursday night, but there’s reason for optimism after superstar Kevin Durant made his long-awaited return from injury and dropped 31 points on the Miami Heat in a close loss.
Playing for the first time since January 15th, Durant was still relatively sharp from the field, shooting 10-of-21 for a shooting percentage of 47.6, just a few points below his season average.
The Nets were unable to take advantage of a short-handed Heat team missing Jimmy Butler, but Miami’s Bam Adebayo had a big night, scoring 30 points on 15 shots.
Tyler Herro had another solid outing off the bench, adding 27.

     Kevin Durant return, Ben Simmons status: Why Nets making the playoffs isn't a certainty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets' playoff hopes received a big boost with the return of Kevin Durant, who suited up against the Miami Heat on Thursday after missing a month of action with an MCL sprain.
The good news for Brooklyn is Durant is good enough to carry the Nets for the home stretch on his own if he hits the ground running.
With that being said, right now, the Nets are closer to missing the playoffs altogether than guaranteeing their spot in the postseason.

     Kevin Durant has 31 points in return, but Heat rally to beat Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant's shot looked good the whole way, one that would have given the Brooklyn Nets the lead with under a minute left.
After their season went sideways when Durant went down, the Nets will need those to start falling — and he believes they will.
Durant had 31 points in his first game since Jan. 15 and his return from a 21-game absence with a sprained left knee ligament inspired the Nets to a 16-point lead.
"Spo tricks us with that zone," said Goran Dragic, the former Heat guard who made his first start for the Nets.

     Nets running out of time to build chemistry after failing first test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant, the Nets’ long, lean, basketball savant, returned Thursday night and reminded everyone what the team had missed for six weeks.
In the second half, however, the Heat’s zone defense reminded everyone what the Nets have missed and possibly will miss all season.
In the second half, however, the Heat switched into a 2-3 zone that sometimes trapped and sometimes slacked off, but always seemed to confuse the Nets.
In the rosiest of scenarios, Simmons will make his Nets debut March 18 against the Trail Blazers.
“[Establishing chemistry] could take one game, it could take 20 games,” Durant said, though the Nets no longer have 20 games.
