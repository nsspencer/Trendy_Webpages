Vince McMahon has explained and defended WWE’s decision to release close to 200 wrestlers over the last two years.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, WWE has released well over 200 wrestlers and behind-the-scenes staff.
Now, in a rare interview with Pat McAfee, Vince McMahon has explained why so many wrestlers were let go.
McMahon told the former NFL star that the decisions he makes on who cuts released are not personal, but are purely based on what’s best for business.

     Vince McMahon Reveals Why He Hates The Term “Wrestling”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vince McMahon has revealed why he hates the term “wrestling” and how it’s all down to marketing.
For a number of years it has been said that the phrase “professional wrestling” is a dirty word in WWE.
While commentators and on-screen figures are banned from using the word “wrestling” across the company programming.
“There’s always been wrestling,” said McMahon “I wanted to separate us from everybody else.
“The Panda got us to a certain extent, because the World Wildlife Fund… I didn’t even know it existed,” said Vince.

McMahon chose to take WWE national and poached top stars from each territory - something that angered senior promoters.
"'This guy knows this guy, I know a guy who can do this, this guy [carried out a hit], it was really impressive.'

     Vince McMahon Recalls Promoters Putting A "Hit" Out On Him In The 80s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon joined The Pat McAfee Show yesterday for a rare, hour-long interview.
Among the many stories Vince McMahon relayed was how many times he had received death threats over the years.
In particular, he claimed to have heard a story from Jim Ross that several of his competitors in the 80s, including Cowboy Bill Watts and other NWA promoters, talked up ideas to threaten him.
McMahon claimed Ross covertly hid in a bathroom stall, hearing all about how these other promoters were plotting against him.
He’s thinking, he doesn’t give a sh-t about Vince McMahon.
