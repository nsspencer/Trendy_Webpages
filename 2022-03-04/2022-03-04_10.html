     Residente Calls J Balvin A Racist Imbecile On New Diss Track
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Residente and J Balvin have been feuding since September, when Balvin accused the Latin Grammys of discriminating against reggaeton artists and called for a boycott (despite being nominated three times).
In October, he released a video for his song “Perra,” which means “bitch” in Spanish, that featured him walking Black women on leashes.
“He’s an imbecile with dyed hair who put Black women with leashes on their necks,” Residente raps.
“He called the producer, who’s a kid, to stop the track, but this kid has balls and he didn’t give in,” Residente said.
“They threatened to sue my label if I released the track.

     J. Balvin Feud Moves Past Memes To Brutal Diss Track
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Like most music industry beefs, the Residente, 44, and J. Balvin, 36, feud snowballed beyond the artists’ original points of contention.
Residente upped the ante on Thursday (March 4) with an eight-minute diss track that attempts to eviscerate Balvin and his ultra-successful reggaeton career, according to Rolling Stone.
Last fall after the 2021 Latin Grammy nominations, Balvin said he felt reggaeton wasn’t being showcased properly and that his fellow reggaeton artists shouldn’t attend the ceremony.
Balvin seemed to take the diss well, jumping on a trend of hot dog memes that kept popping up by posting a picture of himself behind a hot dog cart.
The track clearly demonstrates that Residente’s distaste of Balvin runs deeper than fun hot dog memes and playful asides on the internet.

     A Timeline of Residente &amp; J Balvin’s Feud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Residente and J Balvin‘s feud, which initially involved hot dog comparisons, has evolved into a multi-layered back-and-forth event.
It all started after the Colombian star called for a boycott of the Latin Grammys last September in response to what he perceived as lack of urban representation in the nominations.
Residente quickly responded to Balvin saying, “It’s as if a hot dog cart got offended because he couldn’t earn a Michelin star […] your music is like a hotdog cart.
Almost everybody likes it, but when those people want to eat well, they go to a Michelin-starred restaurant.”Since, the feud hadn’t made headlines.
Below, a timeline of Residente and Balvin’s feud and everything else that has happened in between.

     J Balvin Brutally Dissed By Latin American Rap Icon Residente During BZRP Session: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Things aren't looking so hot for J Balvin right now.
On Thursday, March 3rd, a video of Latin rap icon Residente's BZRP Music Session went live on Bizarrap's YouTube account, and around the 4:44 mark, the Puerto Rican recording artist goes in on the "Mi Gente" hitmaker, further igniting their ongoing feud.
In Residente's eyes, the 36-year-old Colombian was acting "entitled."
Leon Bennett/Getty ImagesOther bars found Residente attacking Balvin's "loyalty" tattoo, his frequently changing hair colours, and his Afro-Latino award, going on to call him "racist but [not] self-aware about it."
From the looks of the comment section, listeners aren't sure how J Balvin plans to recover from Residente's brutal diss – check it out for yourself below, and read the translation here.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     People are questioning the diss track: Was it too much?
We’ve all seen these types of diss tracks in the Latine music industry, most recently with Jhay Cortez and Rauw Alejandro’s famous tiradera.
A Twitter user says: “Admiring Residente for basically bullying J Balvin is a huge red flag.
— Jonathan Olivera (@SoyHumanologo) March 4, 2022On the other side of the argument, a Twitter user expresses being pro-diss tracks: “People saying that Residente is bullying J Balvin????
— Sánquiz (@ssanquizm) March 4, 2022The diss track must have struck a deep chord on some people.

     What do the lyrics of the new Resident song against J Balvin say?
Later, René makes it clear that he and J Balvin, whom he still does not mention by name, are not the same.
Throughout his entire song, Residente made it clear in the chorus that all of this rapping was done with the goal of having fun.
What happened to Residente and J Balvin?
The rivalry between Residente and J Balvin dates back to 2021, when J Balvin criticized the Latin GRAMMY Awards for not including reggaeton singers in their nominations and called on urban artists not to attend the award ceremony.

     Residente and J Balvin’s Feud Just Went Way Beyond Hot Dog Memes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Then, he compared Balvin’s music to a hot dog cart — implying that Balvin’s hits are cheaply made, mass-produced junk food that people enjoy without necessarily respecting.
People cracked jokes and hot dog memes quickly took over the Internet.
He released a picture of himself, photoshopped behind a hot dog cart, as a way to promote one of his songs, and then launched an entire line of hot dog-themed merch.
It cuts deep and it’s extremely personal, moving way beyond awards telecast and hot dog memes.
But ultimately, it all seems to stem from the fact that, to Residente, Balvin represents the very worst impulses of the Latin music industry.
