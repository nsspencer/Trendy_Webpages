     Jack Harlow To Make His Acting Debut In A White Men Can't Jump Reboot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It is no secret that Jack Harlow is having a moment.
While rapping and dancing is his forte, Jack is looking to make his debut in Hollywood next, starting with a starring role in a movie.
Starring in the reboot of the classically hilarious sports comedy, White Men Can’t Jump, the rapper will take on a lead role once held by Woody Harrelson.
And, while we cannot confirm if we will be there for the plot or for the scenes of Jack shooting hoops, we will be there regardless!
While details are rudimentary right now, the possibility of seeing Jack take to the big screen has rendered us thoroughly satisfied, and we cannot wait to find out more.

     White Men Can’t Jump Reboot Casts Rapper Jack Harlow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     by Sophie Butcher |He’d never have even auditioned for an on-screen role before now, never mind acted in one, but in his first read for 20th Century’s new take on White Men Can’t Jump, rapper Jack Harlow landed nothing but net.
As reported by Deadline, just one audition was all it took for Harlow to nab one of the lead roles, played by Woody Harrelson in the original 1992 film.
The iconic sports comedy followed Billy Hoyle (Harrelson), a man under pressure to earn some dollar from wife Gloria (Rosie Perez) and the mobsters he’s indebted to.
After pulling one over on fellow basketball hustler Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes), the two join forces to con players across the courts of Los Angeles.
NBA player Blake Griffin is executive producing, alongside Ryan Kalil and Noah Weinstein under their banner Mortal Media.

     Jack Harlow to Make Acting Debut in "White Men Can't Jump"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     From appearing on Kanye West's DONDA 2 to playing in the 2022 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, Jack Harlow has been all over the place as of late — and it looks like he's getting ready to make his his acting debut in the upcoming reboot of the 1992 basketball comedy, White Men Can't Jump.
Honestly, our money was on Harlow making his acting debut with a Euphoria cameo, but this works too.
Plus, Harlow does sort of give off some Harrelson vibes.
According to Deadline, Harlow was apparently such a natural born talent that he ended up nailing the audition on his first ever screen test.
Check out the trailer for the original film, below.
