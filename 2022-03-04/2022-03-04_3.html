     White Men Can’t Jump Reboot Casts Rapper Jack Harlow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     by Sophie Butcher |He’d never have even auditioned for an on-screen role before now, never mind acted in one, but in his first read for 20th Century’s new take on White Men Can’t Jump, rapper Jack Harlow landed nothing but net.
As reported by Deadline, just one audition was all it took for Harlow to nab one of the lead roles, played by Woody Harrelson in the original 1992 film.
The iconic sports comedy followed Billy Hoyle (Harrelson), a man under pressure to earn some dollar from wife Gloria (Rosie Perez) and the mobsters he’s indebted to.
After pulling one over on fellow basketball hustler Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes), the two join forces to con players across the courts of Los Angeles.
This new version has been penned by Doug Hall and Black-ish and Girls Trip writer Kenya Barris, and will be directed by Calmatic, who has extensive experience shooting music videos and is also the director of another upcoming 1990s comedy remake, House Party.

     A White Men Can't Jump Reboot Appears To Be Happening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     White Men Can't Jump appears to be the latest movie to get the reboot treatment, with rapper Jack Harlow signing on for one of the lead roles.
According to Deadline, Harlow delivered a slam dunk at his first-ever screen audition as he ended up scoring a major role in 20th Century's upcoming reboot of White Men Can't Jump, playing the character made famous by Woody Harrelson in the original 1992 film.
The reboot is apparently now on a "fast track," with the filmmakers actively searching for Harlow's co-star.
The film grossed more than $14 million during its opening weekend in the early '90s and went on to gross over $90 million worldwide.
His most recent single "Nail Tech" has proven to be another hit, charting at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100.
