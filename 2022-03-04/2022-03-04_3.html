     Dallas Cowboys WR Amari Cooper likely to be released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stephen A. Smith reacts to the news of Amari Cooper being released by the Cowboys.
(0:58)The Dallas Cowboys are "likely" to release wide receiver Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday.
Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year, March 20.
If the Cowboys cut Cooper, they could face a lot of turnover at the receiver spot in 2022.
Cooper missed two games last season after testing positive for COVID-19.

Adam Schefter reported on Friday morning that the Dallas Cowboys are most likely to release star wide receiver, Amari Cooper.
Cowboys are “likely” to release WR Amari Copper by the start of the new league year, per league sources.
Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year, March 20.
This isn’t without noting that Cooper is and has been one of the best in the league for the last few years, but Houston isn’t where Cooper is headed.

     Amari Cooper most likely will be released by Cowboys (report)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cowboys are likely going to release their second-highest performing wide receiver Amari Cooper this offseason, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
The Cowboys would need to release Cooper by March 20, which is the fifth day of the new league year.
The Cowboys are projected to be $21 million over their salary cap, and Cooper’s release would reduce his cap hit for the 2022 season to $6 million.
Earlier this week, though, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones did not give a straight answer on Cooper’s future in Dallas.
Cooper played in 15 games this season, catching 68 of 104 targets for 865 yards and eight touchdowns.

     Adam Schefter reports that the Cowboys are “likely” to release WR Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year on March 16.Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year and considering the Cowboys’ salary cap situation, releasing the veteran receiver for cap savings made some sense.
Releasing Cooper will result in $16 million of cap savings for the Cowboys while creating $6 million of dead money for the 2022 season.
The Raiders traded him to the Cowboys for a first-round pick midway through the 2018 season.
Cooper played out the final year of his four-year, $22.7 million contract, as well as his fifth-year option which cost Dallas $13,924,000 for 2019.
In 2021, Cooper appeared in 15 games for the Cowboys and caught 68 passes for 865 yards receiving and eight touchdowns.

     Dallas Cowboys trending toward releasing four-time Pro Bowl WR Amari Cooper
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS — The Amari Cooper era launched suddenly when the Cowboys dealt a first-round draft pick to acquire the wide receiver at the October 2018 trade deadline.
The Cowboys are trending toward releasing the four-time Pro Bowler before his $20 million salary becomes guaranteed on March 20, a person with knowledge of the team's plans confirmed to USA Today Sports on Friday.
Tight end Blake Jarwin underwent offseason hip surgery with serious implications, multiple people with knowledge of the procedure confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.
Teammates advocated for Cooper’s return, Lamb telling USA TODAY Sports that he believed the team needed the crisp-route veteran.
“We do, honestly,” Lamb told USA TODAY Sports on Feb. 10.

     New England Patriots Rumors: Amari Cooper would help offense explode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New England Patriots are currently busy putting in work at the NFL Combine.
The New England Patriots offense could be a top 5 unit with Amari CooperThis bombshell was dropped earlier today by Adam Schefter, and it’s a pretty interesting development.
If Jackson re-signs, you can say goodbye to any shot the New England Patriots may have at landing Cooper.
Even if the the Patriots don’t land Cooper, him being released would open things up on the wide receiver market, which is a win for New England.
Adding Cooper to the team could potentially see the New England Patriots offense become a top five unit in the league next season.

     Cowboys will try to trade Amari Cooper, expected to release veteran WR if no deal reached
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dallas will try to trade Cooper, but will release the veteran receiver if no deal is reached, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday, per sources.
In essence, Cooper's extension will wind up being a two-year, $40 million deal.
The wideout's status in Dallas has been questioned since the Cowboys' season ended with a postseason loss to the San Francisco 49ers.
As Jones' tone suggested, all the guaranteed money on running back ﻿Ezekiel Elliott﻿'s deal is causing collateral damage to other areas of the roster.
It's possible that the Cowboys part ways with Cooper intending to re-sign Gallup, which would at least keep one stud WR alongside Lamb.
