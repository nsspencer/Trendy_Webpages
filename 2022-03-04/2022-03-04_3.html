     Free agency: Amari Cooper is a dream signing for the Tennessee Titans

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amari Cooper should intrigue the Tennessee TitansAdding playmakers to the Tennessee Titans offense is the top priority this offseason, and if Amari Cooper becomes available he would be an ideal fit in Nashville.
There have been rumors that Amari Cooper might be on the chopping block in Dallas for a few reasons.
The general theory is that the Cowboys could cute Amari Cooper and use that money to bring back Michael Gallup and Dalton Schultz.
After drafting Ceedee Lamb in the first round two years ago, the long-term future of Amari Cooper has been in question.
Today, Adam Schefter reported that Amari Cooper was “likely” to be cut in the next week or so.

     Stephen A. Smith reacts to the news of Amari Cooper being released by the Cowboys.
(0:58)The Dallas Cowboys are "likely" to release wide receiver Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday.
Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year, March 20.
If the Cowboys cut Cooper, they could face a lot of turnover at the receiver spot in 2022.
Cooper missed two games last season after testing positive for COVID-19.

     The Dallas Cowboys are on the doorstep of a major shakeup on the offensive side of the ball.
According to CBS Sports NFL writer Patrik Walker, the club is likely to release wide receiver Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year on March 16 if the veteran isn't willing to take a pay cut.
That ultimately helped Cooper ink a five-year, $100 million contract with the Cowboys in March of 2020 that paid him $60 million guaranteed ($40 million at signing).

Cooper will also be able to sign with a new team immediately, even if this release comes prior to the start of the new league year.

     If the Cowboys release Amari Cooper, here are eight landing spots that could be good for fantasy value.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In 2021, the former Alabama Crimson Tide star posted his worst fantasy season since 2017, with 68 receptions for 865 yards and eight touchdowns.
Assuming Cooper hits the open market, let’s take a closer look at some of the best fantasy landing spots for the 27-year-old:Kansas City Chiefs: Not a shock.
The presence of Cooper could only help and he’d be a good mentor to Mooney, who well exceeded last season’s expectations.
Signing Cooper could take some of the heavy expectations off the shoulders of young WR Amon-Ra St. Brown.
Assuming the Bucs opt to not re-sign him, which is likely, Cooper would be a good choice to play beside Mike Evans if the price is right.

     Cowboys will try to trade Amari Cooper, expected to release veteran WR if no deal reached

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dallas will try to trade Cooper, but will release the veteran receiver if no deal is reached, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday, per sources.
In essence, Cooper's extension will wind up being a two-year, $40 million deal.
The wideout's status in Dallas has been questioned since the Cowboys' season ended with a postseason loss to the San Francisco 49ers.
As Jones' tone suggested, all the guaranteed money on running back ﻿Ezekiel Elliott﻿'s deal is causing collateral damage to other areas of the roster.
It's possible that the Cowboys part ways with Cooper intending to re-sign Gallup, which would at least keep one stud WR alongside Lamb.

     New England Patriots Rumors: Amari Cooper would help offense explode

     The New England Patriots are currently busy putting in work at the NFL Combine.
The New England Patriots offense could be a top 5 unit with Amari CooperThis bombshell was dropped earlier today by Adam Schefter, and it’s a pretty interesting development.
If Jackson re-signs, you can say goodbye to any shot the New England Patriots may have at landing Cooper.
Even if the the Patriots don’t land Cooper, him being released would open things up on the wide receiver market, which is a win for New England.
Adding Cooper to the team could potentially see the New England Patriots offense become a top five unit in the league next season.
