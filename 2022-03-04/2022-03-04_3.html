     Dallas Cowboys WR Amari Cooper likely to be released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stephen A. Smith reacts to the news of Amari Cooper being released by the Cowboys.
(0:58)The Dallas Cowboys are "likely" to release wide receiver Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday.
Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year, March 20.
If the Cowboys cut Cooper, they could face a lot of turnover at the receiver spot in 2022.
Cooper missed two games last season after testing positive for COVID-19.

     Amari Cooper most likely will be released by Cowboys (report)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cowboys are likely going to release their second-highest performing wide receiver Amari Cooper this offseason, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
The Cowboys would need to release Cooper by March 20, which is the fifth day of the new league year.
The Cowboys are projected to be $21 million over their salary cap, and Cooper’s release would reduce his cap hit for the 2022 season to $6 million.
Earlier this week, though, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones did not give a straight answer on Cooper’s future in Dallas.
Cooper played in 15 games this season, catching 68 of 104 targets for 865 yards and eight touchdowns.

     Mitchell Leff/Getty ImagesThe Dallas Cowboys are reportedly set to release wide receiver Amari Cooper before the new NFL league year begins March 16.
If Gallup is re-signed, the Cowboys still have several key potential free agents.
The group includes defensive end Randy Gregory, linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, guard Connor Williams, tight end Dalton Schultz and wide receiver Cedrick Wilson.
He's tallied at least 68 catches in six of his seven NFL seasons and hauled in 46 touchdowns in 108 career games.

     Free agency: Amari Cooper is a dream signing for the Tennessee Titans

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amari Cooper should intrigue the Tennessee TitansAdding playmakers to the Tennessee Titans offense is the top priority this offseason, and if Amari Cooper becomes available he would be an ideal fit in Nashville.
There have been rumors that Amari Cooper might be on the chopping block in Dallas for a few reasons.
The general theory is that the Cowboys could cute Amari Cooper and use that money to bring back Michael Gallup and Dalton Schultz.
After drafting Ceedee Lamb in the first round two years ago, the long-term future of Amari Cooper has been in question.
Today, Adam Schefter reported that Amari Cooper was “likely” to be cut in the next week or so.

     Adam Schefter reports that the Cowboys are “likely” to release WR Amari Cooper by the start of the new league year on March 16.Cooper is due $20 million in fully guaranteed money on the fifth day of the new league year and considering the Cowboys’ salary cap situation, releasing the veteran receiver for cap savings made some sense.
Releasing Cooper will result in $16 million of cap savings for the Cowboys while creating $6 million of dead money for the 2022 season.
The Raiders traded him to the Cowboys for a first-round pick midway through the 2018 season.
Cooper played out the final year of his four-year, $22.7 million contract, as well as his fifth-year option which cost Dallas $13,924,000 for 2019.
In 2021, Cooper appeared in 15 games for the Cowboys and caught 68 passes for 865 yards receiving and eight touchdowns.

     New England Patriots Rumors: Amari Cooper would help offense explode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New England Patriots are currently busy putting in work at the NFL Combine.
The New England Patriots offense could be a top 5 unit with Amari CooperThis bombshell was dropped earlier today by Adam Schefter, and it’s a pretty interesting development.
If Jackson re-signs, you can say goodbye to any shot the New England Patriots may have at landing Cooper.
Even if the the Patriots don’t land Cooper, him being released would open things up on the wide receiver market, which is a win for New England.
Adding Cooper to the team could potentially see the New England Patriots offense become a top five unit in the league next season.
