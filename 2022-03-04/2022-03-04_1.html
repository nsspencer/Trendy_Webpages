     Shane Warne, One of Cricket’s Masters of Spin, Dies at 52
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shane Warne, one of the greatest cricket players of all time, and a larger-than-life figure on and off the field, died Friday in Thailand.
The cause was suspected to be a heart attack, his management company said in a statement.
Warne was a bowler, the equivalent of a baseball pitcher.
He was a master of spin, balls that don’t come in fast but instead twist and turn, potentially bamboozling the batsman.
But his success with them, though difficult to replicate by others, helped revive what was becoming a lost art.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shane Warne, legendary former Australian cricket player and television commentator, died of a suspected heart attack on Friday.
“It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack,” MPC said in a statement.
Warne debuted for Australia in test cricket in 1992 against India and played his last test versus England in 2007 after a 5-0 series victory.

     Obituary: Shane Warne was cricket’s great showman and entertainer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CNN —Whether it was his bleach blonde hair or his devastating spin bowling which had batters quivering and quaking, Shane Warne did things his own way.
“Gone too young!”Former India international batter Virender Sehwag said on Twitter: “One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more.
Away from international cricket, Warne also played a pivotal role in making the Indian Premier League (IPL) the behemoth it is today.
“Absolutely shocked and gutted to hear about Shane Warne, wrote former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara.
This can’t be true… Rest In Peace, Shane Warne.
