     Shane Warne, One of Cricket’s Masters of Spin, Dies at 52
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shane Warne, one of the greatest cricket players of all time, and a larger-than-life figure on and off the field, died Friday in Thailand.
The cause was suspected to be a heart attack, his management company said in a statement.
Warne was a bowler, the equivalent of a baseball pitcher.
He was a master of spin, balls that don’t come in fast but instead twist and turn, potentially bamboozling the batsman.
But his success with them, though difficult to replicate by others, helped revive what was becoming a lost art.

     Shane Warne: Australian cricket great dies aged 52
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Australian cricketer Shane Warne, considered one of the greatest players in history of the sport, has died at the age of 52, his management company confirmed to CNN on Friday.
"It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4th March," said a statement from MPC Entertainment.
"Shane was found unresponsive in his Villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived.
"The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course."
Warne was one of cricket's most lethal bowlers, with 708 Test wickets to his name -- the most ever for an Australian, and the second-most of all time behind only Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka.
