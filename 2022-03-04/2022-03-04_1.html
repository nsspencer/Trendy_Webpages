     Shane Warne: Australian cricket great dies aged 52
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Australian cricketer Shane Warne, considered one of the greatest players in history of the sport, has died at the age of 52, his management company confirmed to CNN on Friday.
"It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4th March," said a statement from MPC Entertainment.
"Shane was found unresponsive in his Villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived.
"The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course."
Warne was one of cricket's most lethal bowlers, with 708 Test wickets to his name -- the most ever for an Australian, and the second-most of all time behind only Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka.

     Australian cricket great Shane Warne dies at 52
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shane Warne, who was considered to be the greatest bowler in cricket history and helped Australia win the World Cup in 1999, has died.
Known as “Warnie,” Warne took 708 test wickets in 145 matches for Australia from 1992-2007, second only to Sri Lanka great Muttiah Muralitharan’s 800 test wickets from 133 matches.
“Spinning was a dying art, really, till Shane Warne came along,” cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew told the BBC.
In 1998, the Australian Cricket Board admitted that Warne and Mark Waugh were fined for providing information to an Indian bookmaker during Australia’s tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
That same year, he was selected for the Australian B team and toured Zimbabwe, where he scored his first five-or-more-wickets innings.
