Purdue 2The Ohio State football team has been producing really good receivers over the last few years.
Hartline has recruited and developed a number of great guys, including Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson who are both at the NFL Combine.
Olave ran a blazing fast 4.26 unofficial 40-yard dash.
I‚Äôm sure more former Ohio State football players will put up silly numbers during this Combine.

     7 most impressive wide receivers from Thursday's NFL combine

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2022 NFL draft may not feature a Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase at wide receiver, but that doesn‚Äôt make this group any less impressive.
It was showcase day at the 2022 NFL combine Thursday when wide receivers took the field for workouts.
For some wideouts, the workouts confirmed what we‚Äôd seen in college.
And which pass-catchers confirmed the speed NFL teams saw on tape from their college careers?
We‚Äôve listed the seven most impressive performances from wide receivers at Thursday‚Äôs NFL combine action.

     Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson Show Why They‚Äôre First-Round Picks With Standout Performances at NFL Scouting Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It took less than 4.4 seconds for Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson to solidify their status as first-round draft picks at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Combining what they did in receiver drills with their 40 times, their draft stocks should have only improved on Thursday night.
Although there were seven other wide receivers who also broke 4.4 in the 40, Wilson and Olave were the fastest of the wide receivers who have been widely projected as first-round picks.
While Wilson beat Olave by just one one-hundredth of a second on the official 40 times, Olave beat Wilson by just one inch in the broad jump, leaping 10-foot-4 to Wilson‚Äôs 10-foot-3.
If they weren‚Äôt already both locks to be selected in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft on April 28, they should be now.

     Raiders should consider Chris Olave as a fit at 22nd overall in the NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2021 Raiders appeared in their first postseason since moving to Las Vegas.
Now, entering NFL Draft season, Las Vegas finds themselves at the 22nd slot in the first round.
Additionally, Olave finished his time at Ohio State eclipsing David Boston‚Äôs previous career receiving touchdowns record of 34, amassing 35 through 2018-2021.
People have made the argument that Olave was the more talented player between him and Garrett Wilson at Ohio State despite Wilson‚Äôs numbers.
Among prospects in the first round, Olave could end up being a steal when it‚Äôs all said and done.
