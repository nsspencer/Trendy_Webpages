     Netflix's 'Pieces of Her' Has All the Ingredients of a Juicy Thriller Novel — Is It Based on One?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We all think we know our mothers.
Heck, in most cases, we spent nine months living inside their wombs.
Though they make us want to rip our hair out of our own scalps at times, we wouldn't trade them for anyone else.
But what if our mothers weren't who we thought they were?
In the new Netflix limited thriller series Pieces of Her, Andy Oliver (Bella Heathcote) thinks she knows her mother, Laura Oliver (Oscar nominee Toni Collette) — that is, until a violent local shooting changes everything.

     'Pieces of Her' assembles a Netflix mystery around Toni Collette's mom with a past
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "Pieces of Her" assembles another one of those small-boned thrillers that Netflix serves up in abundance, teasing out a fairly disposable mystery just good enough to get you to the end.
Then, in one sudden flash, a disturbed young man starts shooting up the diner where they're having lunch.
Laura leaps into action to save her child, revealing a side of her mom that takes Andy aback.
Directed by Minkie Spiro, "Pieces of Her" cuts back and forth between Laura's younger days and the present, unearthing shadowy figures as Andy begins peeling back the various layers.
That includes the younger Laura's messed-up family situation, her domineering father (Terry O'Quinn), and an earlier mother-daughter dynamic that might help explain their prickly relationship now.

     Pieces Of Her review: Toni Collette elevates no-frills thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The media attention draws shady figures from Laura’s past into their quiet suburban life, forcing Andy to go on the run with extremely specific instructions from her mother.
Laura and Andy’s tumultuous bond and respective emotional journeys ground the convoluted premise and back-and-forth between timelines.
AdvertisementAndy’s adventures as she looks into Laura’s life before Belle Isle become the show’s other enticing factor.
Pieces Of Her spends a lot of time building up to the obvious final reveal, but the payoff doesn’t remotely live up to expectations.
Despite its foreseeable conclusion, Pieces Of Her is still a pleasant thriller, especially due to Collette and Heathcote’s work.

     How Does Pieces of Her Stack Up Against the Original Novel?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But how does the show stack up against Slaughter’s novel?
Read on for a list of the most noticeable differences between the Netflix series and the novel that inspired it.
The Bad GuysIn both the book and the series, Andy spends a significant amount of time on the run, but from whom?
KYLE KAPLAN/NETFLIXLaura’s InvolvementIn the book, Laura does her best to keep a low profile, and she doesn’t reconnect with Andy until the climactic end of the story.
In the novel, however, Gordon has adopted Andy, and Slaughter makes it very clear that Andy and Laura both consider Gordon to be Andy’s father.

     ‘Pieces of Her’ Review: Even a Pissed-Off Toni Collette Can’t Salvage a Silly Netflix Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     David Cronenbeg’s 2005 film “A History of Violence” entwines itself around a nasty little premise.
His wife, Edie (Maria Bello), wonders why — until a gangster (Ed Harris) comes calling, alleging that Tom isn’t Tom at all, but a hitman named Joey Cusack who disappeared years ago under suspicious circumstances.
Her husband’s once serene identity is streaked in danger; a danger that only grows as his past comes to light.
As far as 30th birthdays go, Andy’s isn’t ideal.
Having left her life in the Big Apple to help her mother Laura (Toni Collette) through chemotherapy, Andy (Bella Heathcote) is living in the guest house and working as a 9-1-1 operator.

     Netflix’s ‘Pieces of Her’ is a tidy and effective thriller to binge this weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Pieces of Her,” premiering Friday on Netflix and based on the 2018 Karin Slaughter novel of the same name, is a tidy and effective thriller without much to say about the state of anything at all.
As exposition will make clear as they sit in a diner on Andy’s 30th birthday, Laura is concerned that Andy is not concerned enough about Andy and too concerned about Laura, and Andy is concerned that Laura is too concerned with Andy not being concerned enough about Andy and too concerned about Andy being concerned about Laura.
(Jessica Barden does nice work as Laura’s younger self, while resembling Collette not at all.)
At the same time, the series does a fair job of distracting you from such thoughts while events are in play, as on a roller coaster where you are too busy screaming to consider its construction.
Some of the payoffs seem a little too tidy; but they are tidy, at least.
