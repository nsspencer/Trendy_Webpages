     Pop star Dua Lipa on reclaiming viral moment she was bullied for
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dua Lipa is grateful for haters who bullied her five years ago.
Lipa — who is currently headlining her Future Nostalgia tour — said the online bullying did initially decrease her confidence.
I'm reclaiming it because there was a moment where actually it caused me a lot of grief.
I was being bullied online.
Lipa performs again Friday night at the Prudential Center in New Jersey, where she will do the dance for all to see.

     Dua Lipa Wore Pantaboots and a Pair of Furry, Over-the-Knee Boots in the Same Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Thursday, the Grammy winner stepped out in New York City wearing two different eccentric footwear looks fresh off the runway.
Lipa wore a pair of the Italian brand's infamous pantaboots (à la Julia Fox), this stiletto iteration in acid wash and bearing a diamond-pattern print.
She also wore a cropped zip-up denim bustier, again in acid wash, and carried a denim bag with a buckle strap.
For jewelry, she wore a silver chain choker necklace, small silver hoop earrings, and a stack of sparkly silver bracelets.

    </h2>

     The pop star told Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” that she brought the move back and will continue doing it on her Future Nostalgia Tour.
I went in and did more rehearsal,” Lipa told Fallon.
While touring, the pop singer said, she opens her Grammy-nominated “Don’t Start Now” with the now-iconic dance move as an act of affirmation.
She told Fallon the concert exceeded all her expectations as the audience “rode the wave,” with the floor shaking from the fans rocking to her music.
The super fan was invited onstage to dance with the pop singer, crossing that off his bucket list.

     Experts Compare Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” to Artikal Sound System’s “Live Your Life”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Earlier this week, Dua Lipa was hit with a copyright infringement lawsuit for her 2020 hit “Levitating.” Florida reggae band Artikal Sound System sued the British pop star, claiming that the Future Nostalgia track is a rip of their 2017 song “Live Your Life.” With cases like The Hollies vs. Radiohead and Marvin Gaye vs. “Blurred Lines” to songwriting credits being updated on tracks like Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U,” the world of copyright infringement is vast and ever-changing.
In the latest episode of Rolling Stone News, three musicologists break down a few of the musical elements of “Levitating” and “Live Your Life” and discuss the complexities of copyright law.

     Dua Lipa Accidentally Throws Her Microphone Into The Crowd While Performing — Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The ‘Levitating’ singer lost her grip on her microphone mid-song during a concert in Washington D.C., but she still managed to land all of her dance moves.
Dua Lipa had a small flub during her Washington D.C. stop on her “Future Nostalgia” tour on Wednesday March 2.
Dua reached down to try to grab it, and she looked like she laughed, as she delivered the lines.
During the tour, Dua also gave fans a peak into some of the ways she’s staying in shape and working out while on tour, namely through yoga.
The singer took to her Instagram to share a video of her showing off her flexibility on February 18.
