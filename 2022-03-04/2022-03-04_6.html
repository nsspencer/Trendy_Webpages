This year, it comes at a time when employers are taking a harder look at how to get and keep workers.
The pandemic has changed the work experience in dramatic ways, shifting the power to the employee.
Many employers, especially in the service industry, are desperate for employees, and having a near-impossible time finding them.

     Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailToday is Employee Appreciation Day, but with the Great Resignation ongoing, this might start feeling like an everyday occurrence.
Why it matters: When employees feel appreciated, they’re more likely to do a good job and less likely to leave.
“Workers want reassurance that their bosses and teammates like them,” the New York Times reports today.
More than half of workers say they’ve gotten new or increased benefits in the last six months, according to a recent The Harris Poll conducted by Fortune.
“Improved dental and vision benefits are among the most commonly reported benefit expansions, along with added health and wellness stipends, as well as options for permanent remote work,” Harris Poll reports.

     On Employee Appreciation Day 2022, Focus on Mental Health
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While nearly 90% said mental health, stress, and burnout are a priority, most had not yet identified strategies to promoting mental health.
As a result, many organizations are offering trainings to increase mental health literacy, increase empathy, and foster supportive conversations about mental health resources.
One option is Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), introduced to the U.S. in 2008 by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing.
Employee Appreciation Day 2022 marks an imperative to include greater focus on mental wellbeing, helping all employees — and businesses — thrive.
A National Trainer for the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, she trains and certifies Mental Health First Aid Instructors throughout the U.S. She is also a Mental Health First Aid Instructor, certifying First Aiders for businesses, schools, and organizations primarily in Northeastern U.S.
