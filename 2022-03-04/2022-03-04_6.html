     Matt Reeves Talks About A Certain Batman Deleted Scene With A Certain CharacterMaybe you've heard rumors about a particular character appearing in "The Batman."
Maybe you've heard about a deleted scene.
There is a scene towards the end of "The Batman" that would have worked just as well as an after-credits scene.
The rejection hurts him, and in his pain, he encounters another character in the cell next to him.
This new person talks about people raining on Riddler's parade, then says, "One day you're on top, the next you're a clown.

     ‘The Batman’: Matt Reeves Breaks Down The Origins Of The Surprise Cameo &amp; A Deleted Scene Featuring The Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     **For those who have seen “The Batman” in theaters, you are probably aware there isn’t some grand post-credits scene that teases what’s to come in the franchise.
However, in a scene right near the end, we are given a moment in Arkham Asylum between Paul Dano’s The Riddler and an “unnamed Arkham prisoner.” Well, in a new interview with IGN, Matt Reeves breaks down exactly who that prisoner is and why that scene is done in that way.
And yes, like all of the rumors assumed, the Joker of the Matt Reeves ‘Batman’ franchise is played by “Eternals” actor Barry Keoghan.
Reeves said there was a much bigger scene during the early part of the film that would have given us a peek into this proto-Joker character.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s as if all previous Caped Crusader movies were counterfeit versions of some Batman — not The Batman — and this new entry is here to correct the record.
Directed and co-written by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), The Batman represents the latest attempt by Warner Bros. to turn its best-known DC Comics superhero into a critical and commercial hit.
And The Lego Batman Movie a year later generated just two-thirds the ticket sales of its animated predecessor, The Lego Movie.

     Matt Reeves’ The Batman is finally upon us, after years and years of anticipation.
Ever since its moodier-than-usual trailer first premiered, The Batman has felt gloomier, stranger, and certainly more cinematic than your average superhero tentpole.

Martin Scorsese’s seething masterpiece is the granddaddy of grubby urban alienation movies, which means it only makes sense as a jumping-off point for a re-imagined, far grittier Batman story.

     'The Batman' Director Matt Reeves Wants to Put You Off-Kilter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jonathan Olley/DCThe Batman hit theaters on Friday, sending Robert Pattinson on a moody adventure as the Dark Knight detective.
The film is directed by Matt Reeves, whose task was to come up with a fresh take on Batman after many previous movies.
It was important to me that when Batman sees the mayor's son in the wake of what happens, that he is really looking at himself.
As a Year Two Batman, he's not as conscious as he should be about what's driving him.
In that story, there's an incident early on where Batman proves his worth and that he's trustworthy to Gordon.

     ‘The Batman’ Director Matt Reeves on Reinventing Bruce Wayne
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     To Matt Reeves, who directed and wrote the film along with Peter Craig, this version of Bruce Wayne isn’t unlike a movie director, trying to make sense of the world through an endless series of night shoots.
Related to that, the movie has an overall grunge aesthetic, even down to the way that we see Bruce Wayne in the black eye makeup he has to wear under the Batman cowl.
It’s interesting to think of being Batman as a creative outlet, as if the way he’s documenting his adventures in his diaries each night is an artistic project for him.
He’s got to evolve toward representing more than vengeance, otherwise he’s going to be just another toxic force.
He’s an original of a character who is very iconic for Batman.
