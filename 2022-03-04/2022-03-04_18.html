MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Virender Sehwag are the other four in the elite list.

     India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 1st Test, Day 2: Jadeja, Ashwin resume for IND; Pant headlines Kohli's 100th appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     India vs Sri Lanka, 1st Test, Day 2 Live Updates: Rishabh Pant smashed 96 to help India to 357 for six but the left-handed dasher narrowly missed out on his century after being bowled by fast bowler Suranga Lakmal.
Pant put on a key stand of 104 with fellow left-hander Ravindra Jadeja, who stood unbeaten on 45 at stumps on the opening day.
Pant stood firm with Jadeja to reach his eighth Test half-century, and then hammered Embuldeniya for two sixes and two fours in a 22-run over.
But Sri Lanka sent the former skipper back for 45 and Vihari, who made 58, in quick succession.
Jadeja (45 not out) and Ashwin (10 not out) closed out the day as India piled a 350-plus score.

     India vs Sri Lanka: Rishabh Pant blasts 96 in first Test; Twitter lauds gusty performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With India four down on 175, Pant and Shreyas Iyer kept the scoreboard moving to help the team reach 199/4.
On the first day of the first Test, India won the toss and chose to bat first.
The 24-year-old wicketkeeper was praised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for his brilliant knock of 96.
This is Rishabh’s 5th score in 90s…all of them stellar knocks enriching Test cricket.
— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) March 4, 2022Rishabh Pant will do to Test cricket what Adam Gilchrist did for us who grew up in 90s and 00s.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     India 357 for 6 (Pant 96, Vihari 58, Embuldeniya 2-107) vs Sri LankaSri Lanka managed to deny Virat Kohli even a fifty in his 100th Test.
They managed 44 of them on the day; Sri Lanka could string together just six maidens..
In a way, Sri Lanka were lucky they got the first five wickets with just 41 mistakes induced in the first 61.1 overs of the day.
This, though, would be the last time in a while that Sri Lanka would see a mistake from the batters.
Within 10 minutes, Sri Lanka had gone from "hang on, what if we get a couple of quick wickets" to looking completely listless.
