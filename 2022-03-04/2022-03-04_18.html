The Lakers put Jordan on concessions on Tuesday and used the spot on their roster to sign the veteran point guard/shooting guard.
Jordan, who signed at least a one-year, $2.6 million contract to join the Lakers this season, will save the Sixers $2.3 million in luxury taxes if he signs a free agent deal instead of demanding concessions.
Jordan started 19 games this season before leaving the team tournament.
Jordan was part of the All-NBA First Team with the Clippers in 2016, and was the All-NBA First Team’s All-Defensive pick twice in 2015 and 2016.

Jordan is expected to spell top star Joel Embiid who has been having a great NBA season.

     CAMDEN, N.J. — The Philadelphia 76ers made another move in the buyout market, bringing in 14-year veteran DeAndre Jordan to be the new backup to Joel Embiid.
The Sixers have been looking for someone to replace Andre Drummond, and it looks like Jordan is the guy.
But he is a veteran who can help a team looking to win a championship right now.
“I was talking to Doc about it and he talked to me like ‘It’s gonna be good for you.
I know what he’s gonna do for the team and I’m excited to learn from someone like that.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!
