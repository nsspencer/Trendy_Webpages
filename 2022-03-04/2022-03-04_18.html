     Watch : Ciara Says Daughter Sienna Is a "Baby Boss"After nearly six years of marriage, "I Bet" Ciara wasn't expecting Russell Wilson to pop that question!
Holding onto a large bouquet of roses that Russell had given to her, Ciara prefaced their chat by saying that he always makes her "really nervous," adding, "I always feel so vulnerable when I'm with you in this setting."
"I'm gonna make you more nervous right now," Russell jokingly replied before getting down on one knee.
Ciara shouted.
The Seattle Seahawks quarterback asked: "Can we have more babies?

The Seattle Seahawks quarterback joined the Grammy-winning singer as she guest-hosted "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on Friday, presenting her with an armful of roses.

Ciara noted during the chat that she thinks it's awesome how wonderful a father Russell Wilson is.
Finally, the "Level Up" singer told him: Sure, but not right now.

     Ciara Showed Off a New Bixie Cut at the 2022 Billboard Women in Music Awards

     Locs, a blonde bob, waist-length red hair: The "Ride" singer quite literally never looks bad in any style, cut, or color she chooses to wear.
Her middle name may be Princess, but if you ask us, she moves like a bonafide queen in the hair department.
And while, yes, the singer is something of a chameleon, she's favored her waist-length, honey-highlighted waves for quite some time.
Ciara's newest Instagram post shows her with a brand-new cut: a bixie, which she wore to the 2022 Billboard Women in Music Awards.
She's had short hair before, but this time, it's got some some volume thanks to a well-placed side part.
