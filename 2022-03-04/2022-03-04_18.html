     Former NFL Lineman Shane Olivea Dead At 40
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shane Olivea, a former NFL offensive lineman and Ohio State University standout, has died at the age of 40.
NFL Vice President of Football Development Roman Oben, who was Olivea's teammate during all four of his NFL seasons with the then-San Diego Chargers, initially announced news of the former offensive tackle's death.
"Very sad to hear the news of my former teammate Shane Olivea.
Olivea, a two-time Second Team All-Big Ten (2002, 2003) selection at Ohio State, was selected by the Chargers in the seventh-round of the 2004 NFL Draft at No.
The now-Los Angeles Chargers -- the franchise Olivea spent all four of his NFL seasons from 2004-07 -- paid tribute to the former lineman in a news release shared after Oben's tweet.
