     Here's What Kevin Durant Said After The Nets Lost To The Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets lost to the Miami Heat on Thursday night at Barclays Center, and after the game Kevin Durant spoke to reporters.
The Brooklyn Nets lost 113-107 to the Miami Heat on their home floor at Barclays Center on Thursday evening.
However, the good news was the fact that Kevin Durant played 35 minutes and scored 31 points in his first time playing since January 15.
After the loss, Durant spoke to the media, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of SNY's Nets Videos.
The Nets fell to 32-32 on the season, which currently has them as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference.

     Nets fall to Heat in Kevin Durant's return as team continues to sputter: 'We just didn’t react very well'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The loss dropped Brooklyn to 32-32 on the season, marking the first time since October that they have been .500.
Durant scored 31 points in his return, but miscommunications and Erik Spoelstra’s zone defense cost the Nets in the second half.
Harris hasn’t played since November and his return has looked doubtful for weeks, but it puts further strain on the current roster to figure each other out ahead of the playoffs.
It also makes the Nets more dependent on Seth Curry , Goran Dragić and Patty Mills to provide offensive support for Brooklyn’s stars, especially whenever Ben Simmons makes his debut.
The Heat showed just how hard that will be.

     Does Kevin Durant Have Enough Help To Keep Brooklyn Nets Afloat?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s been a common sentiment surrounding the Brooklyn Nets throughout the 2021-22 NBA season.
Any team with Kevin Durant has a chance to do some serious damage.

Right now, the Brooklyn Nets are back to .500 following the loss to the Miami Heat and remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
The small ball lineups the Brooklyn Nets could deploy with Ben Simmons alongside near 7-footer Kevin Durant will be tough for teams to guard when there is chemistry established.

     Kevin Durant has 31 points in return, but Heat rally to beat Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant's shot looked good the whole way, one that would have given the Brooklyn Nets the lead with under a minute left.
After their season went sideways when Durant went down, the Nets will need those to start falling — and he believes they will.
Durant had 31 points in his first game since Jan. 15 and his return from a 21-game absence with a sprained left knee ligament inspired the Nets to a 16-point lead.
"Spo tricks us with that zone," said Goran Dragic, the former Heat guard who made his first start for the Nets.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets' playoff hopes received a big boost with the return of Kevin Durant, who suited up against the Miami Heat on Thursday after missing a month of action with an MCL sprain.
The good news for Brooklyn is Durant is good enough to carry the Nets for the home stretch on his own if he hits the ground running.
With that being said, right now, the Nets are closer to missing the playoffs altogether than guaranteeing their spot in the postseason.
