     Julia Fox says being around rapper Kanye West was “like a crash course on how to be famous.” And some parts were even real.
The two were, of course, involved in a whirlwind six-week relationship that by her account included about 15 days in each other’s company.
News that Fox had dumped Ye — that’s his new legal name — came on Valentine’s Day.
And now she’s changed her take on their involvement from real to something, oh, slightly to the left of real.
But it also felt like I was being cast in the role of his girlfriend — and he was casting me,” she told NYT.
