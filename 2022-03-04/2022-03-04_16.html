     Vince McMahon Recalls Promoters Putting A "Hit" Out On Him In The 80s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon joined The Pat McAfee Show yesterday for a rare, hour-long interview.
Among the many stories Vince McMahon relayed was how many times he had received death threats over the years.
In particular, he claimed to have heard a story from Jim Ross that several of his competitors in the 80s, including Cowboy Bill Watts and other NWA promoters, talked up ideas to threaten him.
McMahon claimed Ross covertly hid in a bathroom stall, hearing all about how these other promoters were plotting against him.
He’s thinking, he doesn’t give a sh-t about Vince McMahon.

     Keith Lee Talks Criticism from Vince McMahon, WWE Bearcat Gimmick with Chris Jericho
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Photo credit: WWENewly signed AEW star Keith Lee sat down with Chris Jericho on Friday to discuss a number of topics, including his final days in WWE before getting released.
During an appearance on Talk Is Jericho, Lee was asked about the circumstances that led up to his WWE departure in November.
He wanted some intense guy, and I think that I can be intense, but I need a reason to be intense."
The character McMahon ultimately tried to get Lee to become was Keith "Bearcat" Lee, but the gimmick was short-lived before Lee was released.
Lee divulged that he initially told McMahon he wasn't comfortable with the character, which led to him coming back under his normal Keith Lee persona in July after a five-month absence due to COVID-19 complications.

     Vince McMahon Admits He Expected More From His Family Members
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Throughout WWE's history, Vince McMahon's family have been heavily involved in the running of the company.
Vince's wife Linda McMahon previously served as the company's CEO, while daughter Stephanie previously worked on WWE creative and is currently the promotion's Chief Brand Officer.
The question of who will succeed Vince McMahon as CEO of WWE remains unanswered despite the WWE Chairman now being 76-years-old but Pat McAfee did press McMahon on the issue during their interview on Thursday.
Vince revealed he ultimately does not think about it before he admitted he expected more from his family members.
And quite frankly, I've probably expected more, you know out of my family members, which is probably not the right thing to say.

     Vince McMahon Reveals Why He Hates The Term “Wrestling”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vince McMahon has revealed why he hates the term “wrestling” and how it’s all down to marketing.
For a number of years it has been said that the phrase “professional wrestling” is a dirty word in WWE.
While commentators and on-screen figures are banned from using the word “wrestling” across the company programming.
“There’s always been wrestling,” said McMahon “I wanted to separate us from everybody else.
“The Panda got us to a certain extent, because the World Wildlife Fund… I didn’t even know it existed,” said Vince.

Vince McMahon has explained and defended WWE’s decision to release close to 200 wrestlers over the last two years.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, WWE has released well over 200 wrestlers and behind-the-scenes staff.
Now, in a rare interview with Pat McAfee, Vince McMahon has explained why so many wrestlers were let go.
McMahon told the former NFL star that the decisions he makes on who cuts released are not personal, but are purely based on what’s best for business.

During his appearance on The Pat McAfee show, Vince McMahon spoke about the death threats he received after he took over WWE.
I always felt like if you could knock off a President of United States, then I’m easy to get.
In those days, it was like when you, from their standpoint, invaded their territory, it was like okay it’s not just fighting words.”However, Vince McMahon did not budge from his dreams.
