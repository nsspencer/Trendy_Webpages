During his appearance on The Pat McAfee show, Vince McMahon spoke about the death threats he received after he took over WWE.
I always felt like if you could knock off a President of United States, then I’m easy to get.
In those days, it was like when you, from their standpoint, invaded their territory, it was like okay it’s not just fighting words.”However, Vince McMahon did not budge from his dreams.

     Keith Lee Talks Criticism from Vince McMahon, WWE Bearcat Gimmick with Chris Jericho
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Photo credit: WWENewly signed AEW star Keith Lee sat down with Chris Jericho on Friday to discuss a number of topics, including his final days in WWE before getting released.
During an appearance on Talk Is Jericho, Lee was asked about the circumstances that led up to his WWE departure in November.
He wanted some intense guy, and I think that I can be intense, but I need a reason to be intense."
The character McMahon ultimately tried to get Lee to become was Keith "Bearcat" Lee, but the gimmick was short-lived before Lee was released.
Lee divulged that he initially told McMahon he wasn't comfortable with the character, which led to him coming back under his normal Keith Lee persona in July after a five-month absence due to COVID-19 complications.

You ride it all the way to the end.’ I can respect that, I can respect Vince.

Vince McMahon has explained and defended WWE’s decision to release close to 200 wrestlers over the last two years.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, WWE has released well over 200 wrestlers and behind-the-scenes staff.
Now, in a rare interview with Pat McAfee, Vince McMahon has explained why so many wrestlers were let go.
McMahon told the former NFL star that the decisions he makes on who cuts released are not personal, but are purely based on what’s best for business.

     Vince McMahon Reveals Why He Hates The Term “Wrestling”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vince McMahon has revealed why he hates the term “wrestling” and how it’s all down to marketing.
For a number of years it has been said that the phrase “professional wrestling” is a dirty word in WWE.
While commentators and on-screen figures are banned from using the word “wrestling” across the company programming.
“There’s always been wrestling,” said McMahon “I wanted to separate us from everybody else.
“The Panda got us to a certain extent, because the World Wildlife Fund… I didn’t even know it existed,” said Vince.
