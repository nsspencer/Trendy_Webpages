     Rocket moon crash LIVE – Massive rocket part traveling at 5,800mph ‘hits moon’ after being spotted by expert Bill Gray
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AN OUT-OF-CONTROL rocket part the size of a school bus has likely smashed into the Moon's surface by now.
According to astronomers, a rocket booster was set to hit the lunar surface at around 7.25am ET (12:25 GMT) after spending nearly eight years tumbling through space.
The rocket part was first spotted by Bill Gray, who writes the popular Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects.
However, Bill later retracted his claim and said the rocket part most likely belonged to China.

     A much-debated piece of space junk, suspected to be part of a Chinese rocket that helped launch a 2014 lunar mission, hit the far side of the moon, scientists say.
The bus-sized third stage of a Long March 3C rocket was expected to crash into the moon at about 7:25 a.m.
Originally, astronomers thought the space junk was a SpaceX rocket launched seven years ago.

     Chinese Rocket Strikes Far Side Of The Moon; Expected To Create 20-metre-wide Crater
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The abandoned rocket part, which was on a collision course with the Moon, crashed into the lunar surface on March 4.
The collision occurred at 5:55 pm (IST) in the Hertzsprung Crater, which is on the far side of the moon.
According to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the rocket weighs approximately 4 tonnes and crashed into the Moon at a speed of 9,300 kilometres per hour.
Today, 4 March at 13:25 CET, a rocket upper stage weighing ~4 tonnes will hit the far side of the Moon🌑 at a speed of 9300 km/h.
Not to worry – @DLR_de researchers confirm: Today’s impact is harmless for us on Earth, the #Moon has already withstood far greater impacts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The hardware came barreling head-on at the lunar surface at 5,800 miles an hour, into an existing, enormous crater.
According to Gray, the space junk turned out to be a discarded rocket booster from a Chinese mission that sent a spacecraft toward the moon in 2014.
When you think about it that way, we’re kind of throwing trash at the moon.
Read: The moon is leaving usThis past January, Gray noticed that the rocket debris was tracing a path directly toward the moon.
The collision sparked a bunch of news stories because, well, we’re just throwing trash at the moon now, and this trash appeared to have originated with SpaceX and its divisive CEO, Elon Musk.

     3-ton rocket almost certainly just smashed into the moon at 5,771 mph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After at least seven years hurtling through space, a 3- ton (2.7 metric tons) discarded rocket stage has probably smashed into the moon today (March 4) at a blistering 5,771 mph (9,288 km/h).
This is the first time that space junk has accidentally collided with the lunar surface, according to scientists.
Chinese foreign ministry officials deny that the space junk is theirs, insisting that the Chang'e 5 rocket already burned up on re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.
Further evidence came Tuesday (March 1), when the U.S. Department of Defense's Space Command, which tracks low-Earth orbit space junk, released a statement confirming that China's 2014 rocket never deorbited.
Although this is the first piece of space junk to unintentionally collide with the moon, it isn't the first time a human-made satellite has crashed there.

     After mistaken identity and confusion, a piece of space junk slams into the Moon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After years of zooming through deep space, a presumed leftover piece of a Chinese rocket slammed into the Moon today, just as space tracking experts expected it would.
First of all, the vehicle was never intended to crash into the Moon, making it a rare piece of space debris to find its way to the lunar surface by accident.
The 18SPCS is much more focused on tracking space debris in closer orbits to Earth, as the space environment there has become much more crowded.
The 18SPCS claimed that once the Chang’e 5-T1 rocket passed more than 22,000 miles beyond Earth, their official trackers de-prioritized following the object.
The collision shouldn’t really be a cause for concern, especially since we’ve crashed plenty of objects on the lunar surface before.
