     Looking for a new show to binge-watch now that Love Is Blind Season 2 is over?
Netflix has you covered, as Nick and Vanessa Lachey return to host the brand-new reality series The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On, premiering April 6, which follows already established couples as their relationships are put to the test with an ultimatum: get married or break up for good.
An ultimatum is issued – and in just over eight weeks, they must commit to marriage, or move on.
It is doing the complete opposite,” states a worried contestant at the end of the trailer.

     ‘Love Is Blind’ star Shake says he’s attracted to Vanessa Lachey — in front of Nick Lachey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The premise for “Love Is Blind” is right there in the title.
However, as fans witnessed during the reunion special, he still believes in speaking his mind and voicing his hot takes, even when that means declaring his attraction to Vanessa Lachey, right in front of her husband and co-host, Nick Lachey.
Then the polarizing contestant said something that left his co-stars cringing and covering their faces — and left Nick Lachey looking stunned.
"Love Is Blind" co-hosts Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey in season two of the Netflix hit.
Adam Rose / Netflix"Unfortunately, the only one I’m attracted to is Vanessa," Chatterjee said.
