    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Eyes across the country are on the race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Pat Toomey.
You have to vote, and I'm very disappointed when people don't vote," said Herb Kaufman of Lower Moreland, as he arrived at Huntingdon Valley Library to cast his ballot.
"The Senate, I think Oz has too much Hollywood stuff," said voter Andrew Krick.
"I did vote for Trump, but he seemed to be endorsing candidates I don't really care for right now," added Krick.Barnette, who voted in Huntingdon Valley on Tuesday morning, has seen a late surge.
I'm feeling really good that it's in the hands of Pennsylvanians," said Barnette on her way in to vote.Barnette has repeated false claims the 2020 election was stolen.

     Final Odds as Kathy Barnette Faces Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz is still the favorite to win the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary despite a significant surge from rival Kathy Barnette.
Trump had said Monday that he didn't believe that Barnette could win the general election against "Radical Left Democrats."
The bookmaker has declared Oz the 2/9 favorite to win the GOP Senate candidacy in Pennsylvania, having been 8/11 the previous week.
A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey conducted between May 12 and 15 revealed that the battle between Oz and Barnette could be closer still.
When asked if the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania Senate election was held "today," 28 percent said they would back Oz, with Barnette close behind in second place on 27 percent.

     Photos of Senate candidate Kathy Barnette marching near Proud Boys on Jan. 6 surface online. Will it matter?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photographs showing a Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate marching near Proud Boys members on Jan. 6 have stirred controversy online.
Pictures of Kathy Barnette, a political commentator from Montgomery County, marching near two Proud Boys members who were later indicted for entering the U.S. Capitol Building that day began spreading online late Sunday night.
"She has no connection whatsoever to the proud boys (sic)."
In a video posted to Barnette's YouTube page a few weeks after the 2020 Election, she alleged deceased voters, noncitizens and unregistered people cast ballots in the 4th District.
Barnette's views on the 2020 election are not unique among the seven candidates currently vying for the GOP Senate ballot spot.

     Kathy Barnette Can Win the PA Senate Seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once polling over the last week showed Kathy Barnette had made a breathtaking rush to contention in Pennsylvania's Republican primary for an open U.S. Senate seat, the establishment long knives came for her.
But this belated, transparently gratuitous hatchet job may falter because Kathy Barnette can win in November.
Consider that the Democratic nominee for this Senate seat will be sitting Lt. Gov.
This is not Ohio, where Trump endorsed an outsider populist who managed to overcome feckless opposition in the Republican Senate primary.
Even as he was claiming she cannot win, Trump acknowledged Barnette may "have a wonderful future in the Republican Party."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Idaho, Kentucky and Oregon are also holding primaries that are the next tests of former President Trump's influence over Republican primary voters.
When pressed about his past statements on abortion at a recent debate, Oz said he's proud to have an endorsement from his mother-in-law, who is an ordained minister.
A Fox News poll released last week showed Oz, McCormick and Barnette in a statistical three-way tie.
"Dr. Oz is the only one who will be able to easily defeat the Crazed, Lunatic Democrat in Pennsylvania," Trump said.
