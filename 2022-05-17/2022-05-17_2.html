    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 17, 2022 at 9:03 PM EDTThe Pelicans are in a decent position with the core they've already put together.
They can package the No.
8 overall pick with a few players to upgrade the roster or draft another young piece to go around Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.
My guess is they keep this pick and use it to strengthen their depth with one more young asset they can keep around at a relatively cheap price.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It used to be that the team that finished the season with the worst overall record would have the highest draft odds, and would be guaranteed of a top-four pick, but that isn't quite the case anymore.
The league smoothed the odds in 2019 in an attempt to curb tanking, and now the league's three worst teams record-wise all have equal odds of landing the top pick.
The team with the worst overall record is now guaranteed a top-five pick.
It is on that date that teams will officially find out where they pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, which will take place on June 23.
In the meantime, here's a look at the lottery odds for the 14 teams that will likely be participating.
