     GrubHub Was Getting 6000 Orders A Minute During Its Promo Today That Left Restaurant Workers Stressed And Customers Hangry

     Summary: ‚ÄúIt got overwhelming,‚Äù said Brandon Ching, who was working the counter at Greenberg‚Äôs Bagels, a popular sandwich spot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
‚ÄúWe were short-staffed today so it really added extra stress to my day."
"It's been a complete disaster," Nathaniel, a Manhattan resident who asked that his last name not be used, told BuzzFeed News.
He'd been thrilled that his order from a highly-rated sushi restaurant went through but after an hour of waiting, no response from the restaurant and nothing from GrubHub, he cancelled the order.

     Grubhub overwhelmed after offering New Yorkers free lunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photograph: ShutterstockGrubhub offered to buy New Yorkers lunch on Tuesday, and a lot of people took them up on it.
‚ÄúWe had unprecedented pre-order demand, more than we‚Äôve ever actually seen,‚Äù said Christopher Krautler, the company‚Äôs director of consumer public relations.
Some customers may have been rerouted or met with an error message as a result, Kreutler said.
Discounting is a common tactic among third-party delivery companies as they look to attract customers and drive up order volumes.
The New York Post reported last week that restaurants in the city weren‚Äôt expecting much from the free lunch promotion because of how frequent such discounts have become.

     Summary: Apparently, New Yorkers can‚Äôt say no to a free lunch, even if they have to work extra hard for the deal.
‚ÄúWe saw an unprecedented amount (of orders), more than we‚Äôve seen before with any promotion,‚Äù said Grubhub spokesman Christopher Krautler.
At some points, Krautler said Grubhub was trying to process 6,000 orders per minute from its New York customers.
Romero added that the promotion clearly struck a chord at a time when diners are feeling the financial pinch.
But he eventually got the app to work and was soon rewarded with a free lunch of vegan nachos.

     Grubhub‚Äôs ‚ÄòFree Lunch‚Äô Promo Went Predictably Haywire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The delivery app Grubhub announced last week that it would be providing New Yorkers with ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù between the hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. today.
The same Post report identified that promotions like this one have become increasingly common across food delivery services, as delivery loses the popularity it enjoyed during the peak of the pandemic.
As such, what consumers get is increasingly desperate attempts from delivery platforms to earn goodwill and bring in business.
Still, Grubhub has proven one thing true: ‚ÄúFree lunch‚Äù will always be a siren song, even if it‚Äôs not actually free.
For everyone still waiting on their lunch orders, well, let‚Äôs hope you‚Äôre tipping well ‚Äî and preferably in cash.
