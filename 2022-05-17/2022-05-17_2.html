     Ezra Miller Accused Of Theft By Other Artists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miller is now being accused of stealing music that did not belong to them.
Even the tracks that Miller was not part of were posted on Soundcloud without any of the artists’ permission to do so.
Miller clearly does not care about his behavior right now, and these artists don’t want anyone to have to fall for working with the actor after this instance.
Ezra Miller has had a string of odd and terrible behavior for months on end.
Ezra Miller might need some counseling and AA meetings because there is something obviously going wrong with the once prominent actor.
