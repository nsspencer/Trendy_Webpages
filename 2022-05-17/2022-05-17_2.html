     Josh Shapiro to Face Doug Mastriano in Pa. Governor's Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doug Mastriano, the ultra-conservative state senator from central Pennsylvania, won the Republican primary for Pennsylvania governor, NBC News projects, setting up a race against Democrat Josh Shapiro in the November general election.
With the victory, Mastriano completed a meteoric rise through the state Republican Party ranks, despite efforts from many of the party’s establishment trying to keep him from winning the nomination.
Shapiro, the state attorney general and a former Montgomery County commissioner who lives in Abington Township, did not have any opponents for the Democratic nomination for governor.
He had so much cash, in fact, that in the closing weeks of the primary election cycle, his campaign bought television ads promoting Mastriano.
Republicans tried to stop Mastriano’s momentum in the last month by coalescing around Lou Barletta, a former congressman from Northeast Pennsylvania.

Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.

     Summary: Doug Mastriano, backed by Trump, wins crowded Pennsylvania GOP primary for governorEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesPennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano has emerged as the winner from a crowded Republican primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
A retired Army colonel, Mastriano has risen to prominence espousing far-right views directly to a homegrown network of online supporters.
For that, Mastriano received Trump's endorsement.
Mastriano supports banning the procedure after six weeks and introduced a bill to that effect in the state Senate.
Some, like state Republican party member Jezree Friend, point to President Trump's narrow statewide win in 2016 – and slightly larger loss in 2020 – as proof.

Minutes after NBC News projected the contest, Fetterman, who is in the hospital recovering from a health scare in the closing days of the race, tweeted his gratitude to voters.
Control of the Senate is going to come down to Pennsylvania, and we have to flip this seat.
We have a hard fight ahead of us — but Pennsylvania is worth fighting for,” Fetterman said in a written statement.
