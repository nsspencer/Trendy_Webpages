     Summary: Fetterman wins Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, GOP race is too close to callEnlarge this image toggle caption Marc Levy/AP Marc Levy/APJohn Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, easily won the state's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate on Tuesday, but the Republican race appeared headed for a recount.
The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary.
Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary, which was a two-candidate race early Wednesday with celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz holding a two-tenths of a percentage point lead over former hedge fund CEO David McCormick.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.

Brad Little will win reelection, CNN projected , fending off an unusual challenge from his lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, whom Trump had endorsed.
In North Carolina's Senate race, Rep. Ted Budd will win the GOP nomination to replace retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, CNN projected Tuesday.

Primaries in North Carolina, Idaho, Kentucky, OregonThe GOP Senate primary in North Carolina, where Republican incumbent Richard Burr isn't seeking re-election, had particularly high stakes.

     Pa. primary 2022: Doug Mastriano wins GOP nomination for governor, will face Democrat Josh Shapiro · Spotlight PA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HARRISBURG — Doug Mastriano is the projected winner of Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for governor, defeating a crowded field in a high-stakes race that will shape the state’s future.
In November, Mastriano will face Democrat Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s current attorney general who faced no opposition from members of his party.
In the leadup to May 17, establishment Republicans attempted to stop Mastriano from winning, fearful that his rhetoric would drive away moderates in the general election.
Running unopposed gave him an instant advantage over the crowded, nine-way primary field of GOP contenders.
Pennsylvania is among a minority of states that elects its governors and lieutenant governors separately in the primary, but then as a single ticket in the general election.
