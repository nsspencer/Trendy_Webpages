     Watch! SI Swimsuit Cover Star Maye Musk Talks Long, Incredible Modeling Career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2022 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star Maye Musk has had an amazing, lengthy modeling career—and led something of a double life while doing so!
Five years after becoming CoverGirl’s oldest spokesperson, at 74, she is now the oldest rookie to grace the cover of SI Swimsuit.
But she told Sports Illustrated Swimsuit that, to her own surprise, her modeling days were far from over.
“I got all these calls, ‘Maye, are you on a billboard in Times Square?’ ‘Yes, yes, that’s what I do part-time,'” she recalled to SI Swimsuit about the amazing career highlight when she was in her sixties.
It’s pretty easy to see why Musk lives by the motto, #ItsGreatToBe74.”For even more on Musk’s incredible career, watch the video below.
