The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary.
Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.

     Summary: Doug Mastriano, backed by Trump, wins crowded Pennsylvania GOP primary for governorEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesPennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano has emerged as the winner from a crowded Republican primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
A retired Army colonel, Mastriano has risen to prominence espousing far-right views directly to a homegrown network of online supporters.
For that, Mastriano received Trump's endorsement.
Mastriano supports banning the procedure after six weeks and introduced a bill to that effect in the state Senate.
Some, like state Republican party member Jezree Friend, point to President Trump's narrow statewide win in 2016 – and slightly larger loss in 2020 – as proof.

     Summary: PITTSBURGH — John Fetterman is the winner of the Democratic nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, NBC News projected Tuesday.
Minutes after NBC News projected the contest, Fetterman, who is in the hospital recovering from a health scare in the closing days of the race, tweeted his gratitude to voters.
Control of the Senate is going to come down to Pennsylvania, and we have to flip this seat.
We have a hard fight ahead of us — but Pennsylvania is worth fighting for,” Fetterman said in a written statement.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pennsylvania's chaotic Republican Senate primary was too close to call early Wednesday, with celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz locked in a tight race with former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick.
Primaries in North Carolina, Idaho, Kentucky, OregonThe GOP Senate primary in North Carolina, where Republican incumbent Richard Burr is retiring, had particularly high stakes.
The Senate race is expected to be one of the most expensive in the battle for control of the chamber this fall.
Trump inserted himself into the Senate race there early, endorsing Sean Parnell, an Army veteran and unsuccessful congressional candidate in 2020.
Oz has vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if he wins the Senate race.

     Pa. primary 2022: Doug Mastriano wins GOP nomination for governor, will face Democrat Josh Shapiro · Spotlight PA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HARRISBURG — Doug Mastriano is the projected winner of Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for governor, defeating a crowded field in a high-stakes race that will shape the state’s future.
In November, Mastriano will face Democrat Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s current attorney general who faced no opposition from members of his party.
In the leadup to May 17, establishment Republicans attempted to stop Mastriano from winning, fearful that his rhetoric would drive away moderates in the general election.
Running unopposed gave him an instant advantage over the crowded, nine-way primary field of GOP contenders.
Pennsylvania is among a minority of states that elects its governors and lieutenant governors separately in the primary, but then as a single ticket in the general election.
