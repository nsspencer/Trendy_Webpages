    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taco Bell fans, rejoice: The beloved Mexican Pizza has returned.
Fans can get early access to the Mexican Pizza by redeeming an offer available through the Taco Bell app.
Early access is only available Tuesday and Wednesday, after which the item will formally become available to all customers Thursday.
"Mexican Pizza has a long history with the brand and I'm glad we could give fans what they crave and bring our classic Mexican Pizza back home where it belongs," Taco Bell CEO Mark King said in a statement last month.
Taco Bell is also collaborating with country music legend Dolly Parton on a musical inspired by the Mexican Pizza, which will premiere on TikTok May 26.

     Taco Bell Menu Brings Back Its Classic Mexican Pizza (Sort Of)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I am what one would call a Mexican Pizza devotee.
Since the early '90s, I would make periodic journeys to the Taco Bell closest to my house to acquire an item that transcended all definition.
TheStreetThe New Mexican Pizza: What's Different?
But since Taco Bell mentioned in a press release that "the masterminds in the Taco Bell test kitchen worked to streamline operations and ingredient sourcing, and leave a lighter footprint at the same time," I expected this could mean a change in the meal I have so enjoyed over the years.
The rest of the Mexican Pizza tastes about the same as I remember, from cheese to tomatoes.

     Taco Bell’s Mexican pizza is back, and fans are fired up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She recently used the Mexican pizza revival in a Facebook post advertising a real estate listing for a three-bedroom, two-bath home near the beach — and other amenities.
“We are droooooling over this property &amp; the fact that Taco Bell’s Mexican Pizza can be found only a few blocks away … Both COMING SOON!” it read, punctuated by a pair of pizza slice emoji.
Her boss, who’s also a Taco Bell fan, mentioned the proximity of the home to Taco Bell as a joke.
AdvertisementFirst, we have to acknowledge that the Mexican pizza is neither distinctly Mexican nor pizza (as the old “Saturday Night Live” sketch goes: “Discuss!”).
(“2 more days until the Mexican Pizza is back and all my problems go away,” wrote one fan this week.)
