     Lionel Messi’s agents deny reports star will become Inter Miami player-owner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi will reportedly acquire 35% of shares in Inter Miami and then join the MLS club when his contract with Paris Saint-Germain ends next year.
Messi, who owns a condo in Miami Beach, has long been linked with a late-career move to the three-year-old Major League Soccer club.
But those rumors were given new life on Monday when Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham posted Instagram photos of himself with PSG stars Messi, Neymar, Sergio Ramos and Kylian Mbappe.
“Leo Messi is still one of the best players in the world, his skills have not diminished,” Inter Miami co-owner and executive director Jorge Mas told the Miami Herald back in February.
“I believe, and David [Beckham] has a relationship with him, that if he leaves PSG, at the time he leaves PSG we would love to have Messi as a player at Inter Miami and be part of our community.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For most of his career, it was impossible to picture Lionel Messi in any other jersey than the blue and maroon of Barcelona.
What the USMNTer turned broadcaster didn’t deny is there’s indeed momentum behind Messi joining the MLS in what would be the biggest league signing in 15 years.
AdvertisementMessi coming to MLS would be a second chance to put the league on display to the world.
The MLS is also now more spread through North America, obviously as adding 16 teams would do to any professional league.
The national showcase for the league of Messi would bring plenty of eyes to the product that with the digital awareness that MLS now has, would make repeating the Beckham flop nearly impossible.

     Summary: Beckham’s Instagram post comes amid reports Messi may come to Inter Miami in the summer of 2023, with a reported 35% ownership stake connected to his potential arrival.
The news stems from Alex Candal of DIRECTV Sports .
That move doesn’t seem imminent, but it continues a long line of the Argentine superstar being linked to Beckham’s South Florida-based club.
The 34-year-old forward is under contract at PSG through June 2023, so the timelines could align.

     Summary: There are no plans in place for Lionel Messi to buy a stake in David Beckham’s co-owned MLS club Inter Miami - and join the side as a player next season - according to the PSG forward’s family.
Reports in April suggested that he had decided to continue his stay at PSG for the second year of the deal he signed on arrival.
The 34-year-old has endured a difficult season in France, where he never quite hit the ground running - by his standards at least.
Despite PSG’s exit in the last-16, his Champions League form was better, scoring five times in seven games.

     Lionel Messi to MLS: Superstar not committed to move to David Beckham's Inter Miami, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A source close to Lionel Messi has denied a report that the Paris Saint-Germain superstar will be investing in MLS club Inter Miami before joining as a player in 2023, and this comes just a day after being photographed with co-owner and president David Beckham in Doha, per a report in Le Parisen.
Obviously, Inter Miami fans have plenty of reason to hope they land Messi, especially since the results haven't been there since the club began, winning 19 of 57 matches in the league.
And we already know that Messi has invested in real estate in Miami, he owns an entire floor in a luxury condo building there.
The fact that Inter Miami are owned by Beckham, adds another wrinkle, as Beckham was previously the league's highest profile transfer, moving to the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.
Messi's current contract with PSG expires in June of 2023, opening up a potential move to MLS.

     Messi, Inter Miami deny report of agreement to play for, own club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami have been linked to one another for quite some time, but the Argentina legend’s camp and MLS club have moved to deny a report that suggests a future pairing of the two sides is a done deal.
A report from Madrid-based DirecTV Sports correspondent Álex Candal stated that Messi would be joining Inter Miami upon the expiration of his PSG contract in 2023 in a deal that would also see him acquire a 35% stake in the club.
A subsequent report from Le Parisien flatly denied the comments, alleging them to be “completely false,” while Miami sources also denied any arrangement to the Miami Herald.
Messi and Beckham are linked through Adidas sponsorship and they just spent time together in Qatar through a PSG initiative.
Messi also spent time vacationing in Miami after winning the 2021 Copa América title with Argentina and owns property in the area.

     Summary: But Messi’s agents have refuted these new claims, calling them “completely false” and emphasizing that Messi has not yet made up his mind.
If Messi were to decide to make the move, he wouldn’t be the first European star to do so, but by far the most recognizable name.
Beckham posted a photo with Messi on Instagram Monday, fueling the rumor mill, despite the Argentine’s reps’ rebuttal.
Part of the deal that brought Beckham to America was the option for him to buy his own MLS team.
But don’t think the $200 million price tag for an ownership stake is too high for the future Hall of Famer.

     Lionel Messi's Agent Calls Rumors Involving MLS' Inter Miami FC 'Completely False'

     Summary: John Berry/Getty ImagesLionel Messi may be coming to MLS, but his agent denied a report suggesting it will certainly happen.
However, Messi's agent told Le Parisien (h/t TMZ Sports), "Leo has not yet decided on his future.
The 34-year-old's resume includes seven Ballons d'Or, four UEFA Champions League titles, 10 La Liga titles, two FIFA Men's Player of the Year awards and two UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards.
He has won the league title in his first year in Paris but fell short of winning the club's first Champions League title, which was likely its primary aim in bringing Messi to the club.
Inter Miami would immediately become one of, if not the biggest draw in the league with the star power of Messi.
