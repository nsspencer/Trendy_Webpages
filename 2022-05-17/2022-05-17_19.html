     The Diagnosis That Is Overused On The Good Doctor According To Fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Learn MoreThe Diagnosis That Is Overused On The Good Doctor According To FansOn ABC's "The Good Doctor," Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) and the other surgeons and residents at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital must regularly deal with challenging medical situations and emergencies.
Thanks to their training and expertise, the surgeons are usually equipped to handle difficult cases.
However, treating patients who can succumb to serious illnesses and bodily damage can exact a serious emotional toll, as well.
We see this when Claire (Antonia Thomas) and Jared (Chuku Modu) comfort one another after both of their patients die in "22 Steps."
Many of the maladies featured on the show are difficult to sort out, even for seasoned medical professionals, but some Redditors feel that "The Good Doctor" uses one diagnosis far too often.

     The Good Doctor Season 5 Finale Cliffhanger Called Back To An Iconic ER Twist, But Is That A Good Thing?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The cliffhanger involved Dr. Lim and Nurse Villanueva, and it called back to an iconic scene from another medical drama.
But does it bode well that The Good Doctor had me flashing back to a bloody episode of ER?
It’s a seriously chilling end to the Season 6 episode – which you can watch with a Hulu subscription , or just check out the scene here – and it stuck with me enough that The Good Doctor Season 5 finale immediately left me thinking about it.
But two medical professionals being stabbed as an episode cliffhanger after a happy party scene with music drowning out cries for help?
One thing is certain at this point: The Good Doctor delivered a doozy of a cliffhanger to leave fans on for the months of hiatus.
