     Round 2 | Game 1: Tampa Bay Lightning 4, Florida Panthers 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — Florida Panthers coach Andrew Brunette says his team’s power play is going to score one of these days.
Florida once again did not score with the man advantage in this postseason and it was costly on Tuesday night as the Tampa Bay Lightning took Game 1 with a 4-1 win.
While the Panthers went 0-3 on the power play on Tuesday, the Lightning scored three of its goals on it.
The Panthers had a 1-0 lead in the game until late in the second — with the Lightning scoring three in the third.
Tampa Bay ended up going 1-5 on the power play, the Kucherov-to-Perry goal getting the Lightning on the board.

     Tuesday's NHL: Lightning strike first, beat Panthers in Game 1; Avs win in OT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressSunrise, Fla. — The Tampa Bay Lightning won the first two games of their playoff series with the Florida Panthers on the road last year.
In Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper’s estimation, Vasilevskiy was the story.
Florida went 0-for-18 on the power play in the series win against the Capitals and was scoreless on three more tries Tuesday.
“We knew, right away our coaching staff told us that wasn’t going to be a goal,” Duclair said.
Tampa Bay left no doubt late, with Kucherov and Colton each getting power-play tallies in the final 4:06 to put the game away.

     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostSUNRISE — The Florida Panthers started a Stanley Cup playoffs series with a 1-0 deficit for the sixth time in a row.
Lightning predicted to win:Why the Tampa Bay Lightning will beat the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup PlayoffsPanthers predicted to win:Why the Florida Panthers will beat the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup PlayoffsFlorida actually scored first when Anthony Duclair lifted a wrist shot over a sprawling Vasilevskiy with 5:59 to go in the first period.
The Panthers headed into the series 0-18 on the power play and they did not have much luck with Tampa Bay disrupting the passing and shooting lanes.
“He played the puck more, he was on the puck, I thought he had a pretty solid game,” Brunette said.
It has been especially true when they head to the power play, where they are now 0-21 on the postseason.

     Tampa Bay Lightning at Florida Panthers Game One Preview and Game Day Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The highlight of the game was Nikita Kucherov returning from his season-long injury to post two goals and an assist in the Lightning victory.
In Game One they combined for 9 goals, 11 in Game Three, and 8 in Game Four.
We saw in the Toronto series, in Games Six and Seven, when the Lightning focused on their defense they had a lot more success.
DisciplineThis is probably more for Florida than Tampa, but the Lightning found out early in the Toronto series what happens when a game is littered with penalties.
The Lightning scored 8 power play goals in the series while the Panthers scored 6.
