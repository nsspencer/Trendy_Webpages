     Fetterman wins PA Democratic Senate primary, GOP contest is too early to call, NBC projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Fetterman will win the state's Democratic Senate primary race, while the winner of the hyper-competitive Republican Senate primary is too early to call, NBC News projected Tuesday.
Fetterman, who recently suffered a stroke that took him off the campaign trail, was the heavy favorite in the Democratic contest.
He and the eventual Republican nominee will face off in a general election that could play a decisive role in which party controls the U.S. Senate after the midterms.
Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician and former host of "The Dr. Oz Show," made waves when he announced he would run as a Republican for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.
He received former President Donald Trump's coveted endorsement, and his campaign has reportedly spent more than $12 million in the race on advertising alone.

     Dr. Oz relying on star-power, a Trump endorsement to win Pennsylvania Senate race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Dr. Mehmet Oz’s campaign for senate is relying heavily on his star power, which according to American University political professor Capri Cafaro isn’t a bad strategy.
“Celebrity candidates are nothing new,” said Cafaro, “I think that they’re becoming more maybe, accepted because maybe the lines are blurring a little bit more.
“They have influence, so I really don’t think there’s anything wrong with it,” said Pardeau.
“He has never really lived in the state,” Cafaro said.
But like the others, Barnette’s time in Pennsylvania has been short, which is a turnoff for some voters.

     Final Odds as Kathy Barnette Faces Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz is still the favorite to win the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary despite a significant surge from rival Kathy Barnette.
Trump had said Monday that he didn't believe that Barnette could win the general election against "Radical Left Democrats."
The bookmaker has declared Oz the 2/9 favorite to win the GOP Senate candidacy in Pennsylvania, having been 8/11 the previous week.
A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey conducted between May 12 and 15 revealed that the battle between Oz and Barnette could be closer still.
When asked if the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania Senate election was held "today," 28 percent said they would back Oz, with Barnette close behind in second place on 27 percent.

     Pa. Primary latest: GOP Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz feeling confident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos On Tuesday, Republican Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz said he is confident he will win not only the primary but also the general election.
The 52-year-old said he went to the hospital on Friday after not feeling well and would remain for a while for observation.
He vowed to press forward despite the health setback, saying, "Our campaign isn't slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday.
"It seems like folks like Conor Lamb or Malcolm Kenyatta never got the type of traction to be really competitive in this race.
So, I would be surprised if Fetterman doesn't hang on in that race," he says.
