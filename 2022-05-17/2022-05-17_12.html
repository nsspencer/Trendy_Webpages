     Former Chicago Bears RB Tarik Cohen injured during livestreamed workout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen, now a free agent, apparently suffered an injury during a training session being livestreamed on his Instagram account.
The hard-luck player, released in March by the Bears because of past injuries, grabbed the back of his leg after going down during the workout on Tuesday.
Cohen played three full seasons with Chicago but made it to only three games in 2021 before tearing knee ligaments.
A fourth-round draft pick in 2017, Cohen had a strong rookie year as a running back and kick returner.
He made All-Pro as a punt returner in 2018, when he led the NFL with 33 run-backs for 411 yards.
