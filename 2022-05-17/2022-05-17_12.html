     Summary: Beckham’s Instagram post comes amid reports Messi may come to Inter Miami in the summer of 2023, with a reported 35% ownership stake connected to his potential arrival.

That move doesn’t seem imminent, but it continues a long line of the Argentine superstar being linked to Beckham’s South Florida-based club.
The 34-year-old forward is under contract at PSG through June 2023, so the timelines could align.

     Lionel Messi's Agent Denies Superstar Is Joining MLS Club Inter Miami In 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi -- arguably the greatest soccer player of all time -- is reportedly taking his talents to the United States after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain is up in 2023 ... as he's slated to join David Beckham's club, Inter Miami.
The 34-year-old 7-time Ballon d'Or award winner is expected to take a 35% stake with the MLS franchise, according to Front Office Sports.
Messi, who's currently playing for PSG, will sign with Inter Miami once his contract expires with one of France's top clubs.
On Monday, Beckham posted pics with several members of PSG's club -- Messi being amongst the group -- where he appeared chummy with the Argentinian player.
As we previously reported, Messi parted ways with Barcelona after the club said financial obstacles prevented them from offering him a suitable deal.

     Summary: Lionel Messi will reportedly acquire 35% of shares in Inter Miami and then join the MLS club when his contract with Paris Saint-Germain ends next year.
Messi, who owns a condo in Miami Beach, has long been linked with a late-career move to the three-year-old Major League Soccer club.
But those rumors were given new life on Monday when Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham posted Instagram photos of himself with PSG stars Messi, Neymar, Sergio Ramos and Kylian Mbappe.
“Leo Messi is still one of the best players in the world, his skills have not diminished,” Inter Miami co-owner and executive director Jorge Mas told the Miami Herald back in February.
“I believe, and David [Beckham] has a relationship with him, that if he leaves PSG, at the time he leaves PSG we would love to have Messi as a player at Inter Miami and be part of our community.

     Lionel Messi to MLS: Superstar not committed to move to David Beckham's Inter Miami, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A source close to Lionel Messi has denied a report that the Paris Saint-Germain superstar will be investing in MLS club Inter Miami before joining as a player in 2023, and this comes just a day after being photographed with co-owner and president David Beckham in Doha, per a report in Le Parisen.
Obviously, Inter Miami fans have plenty of reason to hope they land Messi, especially since the results haven't been there since the club began, winning 19 of 57 matches in the league.
And we already know that Messi has invested in real estate in Miami, he owns an entire floor in a luxury condo building there.
The fact that Inter Miami are owned by Beckham, adds another wrinkle, as Beckham was previously the league's highest profile transfer, moving to the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.
Messi's current contract with PSG expires in June of 2023, opening up a potential move to MLS.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami have been linked to one another for quite some time, but the Argentina legend’s camp and MLS club have moved to deny a report that suggests a future pairing of the two sides is a done deal.
A report from Madrid-based DirecTV Sports correspondent Álex Candal stated that Messi would be joining Inter Miami upon the expiration of his PSG contract in 2023 in a deal that would also see him acquire a 35% stake in the club.
A subsequent report from Le Parisien flatly denied the comments, alleging them to be “completely false,” while Miami sources also denied any arrangement to the Miami Herald.
Messi and Beckham are linked through Adidas sponsorship and they just spent time together in Qatar through a PSG initiative.
Messi also spent time vacationing in Miami after winning the 2021 Copa América title with Argentina and owns property in the area.

     Inter Miami officials, Messi’s agent deny report that Argentine star has deal with team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decade later, the Inter Miami club Beckham runs, is rumored an MLS landing spot for Messi, now 34.
And once again, Inter Miami officials and Lionel Messi’s representatives are denying the report, saying it is premature conjecture.
A report from DIRECTV Sports Argentina correspondent Alex Candal saying that Messi “will acquire 35 percent of Inter Miami and join the team in Summer 2023” went viral on social media.
Candal said “the contract is done and will be signed in August.”But two high-ranking Inter Miami officials told the Herald that the report is not true and that there is no deal in the works.
The rumor gained traction after Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham posted Instagram photos of himself Monday with Paris Saint Germain stars Messi, Neymar, Sergio Ramos and Kylian Mbappe.

     Lionel Messi: PSG star's agent denies Inter Miami transfer link amid talk of acquiring stake in club

     Summary: Lionel Messi's father and agent has denied claims that he has agreed to join Inter Miami and acquire a 35 per cent stake in David Beckham's franchise when his PSG contract expires next year.
Yet according to French publication Le Parisien, via TMZ Sports, Messi's agent and father Jorge has branded talk of his son agreeing to join Inter 'completely false'.
When approached by DailyMail.com for comment, Inter said: 'Per Club policy, Inter Miami CF does not comment on rumors.'
Messi and some of his PSG team-mates were pictured with Beckham in Qatar on Monday during the club's mid-season tour of Doha.
When I first started this project, people were saying "This guy is coming, that guy is coming, [Cristiano] Ronaldo is coming, Messi's coming."
