     Taylor Hawkins was reportedly overwhelmed by Foo Fighters' tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been nearly two months since the death of Foo Fighters’ drummer Taylor Hawkins, and today Rolling Stone shared a profile chronicling the musician’s final days with the band.
In it, several friends and colleagues say Hawkins regularly felt the stress of the band’s constant touring, and he had allegedly reached his limit.
“He had a heart-to-heart with Dave and, yeah, he told me that he ‘couldn’t fucking do it anymore’—those were his words,” Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron explains.
“So I guess they did come to some understanding, but it just seems like the touring schedule got even crazier after that.”“He tried to keep up,” Cameron adds.
According to the RS piece, forensic doctors reported that Hawkins heart weighed 200 grams (about twice the amount of the average human’s) and he might have collapsed regardless of any drug use.
