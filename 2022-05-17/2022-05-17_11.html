     2022 Playoffs: Second Round, Game #1: New York Rangers vs Carolina Hurricanes Open Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers are one of those teams, and they’ll look to take the next step in their journey towards a champsionship tonight in Raleigh.
The Blueshirts will clash with Sebastian Aho, Andrei Svechnikov, and the rest of the Metropolitan Division winning Carolina Hurricanes in this second round matchup to determine who will represent the division in the Eastern Conference Finals.
While the current Blueshirts shed some of their inexperience by defeating Pittsburgh to advance this far, Carolina is still a far more talented, battle-tested group.
Player to Watch: Jacob TroubaTrouba had his fair share of good and bad moments during the first round against Pittsburgh.
Keep an eye on Trouba to open the second round off with a bang.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carolina Hurricanes vs. New York Rangers Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 2, Game 1 (Series Tied 0-0)Wednesday, May 18, 2022 - 7:00 p.m.
In the postseason, that’s an eternity, and it’s entirely possible that the Hurricanes could have a bit of rust to shake off tonight as they host the New York Rangers in the first game of their second round series.
As a result, the Hurricanes are as healthy as they can be entering tonight’s matchup.
The Rangers only have one player from their starting lineup on the shelf to begin this series.
Barclay Goodrow suffered a lower body injury in Game 1 against the Penguins and is likely to return at some point during this series, although it won’t happen tonight.

     Cole’s OT Goal Lifts Hurricanes Past Rangers for Game 1 Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The defenseman's second career playoff goal capped a late comeback by the Hurricanes after they trailed most of the night.
Sebastian Aho finally pushed one past Shesterkin in the final minutes of the third period to send the game into OT.
Then came Cole's rebound shot, which clipped the stick of Rangers defenseman Ryan Lindgren to change direction on the way toward the net before slipping past Shesterkin to end this one.
That score held up for the Rangers nearly the rest of the night until the Hurricanes finally showed an urgent third-period edge to build some momentum.
They even twice got pucks past Shesterkin only to ping the crossbar, first on a breakaway by Nino Niederreiter and later from Aho.

     Recap: Cole Plays Overtime Hero, Canes Take Game One
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Surging all period long, Carolina started to get their chances over the course of the final 20.
Instead, 24 seconds after ringing iron, #20 stuffed home a second chance effort after a feed from Seth Jarvis to tie the game.
The PNC Arena crowd erupted into a frenzy and with just 2:23 to go in regulation the game was then pushed to overtime.
The puck deflected off of Rangers defenseman Ryan Lindgren's stick and in, giving the Canes the first game of the series.
You never know what's going to happen in OT, but it just felt like the game was going to open up a bit more.

     Hurricanes-Rangers updates: Carolina forces OT, tops Rangers on Ian Cole wrister
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Game 2 is 8 p.m. Friday at PNC Arena while the series moves to Madison Square Garden on Sunday (3:30 p.m.) and Tuesday (7 p.m.).
The News &amp; Observer’s Chip Alexander, Luke DeCock and Justin Pelletier are PNC Arena and will have live observations from the scene, along with photographer Robert Willett.
No shots early: The Hurricanes have yet to register an official shot on goal, while the Rangers have three.
First penalty to the Canes, second to Rangers: So much for staying out of the box.
AND that lasts all of 27 seconds, when the Rangers’ Strome trips up a pair of Canes in the offensive zone.
