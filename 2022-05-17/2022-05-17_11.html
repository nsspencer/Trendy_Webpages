     Summary: Liverpool drew level before the half-hour, though, when Takumi Minamino crushed his near-post shot into the roof of the Southampton net after being played in on goal by Diogo Jota.
Liverpool celebrate after scoring a goal against Southampton in the Premier League.
Getty ImagesIt was a weak effort by Southampton, and Liverpool had little trouble seeing out the rest of the game and setting up what could be a tense final day.
The result leaves defending champions Man City needing a win on Sunday against Aston Villa -- managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard -- to ensure a fourth Premier League title under Pep Guardiola.
Liverpool also have a Champions League final against Real Madrid on May 28 in Paris to contend with as their hopes of ending the season with four major trophies remain alive.
