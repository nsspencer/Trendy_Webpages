     Tarik Cohen injured while live streaming workout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesFree agent running back Tarik Cohen appeared to suffer a serious injury while working out today, with all of it live streamed on Cohen’s own Instagram account.
The video shows Cohen doing an agility drill, planting his foot to change directions and then falling to the ground, grabbing the back of his ankle.
The injury and Cohen’s reaction led to immediate speculation that he might have torn his Achilles tendon.
Cohen suffered a serious knee injury in the third game of 2020, forcing him to miss the rest of that season and the entire 2021 season.
A fourth-round draft pick of the Bears in 2017, Cohen was a first-team All-Pro return man in 2018.

While live streaming a training session on Instagram Live, Cohen suddenly dropped and grabbed the back of his lower leg.

     VIDEO: Tarik Cohen Suffers Scary Injury On Instagram Live
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In recent memory, Tarik Cohen has endured arguably one of the worst three-year spans for an NFL player.
Things were going fine as he posted another video on Instagram of him going through drills.
Judging by his reaction, it is likely a torn Achilles tendon.
For those who don’t understand, there is no injury more widely feared by NFL players next to a torn ACL than the torn Achilles.
In other words, Tarik Cohen is done before the 2022 season even began.

     Former Chicago Bears RB Tarik Cohen injured during livestreamed workout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen, now a free agent, apparently suffered an injury during a training session being livestreamed on his Instagram account.
The hard-luck player, released in March by the Bears because of past injuries, grabbed the back of his leg after going down during the workout on Tuesday.
Cohen played three full seasons with Chicago but made it to only three games in 2021 before tearing knee ligaments.
A fourth-round draft pick in 2017, Cohen had a strong rookie year as a running back and kick returner.
He made All-Pro as a punt returner in 2018, when he led the NFL with 33 run-backs for 411 yards.

     Summary: It’s been a difficult couple of years for former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen.
Cohen has struggled to battle back from a torn ACL suffered in Week 3 of the 2020 season.
Cohen looks to have suffered an injury during training that was being streamed on Instagram Live.
The hope is the injury isn’t serious and that Cohen can soon get back to training so he can find a new landing spot in the NFL.
But it sounds like it could be an Achilles injury, which would be another devastating blow for Cohen.

     WATCH: Tarik Cohen re-injured during Instagram Live segment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY SportsYou’d be hard-pressed to find an active NFL player who’s been more unlucky than former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen over the past few seasons.
Shortly after signing a four-year, $17.25 million contract extension with the Bears in Sept. of 2020, Cohen has played in just three NFL games since.
After playing in 51 consecutive games, Cohen would go on to miss the next 30 games the Bears would play.
Cohen also later revealed that he also tore his MCL and fractured his tibial plateau in addition to the ACL injury.
This is an extremely tough break for a player who’s worked tirelessly at getting back on the field.
