     She-Hulk: Attorney at Law’s first trailer looks simply smashing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Bruce Banner’s been one of the most physically powerful people running around Marvel’s movies for years at this point, that’s all about to change this summer as his cousin Jennifer Walters makes her way to MCU in Disney Plus’ She-Hulk: Attorney At Law.
While both Hulks make appearances in She-Hulk’s first trailer, the show’s clearly going to be Jennifer’s to own as she embarks on her own path to heroism.
She-Hulk: Attorney At Law’s first trailer introduces Jennifer (Tatiana Maslany) at a tricky point in her already complicated life.
In addition to the Hulks, She-Hulk’s trailer also features a handful of glimpses of longtime Hulk foe Abomination (Tim Roth), pointing to how the series will find ways to connect to the larger MCU.
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law also stars Ginger Gonzaga, Josh Segarra, Jameela Jamil, Jon Bass and Renée Elise Goldsberry hits Disney Plus on August 17th.

     She-Hulk Trailer Reveals Jennifer, Frog-Man, and More!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Then again, in the comics, She-Hulk has been both an Avenger and a member of the Fantastic Four, so it’s only a matter of time before she embraces her identity.
The She-Hulk transformation initially appears to be like what the Hulk was initially: fear and anger turning the person into a rage monster.
Whatever Banner did to conquer that part of him and turn Hulk into brawn with the puny form’s brains, Jennifer Walters looks to be following in his footsteps.
It’s worth noting that when the two walked through a portal in Shang-Chi, they were entering a room with the same hi-tech cage as shown in the She-Hulk trailer.
It looks like She-Hulk may be acting as the defense for Blonsky, perhaps leading him towards redemption or into the Thunderbolts corner of Marvel.

     Summary: Aside for Thor: Love and Thunder, I am not more personally excited about a Marvel project than the upcoming She-Hulk series on Disney+.
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, an Original series from Marvel Studios, starts streaming August 17 on @DisneyPlus.
I'll just throw in that I had heard quite a while ago from a dependable source that Wong is in #SheHulk too.
I have also heard from a dependable source that “a porcupine man” will be appearing in the She-Hulk series as well!
What do you think of the new She-Hulk trailer?

     Marvel Fans Upset Over She-Hulk CGI In New Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She-Hulk CGI Creates Viral ControversyMarvel Studios' debut trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law has been met with social media controversy due to debate over the quality of the CGI present in the footage.
Twitter user @cgichipmunk drew particular attention to how Hulk's VFX appears to be far more complete than that of She-Hulk:ADVERTISEMENT"Why does Hulk’s CGI in this trailer look perfectly fine but She-Hulk looks very bad??
Complaints about the CGI in a trailer are the most ridiculous nitpicking I've seen from Marvel fans.
MarvelThere's no denying some of She-Hulk's CGI doesn't look quite up to scratch in the debut trailer.
There's no doubt that whenever the next look at She-Hulk arrives, things ought to be looking much more polished.

     She-Hulk: Attorney at Law Trailer: (Green) Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About halfway through Marvel’s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law trailer, Jennifer Walters says, “I just want to be a normal, anonymous lawyer.” Unfortunately, that’s just not in the cards for her.
Walters (played by Orphan Black’s Tatiana Maslany) is able to transform into the show’s titular green superhero, thanks to her cousin Bruce Banner and a fair amount of CGI.
“Your transformations are triggered by anger and fear,” Banner (Mark Ruffalo) explains as Smart Hulk.
“Those are like the baseline of any woman just existing,” Walters replies.
The trailer closes with a scene of She-Hulk swiping through a dating app.
