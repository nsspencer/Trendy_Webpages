     Summary: Pennsylvania is a swing state not only in presidential election years but also during cycles when House and Senate seats are up for grabs.
There are two open statewide races in 2022, and both parties are fighting fiercely to win them.
There are crowded primaries on both sides in the Senate race to replace a retiring Republican senator.
And while Democrats have all but cleared the field in the gubernatorial contest, a raucous Republican fight is on tap for the executive mansion.

     Summary: In the Senate primary, Fetterman had held a sizable lead in polls, though he was absent from the campaign trail in the closing days after suffering a stroke.
The GOP Senate primary in North Carolina, where Republican incumbent Richard Burr is retiring, had particularly high stakes.
The Senate race is expected to be one of the most expensive in the battle for control of the chamber this fall.
Trump inserted himself into the Senate race there early, endorsing Sean Parnell, an Army veteran and unsuccessful congressional candidate in 2020.
Oz has vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if he wins the Senate race.

    </h2>

     Summary: The victory, called by The Associated Press, set the stage for a fierce general election battle in a state that could determine control of the chamber.
The early stage of the general election, though, may be muted: Mr. Fetterman has been off the campaign trail since Friday, when he had a stroke.
They also intend to tie Mr. Fetterman to Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist whom Mr. Fetterman supported in the 2016 presidential primary.
Even as some Democrats worried about how his personal style might be perceived by buttoned-up swing voters, Fetterman fans delighted in it.
“If somebody thinks I’m smarter if I’m in a suit, so be it,” Mr. Fetterman said in an interview on Thursday after an event in York, his hometown.
