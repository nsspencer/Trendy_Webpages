     Steve Aoki’s wild first pitch at Fenway Park is not a-ok
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki is known for throwing cake.
Now he might be known for throwing a baseball.
The 44-year-old EDM DJ/producer and entrepreneur threw out the first pitch last night at Fenway Park in Boston, ahead of the Red Sox’ 6-3 win over the Houston Astros, and things didn’t exactly go as planned.
The pitch sailed high and wide and into the backstop, rivaling 50 Cent’s legendary first-pitch mishap as one of the worst of all time.
“I’ll stick to throwing [cake emoji]”, Aoki posted to Instagram after the gaffe.

     Fans Roasted Steve Aoki Like Peanuts And Cracker Jacks For The Worst First Pitch In Baseball History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki was given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park on Monday night as the Boston Red Sox hosted the Houston Astros.
Tons of baseball fans are calling this the worst first pitch in baseball history.
At least Steve Aoki threw it WAY past the catcher so he can’t get roasted for being weak.
— BBT (@btarr8) May 17, 2022I’d actually argue this is the best ceremonial first pitch in Fenway history, not the worst.
Steve Aoki is one of the wealthiest and most successful DJs on the planet.

     Steve Aoki Throws Horrible First Pitch At Red Sox Game, Worst Ever?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki might be able to throw a cake with pinpoint accuracy -- but he sure as hell can't do the same with a baseball, 'cause he absolutely airmailed the ceremonial first pitch at the Red Sox game on Monday night ... and it was truly awful.
Aoki warmed up his left arm, toed the rubber -- and then heaved a ball that went roughly 20 feet over his catcher's head.
Video shot by people in the stadium shows fans were laughing at the pitch -- because it was seriously just that bad.
@steveaoki threw out tonight’s first pitch @fenwaypark , it was just a little bit outside the strike zone….
Of course, Aoki is far from the first celeb to embarrass himself on an MLB diamond ... you'll recall, 50 Cent is known for the worst ever, throwing one sideways in 2014.
