The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary.
Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary.
The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years.
Biden said Fetterman "understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long.

     Summary: Pennsylvania is a swing state not only in presidential election years but also during cycles when House and Senate seats are up for grabs.
There are two open statewide races in 2022, and both parties are fighting fiercely to win them.
There are crowded primaries on both sides in the Senate race to replace a retiring Republican senator.
And while Democrats have all but cleared the field in the gubernatorial contest, a raucous Republican fight is on tap for the executive mansion.

     Live Updates: Mastriano and Fetterman Prevail in Pennsylvania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senate races in both states and a governor’s race in Pennsylvania were set to test Republican voters’ appetite for the lingering effort to re-litigate Mr. Trump’s loss.
The lineup was certain to test the power of Mr. Trump’s endorsements with his fiercely loyal base.
Establishment Republicans’ attempts to block Mr. Mastriano’s rise seemed to fall short, and Mr. Trump handed him his endorsement this weekend.
In North Carolina, Representative Ted Budd, who earned Mr. Trump’s backing in the Senate race, voted in Congress against certifying the electoral votes of Pennsylvania and Arizona.
After the 2020 election, Mr. Budd signed a letter urging the Justice Department to investigate voter fraud and irregularities.
