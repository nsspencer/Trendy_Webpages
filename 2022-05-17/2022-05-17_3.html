     Apex Legends Mobile: how to download it on iOS and Android
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apex Legends Mobile has been in development for a few years and is a completely different game from the original Apex Legends, though it does share a lot of the same content, such as Legends, weapons and maps.
“We’ve built a dedicated team here at Respawn filled with experts in mobile game development to lead the creation of Apex Legends Mobile,” former Apex game director Grenier said.
Since it is a separate entity from the original Apex Legends game, Apex Legends Mobile isn’t cross-compatible with PC or console.
Since the game is available on iOS devices, you can also play Apex Legends Mobile on an iPad with a larger screen.
