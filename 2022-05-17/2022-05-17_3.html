     Summary: What is Apex Legends Mobile?
Apex Legends Mobile characters each have unique strengths and abilities, so players can figure out which one works best with their play styles.
Apex Legends Mobile iOS RequirementsAnyone with a recent iPhone or iPad should be able to easily play Apex Legends Mobile.
Technically, controller support has not been optimized for Apex Legends Mobile, however, using most console controllers and iPhone controllers should work.
Apex Legends Mobile is a separate game from the original Apex Legends hero shooter, and as such, it only works on mobile devices.

     ‘Apex Legends Mobile’ reveals exclusive legend Fade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The launch of Apex Legends Mobile will include an entirely new legend called Fade, who will be exclusive to mobile platforms.
As Apex Legends Mobile approaches its May 17 launch date, developer Respawn Entertainment has unveiled what new features fans can expect.
The biggest of these is a new legend called Fade, a “bold” and “aggressive” character with no plans to launch on PC or console.
When asked if Fade could ever make his way to other versions of Apex Legends, Respawn said there are “no plans” but that it’s “certainly a possibility” in the future.
Earlier in the month, a new legend called Newcastle was added to Apex Legends.
