     WWE's Sasha Banks &amp; Naomi Walk Out Of 'Monday Night Raw' Over Creative Issues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sasha Banks and Naomi -- WWE women's tag team champions -- reportedly walked out of "Monday Night Raw" last night after an argument with management about the creative direction of the show.
Though, WWE's statement makes it seem it was not part of the show, even writing, "Monday Night Raw is a scripted live TV show, whose characters are expected to perform the requirements of their contract."
Sasha and Naomi were slated to be a part of a six-pack challenge match, where the winner would face Raw women's champion, Bianca Belair, in a match for the title.
WWE quickly ran a segment backstage with Becky Lynch, former women's champion, where she said she witnessed Naomi and Sasha leave the arena.
As for Sasha and Naomi, PWInsider reports prior to leaving the arena, they met with Vince McMahon.
