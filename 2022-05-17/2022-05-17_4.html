    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chuck Edwards, a three-term state senator and business owner, has edged out Representative Madison Cawthorn in the Republican primary for a House seat representing North Carolina’s 11th District.
Luke Ball, a representative for Mr. Cawthorn, said late Tuesday that the congressman had called Mr. Edwards to concede.
Mr. Edwards’s narrow triumph was called by The Associated Press.
The outcome served as a rebuke of Mr. Cawthorn, a right-wing firebrand and the youngest freshman in Congress, who was once seen as a rising star of the Republican Party.
It is also a significant victory for the old guard Republicans in North Carolina and Washington who in recent months had been feuding with Mr. Cawthorn over his personal and political errors and foibles.

     Summary: Facts matter: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter.
Capping off a precipitous and humiliating fall from grace, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, the youngest member of the GOP’s Shitposting Caucus, has conceded the Republican primary for his North Carolina congressional seat to state Sen. Chuck Edwards.
— Madison Cawthorn (@CawthornforNC) November 4, 2020Cawthorn’s tenure in Congress was as controversial and performative as it was brief.
By the time of his “orgy and cocaine” comment, Cawthorn’s combative and erratic behavior had already alienated him from many North Carolina Republicans.
All of this led a number of influential Republicans in both North Carolina and DC to back Edwards in what seemed to be a well planned campaign to unseat Cawthorn.

     Summary: After coming under fire for weeks within his own party, Representative Madison Cawthorn narrowly lost his primary race Tuesday night against state Senator Chuck Edwards.
Cawthorn reportedly conceded to Edwards, according to CNN.
While Tillis endorsed Edwards, Cawthorn, who, along with far-right representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, has been among Donald Trump’s most loyal defenders, got a last-minute vote of confidence from the former president.
McCarthy said that Cawthorn told him he had “exaggerated” the allegations.
McCarthy has also stated Cawthorn was “wrong” to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug."

     Summary: Scandal-plagued Rep. Madison Cawthorn is ousted in North Carolina primaryEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images Allison Joyce/Getty ImagesRep. Madison Cawthorn, a freshman Republican who's been beset by scandal since taking office last year, has been ousted in a heated primary in North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
Cawthorn lost to state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who had received the backing of some Republicans who had tired of Cawthorn's controversies.
In North Carolina, a winner just needs to cross a 30% threshold in order to avoid a July runoff election.
A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who was first elected in 2020 to former Rep. Mark Meadows' seat, Cawthorn faced a crowded field of primary challengers in a district that will likely remain red.
Sen. Tillis also called for a bipartisan inquiry by the House Ethics Committee into allegations of Cawthorn participating in insider trading.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — Buckling under the weight of scandal, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C. — a favorite of former President Donald Trump — lost his re-nomination bid in western North Carolina’s 11th District on Tuesday, NBC News projected.
State Sen. Chuck Edwards, a conservative backed by many of the state’s establishment players, won with about a third of the vote in an eight-way race.
Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball told reporters Tuesday night that Cawthorn had called Edwards to concede.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn speaks before former President Donald Trump takes the stage at a rally in Selma, N.C., on April 9.
The district has a clear Republican lean: Trump won it by 10 percentage points, according to the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.

     Summary: Madison Cawthorn, the first-term congressman and pro-Donald Trump firebrand, has lost his seat in the US House after failing to beat back a challenge from state legislator Chuck Edwards in the North Carolina Republican primary.
Luke Ball, a spokesperson for Cawthorn’s campaign, told the Associated Press late Tuesday that Cawthorn had conceded the race.
The race came to be seen as a test of whether voters would grant Cawthorn another term despite his personal and political stumbles.
Besides the remark about being invited to an orgy, Cawthron said he had seen leaders in the movement to end drug addiction use cocaine.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy reprimanded him publicly for the remarks.

     Summary: North Carolina state Sen. Chuck Edwards defeated Rep. Madison Cawthorn to win the Republican nomination for the state's 11th congressional district on Tuesday, according to a Cawthorn campaign spokesperson who said the congressman called Edwards and conceded the race.
Cawthorn briefly flirted with running in a congressional district that included the larger Charlotte media market last year before changing his mind.
Cawthorn's struggles led U.S. Sen Thom Tillis and two of North Carolina's top legislative leaders to endorse Edwards.
Former President Trump seemed to support Cawthorn but has stopped short of issuing an outright endorsement, though Cawthorn did appear at a Trump rally last month.
He later told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that the claims were untrue and "exaggerated."

     Summary: CNN —Rep. Madison Cawthorn conceded his race in the GOP primary for North Carolina’s 11th District to opponent Chuck Edwards in a phone call, Cawthorn spokesperson Luke Ball said.
He was backed by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis as well as state Senate leader Phil Berger and a number of other North Carolina Republicans.
In addition to publicly and privately rooting for Cawthorn to lose his North Carolina primary race on Tuesday, some Republicans had already started preparing for how to deal with him if he returned to Congress after becoming a party pariah, CNN previously reported.
Tillis, the North Carolina Republican who worked actively to defeat Cawthorn in the primary, said he heard discussions among his colleagues about banning Cawthorn from joining certain caucuses in the House and to deny him key committee assignments.
A House Republican familiar with the matter confirmed the discussions.

     Madison Cawthorn Concedes GOP Primary Amid Controversies

     Summary: ToplineRep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) called state Sen. Chuck Edwards Tuesday night to concede defeat in the GOP primary for North Carolina’s heavily conservative 11th congressional district, according to multiple reports, citing Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball—following a stretch of controversy during the campaign that left the freshman congressman out of favor with party leaders in Washington.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) is seen in the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2021.
Much of Cawthorn’s support came from rural areas, while Edwards fared better in more populated parts of the district, winning Buncombe County, home of Asheville.
But the wave of controversy engulfing Cawthorn only grew in the following weeks.
