     Free at-home COVID tests: How to get 8 more mailed to you
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Americans are now eligible to order a third set of at-home COVID-19 tests online for free as part of the Biden administration’s push to increase testing for the coronavirus.
This time, you can order up to eight free tests — an increase from the first two rounds when the limit was four.
To get a third round of free COVID-19 at-home tests, all you have to do is enter your home address on COVIDtests.gov, which will create an order for eight tests.
It was initially started in December when the omicron variant of COVID surged throughout the country.
Households that already received eight at-home tests from COVIDtests.gov are eligible to receive a third shipment.

     Summary: The White House said on Tuesday that Americans were now eligible for a third order of free, at-home coronavirus tests shipped through the Postal Service.
The move doubled to 16 the total number of tests the program has made available to each household.
Under withering criticism for those shortages, Mr. Biden promised a billion at-home tests, and his administration secured commitments for hundreds of millions of them.
The White House has said that half of them would be distributed through the Postal Service program.
Over 70 million U.S. households — more than half the households in the country — have ordered tests that way so far, and roughly 350 million tests have been delivered.

     Summary: U.S. households are now be able to order an additional eight free at-home tests at COVIDTests.gov—bringing the total number of free tests available to each household since the start of the program to 16.

Since then, over 70 million households have visited COVIDTests.gov to order at-home tests to be mailed directly to them.
To date, the Administration has delivered approximately 350 million free tests to mailboxes and doorsteps across the country, in U.S. territories, and at overseas military bases, with most tests delivered by the U.S.
The third round of tests available were purchased by the federal government earlier this year with funding from the American Rescue Plan.
