     Madison Cawthorn loses his re-election bid after a deluge of scandals.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chuck Edwards, a three-term state senator and business owner, has edged out Representative Madison Cawthorn in the Republican primary for a House seat representing North Carolina’s 11th District.
Luke Ball, a representative for Mr. Cawthorn, said late Tuesday that the congressman had called Mr. Edwards to concede.
Mr. Edwards’s narrow triumph was called by The Associated Press.
The outcome served as a rebuke of Mr. Cawthorn, a right-wing firebrand and the youngest freshman in Congress, who was once seen as a rising star of the Republican Party.
It is also a significant victory for the old guard Republicans in North Carolina and Washington who in recent months had been feuding with Mr. Cawthorn over his personal and political errors and foibles.

     Madison Cawthorn Has Lost Reelection. Not Even Donald Trump Could Save Him.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After coming under fire for weeks within his own party, Representative Madison Cawthorn narrowly lost his primary race Tuesday night against state Senator Chuck Edwards.
Cawthorn reportedly conceded to Edwards, according to CNN.
While Tillis endorsed Edwards, Cawthorn, who, along with far-right representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, has been among Donald Trump’s most loyal defenders, got a last-minute vote of confidence from the former president.
McCarthy said that Cawthorn told him he had “exaggerated” the allegations.
McCarthy has also stated Cawthorn was “wrong” to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug."

     Summary: Scandal-plagued Rep. Madison Cawthorn is ousted in North Carolina primaryEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images Allison Joyce/Getty ImagesRep. Madison Cawthorn, a freshman Republican who's been beset by scandal since taking office last year, has been ousted in a heated primary in North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
Cawthorn lost to state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who had received the backing of some Republicans who had tired of Cawthorn's controversies.
In North Carolina, a winner just needs to cross a 30% threshold in order to avoid a July runoff election.
A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who was first elected in 2020 to former Rep. Mark Meadows' seat, Cawthorn faced a crowded field of primary challengers in a district that will likely remain red.
Sen. Tillis also called for a bipartisan inquiry by the House Ethics Committee into allegations of Cawthorn participating in insider trading.

     Summary: Luke Ball, a spokesperson for Cawthorn’s campaign, told the Associated Press late Tuesday that Cawthorn had conceded the race.
The race came to be seen as a test of whether voters would grant Cawthorn another term despite his personal and political stumbles.
Besides the remark about being invited to an orgy, Cawthron said he had seen leaders in the movement to end drug addiction use cocaine.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy reprimanded him publicly for the remarks.
Edwards and others accuse Cawthorn of trying to walk away from his constituents for political convenience.

     Trump-backed Rep. Madison Cawthorn will lose GOP primary in North Carolina, CNN projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Rep. Madison Cawthorn conceded his race in the GOP primary for North Carolina’s 11th District to opponent Chuck Edwards in a phone call, Cawthorn spokesperson Luke Ball said.
He was backed by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis as well as state Senate leader Phil Berger and a number of other North Carolina Republicans.
In addition to publicly and privately rooting for Cawthorn to lose his North Carolina primary race on Tuesday, some Republicans had already started preparing for how to deal with him if he returned to Congress after becoming a party pariah, CNN previously reported.
Tillis, the North Carolina Republican who worked actively to defeat Cawthorn in the primary, said he heard discussions among his colleagues about banning Cawthorn from joining certain caucuses in the House and to deny him key committee assignments.
A House Republican familiar with the matter confirmed the discussions.
