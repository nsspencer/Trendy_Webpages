     She-Hulk: Attorney at Law’s first trailer looks simply smashing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Bruce Banner’s been one of the most physically powerful people running around Marvel’s movies for years at this point, that’s all about to change this summer as his cousin Jennifer Walters makes her way to MCU in Disney Plus’ She-Hulk: Attorney At Law.
While both Hulks make appearances in She-Hulk’s first trailer, the show’s clearly going to be Jennifer’s to own as she embarks on her own path to heroism.
She-Hulk: Attorney At Law’s first trailer introduces Jennifer (Tatiana Masalany) at a tricky point in her already complicated life.
In addition to the Hulks, She-Hulk’s trailer also features a handful of glimpses of longtime Hulk foe Abomination (Tim Roth), pointing to how the series will find ways to connect to the larger MCU.
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law also stars Ginger Gonzaga, Josh Segarra, Jameela Jamil, Jon Bass and Renée Elise Goldsberry hits Disney Plus on August 17th.

     Here's the first trailer for Disney Plus' She-Hulk: Attorney At Law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alright Moon Knight, take your laughable Bri’ish accents and your gloomy tone and get out of here, it’s time for the Marvel Cinematic Universe to get completely wacky with She-Hulk: Attorney At Law.
Assuming you can tolerate the CG on her She-Hulk form... which will hopefully be a little more palatable once you get used to it.
That might be a good thing for her new job, which involves some kind of superhero-based law firm, with Tim Roth’s Emil Blonsky—a.k.a.
Speaking of superhero-based law firms (which was a plot point on Daredevil) and lawyers with superpowers (like Daredevil), there is no mention of Daredevil or the events of Daredevil in this trailer.
What this trailer does mention, at least implicitly, is that She-Hulk and some (relatively) little dude who likes french fries are totally going to have sex.

     New She-Hulk trailer flexes muscles, jokes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest trailer for the upcoming Disney+ MCU show She-Hulk: Attorney at Law is here, giving us a more in-depth look at Tatiana Maslany as the super strong lawyer.
It’s also the first solid look we’ve had at what She-Hulk will look like on-screen.
As expected with any MCU vehicle, there are plenty of quips in the trailer, like “I’m not a superhero.
And adult orphans, for some reason.”Also appearing: Tim Roth, reprising his role as Emil Blonsky/Abomination, the antagonist of 2008’s The Incredible Hulk (notably not starring Mark Ruffalo).
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law will premiere August 17 on Disney Plus.

     Summary: Aside for Thor: Love and Thunder, I am not more personally excited about a Marvel project than the upcoming She-Hulk series on Disney+.
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, an Original series from Marvel Studios, starts streaming August 17 on @DisneyPlus.
I'll just throw in that I had heard quite a while ago from a dependable source that Wong is in #SheHulk too.
I have also heard from a dependable source that “a porcupine man” will be appearing in the She-Hulk series as well!
