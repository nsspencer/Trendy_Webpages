     Grubhub free lunch promo leaves New York City customers waiting for food
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grubhub planned to treat New Yorkers to a free meal Tuesday with a three-hour lunch promotion that was designed to take $15 off orders.
What they’re saying: “The initial demand temporarily overwhelmed our app, causing some diners to experience an error message when they used their promo code,” Krautler said.
What's next: Grubhub is offering $5 off a $15 order before tax, tip and fees in New York City and surrounding areas through May 31 with promo code 5OFFNYC.
The code can be used three times per user at Grubhub or Seamless.
Our thought bubble: Free food giveaways and popular food deals often end in disappointment or long waits at the very least.

     Grubhub overwhelmed after offering New Yorkers free lunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photograph: ShutterstockGrubhub offered to buy New Yorkers lunch on Tuesday, and a lot of people took them up on it.
“We had unprecedented pre-order demand, more than we’ve ever actually seen,” said Christopher Krautler, the company’s director of consumer public relations.
Some customers may have been rerouted or met with an error message as a result, Kreutler said.
Discounting is a common tactic among third-party delivery companies as they look to attract customers and drive up order volumes.
The New York Post reported last week that restaurants in the city weren’t expecting much from the free lunch promotion because of how frequent such discounts have become.

     GrubHub Was Getting 6000 Orders A Minute During Its Promo Today That Left Restaurant Workers Stressed And Customers Hangry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It got overwhelming,” said Brandon Ching, who was working the counter at Greenberg’s Bagels, a popular sandwich spot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
“We were short-staffed today so it really added extra stress to my day."
"It's been a complete disaster," Nathaniel, a Manhattan resident who asked that his last name not be used, told BuzzFeed News.
He'd been thrilled that his order from a highly-rated sushi restaurant went through but after an hour of waiting, no response from the restaurant and nothing from GrubHub, he cancelled the order.
— filling up previously empty Manhattan salad spots to pick up now much cheaper overpriced salad.

     Grubhub’s ‘Free Lunch’ Promo Went Predictably Haywire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The delivery app Grubhub announced last week that it would be providing New Yorkers with “free lunch” between the hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. today.
The same Post report identified that promotions like this one have become increasingly common across food delivery services, as delivery loses the popularity it enjoyed during the peak of the pandemic.
As such, what consumers get is increasingly desperate attempts from delivery platforms to earn goodwill and bring in business.
Still, Grubhub has proven one thing true: “Free lunch” will always be a siren song, even if it’s not actually free.
For everyone still waiting on their lunch orders, well, let’s hope you’re tipping well — and preferably in cash.

     Summary: On Tuesday (17 May), the food delivery service Grubhub offered people in New York City a free lunch with a special promotional code between 11am and 2pm.
“3min into @Grubhub free lunch promo, and the app is crashing.
One person jokingly tweeted, “Fav this tweet if you were on the nyc Grubhub battle field fighting for your free lunch” while another person wrote: “Grubhub said free lunch and all the restaurants said no”.
God knows why Grubhub decided a free lunch promo in this city would be anything short of CHAOS,” one person tweeted.
Another NYC resident shared that they decided to grab lunch at a local spot instead, but it was also overwhelmed with orders from the Grubhub free lunch promo.

[Customers] called very frustrated, understandably so, and at some point, we stopped taking GrubHub orders,' the manager added.
'New Yorkers went as hard for free lunch as the Rangers did in game 7.
Others suggested that the delivery giant should have offered all New Yorkers a code for a free lunch to use whenever.
In a statement to DailyMail.com, the company said: 'While we knew 72% of New York workers call lunch the most important meal of the day, our free lunch promotion exceeded all expectations.
