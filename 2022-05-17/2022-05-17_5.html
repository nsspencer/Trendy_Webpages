    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Americans are now eligible to order a third set of at-home COVID-19 tests online for free as part of the Biden administration’s push to increase testing for the coronavirus.
This time, you can order up to eight free tests — an increase from the first two rounds when the limit was four.
To get a third round of free COVID-19 at-home tests, all you have to do is enter your home address on COVIDtests.gov, which will create an order for eight tests.
It was initially started in December when the omicron variant of COVID surged throughout the country.
Households that already received eight at-home tests from COVIDtests.gov are eligible to receive a third shipment.

     Biden Offering Additional 8 Free COVID-19 Tests to Public
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — The government website for people to request free COVID-19 at-home tests from the U.S. government is now accepting a third round of orders.
The White House announced Tuesday that U.S. households can request an additional eight free at-home tests to be shipped by the U.S.
President Joe Biden committed in January to making 1 billion tests available to the public free of charge, including 500 million available through covidtests.gov.
Households were eligible to receive four tests during each of two earlier rounds of ordering through the website.
Biden has requested an additional $22 billion from Congress to buy vaccines and therapeutics to prepare for a fall spike in COVID-19 cases, but lawmakers have balked at the price tag.
