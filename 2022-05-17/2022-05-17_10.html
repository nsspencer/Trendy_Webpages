     Madison Cawthorn loses his re-election bid after a deluge of scandals.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chuck Edwards, a three-term state senator and business owner, has edged out Representative Madison Cawthorn in the Republican primary for a House seat representing North Carolina’s 11th District.
Luke Ball, a representative for Mr. Cawthorn, said late Tuesday that the congressman had called Mr. Edwards to concede.
Mr. Edwards’s narrow triumph was called by The Associated Press.
The outcome served as a rebuke of Mr. Cawthorn, a right-wing firebrand and the youngest freshman in Congress, who was once seen as a rising star of the Republican Party.
It is also a significant victory for the old guard Republicans in North Carolina and Washington who in recent months had been feuding with Mr. Cawthorn over his personal and political errors and foibles.

     Madison Cawthorn behind in early primary vote counting; state Sen. Chuck Edwards has lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSONVILLE - Early vote tallies show Rep. Madison Cawthorn, a Donald Trump endorsed candidate, trailing in the race for North Carolina's far western 11th District.
With 12% of the votes counted, Cawthorn had 31% of the tally to 34% by state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who like Cawthorn is from Henderson County.
To avoid a runoff, one of the candidates in the eight-way primary must get more than 30% of the vote.
Recently those have included a criminal misdemeanor charge for bringing a loaded gun through an airport checkpoint in Charlotte.
He is also facing another misdemeanor charge after a member of the North Carolina Highway Patrol said he was driving March 3 with a revoked license in Cleveland County.

     Summary: After coming under fire for weeks within his own party, Representative Madison Cawthorn narrowly lost his primary race Tuesday night against state Senator Chuck Edwards.
Cawthorn reportedly conceded to Edwards, according to CNN.
While Tillis endorsed Edwards, Cawthorn, who, along with far-right representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, has been among Donald Trump’s most loyal defenders, got a last-minute vote of confidence from the former president.
McCarthy said that Cawthorn told him he had “exaggerated” the allegations.
McCarthy has also stated Cawthorn was “wrong” to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn, the youngest member of Congress, failed to hold onto his House seat, after critics said the 26-year-old brought too much negative attention to his North Carolina district.
Cawthorn's congressional race has been one to watch during Tuesday's GOP primary election in North Carolina, as well as the Senate GOP primary.
In March, he was cited by North Carolina troopers for driving with a revoked license.
Under North Carolina primary rules, if no candidate got above 30%, there would have been second primary run-off election on July 26 between the first and second-place finishers.
In November, Budd will face the Democratic nominee, Cheri Beasley, a former North Carolina Supreme Court chief justice.
