     Watch DJ Steve Aoki Throw The BEST Worst First Pitch Ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor and Director Dax Shepard once said that there is no upside to throwing a first pitch.
Dax clearly had never met DJ and Producer Steve Aoki.
Aoki threw out the first pitch at The Red Sox and Astros game and it was so bad it was good.
He had an amazingly ridiculous wind up that led to the pitch going way over the catchers head and into the crowd.
Watch the video below.

     Steve Aoki’s wild first pitch at Fenway Park is not a-ok
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki is known for throwing cake.
Now he might be known for throwing a baseball.
The 44-year-old EDM DJ/producer and entrepreneur threw out the first pitch last night at Fenway Park in Boston, ahead of the Red Sox’ 6-3 win over the Houston Astros, and things didn’t exactly go as planned.
The pitch sailed high and wide and into the backstop, rivaling 50 Cent’s legendary first-pitch mishap as one of the worst of all time.
“I’ll stick to throwing [cake emoji]”, Aoki posted to Instagram after the gaffe.

     Watch hilarious moment Steve Aoki throws ‘WORST first pitch ever’ as fans compare DJ’s effort to iconic 50 Cent throw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: STEVE AOKI was mocked for throwing the 'worst first pitch ever' as he opened up a Red Sox game.
The legendary DJ, 44, had been asked to throw the ceremonial first pitch at Monday's MLB game between Boston and Houston Astros.
Decked out in colourful trousers and chunky gold trainers, Aoki strode to the pitcher's mound certainly looking the business.
Aoki's wild pitch sailed high into the Boston night, flying over the intended recipient and hurtling far into the crowd.
Fans were in hysterics at the horrendous pitch, with many comparing it to 50 Cent's infamous effort at the NY Mets in 2014.

     LOOK: Steve Aoki launches ceremonial first pitch into stands at Fenway Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DJ Steve Aoki was at Fenway Park to throw out the first pitch prior to Monday's game between the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox and let's just say it didn't go well.
Luckily, no fans were hurt when Aoki's throw sailed into the stands.
It's worth noting that Aoki is no stranger to throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Major League Baseball ball.
Back in 2015, Aoki threw out the first pitch at a Los Angeles Dodgers game and skipped the ball in front of the plate.
As far as where Aoki's bad pitch goes down in history, it probably doesn't top 50 Cent's.

     Steve Aoki Throws Horrible First Pitch At Red Sox Game, Worst Ever?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki might be able to throw a cake with pinpoint accuracy -- but he sure as hell can't do the same with a baseball, 'cause he absolutely airmailed the ceremonial first pitch at the Red Sox game on Monday night ... and it was truly awful.
Aoki warmed up his left arm, toed the rubber -- and then heaved a ball that went roughly 20 feet over his catcher's head.
Video shot by people in the stadium shows fans were laughing at the pitch -- because it was seriously just that bad.
@steveaoki threw out tonight’s first pitch @fenwaypark , it was just a little bit outside the strike zone….
Of course, Aoki is far from the first celeb to embarrass himself on an MLB diamond ... you'll recall, 50 Cent is known for the worst ever, throwing one sideways in 2014.
