     Madison Cawthorn behind in early primary vote counting; state Sen. Chuck Edwards has lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSONVILLE - Early vote tallies show Rep. Madison Cawthorn, a Donald Trump endorsed candidate, trailing in the race for North Carolina's far western 11th District.
With 12% of the votes counted, Cawthorn had 31% of the tally to 34% by state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who like Cawthorn is from Henderson County.
To avoid a runoff, one of the candidates in the eight-way primary must get more than 30% of the vote.
Recently those have included a criminal misdemeanor charge for bringing a loaded gun through an airport checkpoint in Charlotte.
He is also facing another misdemeanor charge after a member of the North Carolina Highway Patrol said he was driving March 3 with a revoked license in Cleveland County.

     Can a Last-Minute Trump Lifeline Save Madison Cawthorn?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After coming under fire for weeks within his own party, Representative Madison Cawthorn’s political future is in jeopardy, as North Carolina voters cast their primary ballots Tuesday in the 11th Congressional District race.
Cawthorn is being challenged by state Senator Chuck Edwards, who has been endorsed by Republican senator Thom Tillis, along with several other Republicans vying for the seat, including Rod Honeycutt, Michele Woodhouse, and Matthew Burril.
Though Cawthorn won the district’s general election by more than 12 points in 2020, staying on the Republican ticket in 2022 has been a challenge.
McCarthy said that Cawthorn told him he had “exaggerated” the allegations.
McCarthy has also stated Cawthorn was “wrong” to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug."
