     Summary: BOSTON — Houston Astros right-hander Jake Odorizzi collapsed with a leg injury while running to cover first base in the fifth inning Monday night against the Boston Red Sox and was taken off the Fenway Park field on a stretcher.
The team said he had “left lower leg discomfort,” and manager Dusty Baker said Odorizzi would get an MRI.
The pitcher was on crutches, wearing a boot and in good spirits after the game, Baker said.
Odorizzi, who entered the game with a 15 2/3 inning shutout streak, appeared to twist his left leg awkwardly on the delivery to Kiké Hernandez.
When he turned to cover first base, he took a step and then sprawled out, face down, on the grass.

     Jake Odorizzi stretchered off field; what injury means for Astros rotation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It also leaves a hole in the Astros' plan to emply a six-man rotation while ace Justin Verlander continues his remarkable comeback from Tommy John surgery.
No matter what they do, it's unlikely the Astros will be able to plug in someone to pitch as well as Odorizzi had the past three weeks.
However, the Astros had said they wanted to continue with the six-man rotation a bit longer to continue giving Verlander an extra day to recover as he returns from an 18-month layoff post-surgery.
The more intriguing option is 2019 fifth-round pick Hunter Brown, who most consider as the Astros’ top pitching prospect.
He just started throwing from 90 feet this month and the next step is to throw off the mound.

     Jake Odorizzi Carted Off With Left Leg Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 17: Odorizzi was on crutches and in a walking boot following the game, manager Dusty Baker told reporters (link via MLB.com’s Molly Burkhardt).
He stumbled off the mound and fell to the ground in pain; he was eventually carted off the field.
The team has yet to provide a substantive update, noting only that he departed the game due to left lower leg discomfort.
Given the nature of the injury, it’d register as a real surprise if the veteran didn’t require an injured list stint.
Odorizzi has made seven starts this season, tossing 31 2/3 innings.
