     How Liverpool beat Southampton to keep their Premier League title hopes alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool keep their title hopes alive after a narrow 2-1 victory over Southampton at St Mary's.
Southampton got off to the perfect start after a stunning strike from Nathan Redmond saw the Saints take the lead within 15 minutes.
Kostas Tsimikas' corner couldn't beat the first man but the clearance was poor and found the head of Joel Matip.
Matip's quick reactions saw him get his head to the ball first ahead of Walker-Peters and loop the ball over McCarthy.
Saints piled on the pressure late in the game but it was too late to rescue a point as Liverpool held on to their lead and took the valuable three points.

     Summary: Liverpool lifting the 2022 FA Cup trophy IMAGO / PA ImagesGoalkeeper - Alisson BeckerAs always, the first name on the team sheet is Alisson Becker.
After an impressive 120 minutes and a penalty shootout win against Chelsea in the FA Cup final, he cements his place in the starting XI.
The ‘Greek Scouser’ or as he put it after the FA Cup Final, the ‘Scouser Greek’.
