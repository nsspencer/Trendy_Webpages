     Summary: Jordan Peterson is an academic, an internet personality, and a big fan of beef.
The latest Peterson drama comes to us via Twitter, which the academic has just dramatically announced he will be “departing” forever.
For now, however, he wants us all to know that Twitter is a hellhole which makes your life infinitely worse.
Don’t critique my reasoning.”One rule for public life in the modern age – certainly one that every woman in the public eye has discovered – is that you have to develop a very thick skin.
Like every prominent person who likes developing “rules” for other people to live by, Peterson doesn’t seem to think they apply to him.

     Jordan Peterson ‘departs’ from Twitter after criticising Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Canadian psychologist and author Dr Jordan Peterson has announced he’s quitting Twitter after receiving “an endless flood of vicious insults” on the platform.
Peterson’s departure comes after he was criticised for a controversial twee t that shamed plus-size model Yumi Nu’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover.
Peterson received backlash on Monday after he shamed 25-year-old Nu by calling her “not beautiful” after the plus-size model’s cover debut for the 2022 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
Now, Twitter users are also pointing out the hypocrisy in Peterson quitting Twitter for receiving a series of “vicious insults,” only after he had shamed Nu that same day.
“Don’t let anyone tell you that the left has a monopoly on victim culture.”“Didn’t you tweet just to randomly insult the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue cover model?

     Summary: Profile of Dr. Jordan Peterson.
If Peterson doesn’t, that’s ok - frankly, no one asked his opinion on the matter.
Peterson, famous for decrying the youth of today as hyper-sensitive snowflakes, took great offense at being the subject of online mockery.
The culture war never sleeps, and Peterson seems to view himself as one of the most dedicated soldiers on the battlefield.
After all, Western civilization isn’t going to defend itself - there are beauty and gender norms being challenged every day!

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial Canadian psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson has quit Twitter after coming under furious fire for saying that a plus-size Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model is 'not beautiful'.
You're in no position to be assessing anybody's beauty you rickety junkie,' one person fired back at Peterson, who is the author of the international bestselling book 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote to Chaos.
Others flipped the script by copying the words from the psychologist's tweet and re-posting them with a picture of him.
Despite his insistence that he was 'departing' Twitter, Peterson's account remains active - and he continued to tweet even after claiming that he was exiting the social media site.
In 2017, he said in an interview: 'The idea of white privilege is absolutely reprehensible and it's not because white people aren't privileged.
