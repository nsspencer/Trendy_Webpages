     Houston Astros' Jake Odorizzi put on injured list with lower leg discomfort
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Houston Astros pitcher Jake Odorizzi, who was taken off the field on a stretcher Monday night, has been placed on the 15-day injury list Tuesday with what the team continues to describe only as "lower left leg discomfort."
Odorizzi fell while running to cover first base in the fifth inning of Monday's 6-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox.
Astros manager Dusty Baker said after Monday's game that the right-hander was on crutches, in a boot and in good spirits.
Odorizzi (3-2, 3.13 ERA), who entered the game with a 15⅔ inning shutout streak, appeared to twist his left leg awkwardly on the delivery to Kike Hernandez.
When he turned to cover first base, he took a step and then sprawled out, face down, on the grass.

     Jake Odorizzi stretchered off field; what injury means for Astros rotation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There's no word yet on the seriousness of Jake Odorizzi's injury, but he was placed on the 15-day injured list Tuesday.
It also leaves a hole in the Astros' plan to emply a six-man rotation while ace Justin Verlander continues his remarkable comeback from Tommy John surgery.
No matter what they do, it's unlikely the Astros will be able to plug in someone to pitch as well as Odorizzi had the past three weeks.
However, the Astros had said they wanted to continue with the six-man rotation a bit longer to continue giving Verlander an extra day to recover as he returns from an 18-month layoff post-surgery.
The more intriguing option is 2019 fifth-round pick Hunter Brown, who most consider as the Astros’ top pitching prospect.

     Astros Place Jake Odorizzi On Injured List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 17: Houston placed Odorizzi on the 15-day injured list this afternoon, recalling Seth Martinez in his place.
May 16: Astros starter Jake Odorizzi was carted off the field during tonight’s game against the Red Sox.
Odorizzi was on crutches and in a walking boot following the game, manager Dusty Baker told reporters (link via MLB.com’s Molly Burkhardt).
Given the nature of the injury, it’d register as a real surprise if the veteran didn’t require an injured list stint.
The Astros have been deploying a six-man rotation, with Justin Verlander, Cristian Javier, José Urquidy, Luis Garcia and Framber Valdez joining Odorizzi in the starting staff.
