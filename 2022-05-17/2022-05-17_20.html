     Diamondbacks Vs. Dodgers Game Preview: Rare Doubleheader At Dodger Stadium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After coming from behind to earn a 5-4 win in the series opener, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks meet for a rare day-night doubleheader at Dodger Stadium.
The Dodgers recalled Ryan Pepiot from Single-A Rancho Cucamonga as their 27th player permitted for a doubleheader.
The Diamondbacks counter with Tyler Gilbert, who was called up from Triple-A Reno ahead of Game 1 of the doubleheader.
That’s left Freddie Freeman and Trea Turner as the only Dodgers to start every game so far in 2022.
Prior to the game, the Dodgers activated Mitch White off the COVID-19 injured list and recalled Justin Bruihl from Triple-A Oklahoma City.
