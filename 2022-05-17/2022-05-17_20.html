     Dr. Oz makes creepy closing pitch, asks voters to imagine themselves lying in bed with him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who is running to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, made an unsettling political pitch on Monday ahead of the state's Republican primary, asking voters to imagine themselves lying next to him in bed.
"Creepiest political pitch ever?
"I'm not sure exactly what Dr. Oz is promising here, but nobody wants him to keep it," added Andy and Brian Kamenetzky.
According to Politico, the Republican primary is Oz's to lose, with the celebrity doctor clinging on to a small advantage in the polls.
Last month, Oz received support from Donald Trump in a move that rankled many of the former president's supporters.

     Dr. Oz relying on star-power, a Trump endorsement to win Pennsylvania Senate race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Dr. Mehmet Oz’s campaign for senate is relying heavily on his star power, which according to American University political professor Capri Cafaro isn’t a bad strategy.
“Celebrity candidates are nothing new,” said Cafaro, “I think that they’re becoming more maybe, accepted because maybe the lines are blurring a little bit more.
“They have influence, so I really don’t think there’s anything wrong with it,” said Pardeau.
“He has never really lived in the state,” Cafaro said.
But like the others, Barnette’s time in Pennsylvania has been short, which is a turnoff for some voters.

     Dr. Oz Tells Pennsylvania Voters He Wants to Have Sex With Them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday, Trump-endorsed US Senate candidate and noted New Jersey resident Mehmet “Dr.
Oz” Oz offered a pretty lewd final pitch to voters: In a Monday interview with Sean Hannity, the controversial celebrity doctor directed voters to imagine him in bed with them.
AdvertisementPersonally, I would rather not imagine being in bed with Dr. Oz, who just radiates a very creepy, unpleasant energy.
This is a man who, as recently as last April, was pushing hydroxychloroquine as a covid remedy, a chronic abortion rights flip-flopper, and all-around, just a deeply unserious man.
I very much hope Pennsylvania voters reject Dr. Oz.

     Final Odds as Kathy Barnette Faces Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz is still the favorite to win the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary despite a significant surge from rival Kathy Barnette.
Trump had said Monday that he didn't believe that Barnette could win the general election against "Radical Left Democrats."
The bookmaker has declared Oz the 2/9 favorite to win the GOP Senate candidacy in Pennsylvania, having been 8/11 the previous week.
A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey conducted between May 12 and 15 revealed that the battle between Oz and Barnette could be closer still.
When asked if the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania Senate election was held "today," 28 percent said they would back Oz, with Barnette close behind in second place on 27 percent.

     Trump-backed candidates Dr. Oz, Madison Cawthorn face major GOP primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Here's what to watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Pennsylvania, Trump has backed Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former host of "The Dr. Oz Show," who is one of three top contenders in an intense — and intensely expensive — battle for an open Senate seat.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn (NC-11) makes remarks at the Hilton Anatole Hotel in Dallas, Texas on Friday, July 9, 2021.
In April, Cawthorn was cited on a misdemeanor criminal charge for bringing a handgun to a North Carolina airport.
Sen. Thom Tillis, a fellow North Carolina Republican, called for a House ethics probe into the allegations.
Polls in the North Carolina primary are open from 6:30 a.m.

     Summary: The Ohio-born doctor, whose parents emigrated to the US from Turkey, spent two years in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.
Dr Oz described himself as a “Teddy Roosevelt Republican” in a 2008 interview that also praised Hillary Clinton and identified himself as “not socially conservative”.
The GOP primary winner on 17 May will face the Democratic challenger in the general election on 8 November.
If elected, Dr Oz would be the first Muslim member of the Senate.
Dr Oz has refused to say whether he believes the 2020 election was rigged.
