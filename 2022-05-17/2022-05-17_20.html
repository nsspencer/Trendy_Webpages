     Summary: Better, higher-fidelity data will allow the Pentagon to draw better conclusions about unidentified phenomena.
Mr. Bray said the Pentagon was focused on a few reports of unexplained phenomena with strange flight characteristics — like fast movement or no visible means of propulsion.
“We’ll go wherever the data takes us,” Mr. Bray said.
The intelligence community criticized the document because it failed to draw conclusions or offer explanations for most of the events.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bray tried to explain why it is so difficult to identify the images in the fuzzy videos.

The military's 2021 report said no evidence of aliens had been found.
Moultrie noted that he's a science fiction fan, and that simple human curiosity means that "we want to know what's out there just like you want to know what's out there."
As the effort moves forward, Moultrie told lawmakers, a major focus will be on improving cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration and other government agencies.
While the military's database does include some civilian reports, the vast majority have come from within the military.

     What We Learned from Congress’ First Open UFO Hearing in 50 Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carson, chair of the House Intelligence Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation subcommittee, presided over the first open hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years.
"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena are a potential national security threat.
The crux of the bipartisan hearing revolved around a 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding 144 incidents studied by the Pentagon’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force.
During the hearing, lawmakers witnessed select videos of UAPs from various times and places that—while under investigation—are currently unexplainable.
Nobody is officially blaming aliens, at least not yetYet exchanges between Bray and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., raised some eyebrows.
