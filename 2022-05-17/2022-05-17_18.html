    </h2>

     Summary: Walmart on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin, as the nation's largest retailer felt pressure from rising fuel costs and higher levels of inventory.
Walmart is a much-watched company as investors and economists look for clues about how the American consumer is weathering inflation.
The significant jump in fuel prices, elevated labor costs and aggressive inventory levels weighed on the company, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told CNBC in an interview.

     Summary: What happenedShares of Walmart (WMT -11.38%) sank 11.4% on Tuesday after the retail giant's profits fell short of investors' expectations.
Higher labor costs further dented the company's operating margin.
"U.S. inflation levels, particularly in food and fuel, created more pressure on margin mix and operating costs than we expected."
Management now expects the company's operating income and earnings per share to decline by roughly 1% in fiscal 2023.
Walmart had previously projected that its operating profits would grow by approximately 3%.

     Walmart Stock Slips as Inflation Kicks In
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the losses, I’m bullish on Walmart; if any company is going to survive spiking inflation, it’s going to be Walmart.
The average Walmart price target of $162.21 implies 22.6% upside potential.
In the last three months, sell transactions have led buy transactions by 24 to 18.
For the full year, meanwhile, sell transactions led buy transactions far and away, with 159 sell transactions against 61 buy transactions.
All it really has to do to be the “everyday low price” store is just be lower than its competitors.
