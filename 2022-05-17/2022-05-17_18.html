The Panthers headed into the series 0-18 on the power play and they did not have much luck with Tampa Bay disrupting the passing and shooting lanes.
“He played the puck more, he was on the puck, I thought he had a pretty solid game,” Brunette said.
It has been especially true when they head to the power play, where they are now 0-21 on the postseason.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Lightning won the first two games of their playoff series with the Florida Panthers on the road last year.
In Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper’s estimation, Vasilevskiy was the story.
Florida went 0 for 18 on the power play in the series win against the Capitals and was scoreless on three more tries Tuesday.
“We knew, right away our coaching staff told us that wasn’t going to be a goal,” Duclair said.
Tampa Bay left no doubt late, with Kucherov and Colton each getting power-play tallies in the final 4:06 to put the game away.

     Florida Panthers drop Game 1 to Tampa Bay, 4-1. Time for Huberdeau and Barkov to step up | Opinion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is what Florida Panthers vs. Tampa Bay Lightning is all about in this NHL second-round playoff series that began Tuesday night on the Cats’ ice in Sunrise.
Tampa ousted Florida in six games in last year’s playoffs and this was not the home start the Panthers needed.
Through seven playoff games Florida is now 0-for-21 on power plays while giving up eight such goals to opponents.
Panthers coach Andrew Brunette seemed rather upbeat for a guy whose team had just lost Game 1 at home 4-1.
And made it 4-1 with 2:16 left on a Ross Colton shot -- and the third power play of the night.
