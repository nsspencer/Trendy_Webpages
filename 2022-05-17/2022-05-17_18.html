     Fall Guys is going free-to-play on the Epic Games Store in June
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mediatonic’s bean-themed party royale Fall Guys will go free-to-play on June 21st, the studio announced last night.
From that point on, Fall Guys will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, although it will still remain playable for existing owners on Steam without them having to move to Epic's launcher.
It’s not that surprising to see Fall Guys move to the Epic Games Store, as Epic acquired Mediatonic in March last year.
Indeed, compulsory sign-in with an Epic Games account was introduced to Fall Guys in season six, even for people playing on Steam.
The full details of what changes are coming to Fall Guys can be read here.

     See Fall Guys Go Even More Chaotic And Free In Brand-New Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jason Collins | 7 seconds agoIt’s a big day with plenty of good news for the fans of the jellybean battle royale video game Fall Guys.
The showcase started by saying the Fall Guys is going fully free-to-play after spending less than two years on Steam, requiring a one-time upfront payment.
Lastly, a bit of disappointing news —Fall Guys are leaving Valve’s digital storefront and moving over to Epic Games Store.
Considering that Bethesda is moving their titles to Steam, we’d say that the Steam’s gaming community won-some-lost-some with the arrival of Bethesda and the departure of Fall Guys.
In fact, Fall Guys is following the very same trajectory Psyonix’s car soccer game took when it moved to Epic Games Store.
