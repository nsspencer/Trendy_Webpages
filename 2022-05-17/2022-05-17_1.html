     Final Odds as Kathy Barnette Faces Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz is still the favorite to win the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary despite a significant surge from rival Kathy Barnette.
Trump had said Monday that he didn't believe that Barnette could win the general election against "Radical Left Democrats."
The bookmaker has declared Oz the 2/9 favorite to win the GOP Senate candidacy in Pennsylvania, having been 8/11 the previous week.
A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey conducted between May 12 and 15 revealed that the battle between Oz and Barnette could be closer still.
When asked if the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania Senate election was held "today," 28 percent said they would back Oz, with Barnette close behind in second place on 27 percent.

     Jan. 6 connection binds Pennsylvania Republicans (in a bad way)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the course of the last 16 months, many Americans have seen images of right-wing radicals who were in Washington, D.C., for Jan. 6.
What much of the public may not fully appreciate, however, is that some of those images captured Republicans who are now seeking powerful government offices.
While Barnette may be the only leading Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who was in the nation’s capital on Jan. 6, in Pennsylvania's Republican gubernatorial race, the frontrunner, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, was there, too.
Let’s not forget about Teddy Daniels, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania, who’s been endorsed by Mastriano and Barnette.
God bless our patriots,’ he wrote.”Daniels later claimed that he didn’t enter the Capitol building.

     Kathy Barnette Can Win the PA Senate Seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once polling over the last week showed Kathy Barnette had made a breathtaking rush to contention in Pennsylvania's Republican primary for an open U.S. Senate seat, the establishment long knives came for her.
But this belated, transparently gratuitous hatchet job may falter because Kathy Barnette can win in November.
Consider that the Democratic nominee for this Senate seat will be sitting Lt. Gov.
This is not Ohio, where Trump endorsed an outsider populist who managed to overcome feckless opposition in the Republican Senate primary.
Even as he was claiming she cannot win, Trump acknowledged Barnette may "have a wonderful future in the Republican Party."

     Photos of Senate candidate Kathy Barnette marching near Proud Boys on Jan. 6 surface online. Will it matter?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photographs showing a Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate marching near Proud Boys members on Jan. 6 have stirred controversy online.
Pictures of Kathy Barnette, a political commentator from Montgomery County, marching near two Proud Boys members who were later indicted for entering the U.S. Capitol Building that day began spreading online late Sunday night.
"She has no connection whatsoever to the proud boys (sic)."
In a video posted to Barnette's YouTube page a few weeks after the 2020 Election, she alleged deceased voters, noncitizens and unregistered people cast ballots in the 4th District.
Barnette's views on the 2020 election are not unique among the seven candidates currently vying for the GOP Senate ballot spot.
