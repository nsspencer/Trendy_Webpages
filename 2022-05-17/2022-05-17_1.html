     Boston Celtics 'out-toughed' as Miami Heat use huge third quarter to take Game 1 behind Jimmy Butler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Heat outscore the Celtics 39-14 in the third quarter alone to take the lead and never look back in a huge Game 1 win.
(3:08)MIAMI -- The Boston Celtics exited their locker room at halftime Tuesday night in control of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
After Boston went 15-for-28 on contested shots in the first half, the Celtics went 1-for-12 on them in the third.
The last time Boston took at least 7 minutes to score in a quarter was Game 3 of the 2002 Eastern Conference semifinals versus the Detroit Pistons.
The Heat needed to have that kind of reversal after the Celtics had controlled the first half with relative ease.

     NBA playoffs: Jimmy Butler scores 41, Heat dominate third to take Game 1 from Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Butler scored 27 of his 41 points in the second half, and a huge third quarter by the Heat carried them to a 118-107 win over the short-handed Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday night.
Butler had 17 alone in the third, outscoring the Celtics by himself over those 12 minutes.
Jayson Tatum scored 29 for the Celtics, who were without starters Marcus Smart (foot) and Al Horford (health and safety protocols).
A 22-2 run was how Miami started the second half, the run punctuated by steals that led to baskets on three consecutive possessions.
Strus had one, the next two by Butler pushed the lead out to 76-64, and the Heat were off and running.

     Summary: Celtics 8 takeaways as Heat crush short-handed Celtics in second half of Game 1 The Celtics embarrassed themselves in the third quarter.
Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesFor the second consecutive series, the Celtics lost Game 1 â€” falling 118-107 to the Heat on Tuesday in their Eastern Conference finals opener.
Then, in the second half, disaster.
The Celtics outscored the Heat in the first, second and fourth quarters, but the Heat won the third 39-14 which proved utterly insurmountable.
After the first half, Tatum looked like he was going to win the superstar battle comfortably against Butler, but Butler was transcendent in the second half.
