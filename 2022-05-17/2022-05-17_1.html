     Reported details behind Sasha Banks and Naomi walking out of WWE before Monday Night RAW
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sasha Banks and Naomi walked out of Monday Night RAW last night amid an apparent creative dispute with the company.
The match was set to feature Banks, Naomi, Doudrop, Nikki A.S.H., Asuka, and Becky Lynch, which was advertised at the start of tonight’s Raw.
The idea that Sasha and Naomi considered anyone “unsafe” was news to the talent and wasn’t a known thing until the statement was released.
We’re told that Sasha Banks and Naomi’s issues largely were concerns about the direction of their tag team and the division as a whole.
Given the lack of attention the Women’s Tag Team championships have historically had, that’s not hard to believe.
