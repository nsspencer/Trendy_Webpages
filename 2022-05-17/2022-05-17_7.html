    </h2>

In fact, for launch, a new face is joining the Apex Legends Mobile roster: Fade.

     Apex Legends Mobile – Handheld Battle Royale Mayhem Now Available
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EA and Respawn Entertainment have just unleashed their mobile take on their ever-expanding battle royale/hero shooter, simply known as Apex Legends Mobile.
Apex Legends Mobile takes the same experiences that players can get from the PC and console version of Apex Legends and shrinks it down to your smartphone and tablet with little to no compromise to the gameplay.
In a trailer released on the official Apex Legends Mobile YouTube Channel, many aspects of the game have been shown off, including the fast-paced gunplay that many Apex Legends fans have come to know and love.
The biggest reward that players can earn from the battle pass is being able to unlock Fade for free, by reaching level 25 in the free Battle Pass.
Apex Legends Mobile is available now for Android and iOS devices.
