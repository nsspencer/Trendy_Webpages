     Jordan Peterson Quits Twitter Over 'Insults' After Criticizing Woman's Body
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Psychologist and author Jordan Peterson has announced he plans on leaving Twitter while complaining about the "endless flood" of insults he receives on the platform.
In a series of tweets, Peterson explains that he will be "departing" Twitter once again and will soon write an article explaining further issues he has with the platform.
I started using it again, a few days ago, and I would say that my life got worse again almost instantly," Peterson wrote.
In another tweet, Peterson says he plans to write an article on the "technical reasons that Twitter is maddening," ending the post with "bye for now."
Hours before he announced he was leaving, Peterson was highly criticized over his tweet about Nu, who became the first Asian-American plus-size model to feature on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

     Summary: Jordan Peterson Quits Twitter After Backlash to Sleazy TweetBy Dustin Rowles | Social Media | May 17, 2022 |American model and singer-songwriter Yumi Nu appears this month on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first Asian plus-size model to do so.
Jordan Peterson, who loves capitalism, nevertheless had issues with this cover because … he is blind?
It turns out that even people who inexplicably follow Jordan Peterson understand attractiveness.
Look again, and maybe lay off the protein.”I think if the backlash had been limited to those of us who whisper Jordan Peterson insults in our sleep, Peterson might have been fine.
—Jordan Peterson — Angus Johnston (@studentactivism) May 17, 2022That, hopefully, will mean we hear much less often from Jordan Peterson, although I really must — must — recommend the takedown of his Carnivore’s Diet on the Maintenance Phase podcast.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Peterson is an academic, an internet personality, and a big fan of beef.
The latest Peterson drama comes to us via Twitter, which the academic has just dramatically announced he will be “departing” forever.
For now, however, he wants us all to know that Twitter is a hellhole which makes your life infinitely worse.
Don’t critique my reasoning.”One rule for public life in the modern age – certainly one that every woman in the public eye has discovered – is that you have to develop a very thick skin.
Like every prominent person who likes developing “rules” for other people to live by, Peterson doesn’t seem to think they apply to him.

     Summary: Profile of Dr. Jordan Peterson.
If Peterson doesn’t, that’s ok - frankly, no one asked his opinion on the matter.
Peterson, famous for decrying the youth of today as hyper-sensitive snowflakes, took great offense at being the subject of online mockery.
The culture war never sleeps, and Peterson seems to view himself as one of the most dedicated soldiers on the battlefield.
After all, Western civilization isn’t going to defend itself - there are beauty and gender norms being challenged every day!

     Dr. Jordan Peterson quits Twitter over backlash about Sports Illustrated Swimsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial Canadian psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson has quit Twitter after coming under furious fire for saying that a plus-size Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model is 'not beautiful'.
You're in no position to be assessing anybody's beauty you rickety junkie,' one person fired back at Peterson, who is the author of the international bestselling book 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote to Chaos.
Others flipped the script by copying the words from the psychologist's tweet and re-posting them with a picture of him.
Despite his insistence that he was 'departing' Twitter, Peterson's account remains active - and he continued to tweet even after claiming that he was exiting the social media site.
In 2017, he said in an interview: 'The idea of white privilege is absolutely reprehensible and it's not because white people aren't privileged.
