    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Naomi and Banks have been silent on social media since the walkout but one theory has been shared on social media.
AdvertisementIn the microscopic chance this is all a storyline, kudos to McMahon and friends for this swerve to get hype for WWE’s women’s division.
Back on planet Earth, Banks and Naomi should be commended for taking a stand against creative decisions they feel are unmistakably bad.
The current WWE women’s tag team champions have some leverage here.
If McMahon has no desire to compromise and patch things up with Banks and Naomi, he deserves the levee breaking and every consequence of letting them walk permanently.
