     Ezra Miller Tells Cops Misgendering Them Is A ‘Hate Crime’ In New Bodycam Footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Flash actor Ezra Miller has been arrested multiple times in Hawaii recently, and new bodycam footage from an arrest in March shows them insisting that Hawaii police officers stop misgendering them.
In the new video, Miller complains about experiencing wrist pain from the cuffs, adding that they are a musician and that their nerves are important to them.
Following this, an officer refers to Miller as “sir,” which clearly upsets Miller.
I'm transgender nonbinary,” they reply.
Miller continues, “If you fail to do that again, it is an act of intentional bigotry and it is a technical hate crime according to U.S. Federal law.”The new footage comes from Miller’s arrest in March for disorderly conduct and harassment.

     Ezra Miller Accused Of Theft By Other Artists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miller is now being accused of stealing music that did not belong to them.
Even the tracks that Miller was not part of were posted on Soundcloud without any of the artists’ permission to do so.
Miller clearly does not care about his behavior right now, and these artists don’t want anyone to have to fall for working with the actor after this instance.
Ezra Miller has had a string of odd and terrible behavior for months on end.
Ezra Miller might need some counseling and AA meetings because there is something obviously going wrong with the once prominent actor.
