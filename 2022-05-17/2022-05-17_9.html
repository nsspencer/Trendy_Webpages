     The White House opens up another round of free, at-home virus tests to order through the Postal Service.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House said on Tuesday that Americans were now eligible for a third order of free, at-home coronavirus tests shipped through the Postal Service.
The move doubled to 16 the total number of tests the program has made available to each household.
Under withering criticism for those shortages, Mr. Biden promised a billion at-home tests, and his administration secured commitments for hundreds of millions of them.
The White House has said that half of them would be distributed through the Postal Service program.
Over 70 million U.S. households — more than half the households in the country — have ordered tests that way so far, and roughly 350 million tests have been delivered.
