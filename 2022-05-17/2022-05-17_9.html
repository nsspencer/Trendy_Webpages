     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — Karine Jean-Pierre, the new White House press secretary, hopes she can inspire young people to “dream big and dream bigger” now that she has broken a barrier by becoming the first Black and gay woman to be chief spokesperson for the president of the United States.
She followed Obama to the White House, working in his political affairs operation and later on his reelection campaign.
Jean-Pierre, 47, worked on Biden’s presidential campaign, then followed him to the White House as principal deputy press secretary.
In that role, she led the briefing on several occasions, making history in May 2021 when she first subbed for press secretary Jen Psaki.
Biden promoted Jean-Pierre after Psaki, who had been press secretary since the start of the administration, announced she was stepping down last Friday.
