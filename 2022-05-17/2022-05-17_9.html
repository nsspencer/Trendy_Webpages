     May 17 primary takeaways: Cawthorn loses, election denier Mastriano wins Pennsylvania GOP gov primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Doug Mastriano's primary win in Pennsylvania, the "Big Lie" could again dominate another election.
Embattled GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn lost his primary race in North Carolina.
WASHINGTON— The "Big Lie" that Joe Biden did not win the presidency continues to dominate the 2022 primary elections, nearly two years after the 2020 presidential election.
In a win for former President Donald Trump, state senator and retired Army Col. Doug Mastriano won the Republican nomination for governor of Pennsylvania on Tuesday night.
Mastriano has repeatedly supported Trump's falsehoods about Biden's victory, although he attempted to tone down his rhetoric during a victory speech.

     Madison Cawthorn loses his re-election bid after a deluge of scandals.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chuck Edwards, a three-term state senator and business owner, has edged out Representative Madison Cawthorn in the Republican primary for a House seat representing North Carolina’s 11th District.
Luke Ball, a representative for Mr. Cawthorn, said late Tuesday that the congressman had called Mr. Edwards to concede.
Mr. Edwards’s narrow triumph was called by The Associated Press.
The outcome served as a rebuke of Mr. Cawthorn, a right-wing firebrand and the youngest freshman in Congress, who was once seen as a rising star of the Republican Party.
It is also a significant victory for the old guard Republicans in North Carolina and Washington who in recent months had been feuding with Mr. Cawthorn over his personal and political errors and foibles.

     Summary: (CNN) Rep. Madison Cawthorn conceded his race in the GOP primary for North Carolina's 11th District to opponent Chuck Edwards in a phone call, Cawthorn spokesperson Luke Ball said.
"I received a call from Congressman Cawthorn just a few of minutes ago.
Edwards was one of seven candidates looking to oust the Trump-backed Cawthorn.
He was backed by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis as well as state Senate leader Phil Berger and a number of other North Carolina Republicans.
Trump doubled down on his support for Cawthorn earlier this week, asking voters to give the firebrand freshman, who is the youngest member of the US House, "a second chance."

     Summary: Scandal-plagued Rep. Madison Cawthorn is ousted in North Carolina primaryEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images Allison Joyce/Getty ImagesRep. Madison Cawthorn, a freshman Republican who's been beset by scandal since taking office last year, has been ousted in a heated primary in North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
Cawthorn lost to state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who had received the backing of some Republicans who had tired of Cawthorn's controversies.
In North Carolina, a winner just needs to cross a 30% threshold in order to avoid a July runoff election.
A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who was first elected in 2020 to former Rep. Mark Meadows' seat, Cawthorn faced a crowded field of primary challengers in a district that will likely remain red.
Sen. Tillis also called for a bipartisan inquiry by the House Ethics Committee into allegations of Cawthorn participating in insider trading.

     Madison Cawthorn loses primary, concedes to Chuck Edwards in North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Buckling under the weight of scandal, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C. — a favorite of former President Donald Trump — lost his re-nomination bid in western North Carolina’s 11th District on Tuesday, NBC News projected.
State Sen. Chuck Edwards, a conservative backed by many of the state’s establishment players, won with about a third of the vote in an eight-way race.
Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball told reporters Tuesday night that Cawthorn had called Edwards to concede.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn speaks before former President Donald Trump takes the stage at a rally in Selma, N.C., on April 9.
The district has a clear Republican lean: Trump won it by 10 percentage points, according to the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.
