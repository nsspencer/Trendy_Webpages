     House Panel Opens Public Hearing on Unexplained Aerial Sightings

     Summary: Mr. Bray’s remarks were aimed at trying to explain why it is so difficult to identify the images in the fuzzy videos.
Mr. Bray tried to stamp out some speculation that the phenomena were extraterrestrial in origin.
task force that is, that would suggest it’s anything nonterrestrial in origin,” Mr. Bray said, referring to unidentified aerial phenomena.
Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, said he was more interested in discussions of Russian or Chinese hypersonic programs than unidentified phenomena.
The government’s inability to identify objects in sensitive operating areas was “tantamount to intelligence failure that we certainly want to avoid,” Mr. Crawford said.

     Summary: The military's UFO database now has info from about 400 reported incidentsEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/APA database of reports of UFOs now includes about 400 incidents, up from 143 assessed in a report released about a year ago, a Navy intelligence official told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.
The military's 2021 report said no evidence of aliens had been found.
Moultrie noted that he's a science fiction fan, and that simple human curiosity means that "we want to know what's out there just like you want to know what's out there."
As the effort moves forward, Moultrie told lawmakers, a major focus will be on improving cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration and other government agencies.
While the military's database does include some civilian reports, the vast majority have come from within the military.

     UFO hearing features historic testimony from Pentagon officials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On May 17, Congress held a hearing on UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), better known as UFOs.
AdvertisementThe hearing was the first time in more than 50 years that U.S. officials have provided testimony for public consumption about their investigation of UFOs.
AdvertisementOfficials have said that the unidentified objects could pose a threat to national security.
In their testimony, the Pentagon officials focused largely on the potential danger the objects pose to military equipment and personnel, and steered away from speculation about whether the craft were extraterrestrial.
Moultrie interjected and said the question would be addressed better in a closed, classified session that followed the public hearing.
