     Former Bears RB Tarik Cohen tore Achilles tendon during live-streamed workout, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An MRI has revealed that former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon during a training session being livestreamed on his Instagram account, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Tuesday.
The hard-luck player, released in March by the Bears because of past injuries, grabbed the back of his leg after going down during the workout on Tuesday.
The incident was seen on Instagram Live, with Cohen falling to the floor after backpedaling.

A fourth-round draft pick in 2017, Cohen had a strong rookie year as a running back and kick returner.
