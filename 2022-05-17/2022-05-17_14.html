    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mediatonic’s bean-themed party royale Fall Guys will go free-to-play on June 21st, the studio announced last night.
From that point on, Fall Guys will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, although it will still remain playable for existing owners on Steam without them having to move to Epic's launcher.
It’s not that surprising to see Fall Guys move to the Epic Games Store, as Epic acquired Mediatonic in March last year.
Indeed, compulsory sign-in with an Epic Games account was introduced to Fall Guys in season six, even for people playing on Steam.
The full details of what changes are coming to Fall Guys can be read here.
