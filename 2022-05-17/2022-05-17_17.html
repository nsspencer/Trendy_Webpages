     Julia Fox Thinks Grocery Shopping In Underwear Should Be “Socially Acceptable”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At some point, while watching Julia Fox’s parade of increasingly outrageous looks over the past few months, you may have asked yourself at one point or another, “How will she ever top this one?” Well, leave it up to Fox to figure it out.
The actress seems to never run out of ideas for how to shock the public and her latest look just stepped it up another notch.
On Sunday, Fox stepped out in her most-out there look yet while doing the most mundane thing possible—she went grocery shopping in her bra and underwear.
Fox shared her reasoning for the look on Instagram, writing, “I just think if it’s socially acceptable at the beach, it should be the same everywhere,” she said.
Clearly, the market she shops at doesn’t have a “no shoes, no shirt, no service” rule, or else she may have run into some trouble.
