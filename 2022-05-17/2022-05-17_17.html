     Sasha Banks, Naomi walk out of WWE Monday Night Raw main event over storyline issues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE officials had to make sudden changes to the main event of Monday Night Raw after the women's tag team champions Sasha Banks and Naomi reportedly walked out of the arena as the show aired.
The original plan by WWE was for the main event of Monday Night Raw at Scope Arena in Norfolk, Virginia to be a "Six Pack Challenge" to determine the challenger for WWE Raw Women's Champion Bianca Belair at the Hell in A Cell pay-per-view event on June 5.
"When Sasha Banks and Naomi arrived at the arena this afternoon, they were informed of their participation in the main event of tonight's Monday Night Raw," WWE said in a statement.
"Monday Night Raw is a scripted live TV show, whose characters are expected to perform the requirements of their contract," WWE said.
"We regret we were unable to deliver, as advertised, tonight's main event."

     Why Sasha Banks &amp; Naomi Walked Out Of Raw &amp; What's Next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The WWE Monday Night Raw tag-team champions Sasha Banks and Naomi reportedly walked out on the May 16 edition of the show despite being advertised for the event.
Asuka would win after giving Lynch the mist-in-the-eyes treatment, but that wasn't the talk of WWE Monday Night Raw afterward.
A majority of the focus was on Banks, Naomi, and their choice to take their ball and go home.
There's certainly a lot to digest with regards to Naomi and Banks leaving Raw, and as of this writing, neither superstar has made any public comments about the matter.
The walkout forced major changes to Monday Night Raw and presumably Hell In A Cell, based on the planned finish of Naomi winning the six-pack challenge.

     Why Sasha Banks, Naomi walked out on Monday Night Raw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NORFOLK, VA. — WWE star Sasha Banks and her women’s tag team champion partner Naomi reportedly walked out during the live event on Monday Night Raw in Norfolk, Virginia.
According to reports, Banks had an issue with the match because the creative department planned to have Naomi win the match and lose to Belair.
Fightful Select reported that Banks would challenge Ronda Rousey for the Smackdown Women’s Championship on the same night and also lose the match.
WWEAfter Banks and Naomi left the show, WWE changed the main event to a match between Lynch and Asuka to determine Belair’s next challenger.
“Monday Night Raw is a scripted live TV show, whose characters are expected to perform the requirements of their contract,” WWE said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Naomi and Banks have been silent on social media since the walkout but one theory has been shared on social media.
AdvertisementIn the microscopic chance this is all a storyline, kudos to McMahon and friends for this swerve to get hype for WWE’s women’s division.
Back on planet Earth, Banks and Naomi should be commended for taking a stand against creative decisions they feel are unmistakably bad.
The current WWE women’s tag team champions have some leverage here.
If McMahon has no desire to compromise and patch things up with Banks and Naomi, he deserves the levee breaking and every consequence of letting them walk permanently.

     WWE’s Sasha Banks and Naomi walkout mid-show after feeling disrespected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (WDVM) — The wrestling world was shocked last Monday night when the Women’s Tag Team Champions turned in their titles and walked out mid-show.
It left fans stunned and confused, with some thinking it was part of the show, but WWE released a statement confirming that Sasha Banks and Naomi left.
When Sasha Banks and Naomi arrived at the arena this afternoon, they were informed of their participation in the main event of tonight’s Monday Night Raw.
They claimed they weren’t respected enough as tag team champions.
Wrestling insiders said Sasha Banks and Naomi are two big reasons women’s wrestling has grown — and they say this incident will lead to changes of some sort in the future.
