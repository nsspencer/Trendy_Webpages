     Dr. Oz makes creepy closing pitch, asks voters to imagine themselves lying in bed with him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who is running to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, made an unsettling political pitch on Monday ahead of the state's Republican primary, asking voters to imagine themselves lying next to him in bed.
"Creepiest political pitch ever?
"I'm not sure exactly what Dr. Oz is promising here, but nobody wants him to keep it," added Andy and Brian Kamenetzky.
According to Politico, the Republican primary is Oz's to lose, with the celebrity doctor clinging on to a small advantage in the polls.
Last month, Oz received support from Donald Trump in a move that rankled many of the former president's supporters.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Dr. Mehmet Oz’s campaign for senate is relying heavily on his star power, which according to American University political professor Capri Cafaro isn’t a bad strategy.
“Celebrity candidates are nothing new,” said Cafaro, “I think that they’re becoming more maybe, accepted because maybe the lines are blurring a little bit more.
“They have influence, so I really don’t think there’s anything wrong with it,” said Pardeau.
“He has never really lived in the state,” Cafaro said.
But like the others, Barnette’s time in Pennsylvania has been short, which is a turnoff for some voters.

     Final Odds as Kathy Barnette Faces Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz is still the favorite to win the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary despite a significant surge from rival Kathy Barnette.
Trump had said Monday that he didn't believe that Barnette could win the general election against "Radical Left Democrats."
The bookmaker has declared Oz the 2/9 favorite to win the GOP Senate candidacy in Pennsylvania, having been 8/11 the previous week.
A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey conducted between May 12 and 15 revealed that the battle between Oz and Barnette could be closer still.
When asked if the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania Senate election was held "today," 28 percent said they would back Oz, with Barnette close behind in second place on 27 percent.

     Dr. Oz Tells Pennsylvania Voters He Wants to Have Sex With Them

     Summary: With the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday, Trump-endorsed US Senate candidate and noted New Jersey resident Mehmet “Dr.
Oz” Oz offered a pretty lewd final pitch to voters: In a Monday interview with Sean Hannity, the controversial celebrity doctor directed voters to imagine him in bed with them.
AdvertisementPersonally, I would rather not imagine being in bed with Dr. Oz, who just radiates a very creepy, unpleasant energy.
This is a man who, as recently as last April, was pushing hydroxychloroquine as a covid remedy, a chronic abortion rights flip-flopper, and all-around, just a deeply unserious man.
I very much hope Pennsylvania voters reject Dr. Oz.

     Pa. Primary latest: GOP Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz feeling confident

The 52-year-old said he went to the hospital on Friday after not feeling well and would remain for a while for observation.
He vowed to press forward despite the health setback, saying, "Our campaign isn't slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday.
"It seems like folks like Conor Lamb or Malcolm Kenyatta never got the type of traction to be really competitive in this race.
So, I would be surprised if Fetterman doesn't hang on in that race," he says.
