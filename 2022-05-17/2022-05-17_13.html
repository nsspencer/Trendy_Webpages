     MRI shows torn Achilles tendon for former Chicago Bears RB Tarik Cohen, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An MRI has confirmed that former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon during a training session being livestreamed on his Instagram account.
The incident was seen on Instagram Live, with Cohen falling to the floor after backpedaling.
Cohen, now a free agent, played three full seasons with Chicago but made it to only three games in 2021 before tearing knee ligaments.
He missed the rest of that season and then was released by the Bears.
A fourth-round draft pick in 2017, Cohen had a strong rookie year as a running back and kick returner.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a difficult couple of years for former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen.
Cohen has struggled to battle back from a torn ACL suffered in Week 3 of the 2020 season.
Cohen looks to have suffered an injury during training that was being streamed on Instagram Live.
The hope is the injury isn’t serious and that Cohen can soon get back to training so he can find a new landing spot in the NFL.
But it sounds like it could be an Achilles injury, which would be another devastating blow for Cohen.

     WATCH: Tarik Cohen re-injured during Instagram Live segment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY SportsYou’d be hard-pressed to find an active NFL player who’s been more unlucky than former Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen over the past few seasons.
Shortly after signing a four-year, $17.25 million contract extension with the Bears in Sept. of 2020, Cohen has played in just three NFL games since.
After playing in 51 consecutive games, Cohen would go on to miss the next 30 games the Bears would play.
Cohen also later revealed that he also tore his MCL and fractured his tibial plateau in addition to the ACL injury.
This is an extremely tough break for a player who’s worked tirelessly at getting back on the field.
