     Lil Wayne fires off vulgar tweet at Mavericks' Mark Cuban, then deletes it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesMark Cuban's tweet at Lil Wayne must have really stung the New Orleans rapper, because he let the Mavericks owner's diss sink in for nearly 36 hours before firing back with a pretty gross description of what he might do to the billionaire.
For a quick recap, Lil Wayne, who is close friends with the Phoenix Suns' Chris Paul, called out Mavericks star Luka Dončić's flopping tendencies during the Suns-Mavericks series, tweeting simply, "Luka a ho."
The Mavericks ended up bouncing back and winning the final two games of the series to eliminate the Suns while Lil Wayne sat courtside in Phoenix.

     Lil’ Wayne tweets (then deletes) impossibly NSFW threat at Mark Cuban amid NBA playoff beef
    </h2>

     Summary: We aren’t even allowed to write what Wayne said, so you’ll just have to read it for yourself.
But needless to say, it is HIGHLY specific and DEAD serious.
There’s no doubt in our minds that, in that moment of rage about being daggered with his own knife, Wayne would have made good on his pledge.
As certain as the sun coming up tomorrow.
Let’s be glad it didn’t come to that, even if it is supposedly sterile.

     Lil Wayne Threatens To Have Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban “Smacked”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of Hip-Hop’s most avid sports fans, Lil Wayne has a history of injecting himself into rivalries between teams, with the rap legend usually coming up on the winning end.
However, Weezy lost his composure following the Game 7 matchup between the Dallas Mavericks and the Phoenix Suns on Sunday (May 15), threatening to have Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban assaulted the following Tuesday (May 17) in response to a tweet Cuban wrote poking fun at the rapper.
Lil Wayne responds to Mark Cuban then deleted it.
pic.twitter.com/tRlrgyUICB — Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) May 18, 2022A friend and longtime fan of Phoenix Suns point guard Chris Paul, Wayne made it clear he was rooting for the Suns, particularly when the rapper dubbed Mavs superstar Luka Doncic a “ho” in a tweet the previous Sunday (May 8).
While Wayne would quickly delete that tweet, he would follow up with another, writing “Ya lil b**ch it’s up.”The exchange is a far cry from a decade prior when Wayne gushed about his experience meeting and partying with Cuban after the Mavericks won the franchise’s first championship back in 2011.

     How the Ongoing Beef Between Mark Cuban and Lil Wayne Happened, According to Skip Bayless
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lil Wayne and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban recently found themselves involved in something of a beef, and now Skip Bayless has given the lowdown on what caused it.
“He liked them [Miami Heat] and he was into them, but they weren’t in his heart like the Lakers,” said Bayless.
That situation caused a rift between Wayne and Cuban, Bayless said, but they tried to remain on friendly terms.
More recently, Cuban allegedly offered Wayne tickets to some Western Conference Finals games to settle their issues.

However, Lil Wayne was cheering for the Suns and is a friend of Chris Paul.
