     Summary: Steve Aoki is known for throwing cake.
Now he might be known for throwing a baseball.
The 44-year-old EDM DJ/producer and entrepreneur threw out the first pitch last night at Fenway Park in Boston, ahead of the Red Sox‚Äô 6-3 win over the Houston Astros, and things didn‚Äôt exactly go as planned.
The pitch sailed high and wide and into the backstop, rivaling 50 Cent‚Äôs legendary first-pitch mishap as one of the worst of all time.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll stick to throwing [cake emoji]‚Äù, Aoki posted to Instagram after the gaffe.

     LOOK: Steve Aoki launches ceremonial first pitch into stands at Fenway Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DJ Steve Aoki was at Fenway Park to throw out the first pitch prior to Monday's game between the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox and let's just say it didn't go well.
Luckily, no fans were hurt when Aoki's throw sailed into the stands.
It's worth noting that Aoki is no stranger to throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Major League Baseball ball.
Back in 2015, Aoki threw out the first pitch at a Los Angeles Dodgers game and skipped the ball in front of the plate.
As far as where Aoki's bad pitch goes down in history, it probably doesn't top 50 Cent's.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki sits for a portrait, May 4, 2019.
The award-winning DJ and record producer threw what many are calling the worst first pitch of all time Monday before a Red Sox game in Boston.
But the Boston Red Sox may have just produced the worst ceremonial first pitch of all time.
That's what many are saying of world-renowned DJ Steve Aoki's attempt at spinning pitches instead of spinning records.
So what do you think: first pitch gone horribly wrong, or a perfectly executed forced failure?

     Steve Aoki Throws Horrible First Pitch At Red Sox Game, Worst Ever?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Aoki might be able to throw a cake with pinpoint accuracy -- but he sure as hell can't do the same with a baseball, 'cause he absolutely airmailed the ceremonial first pitch at the Red Sox game on Monday night ... and it was truly awful.
Aoki warmed up his left arm, toed the rubber -- and then heaved a ball that went roughly 20 feet over his catcher's head.
Video shot by people in the stadium shows fans were laughing at the pitch -- because it was seriously just that bad.
@steveaoki threw out tonight‚Äôs first pitch @fenwaypark , it was just a little bit outside the strike zone‚Ä¶.
Of course, Aoki is far from the first celeb to embarrass himself on an MLB diamond ... you'll recall, 50 Cent is known for the worst ever, throwing one sideways in 2014.
