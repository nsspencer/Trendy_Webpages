     Astros vs. Red Sox Prediction and Odds for Tuesday, May 17 (Back Houston at Plus Money)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a 6-3 Boston win in the first game of the series, the 14-21 Red Sox hope for a similar result tonight as they host the 23-13 Astros at 7:10 PM EST.
Houston has now lost two of three after a nine-game winning streak and will send Jose Urquidy to the bump in this one.
Urquidy has struggled this year but did throw six scoreless innings against the Tigers last week.
The Red Sox will counter with Nathan Eovaldi, who has a quality start in three of his last four outings while compiling a 2.87 ERA in that stretch.
Here are the odds from WynnBET to help us find some value in this Astros vs Red Sox matchup:Astros vs Red Sox Odds, Run Line and TotalRun Line:Astros +1.5 (-195)Red Sox -1.5 (+160)Moneyline:Astros: +107Red Sox: -117Total:8.5 (Over -110/Under -110)Astros vs Red Sox Prediction and PickJose Urquidy only threw three innings in his last start against the Twins due to a rain delay, but was pitching well.

The good news is that I am a Yankees fan, so I absolutely despise the Red Sox and Astros.
That being said, it brings me great joy that the Red Sox are on pace for over 100 losses.
Pitchers have gotten the Red Sox to chase pitches out of the zone more than any other team in the league.
Even if he does have a strong outing, the Red Sox bullpen ranks 24th in reliever ERA and 25th in xFIP.
