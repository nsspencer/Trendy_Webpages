     ‘It’s hard to accept him’: Deshaun Watson booed on NFL return after abuse claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deshaun Watson was booed on his return to the NFL after 700 days away from the league as he made his debut for the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.
Watson’s debut with Cleveland came against the Houston Texans, where he was a three-time Pro Bowl pick in four seasons.
He said earlier in the week about 10 women wanted to attend “to kind of make the statement, ‘Hey we’re still here.
After warming up before the game, Watson signed jerseys for fans behind the end zone.
The NFL wanted to suspend Watson for at least one season but settled for 11 games after an independent arbiter initially gave him a six-game ban.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Browns were expecting their new QB to be Superman right away, Sunday served as proof of how far away they still might be.
The Browns, as predicted, relied heavily on a running game and defense to beat the worst team in the NFL, the 1-10-1 Texans.
The Browns won their first game with Watson under center, but he was far from Superman in his return.
It’s unclear whether anyone expected Watson to light up his former team, but it’s also unclear whether they expected him to look this raw.

     Summary: CNN —Around 10 of the more than two dozen women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual misconduct were expected to attend his game in Houston on Sunday, according to their attorney.
Makes me proud they want to stand up and be counted rather than quietly go away.”The NFL and the Cleveland Browns did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the accusers’ attendance.
Women’s movement organizations and nonprofits dedicated to protecting victims of sexual assault and harassment have applauded the accusers for attending the game.
We’re a huge football town, folks here have been lifelong fans of the Cleveland Browns,” Greene said.
We believe that Deshaun Watson deserves a second chance.”The team’s “refusal to prioritize protecting women sends a disgusting message” to survivors of sexual assault, Nunes said.
