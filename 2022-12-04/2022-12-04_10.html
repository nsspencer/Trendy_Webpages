    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15's matchup between the Commanders and Giants at FedEx Field will be a primetime affair, the team announced Monday.
For the first time since Week 3 of the 2017 campaign, the franchise will host a Sunday night game when they welcome Brian Daboll's group to its residence.
It'll also represent a chance for the two rivals to sort out the mixed feelings they experienced following their Week 13 tie at MetLife Stadium.
"This game that we're going to play here in two weeks means double," Allen told reporters after the 20-20 draw with the Giants.
I'm going to provide as many free tickets as I can.

Washington took leads of 10-0 and 13-10 only to see the Giants tie it just before halftime on Gano’s second field goal.
The thing about it is that it doesn’t really help us but it doesn’t really hurt us, either.”Barkley tallied on a 13-yard run through a gapping hole for New York’s TD.
