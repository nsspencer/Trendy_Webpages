     Lions will use Jameson Williams as a gunner on the punt team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesRemember when receiver Jameson Williams looked miserable after being drafted by the Lions?
Today, he may have a reason to feel that way.
Jay Glazer of Fox Sports reports that Williams, in the first game of his NFL career due to a torn ACL suffered during the 2021 college season, will be a gunner on the punt team.
Said Fox’s Howie Long in response, “That’s why Detroit struggles.”Williams reportedly will be on a snap count on offense.
If they’re willing to expose him to injury as a punt gunner, why not just let him play offense without limitations?

     Summary: Detroit Lions injured rookie receiver Jameson Williams waves at fans after the Lions' 38-35 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Ford Field, Sept. 11, 2022.
The Detroit Lions tried to temper expectations all week, which pointed to Jameson Williams not making his NFL debut until next week.
A snap count is certainly in order for Williams on Sunday.
#Lions first-round pick WR Jameson Williams will make his debut against the #Jaguars, but he’s expected to be on a very limited snap count, per me and @RapSheet.
But overall, expectations should be kept reasonable for Williams’ numbers in his NFL debut.

     'Just a Primer': Dan Campbell Explained Goal for Jameson Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lions' goal was to get Jameson Williams 'somewhat acclimated' to playing in the NFL.
The Detroit Lions were able to get rookie wideout Jameson Williams acclimated to playing a National Football League game.
"We felt like that was the biggest impact he could have today," Lions head coach Dan Campbell said postgame.
He's tough, he's physical, and he was all for it.
While many had elevated goals for Williams against the Jaguars, his debut did not produce his first career reception.

He’s going to get a little bit more next week.

"As a teammate, I'm here to let him know that's part of the game," Chark said.

     Rookie report: Jameson Williams on pitch count in first game as a Lion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a blowout 40-14 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, all eyes were on Detroit Lions first-round pick, Jameson Williams.
For Williams, who has just two weeks of practice time logged with the Lions, a pitch count was necessary.
Williams took a mere six snaps on offense throughout the game, most of which came on run plays.
His reputation from his days at Alabama followed him to the league and benefitted the run game by taking defenders away from the play.
At the end of the first half, Houston used a bend technique to get around the left tackle and take down Trevor Lawrence.
