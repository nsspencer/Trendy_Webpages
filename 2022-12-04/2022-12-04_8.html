     Summary: Derek, though, had a key early successful carry on a third-and-1, added a reception and even had a special-teams tackle during the Steelers’ 19-16 win.
The one last game was the first drive of the game, and we put a really long drive together.
Over his first 2½ seasons with the Steelers since signing in 2020 until Week 8 of this season, though, Watt had just six touches.
“The O-line has done a great job on those short-yardage plays and kind of made my job easy,” Watt said.
We have to continue to make the most of those opportunities.”Hey, Steelers Nation, get the latest news about the Pittsburgh Steelers here.
