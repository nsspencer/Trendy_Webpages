     Detroit Lions' Week 13 Inactive List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here is a list of players who are inactive for the Lions in Week 13 against the Jaguars.
The Detroit Lions will have an opportunity to play several of their young players during the final stretch of the season.
With the team getting healthier, the opportunities will be there for younger players to showcase their skillset for the coaching staff.
Again, I think you guys think that we should be in the Super Bowl with all these new players," Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn said this week.
"So, we’ve got to do a good job of teaching and making sure our guys understand schematically," said Glenn.

    </h2>

     Summary: For the second time in three weeks, the Detroit Lions administered the type of butt-kicking they’ve been on the wrong end of too many times in recent years.
Jared Goff threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns and D’Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams ran for scores as the Lions beat the Jacksonville Jaguars, 40-14, at Ford Field.
They can get even betterCARLOS MONARREZ:Jameson Williams' debut doesn't quite live up to hype for LionsAt 5-7, the Lions are firmly in the wild card hunt with five games to play.
The Vikings have clinched at least a share of the division title by beating the Jets on Sunday.
Williams opened the scoring for the Lions with his 14th touchdown run of the season, surpassing his rushing touchdown total (13) from the first five seasons of his career.

     RECAP: Lions vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When asked this week about facing the Jacksonville Jaguars at Ford Field on Sunday, Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell said he thought the two teams were mirror images of one another.
Both teams are young, building a culture under new coaching staffs, had 11 one-score losses on the year between them, and came in with identical 4-7 records.
But on this day, Detroit was clearly the more dominant football team.
The Lions raced out to a double-digit lead early and were on cruise control from there for a 40-14 win at home for their fourth victory in the last five contests.
They improve to 5-7 on the season.

     Summary: THIRD DOWN: SETTING THE TONELions safety DeShon Elliott set the tone for the Lions and the defense on the second play of the game.
The offense turned the takeaway into a touchdown, and the Lions never looked back from there.
The Jaguars were held to nearly 100 yards under their average per game and were just 3-of-12 converting third downs.
"Set the whole tone for the game," Campbell said of the Elliott play.
They really couldn't get in a rhythm because our guys played well."

     Summary: DETROIT — After starting the day with plenty to play for, the Jacksonville Jaguars (4-8) weren't able to show up when needed against the Lions (5-7) on Sunday, ultimately losing 40-14.
Upon his return, Lawrence completed 6 of 10 passes for 52 yards, including a three-yard TD toss to tight end Evan Engram.
Jaguars offense starts slow, can't move ball against Lions defenseThe Jaguars began the day against the Lions with two stalled drives due to dropped footballs.
Jacksonville didn't have much of an answer for the Lions' rushing attack, either, though Detroit didn't go to it much.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just a freight train coming your way.”The Metallica lyric famously used by Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell as a training camp motivational tool proved prophetic in Week 13.
Except the Lions were the freight train crashing through the Jacksonville Jaguars, with a polished Campbell engineering one of the most impressive wins of the last decade in Detroit.
For a Lions team too used to being the freight train roadkill, this was something special.
The first half was about as well as we’ve seen a Lions team perform in all facets of a regular-season game in a long time.
Lawrence did lead the Jaguars on a nice opening drive, culminating in a touchdown that cut the Detroit lead to 30-14.
