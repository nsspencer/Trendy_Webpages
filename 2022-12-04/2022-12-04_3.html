It was the Steelers' first touchdown of the afternoon after two earlier possessions ended in field goals.
The score, which pushed the Steelers' lead to 13-3, was set up after tight end Pat Freiermuth picked up 57 yards on a catch-and-run third down pass from Pickett.

     Summary: Getty ImagesEvery week we bring you all the inactives from the 1 p.m.
Linebacker T.J. Watt‘s availability was the biggest question mark for the Steelers heading into Sunday’s game against the Falcons.
Watt was a limited participant in practice all week because of injured ribs and he carried a questionable tag with him to Atlanta.
The Steelers won’t have to worry about life without Watt, however.
He is active for the game and will be part of the effort to stop Marcus Mariota and the Falcons offense from scoring points on Sunday.
