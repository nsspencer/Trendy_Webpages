     Michigan’s J.J. McCarthy on Possible Ohio State Rematch: ‘Bring It On’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the team awaits to see who its will face in the Playoff, it is not out of the question that a rematch with Ohio State could be in store.
As both Ohio State and TCU ended the year with just one loss, the selection committee could prefer the Buckeyes’ résumé to that of the Horned Frogs.
If that does happen, Michigan apparently wouldn’t be afraid to play Ohio State again.
“Deep down, a little bit, but hopefully we see them in the big game,” McCarthy said, via Rittenberg.
“It’s the best of both worlds [Ohio State or Georgia], honestly, so no matter who it is, we’re going to be ready for it.”
