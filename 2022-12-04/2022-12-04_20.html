     Teams focused on World Cup, not politics, had easier passage to last 16, Arsène Wenger says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The outcome of the World Cup group stages showed the teams that advanced without complication were those best prepared mentally and not distracted by political issues, according to former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger.
Referring to shock exits by Germany, Belgium and Denmark, Wenger, speaking during a technical analysis of the group stages by world governing body FIFA, said it was notable the teams that focused on football and started well, like Brazil, France and England, had easier passage to the last 16.
"The teams who were not disappointing in their first game performance - because when you got to the World Cup you know you have not to lose the first game - are the teams with experience, they have results ....they played well in first game," Wenger said on Sunday.
"The teams as well who were mentally ready and had the mindset to focus on the competition and not on political demonstrations."
The Qatar World Cup has seen an unusual amount of political discussion from teams, with some voicing concerns about the host's treatment of migrant labour, its approach to LGBT rights and FIFA's threats to penalise players for political statements.

At the Qatar World Cup there has been an unusual amount of political discussion from teams, with some voicing concerns about the host country’s treatment of migrant labour, its approach to LGBTQ+ rights and Fifa’s threats to penalise players for political statements.
Denmark also made a stand over the armbands and last month wanted to use a training kit with slogans in support for human rights.

     FIFA Official Wenger Knocks Teams Protesting at World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DOHA, Qatar (AP) — FIFA official Arsène Wenger took a shot at World Cup teams who tried to make political statements in Qatar, saying Sunday they lacked focus for their first games.
However, Wenger overlooked the part FIFA played in the dispute by avoiding the issue before teams arrived at the World Cup.
Teams usually have at least two weeks to prepare after the European season for a typical World Cup starting in June.
Evolution of the “sweeper keeper” role pioneered by Germany captain Manuel Neuer saw a 70% increase since the 2018 World Cup of goalkeepers offering to receive the ball with their feet.

     Arsène Wenger claims teams who focused on ‘competition’ rather than ‘political demonstrations’ performed better at the World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said teams who focused on “competition” rather than “political demonstrations” performed better in the group stages of the World Cup.
“Going to the World Cup, you know you have to not lose the first game,” said Wenger, who has taken up a role as FIFA’s chief of global football development since stepping away from management, said on Sunday.
Seven European nations, including Germany, were set to wear the armbands at the World Cup, but chose not to so as not to put players at risk of receiving yellow cards.
Social media users were critical of Wenger drawing a correlation between teams protesting and underperforming on the pitch.
“Disgraceful comments by Wenger,” Craig Foster, a former Australian midfielder turned human rights activist, wrote on Twitter.

     Wenger takes swipe at World Cup teams 'focused on demonstrations'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Germany's players covered their mouths in protest before their match against JapanDoha (AFP) – Arsene Wenger said on Sunday that teams who focused on football rather than "political demonstrations" fared better in the opening round at the World Cup.
"When you go to a World Cup you know you must not lose the first game," said the 73-year-old, saying teams with World Cup experience such as holders France won their opening matches.
Wenger then added: "And the teams as well who were mentally ready, who had the mindset to focus on the competition and not on political demonstrations."
This World Cup has been overshadowed by several controversies both on and off the pitch, especially when it comes to gay rights.
Germany captain Manuel Neuer was among the skippers who had planned to wear rainbow-themed armbands to promote diversity, but abandoned the initiative after FIFA threatened their teams with sporting sanctions.

Klinsmann said: "If you struggled to adapt, to come here and for whatever reason — especially mentally — were not able to adapt yourself to everything you find here and how dynamic this World Cup is, you will struggle.
“And you will get a negative surprise like we saw with Germany, we saw with Denmark and other teams."
