     Browns vs. Texans score, takeaways: Deshaun Watson wins first start in 700 days, beats ex-team despite no TDs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson played exactly like someone starting their first game in 700 days in Cleveland's 27-14 road win in his old stadium against the Houston Texans in Week 13.
Cleveland scored on special teams with Donovan Peoples-Jones' 76-yard punt return and their two defensive scores.
Getting a special teams touchdown like they did on Peoples-Jones' punt return touchdown is like finding a $20 in your jeans pocket after taking them out of the washing machine.
Play of the gameThe play of the game was the most exciting moment from Sunday afternoon's offensive slog: Donovan Peoples-Jones' 76-yard punt return touchdown.
It's only the second punt return score of the season after the Patriots Marcus Jones' game-winning punt return touchdown in Week 11 against the Jets.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4 jersey from both the Texans (1-10-1) and the Browns, but there were also detractors with loud boos raining down on him every time he touched the ball.
The Browns added a second defensive score when Tony Fields intercepted Kyle Allen and returned it 16 yards on the next play.
He remained on Houston’s roster last year, but sat out all season before being traded to the Browns in March.
The Texans got down to the 1, but Allen threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-1 to give the Browns the ball back.
The Texans looked to have returned a fumble by Watson for a touchdown with less than a minute left in the first half.
