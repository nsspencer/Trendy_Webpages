     Summary: In Week 14, the Detroit Lions will host the division-leading Minnesota Vikings who are 10-2 on the season and will have a chance to secure themselves a spot in the Playoffs if they leave Detroit with a win.
The Lions are just 5-7 on the season but they are one of the hottest teams in the NFL right now.
Meanwhile, the Vikings have continued to stack wins, but the manner in which they have been securing victories can look a bit shaky at times.
“It feels like any other play,” Vikings Camryn Bynum—who made an interception in the red zone to seal the win—told ESPN.

     O'HARA'S MONDAY COUNTDOWN: Lions execute their game plan to near perfection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions got what they wanted, what they needed and what they worked hard to get, and it all came in one neat package.
They had eight possessions – not counting the end-of-game victory kneel down – and scored a touchdown or field goal on all eight.
The Lions were penalized only once – 10 yards for holding – and they didn't have a turnover.
This week's Monday Countdown looks at how the Lions put together a game plan and followed it to near perfection.
There's also a projection from Campbell on where his team stands with others and how rebounding from the loss to the Buffalo Bills wasn't as difficult as it might seem.

     Detroit Lions Week 13 snap count observations: Jameson Williams gets feet wet vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In most weeks, this would be the dominating headline, but with the Lions activating first-round pick Jameson Williams, his involvement has stolen the show.
He’s going to get a little bit more next week.
“I think as a rookie, he’s going to want to come out and light the world on fire as we all do want him to,” Goff continued.
“But he’s going to have his plays that he’s going to know and he’s going to be good at, and we’re going to roll with him on those, and whatever that may be.
With the Lions shifting away from the SAM linebacker role, Harris saw his snaps at nickel increase.
