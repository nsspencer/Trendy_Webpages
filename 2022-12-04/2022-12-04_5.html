     Bengals cut punter Kevin Huber
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBengals punter Kevin Huber‘s long tenure in Cincinnati has come to an end.
The 37-year-old Huber, who was born and raised in Cincinnati and played his college football at Cincinnati, has also spent his entire NFL career with the Bengals, who drafted him in 2009.
Bengals head coach Zac Taylor praised Huber today in announcing his release, but said the team has ultimately decided that Drue Chrisman, who has been elevated from the practice squad to punt the last three weeks, is the Bengals’ best option going forward.
Huber will now go on waivers, and any team that wants him can claim him.
If he goes unclaimed he’ll be a free agent, and that could mean the end of a long run that has been all in Cincinnati.

     Around the AFC North: Bengals Back Joe Burrow for MVP After He Tops Patrick Mahomes Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals: Joe Burrow Goes to 3-0 Against Patrick MahomesThe Bengals (8-4) kept pace with the Ravens (8-4) in the AFC North, as quarterback Joe Burrow strengthened his case for MVP consideration.
Completing 25 of 31 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns, Burrow led Cincinnati to a 27-24 victory in Kansas City and raised Burrow's career record to 3-0 against the Chiefs and the former league MVP Patrick Mahomes.
Two of Burrow's victories against the Chiefs have come at Arrowhead Stadium, including last year's AFC Championship game.
But the Bengals are backing their quarterback, and Head Coach Zac Taylor gave a one-word answer when asked if Burrow deserved MVP consideration.
Burrow said he's not worried about winning the MVP, but he wants his team to keep rolling.

Note: Applying the labels “winners” and “losers” is not intended to be a judgment on the talent or character of any of these players.
Cornerbacks Trent McDuffie and Joshua Williams: There will be plenty of blame to pass around on Chiefs’ defense, but it shouldn’t be directed at these two rookie corners.
The Bengals didn’t have a 100-yard receiver — and only Higgins was able to get into the end zone, catching a contested pass and breaking multiple tackles.
Reid didn’t.
