     Vikings' Akayleb Evans Says He's OK After Leaving Game With Concussion Symptoms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vikings rookie cornerback Akayleb Evans made his second career start on Sunday, returning from missing the last two games with a concussion.
Unfortunately, he was forced out of the win over the Jets with more concussion symptoms that popped up following a collision over the middle of the field in the third quarter.
Evans tweeted "I'm feeling good I promise!"
Evans had six tackles and a PBU of his own before leaving the game.
Heading into next week's game against the Lions, the statuses of Darrisaw, Evans, and Bullard will all be worth monitoring.

     Vikings' Akayleb Evans: Evaluated for concussion Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Evans was evaluated for a concussion during Sunday's 27-22 win over the Jets, Alec Lewis of The Athletic reports.
Evans was making his return from a two-game absence due to a previous concussion.
The 23-year-old recorded six tackles and a pass defended before exiting in the second half, and it's unclear if he was ever officially diagnosed with a concussion before the end of this Week 13 contest.
It will be worth monitoring Evans' status heading into next Sunday's divisional matchup against Detroit.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his first game back from suffering a concussion against the Buffalo Bills back on November 13th, things didn’t quite go as planned for Akayleb Evans.
After getting hit hard by his own teammate while covering Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson, Evans was sent off the field to be evaluated for a concussion per ESPN’s Kevin Seifert.
Officials just sent off CB Akayleb Evans after that collision.
— Kevin Seifert (@SeifertESPN) December 4, 2022Once Shelley replaced him, he made a key stop, knocking the ball away from Jets tight end Tyler Conklin.
The Vikings are in trouble at cornerback without Evans in the game and they could really use him throughout the rest of the game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, where they could have had 28 points (assuming extra points after each touchdown), they only took away 16.
The defense, once again, also deserves a ton of credit for keeping the Jets in the game.
Other than that, the Jets really held the Vikings’ offense in check.
But two interceptions, including the late one to ice the game for the Vikings, really killed the Jets’ momentum.
But against an offense like the Vikings, you had to start wondering if all those points left on the table would come back to bite the Jets.

     Summary: They didn’t get any help from the Detroit Lions, and have to wait at least another week to win the NFC North title.
The Jets got two more chances in the red zone, and the Vikings’ defense had the answer.
On their last chance White’s pass to the end zone on 4th-and-10 was intercepted by Cam Bynum to seal a Vikings’ win.
One play to lose a game or win the game, that’s normal football to us."
Minnesota clinches at least a share of the NFC North title with Sunday’s win.

The Jets responded similarly, with a 45-yard drive into Greg Zuerlein range, with "Legatron" coming on for a 48-yard field goal to tie the score back up at 3-3.
They moved 17 yards before Joseph came on for a 41-yard field goal and a 20-3 lead with 40 seconds left.
With two timeouts of their own remaining, the Jets tried to get within a long-range three-point try from Zuerlein.

     Summary: (0:17)MINNEAPOLIS -- — In the tension of these habitually tight finishes, the Minnesota Vikings have become quite the confident and comfortable team.
Justin Jefferson's touchdown catch with 8:33 left gave the Vikings a large enough lead to hang on for a 27-22 victory despite a relentless rally by the New York Jets on Sunday.
“They’ve been winning like this all year, and we didn’t make the play that we needed to make,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said.
The Jets had to settle for five field goals from Greg Zuerlein, including a franchise-record 60-yarder at the end of the first half.
GREG THE LEGThe previous field goal record for the Jets was 57 yards, shared by Zuerlein (twice earlier this year) and Chandler Catanzaro (2017).
