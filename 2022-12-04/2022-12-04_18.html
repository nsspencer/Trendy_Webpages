     Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence back and playing vs. Lions following injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Lawrence has shown meaningful progress in Year 2 and the Jacksonville Jaguars will need him to keep playing at a high level for the remainder of the season if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive.
That’s why the Jags were rightfully concerned when he got hurt near the end of the second quarter of their Week 13 matchup against the Detroit Lions.
On the last play of the first half, Lawrence was brought down on a sack and suffered a lower-leg injury.
Beathard started warming up ahead of the third quarter put Lawrence’s availability for the remainder of the game for a moment.
Trailing 30-6, it’s hard to see the Jags coming back the way they did against the Baltimore Ravens last week.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The relief mattered a lot for Trevor Lawrence late Sunday afternoon, with Jaguars Head Coach Doug Pederson calling the second-year quarterback "very fortunate" to avoid serious injury late in the first half of 40-14 loss to the Detroit Lions at Ford Field.
Lawrence lay on the field for an extended time, then returned to the Jaguars' sideline during a Lions touchdown drive to start the second half.
"He was obviously fine to play in the game and we'll make sure he's good moving forward," Pederson said.
Lawrence, who led the Jaguars' lone touchdown drive on their first possession after the injury, said he first believed he had injured his knee before feeling pain in his foot.
"Luckily, nothing serious," Lawrence said.
