     Summary: COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio State football team may face underdog status as long as it remains in the playoff, and that certainly applies to its opening betting line for the semifinal against Georgia.
Caesars Sportsbook lists the defending national champion Bulldogs as a 6.5-point favorite over OSU for the Dec. 31 Peach Bowl.
Assuming it holds, that will be the first time this season the Buckeyes are a betting underdog at kickoff.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Online betting markets are heavily favoring incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) over Republican Herschel Walker in Georgia’s Senate runoff with two days until the election.
The Democrat’s chances of winning the runoff were at 89.5 percent to Walker’s 10.5 percent as of Sunday afternoon, according to the tracker Election Betting Odds, which culls odds from other popular betting markets.
Smarkets, another betting market used by Election Betting Odds, puts Warnock’s odds even higher — at 92.6 percent to Walker’s 8.3 percent.
CNN’s survey noted that 47 percent of likely voters who support Walker said they were casting their ballots for the Republican out of opposition to Warnock rather than support for their chosen candidate.
Neither former President Trump nor President Biden has campaigned in Georgia ahead of the high-stakes Senate election, though former President Obama did stump with Warnock earlier this week.

     HBCU students in Georgia face an extra obstacle in voting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a provision that voting rights experts say continues to confuse voters — especially college students or others who already face barriers — and results in many of them voting elsewhere or not at all.
Nicks could have brought in another form of identification to vote; under Georgia law, her passport or her New York state identification card would have sufficed, for example.
“Students in general often have a more difficult time accessing the ballot box because of all sorts of things.
There are at least 10,000 students enrolled at private HBCUs in Georgia.
Voting rights experts acknowledge that number of voters in Georgia affected by the provision ultimately represents a narrow slice of the state’s electorate.
