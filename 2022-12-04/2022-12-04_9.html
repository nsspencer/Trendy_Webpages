     Lakers: Does Russell Westbrook Think Anthony Davis Can Win MVP This Season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another big part of the Lakers' revitalized season has been Russell Westbrook's improved play since being shifted to the bench.
Westbrook is most likely right in saying that, to win MVP, the Lakers will probably need to keep winning.
Only twice in league history has a player won the MVP on a team with a losing record (i.e.
St. Louis Hawks center Bob Pettit, an 11-time All-Star and a two-time MVP, won it on a 33-39 club in 1956.
Davis has announced himself as a fringe contender for the honor thanks to his recent output.

     LA Lakers' resurrection: From a pitiful start to MVP chants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And when the Los Angeles Lakers, a juggernaut of a franchise for better or worse, are in the middle of it, it's a big deal.
They're back, with Anthony Davis putting up 55 points, 17 rebounds and 22/30 shooting against the Washington Wizards.
Having passing point guards by his side, nurturing the interior, boosting the 'block and follow' style has seen wonderful results.
The 55 points and 17 rebounds against the Wizards was just another product of a player at the top of his game.
For me it's about focus, having the mentality to be aggressive, not switching off in games and having a dominant mentality," Davis said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Davis stays hot with 55 points and 17 rebounds as the Lakers defeat the Wizards on the road.
Davis, who finished with 55 points, 17 rebounds and three blocked shots in L.A.'s 130-119 win over the Washington Wizards, isn't just hearing the praise from fans, either.
LeBron James, who finished with 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists, echoed the sentiment.
So if we continue to do what we do and win basketball games, the rest will take care of itself."
The Lakers' win capped a sublime stretch for Davis, whose highest career finish in MVP voting was third in 2017-18 when he played for the New Orleans Pelicans.

     Summary: AdvertisementAfter he had thrown down a dunk over a crowd of players in pink, Anthony Davis roared and shook the entire basket stanchion.
The Wizards, in their cherry blossom uniforms, scattered as Davis moved back up the floor, mean-mugging and flexing his arms.
That’s not to blame observers who witnessed the beginning of the season, when the Lakers brought their own shovels to every game and started 2-10.
After toppling the Wizards, who didn’t have three-time all-star Bradley Beal for most of the game, the Lakers have won eight of 10.
Westbrook, the Lakers’ bench leader and part-time hip twirler, might actually be having fun again.
