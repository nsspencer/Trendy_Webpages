     World Cup Ratings: England’s 3-0 Win Over Senegal Viewed By Almost 20M Peak On ITV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: England’s comfortable second round victory over Senegal last night was watched by a peak of nearly 20M viewers on ITV, becoming the most-viewed of the Qatar World Cup 2022 tournament so far in the UK.
Across a three-and-a-half-hour run time from 6pm GMT (10 a.m. PST), the game, which ended 3-0 to England, was viewed by a 13.4M average.
England will now face France on Saturday at 7 p.m. GMT (11 a.m. PST) in a hotly-anticipated clash that will likely beat the ratings for yesterday’s game.
The World Cup has so far been producing huge TV audiences both across Europe and in the U.S., breaking records for Fox live sport viewing in the latter.
The tournament has now reached its second stage and is midway through the Second Round, with Brazil facing South Korea later and Japan playing Croatia.

     World Cup Recaps: England vs Senegal | Three Lions mightier than Lions of Teranga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After blowing both hot and cold in the group stages, England revved into gear last night and beat Senegal 3-0 at a canter.
This Senegal side, however, proved no match for an England side that was not hamstrung by key injuries in the same way as their competition.
Their fluidity built and built all game and they would slam the door officially on Senegal’s world cup project.
France is the next match, less than a week away, and the French are - deservedly - favorites to win a second, back-to-back World Cup.
The Three Lions will be thrilled with moving on to the Quarterfinals but will still be very hungry for more; oh, what a World Cup it has been - for good and bad.

     England vs Senegal: Full backs excel in dress rehearsal for France
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bellingham and Henderson run amok against Senegal’s Gueye-less midfieldIn the group stage Idrissa Gana Gueye was a one-man midfield defensive machine, making the most sprints and blocks and covering the most distance for Senegal.
His suspension for this game was an opportunity seized by Gareth Southgate, through a brilliant use of Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham.
Both were freed, whenever there was the opportunity, to sprint forward and try to break Senegal’s lines with aggressive running.
Perhaps Gueye’s greatest strength is stopping counterattacks and without him Senegal were powerless to stem Bellingham and Henderson when the ball was turned over.
Guarding in midfield were two moderate players: Nampalys Mendy — who has started only once for Leicester City this season, in the EFL Cup

     Summary: Celebrities from across the world of culture have reacted to England’s win over Senegal in the 2022 football World Cup.
“Superb win, England coming alive after sluggish start,” wrote former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan.
But who the hell wants to play England in this World Cup right now?
Match of the Day presenter and former England footballer Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: “This young @england team is not only excellent, it’s so bloody likeable.
Love ‘em.”Daytime TV personality Judge Robert Rinder, meanwhile, urged England to win the world cup as an “articulate middle finger” aimed at Qatar’s human rights record.
