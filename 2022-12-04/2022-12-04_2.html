     Summary: The Chicago Bears (3-10) suffered a 28-19 loss to the Green Bay Packers (5-8), which marked their sixth straight defeat and eighth consecutive against Green Bay.
The Packers scored 18 unanswered points to get the win.
Some poor play calling decisions by Luke Getsy, Cairo Santos missing two key kicks and allowing 18 unanswered points were big factors.
While the defeat gets them one step closer to a top draft pick, Chicago could’ve (and should’ve) beaten Green Bay.
Here’s a look at our studs and duds from the Bears’ loss to the Packers.

     Packers earn NFL-record 787th victory in franchise history, moving past rival Bears for first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the strength of Sunday's 28-19 win over the archrival Chicago Bears, the Green Bay Packers have become the NFL's all-time winningest franchise.
Aaron Rodgers and the 2022 Packers earned the club's 787th win with their victory over the Bears, breaking a tie with Chicago for the most in league history.
The Packers, in their 102nd season, improved to 787-589-38 with Sunday's win.
"The significance of this game, that's a pretty cool deal to be the NFL's all-time winningest franchise," Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said after the game, per USA Today.
Thus, the last time anyone was ahead of the Bears franchise, they were yet to be the Bears and the National Football League was not yet called the NFL, as it was in its last year as the American Pro Football Association.

     Instant Takeaways: Packers escape Chicago with comeback win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 04: Christian Watson #9 of the Green Bay Packers celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the Chicago Bears during the second quarter of the game at Soldier Field on December 04, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.
– In the midst of Rodgers chucking the ball, Green Bay still did utilize the run game, specifically leaning on AJ Dillon, and had a solid run-pass mix.
The Packers needed to find their WR1, and they have in Watson, who has become a game-changer in Green Bay.
– We knew Chicago was going to run the ball, and Green Bay utilized some heavier boxes as a result.
– As has been the case, Green Bay struggled to create pressure without Rashan Gary.
