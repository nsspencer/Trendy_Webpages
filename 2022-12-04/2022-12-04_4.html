     Aaron Rodgers Flips Out After Packers Don’t Challenge a Play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By now, most NFL fans know Aaron Rodgers isn’t shy when it comes to voicing his opinion.
And, on Sunday against the Bears, the Packers quarterback again took the opportunity to do so following a frustrating call in the third quarter.
Rodgers led the Packers back into Soldier Field after halftime looking to erase a 16–10 deficit starting at their own 25-yard line.
The Packers went on to win the contest, 28–19, to improve to 5–8 and keep their hopes of squeaking into the playoffs alive.

The Packers and Bears entered Week 13 tied for the most wins in NFL history.
However, the Packers’ 787th win in franchise history didn’t come easy.
Green Bay trailed 16-3 in the first half before mounting a fourth-quarter comeback to secure their fifth win of the season.

     Packers earn NFL-record 787th victory in franchise history, moving past rival Bears for first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the strength of Sunday's 28-19 win over the archrival Chicago Bears, the Green Bay Packers have become the NFL's all-time winningest franchise.
Aaron Rodgers and the 2022 Packers earned the club's 787th win with their victory over the Bears, breaking a tie with Chicago for the most in league history.
The Packers, in their 102nd season, improved to 787-589-38 with Sunday's win.
"The significance of this game, that's a pretty cool deal to be the NFL's all-time winningest franchise," Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said after the game, per USA Today.
Thus, the last time anyone was ahead of the Bears franchise, they were yet to be the Bears and the National Football League was not yet called the NFL, as it was in its last year as the American Pro Football Association.

     Packers Final Thoughts: Run Defense will be Tested once again v. Bears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN - SEPTEMBER 18: Aaron Jones #33 of the Green Bay Packers runs for yards during a game against the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field on September 18, 2022 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
As I always do before kickoff, here are my final thoughts on this matchup between the Packers and Bears.
Complimentary football has been tough for Green Bay to find, but this mix between the run and passing game has really stressed opposing defenses.
– The Bears’ offense certainly isn’t as robust as Philadelphia’s, but they present a similar challenge with a mobile quarterback and an effective run game.
Basically, force Fields, and his shorthanded wide receiver room, to beat Green Bay through the air, and hopefully, the secondary is better prepared this time around.

     Summary: Bears lead Packers 16-10 at halftimeThe Packers opened the second quarter with two Dillon runs for 10 yards before picking up another 13 on pitch to Aaron Jones and a push pass to the Chicago 11.
Rodgers scrambled six yards to the Bears' 6 on second-and-11 but had to throw the ball away on third down.
The Bears flipped the field back in their favor when Equanimeous St. Brown caught a 56-yard pass from Fields to the Green Bay 7.
Chicago scored one play later with a 7-yard Montgomery touchdown to extend the Bears' lead to 16-3 after a mixed extra point.
On first-and-10 from the Chicago, Jones eclipsed 5,000 career rushing yards with a 7-yard carry, the fourth Packers running back to do so.

     Summary: "I thought the offensive coaches did a really good job of getting Wesco ready to go because he's our guy that really steps into that role.
Then Wesco gets hurt … so then our offense had to move and do a good job with adjusting during those two things that happened.
I think they did a good job."
No excuses: The normally reliable Cairo Santos missed both a field goal and an extra point for the first time in 47 career games with the Bears.
I feel confident in saying that, [but] on Sunday the extra point consistency is not there.

With just under five minutes to go, Joe Barry and the Packers’ defense needed to get a stop to preserve a win.
Finally, Alexander made his presence felt, jumping St. Brown’s route and intercepting Fields to give the Packers’ defense their second turnover of the day.
Here’s Watson’s score:Facing a nine-point deficit, the Bears moved the ball quickly through the air, but the Packers defense delivered a final dagger with a minute left.

Lend a hand: Dean Lowry has 16 career pass deflections on his NFL resume…and now a blocked field goal to go with them.
On the ensuing possession, the Packers took a 20-19 advantage when Mason Crosby drilled a 32-yard field goal.
It was Lowry's first blocked field goal since his time at Northwestern, a special achievement for the Chicagoland native.

     Summary: Rodgers also will hit the eight-week mark with his thumb fracture over the upcoming bye, so if the Packers are going to put together any kind of late-season run, the QB's health is at least trending the right way.
So that's like a dream game for somebody in my position with a pretty sore rib cage.
"I feel good going to the bye week that maybe both of these things will be behind me."
Putting another win at Soldier Field behind him feels good, too, as Rodgers is now 11-1 in Chicago since the 2010 NFC title game.
He's found ways late in games on the Bears' turf plenty of times over the years.
