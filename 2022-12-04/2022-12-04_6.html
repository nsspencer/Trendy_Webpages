     Lamar Jackson injury update: John Harbaugh says quarterback is 'week to week' with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson suffered a knee injury during Sunday's victory over the Denver Broncos, but it will not be a season-ending issue.
Monday, head coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson is "week to week," but that it is less likely he will suit up this week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, per ESPN.
Still, Harbaugh is not ruling him out for Week 14 just yet.
Following the Ravens' 10-9 win on Sunday, Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson's injury would hold him out "days to weeks" as opposed to a more substantial amount of time.
"It's a knee, but not a season-ending type of knee," Harbaugh said.

     Ravens’ Lamar Jackson Unlikely to Play vs. Steelers in Week 14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is unlikely to play in the team’s Week 14 rivalry matchup against the Steelers, coach John Harbaugh said Monday.
Harbaugh called the former MVP “week-to-week” during an afternoon press conference on the day after Baltimore’s 10–9 win over the Broncos.
He previously said on Sunday said that Jackson’s injury was not season-ending but that the former MVP is “days to weeks” from returning.
As the week goes on, we’ll see for this week.
Brett Hundley, who signed to the Ravens practice squad Monday, could serve as Huntley’s backup, beginning as soon as this upcoming weekend against the Steelers.

     Ravens say QB Lamar Jackson 'week-to-week' with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is "week-to-week" with a knee injury after undergoing MRIs on Monday, coach John Harbaugh said.
If Jackson is sidelined this week, backup Tyler Huntley would start for the Ravens (8-4), who play at the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-7) on Sunday.
This would mark the second straight season that Jackson has missed a game due to injury.
Last season, the Ravens lost all four games in which Jackson was sidelined with an ankle injury.
This season, Jackson had shown signs of some wear and tear.

     Ravens HC John Harbaugh: Lamar Jackson considered week to week with knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens received some good news regarding Lamar Jackson's knee injury, but the star quarterback could still miss some time.
Ravens head coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Monday that Jackson is "week to week," but it's "less likely" that he'll be available this coming Sunday against the Steelers.
"He's been through the MRIs, and I would say it's kind of week to week," Harbaugh said.
Monday's update jives with Harbaugh's postgame comments from Sunday that Jackson's injury isn't a season-ender.
He popped up on the Week 12 injury report with a hip injury and then dealt with a quad issue during practice last week.

     Summary: Baltimore Beatdown's Dustin Cox: "The biggest concern exiting this game is the health of quarterback Lamar Jackson.
The execution by the Ravens' defense has NFL.com's Bobby Kownack's giving them credit for keeping them in the game and closing it out.
But the results were middling as the Ravens running backs combined for 43 yards on 14 carries.
Press Box Online's Bo Smolka aired concern following the contest, stating "this game was perfectly suited for the running game, and it couldn't deliver."
"The Ravens' running attack, though, got little traction throughout.

     Ravens hopeful on Lamar Jackson injury, confident in Huntley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE — (AP) — Just like last year, the Baltimore Ravens are prepared to enter the pivotal part of their season without star quarterback Lamar Jackson.
The concern grew when Jackson was ushered into the tunnel to the Ravens' locker room so trainers could get a closer look at his injured knee.
Jackson never returned to the game, but things ultimately turned out fine for the AFC North leaders.
The Ravens (8-4) have had their struggles this season on offense, and Jackson has not always been exceptionally sharp.
Jackson missed the final four games of the 2021 season with an ankle injury, and Baltimore lost every one of them.
