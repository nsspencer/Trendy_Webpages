     Lamar Jackson injury update: Ravens QB avoids season-ending knee issue; to have MRI Monday, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was ruled out of Sunday's matchup against the Denver Broncos after suffering a knee injury in the second quarter.
NFL Media reported that initial tests show that Jackson is dealing with a knee sprain, but will undergo an MRI on Monday to specifically come down with a diagnosis.
"It's a knee, but not a season-ending type of knee," Harbaugh said.
Huntley started four games for the Ravens last season and the club went 1-3 over that stretch.
Next week, the Ravens will head to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers.

     Ravens say QB Lamar Jackson's knee injury not season-ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE -- Lamar Jackson's knee injury is not a season-ending one, but there is no definitive timetable for the Pro Bowl quarterback's return, coach John Harbaugh said after the Baltimore Ravens' 10-9 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was ruled out for the rest of the game after injuring his left knee on a sack by Broncos linebacker Jonathon Cooper.
It appeared as if Jackson's left knee was driven into the ground as Cooper landed on top of his back.
This season, Jackson has led Baltimore to first place in the AFC North.
Asked about his mindset if Jackson misses more games because of injury, Huntley said, "Just like every week -- just prepare.

     Lamar Jackson's Knee Injury Isn't Season Ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The injury happened when Jackson was sacked for a 6-yard loss by Broncos linebacker Jonathan Cooper, the second sack Jackson took in the game.
Jackson went into the blue medical tent at the start of the second quarter and then immediately to the locker room.
Though Jackson hasn't missed any games this season, he was sidelined for the final four games of last season due to an ankle injury.
Huntley completed 27 of 32 passes for 187 yards and ran 10 times for a team-leading 41 yards.
He scored the game-winning touchdown on a 2-yard plunge into the end zone with 28 seconds left.

     Ravens hopeful on Lamar Jackson injury, confident in Huntley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE â€” (AP) â€” Just like last year, the Baltimore Ravens are prepared to enter the pivotal part of their season without star quarterback Lamar Jackson.
The concern grew when Jackson was ushered into the tunnel to the Ravens' locker room so trainers could get a closer look at his injured knee.
Jackson never returned to the game, but things ultimately turned out fine for the AFC North leaders.
The Ravens (8-4) have had their struggles this season on offense, and Jackson has not always been exceptionally sharp.
Jackson missed the final four games of the 2021 season with an ankle injury, and Baltimore lost every one of them.
