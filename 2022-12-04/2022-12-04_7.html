    </h2>

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers spent the summer openly trying and failing to get rid of quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.
It was awkward, yet coach Kyle Shanahan was absolutely thrilled to still have him when Garoppolo stepped in for an injured Trey Lance and helped turn the team into a Super Bowl favorite.
Then Garoppolo got hurt.

     Summary: For the second time in the 2022 season, the 49ers are down a starting quarterback.
In Week 2 they lost Trey Lance to an ankle injury, and in Week 13 Jimmy Garoppolo went down for the season with a broken foot.
“No, he can’t,” Shanahan responded when asked if there was a chance Lance would be activated.
However, this is the first confirmation that his injury and the ensuing surgery would keep him out for the year.
For the rest of this season, Lance and Garoppolo will only be observers.

     Summary: Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers might not be moving on from each other just yet.
Garoppolo takes the 7-4 Niners into their showdown today against the Dolphins having led his team to four straight victories.
Trey Lance, who began the season as the starter, is on injured reserve and out for the season following September ankle surgery.
The 49ers moved on from Garoppolo before the 2022 season, embracing Lance as the starter and giving permission to Jimmy G to seek a trade.
Either way, Garoppolo should be one of the most coveted free-agent QBs this offseason, set to cash in again.

     49ers' Jimmy Garoppolo out for season with broken left foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. — (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers lost quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to a season-ending left foot injury Sunday, dealing a big blow to one of the NFL's top teams.
We know what Jimmy’s been through, how hard he’s worked at this,” coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game.
This is the third time Garoppolo has had a season derailed by injury since joining the 49ers midway through the 2017 season.
He went down with a season-ending knee injury in the third game of the 2018 season and missed eight games with ankle injuries in 2020.
Garoppolo kept his job last year but was supposed to move on this season before offseason shoulder surgery killed his trade market.
