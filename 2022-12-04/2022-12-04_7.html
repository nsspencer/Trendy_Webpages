     Summary: Getty ImagesThe 49ers have provided an update on quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and it’s not good news.
Garoppolo has been downgraded to out with a foot injury.
Garoppolo was sacked for a 10-yard loss to end San Francisco’s first drive and suffered the injury then.
San Francisco initially announced Garoppolo as questionable to return with an ankle injury.
He threw a 3-yard touchdown to fullback Kyle Juszczyk to give San Francisco a 10-7 lead.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s just about the only reaction you can have to Sunday’s report that Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers have mutual interest in re-reuniting for a seventh season together in the bay.
“Both sides are open to him being back for the 2023 season,” NFL Network reported.
Trey Lance looked nothing like a franchise quarterback in his extremely brief stint as the starter.
Garoppolo, for his part, has successfully avoided the chronic injuries that were his biggest problem in his first five seasons with San Francisco.
Now a tenure that was announced as over after five years could extend into year seven and beyond.

     49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo out for season with broken foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jimmy Garoppolo is carted off and ruled out for the rest of the game after suffering an apparent foot injury vs. the Dolphins.
(0:16)SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Just eight plays into the San Francisco 49ers' opening drive Sunday, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo departed with a left foot injury that will end his season.
49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said after his team's 33-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins that Garoppolo has a broken foot and will undergo season-ending surgery.
Garoppolo attempted to keep his momentum moving forward, and his left foot got caught under Phillips as he was taken down.
Garoppolo has started every game since Lance's injury, and the Niners had gone 6-3 in his nine starts entering Sunday.

     Jimmy Garoppolo injury update: 49ers QB out for 2022 season with broken foot; rookie Brock Purdy to take over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers turned to Jimmy Garoppolo early this season after initial starter Trey Lance suffered a season-ending ankle injury.
Now, they're turning to rookie Brock Purdy after Garoppolo suffered his own season-ending injury in Week 13 against the Dolphins.
Coach Kyle Shanahan announced immediately following the game that Garoppolo suffered a broken foot and will require surgery that will sideline him for the remainder of 2022.
Garoppolo had been enjoying one of the most productive seasons of his 49ers career, filling in for Lance while guiding the 49ers atop the NFC West.
CBS Sports stats guru Stephen Oh ran the numbers, and here's how the 49ers' prospects change with Purdy at quarterback.

     Niners QB Jimmy Garoppolo exits with ankle injury in first half of win over Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo suffered an ankle injury in the first quarter of Sunday's 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins.
Garoppolo was carted to the locker room at Levi's Stadium following the 49ers' first possession.
Brock Purdy replaced Garoppolo at quarterback with San Francisco trailing 7-3 and played well in relief.
Garoppolo has enjoyed a solid season under center since he re-assumed the starting role in San Francisco after Trey Lance suffered a season-ending ankle injury in September.
Garoppolo's strong play has also led to a situation in which the veteran QB could find himself unexpectedly back with the Niners for the 2023 season.

     Summary: Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers might not be moving on from each other just yet.
Garoppolo takes the 7-4 Niners into their showdown today against the Dolphins having led his team to four straight victories.
Trey Lance, who began the season as the starter, is on injured reserve and out for the season following September ankle surgery.
The 49ers moved on from Garoppolo before the 2022 season, embracing Lance as the starter and giving permission to Jimmy G to seek a trade.
Either way, Garoppolo should be one of the most coveted free-agent QBs this offseason, set to cash in again.

     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. — (AP) — San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo will miss the rest of the season after breaking his right foot in a 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.
Garoppolo got up slowly after being sacked by Jerome Baker and Jaelan Phillips on third down on San Francisco's first drive.
Rookie Brock Purdy came into the game to replace Garoppolo to start the second drive and threw two touchdown passes.
Purdy had thrown just nine passes this season in mop-up duty of a blowout loss to Kansas City in Week 7.
Garoppolo resumed his starting role for San Francisco in Week 2 this season after Trey Lance went down with a season-ending ankle injury.
