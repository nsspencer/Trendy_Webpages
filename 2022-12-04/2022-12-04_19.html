     Republican leaders mostly silent over Donald Trump's call to suspend the Constitution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – As party leaders remained silent, a few Republicans on Sunday rejected Donald Trump's extraordinary suggestion for "termination" of the U.S. Constitution and his installation as president.
Mike Lawler, an incoming House Republican from New York, told CNN's "State of the Union" that "obviously, I don't support" Trump's demands, and that the Constitution exists "to protect the rights of every American."
Joe Walsh, a former congressman who left the Republican Party over the elevation of Trump, used his Twitter feet to call out GOP leaders about Trump.
"Without a backbone, Donald Trump is going to continue to pull the strings in the Republican Party and he's going to continue to be the face of the Republican Party," she said.
"And only a toxic dictator, a would-be dictator would say, we got to suspend the Constitution."

     Summary: “Not a single conservative can legitimately support him, and not a single supporter can be called a conservative,” Kinzinger said.
“This is insane.”Kinzinger, like Cheney, is a frequent Trump critic who’s leaving Congress in January.
“A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump posted.
Democrats condemned Trump’s remarks and also suggested they reflected a larger problem within the GOP.
“I guess a ‘constitutional conservative’ is one who is conservative in their support for the constitution … when it’s inconvenient,” Schiff wrote on Twitter.

     Trump rebuked for call to suspend Constitution over election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — (AP) — Former President Donald Trump faced rebuke Sunday from officials in both parties after calling for the “termination” of parts of the Constitution over his lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
Trump, who announced last month that he is running again for president, made the claim over the weekend on his Truth Social media platform.
“A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” he wrote.
They include the probe into classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago, and ongoing state and federal inquiries related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
“Attacking the Constitution and all it stands for is anathema to the soul of our nation."

     Trump calls for the termination of the Constitution in Truth Social post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Former President Donald Trump called for the termination of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election and reinstate him to power Saturday in a continuation of his election denialism and pushing of fringe conspiracy theories.
A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump wrote in a post on the social network Truth Social and accused “Big Tech” of working closely with Democrats.
Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election.
No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.
The debate took place weeks before the 2020 election, when Joe Biden, Hunter Biden’s father, was running against then-President Trump.
