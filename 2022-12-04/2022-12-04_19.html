     Jeff Saturday: Matt Ryan knows he didn’t play well, but I didn’t consider benching him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesColts coach Jeff Saturday said there was no thought to benching quarterback Matt Ryan on Sunday night, no matter how ugly the 54-19 loss to the Cowboys got.
Asked if he considered going to backup quarterback Nick Foles, Saturday answered, “No, no.”“From a quarterback perspective, you dig yourself a hole, you’ve got to get out,” Saturday continued.
“He knows he didn’t play good.
You find a way to fix it and get better.”Saturday didn’t completely slam the door on starting Foles or Sam Ehlinger later this season.
I’m disappointed, they’re disappointed, no decision I’m going to make right now is going to be a good decision.

     'Total Disaster' Matt Ryan Ripped by Twitter During Colts' Blowout Loss to Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wesley Hitt/Getty ImagesThe Matt Ryan trade is proving to be a disaster for the Indianapolis Colts as they continue to search for a reliable signal-caller in the post-Andrew Luck era.
Indianapolis fell to the Dallas Cowboys 54-19 on Sunday night at AT&amp;T Stadium, and Ryan was a big reason why the Colts dropped to 4-8-1 on the season.
Ryan completed 21-of-37 passes for 233 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.
He posted a passer rating of 59.8, and the Colts posted a total of five turnovers.
The 37-year-old is under contract with the Colts through the 2023 campaign with a cap hit of $35.2 million, per Spotrac.

    </h2>

     Summary: The latest such example came on Monday, when a reporter asked Saturday whether the injury suffered by Matt Ryan ahead of Week 8 — a Grade 2 shoulder separation — has since affected his play.
Saturday's answer wasn't one you typically hear from an NFL coach:#Colts HC Jeff Saturday was asked if he sees on film that Matt Ryan’s shoulder injury has affected him:"Um, I don't think so.
… “ pic.twitter.com/doiqMAE4pJ — James Boyd (@RomeovilleKid) December 5, 2022Regardless of the truthfulness of Saturday's answer, it seems bizarre the coach — interim or not — would not take greater consideration of his players' injuries.
Saturday's answer on Monday was the latest of several curious decisions by the interim coach, including late-game clock management in a loss vs. the Steelers.
Since a surprising victory over the Raiders in his debut, Saturday has gone 0-3 in his four-game stint as interim coach.

     Colts’ Jeff Saturday Has Not Asked QB Matt Ryan About Shoulder Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colts interim coach Jeff Saturday had yet another head-scratching exchange with a reporter on Monday, this time in regard to an injury to starting quarterback Matt Ryan.
When asked if he thought Ryan’s shoulder injury from earlier in the season was affecting his play, the interim coach made a rather confusing admission.
Reich was fired after a 26–3 loss to the Patriots in Week 9 and Saturday was brought in to be Indianapolis’ interim head coach.
Ryan was re-installed as the starter that same week and led the team to a win over the Raiders in Saturday’s coaching debut.
However, the Colts have followed up the victory with three straight losses in which Ryan has thrown just three touchdowns compared to six giveaways.

     Insider: Too many hits, too many mistakes, Colts QB Matt Ryan's problems aren't going away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All that needed to be said about the way Matt Ryan has played in Indianapolis.
Ryan has hinted at the toll all of those hits have taken on him in the last couple of weeks.
Hooker’s pick led to a Dallas touchdown, a 21-13 halftime lead, and set the stage for the Colts’ fourth-quarter collapse.
“Probably need to put that ball a little further outside, and if it misses, it misses a little further away,” Ryan said.
But Ryan hasn’t been able to overcome any of the issues the Colts have had this season.

Ryan got rid of the ball quickly, but not as quickly as I want the memory of this game to fade.
Quick, short, inaccurate, pressured throws result in low yards, lots of turnovers, some first downs, a few TDs, and the 24th overall efficiency.
