     Clemson’s Dabo Swinney Says QB Cade Klubnik to Start Orange Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clemson’s ACC Championship Game victory on Saturday night came with some quarterback drama, as backup Cade Klubnik relieved D.J.
After the game, head coach Dabo Swinney confirmed that Klubnik would start at quarterback for the Tigers (11-2) in the Orange Bowl.
He’s really, really fast.
Uiagalelei has one year of eligibility left, but it appears as if Clemson is ready to hand the team over to Klubnik.
“Obviously, it didn't end tonight the way he would like, but he’s got a bright, bright future as a football player.”

     Clemson Football: Tigers projected to face SEC opponent in Orange Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clemson Football: Predicting the playoffs and New Year’s Six bowls by John ChanceyESPN has released its College Football Playoff predictions and bowl matchups for the 2022 season, including the Orange Bowl opponent for Clemson football.
Those projections include Georgia vs. Ohio State in the Peach Bowl and Michigan vs. TCU in the Fiesta Bowl.
The projection has Clemson matched up with Tennessee in the Orange Bowl, which will be played at 8 p.m. on Friday, December 30th at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Fifteen bowl practices with first-team reps should help Klubnik mature quickly, not only for the bowl game, but in anticipation of next season.
Again, if this matchup happens, it’ll likely be the battle of two little used quarterbacks as Milton has attempted only 54 passes on the season and Klubnik 46.
