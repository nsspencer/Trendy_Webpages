     Niners QB Jimmy Garoppolo exits with ankle injury in first half of win over Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo suffered an ankle injury in the first quarter of Sunday's 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins.
Garoppolo was carted to the locker room at Levi's Stadium following the 49ers' first possession.
Brock Purdy replaced Garoppolo at quarterback with San Francisco trailing 7-3 and played well in relief.
Garoppolo has enjoyed a solid season under center since he re-assumed the starting role in San Francisco after Trey Lance suffered a season-ending ankle injury in September.
Garoppolo's strong play has also led to a situation in which the veteran QB could find himself unexpectedly back with the Niners for the 2023 season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Niners and Dolphins face off this Sunday in what NFL Network’s Peter Schrager described as “the game of the season.” When you look at all the ink that’s spilled this week about how the strength of Miami’s offense comes into direct conflict with the strength of the San Francisco defense, attacking and defending the middle of the field respectively, which are both the best in the league at what they do, it seems like he might just be right.
Throw in the familiarity between the two coaching staffs, centered on the one time mentor-mentee relationship of Shanahan and McDaniel, the bevy of former Niners on the Dolphins, and the recent chippy quotes from one of those players, Raheem Mostert, and there’s even more reason to make this contest appointment viewing.
With that in mind, here’s everything you need to know about the who, what, and how to watch.

     49ers vs. Dolphins score, takeaways: San Francisco beats Miami but loses Jimmy Garoppolo for season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike McDaniel learned under Kyle Shanahan, and he returned to San Francisco on Sunday with the intention of beating his mentor, and tying the Bills atop the AFC East in the process.
But his own starter, Tua Tagovailoa, struggled for much of the first half against the 49ers' persistent defense.
A late comeback effort kept things close, but rookie Brock Purdy ultimately outdueled Tagovailoa as San Francisco rolled past Miami, 33-17.
But it worked; neither play-maker had a gaudy stat line, but they stepped up on several key third downs to help San Francisco dominate time of possession.
But then San Francisco finally took advantage of Tagovailoa slinging it into traffic with the following turnover ...
