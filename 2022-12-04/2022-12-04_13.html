     Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence back and playing vs. Lions following injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Lawrence has shown meaningful progress in Year 2 and the Jacksonville Jaguars will need him to keep playing at a high level for the remainder of the season if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive.
That’s why the Jags were rightfully concerned when he got hurt near the end of the second quarter of their Week 13 matchup against the Detroit Lions.
On the last play of the first half, Lawrence was brought down on a sack and suffered a lower-leg injury.
Beathard started warming up ahead of the third quarter put Lawrence’s availability for the remainder of the game for a moment.
Trailing 30-6, it’s hard to see the Jags coming back the way they did against the Baltimore Ravens last week.

     Trevor Lawrence says foot was hurting, but 'not anything serious'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jacksonville Jaguars fans feared the worst when quarterback Trevor Lawrence went down and reached for the back of his knee after an awkward sack Sunday.
First, when Lawrence managed to walk off the field under his own power.
Then there was even more relief when Lawrence jogged out of the tunnel early in the third quarter and played the second half.
“I thought it was my knee at first, and then my foot a little bit was hurting too,” Lawrence told reporters after the game.
Last week, the Jaguars were cautious with Travis Etienne Jr. after the second-year back suffered a foot injury.
