     3 Takeaways from 49ers' Week 13 Win vs. Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 3Bob Kupbens/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesThe San Francisco 49ers won on Sunday, but they're probably feeling about as low as they possibly could on a victory Monday.
San Francisco handled a very good Miami Dolphins team, notching a decisive 33-17 victory.
Now winners of five straight, the 49ers were rolling and looking like a team that could make a Super Bowl push.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks are on deck, so San Francisco will have to regroup quickly.
Here's what else we learned during the 49ers' Week 13 win over the Dolphins.

     Fans react on Twitter during Dolphins vs. 49ers in Week 13
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers met on Sunday afternoon at Levi’s Stadium for a Week 13 matchup between two teams on winning streaks, but it was Kyle Shanahan’s squad that extended their’s another week.
Miami had a few pop plays, including long touchdowns to Trent Sherfield and Tyreek Hill, but they were stagnant for most of the game due to Tua Tagovailoa’s inaccuracy and a reluctance to run the ball.
Defensively, the Dolphins were beaten by seventh-round rookie Brock Purdy, who looked better than expected in Shanahan’s quarterback-friendly system.
He relied heavily on running back Christian McCaffrey, who put up an impressive performance in both the rushing and receiving game.
Here’s how Dolphins fans reacted throughout and after the contest:

     5 Winners and 1 loser from the 49ers victory over the Dolphins: A Kyle Shanahan gem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers' offense ran 34 more plays (79-45) and held the ball more than 20 minutes longer than the Dolphins (40:34-19:26).
The 49ers' offense was able to keep the Dolphins offense off the field and subsequently to their lowest output since Week 7.
Purdy played well on Sunday and helped the 49ers pick up a much-needed victory to stay atop the NFC West.
His biggest sack of the game came with 1:53 left in the 4th quarter, and the 49ers were up nine.
Winner: Forcing turnoversThe 49ers' defense forced a season-high four turnovers against a Dolphins offense that, entering Sunday, had the fourth-fewest turnovers in the league.

     49ers vs. Dolphins score, takeaways: San Francisco beats Miami but loses Jimmy Garoppolo for season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike McDaniel learned under Kyle Shanahan, and he returned to San Francisco on Sunday with the intention of beating his mentor, and tying the Bills atop the AFC East in the process.
But his own starter, Tua Tagovailoa, struggled for much of the first half against the 49ers' persistent defense.
A late comeback effort kept things close, but rookie Brock Purdy ultimately outdueled Tagovailoa as San Francisco rolled past Miami, 33-17.
But it worked; neither play-maker had a gaudy stat line, but they stepped up on several key third downs to help San Francisco dominate time of possession.
But then San Francisco finally took advantage of Tagovailoa slinging it into traffic with the following turnover ...
