     Giants' Carlos Rodon: Signs two-year deal with Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rodon signed a two-year, $44 million contract with the Giants on Friday which includes an opt-out after the first season, Jeff Passan of ESPN.com reports.
The deal places Rodon in one of the best possible landing spots for any pitcher, as the Giants play in a pitcher-friendly park and have earned a reputation for getting the most out of their starters in recent years.
That said, Rodon didn't seem to need much help making the most of his talents in 2021, as he's coming off a season in which he rode a 34.6 percent strikeout rate to a 2.37 ERA.
Health is easily his most significant question mark, as he's battled arm troubles throughout his career and was used very cautiously by the White Sox down the stretch last season while he managed shoulder trouble.

     Carlos Rodon, Giants Reportedly Agree to 2-Year, $44M Contract in Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Nam Y. HuhFormer White Sox starting pitcher Carlos Rodon has agreed to sign with the San Francisco Giants on a two-year contract worth $44 million, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
The White Sox didn't give Rodon an $18.4 million qualifying offer prior to the MLB lockout that lasted 99 days, which allowed him to test the open market.
He posted a team-best 2.37 ERA with 185 strikeouts in 132.2 innings pitched, tying for the team lead with 13 wins.
Rodon pitched his first career no-hitter on April 14 against the Cleveland Indians.
Rodon allowed two runs in 2.2 innings as the White Sox went on to lose 10-1.

     Finally Something Spicy: Carlos Rodon Could Be Going to the Giants (UPDATE: Yup)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if I don’t love it …The last couple years, the San Francisco Giants have been home to many a reclaimed starting pitcher.
It’s clearly something they’ve gotten really good at, and if I were Carlos Rodon, I would probably be interested in the Giants, too:Sounds as if Carlos Rodon is very much in play for the Giants, and that could happen quickly, I am told.
— Susan Slusser (@susanslusser) March 11, 2022Rodon, 29, was excellent for the White Sox last year when healthy, but he had arm issues late in the year, his velocity dipped, and then – most notably – the White Sox declined to make him a qualifying offer.
— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) March 11, 2022A two-year deal with an opt-out is otherwise – better – known as a one-year deal with a player option for a second year.
I’ll be curious to see the annual breakdown, but this looks like a really good deal for Rodon.

     Rodon, Giants agree to deal, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB Rumors: Carlos Rodon and the San Francisco Giants have reportedly agreed to terms on a two year, $44 million deal with an opt out after year one.
Rodon, 29, was one of the more interesting free agents on the market this offseason.
The ChiSox actually non-tendered him after the 2020 season, then re-signed him to a lesser deal than what he would have made in arbitration.
Rodon responded with a breakout year, putting up a 2.37 ERA and a 2.65 FIP in 132 innings over 24 starts.
Rodon offers great upside if he can stay healthy, but the injury history and lack of track record was expected to limit the total value of any deal he signed this offseason.

     Summary: Carlos Rodon agrees with the Giants on 2-year, $44M deal.
Check out some of his best strikeouts with the Chicago White Sox last season.
Rodon set a career high for wins with the Chicago White Sox in 2021 in going 13-5 with a 2.37 ERA and made his first All-Star team.
But he also played a big role as the White Sox ran away with the American League Central title at 93-69.
The Giants lost right-hander Kevin Gausman to the Blue Jays earlier this offseason on a $110 million, five-year deal and declined righty Johnny Cueto's $22 million contract option.

San Francisco still needs to make some more upgrades around the roster with star outfielder Kris Bryant hitting free agency and catcher Buster Posey retiring.
The Giants showed last season that they are able to compete at a high level and that they are serious about contending.

     Giants To Sign Carlos Rodon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 3:07pm: The Giants have reached a two-year, $44MM deal with left-hander Carlos Rodon, reports ESPN’s Jeff Passan.
Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reported shortly beforehand that Rodon was “very much in play” for the Giants.
Rodon was still effective in that time (2.35 ERA in 23 innings), but his strikeout rate was down to 27.2% — still strong, but not quite elite.
He ranked among the league leaders in terms of swinging-strike rate, opponents’ chase and overall strikeout rate.
Because Rodon did not receive the QO, the Giants won’t have to surrender any draft picks to sign him — and the White Sox won’t receive any compensation for his departure.
