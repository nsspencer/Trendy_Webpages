     Report: Joe Buck Expected to Leave Fox Sports for MNF; Contract Worth Up to $75M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stacy Revere/Getty ImagesTroy Aikman has reportedly left Fox Sports to serve as a color commentator for ESPN's Monday Night Football broadcast, and it appears longtime broadcasting partner Joe Buck will make the same move.
According to Andrew Marchand of the New York Post, Buck is "expected to sign a contract in the five-year, $60-75 million range with ESPN."
Add in the alternative broadcast with Peyton and Eli Manning, and Marchand noted ESPN will spend around $50 million a year for its MNF broadcast talent.
From 2006 to 2014, ESPN paired Mike Tirico with a number of color commentators, including Tony Kornheiser, Joe Theismann, Ron Jaworski and Jon Gruden.
But Buck and Aikman—the NFL's longest-tenured broadcasting duo at 20 years together—should solidify ESPN's MNF booth.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new voice of "Monday Night Football" will link up with his old teammate from their former network.
