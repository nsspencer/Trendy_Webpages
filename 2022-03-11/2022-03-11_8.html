     How to watch: Wisconsin basketball vs. Michigan State in the Big Ten Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday night, the Wisconsin Badgers will head to Indianapolis to play the Michigan State Spartans in the quarterfinal of the Big Ten Tournament.
The Spartans just escaped the Maryland Terrapins with a 76-72 win to move past the second round of the tournament on Thursday night.
Freshman Max Christie led the way for Michigan State and could provide a difficult matchup for Badgers guard Jonathan Davis, who is coming off a lower-body injury that he sustained on Sunday against Nebraska.
It should be a great game to watch between two Big Ten powerhouses, as the winner will move on to play the winner of the Penn State vs. Purdue matchup in the semifinal.

Final from Indy pic.twitter.com/leo1ziU59E — Wisconsin Basketball (@BadgerMBB) March 12, 2022The game got off to a classic Big Ten start with neither team really able to score.

Davison led Wisconsin’s offense with 10 points while MSU was paced by Julius Marble who had eight points and four rebounds.

We’ve battled, we’ve done things the right way and we’ve had pretty good outcomes throughout the year.
Hoggard took turns guarding Davis and the Spartans’ help defense was terrific, quickly shutting down gaps whenever they appeared.
“I’m pretty sure their game plan was to try and take away those shots or contest those shots really hard,” Davis said.
Spartans point guard Tyson Walker got loose and scored on back-to-back possessions with the game on the line and the Badgers needing stops.
