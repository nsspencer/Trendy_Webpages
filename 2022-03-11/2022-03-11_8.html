     Steve Pikiell will not leave Rutgers anytime soon after unprecedented contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pikiell now effectively has an eight-year, $29.5 million contract running through the 2029-30 season, according to a term sheet obtained by NJ Advance Media.
The deal includes an initial $15 million buyout, which makes him virtually unattainable for any potential suitors.
Pikiell is also due four biannual $300,000 retention bonuses over the life of the deal.
2022-23: $3 million2023-24: $3.25 million (+ $300,000 retention bonus)2024-25: $3.5 million2025-26: $3.75 million (+ $300,000 retention bonus)2026-27 : $3.85 million2027-28 : $3.95 million (+ $300,000 retention bonus)2028-29 : $4.05 million2029-30: $4.15 million (+ $300,000 retention bonus)Buyout: Pikiell’s buyout has reset to a whopping $15 million -- three times the $5 million figure it started at with his previous two extensions.
That will significantly limit the number of schools that could conceivably make a play to poach Pikiell from Rutgers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Scarlet Knights fell to Iowa in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals after a frustrating day offensively keeping up with the Hawkeyes.
In the 84-74 loss, things went from bad to worse on the Rutgers bench as strength and conditioning coach David VanDyke was tossed with his second technical foul.
He was in the middle of his 17th season with Rutgers head coach Steve Pikiell, working previously together at Stony Brook.
“They were getting into it and the refs cleaned it up,” Iowa coach Fran McCaffery said to Big Ten Network’s Rick Pizzo.
Dayton and the First Four games are the trendy projections for Pikiell, who hopes to bring Rutgers to its second-straight NCAA Tournament.

     Big Ten: Rutgers embraces its underdog label in tournament matchup with Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS — Ron Harper Jr. correctly predicted earlier in the week that despite being the higher seed, Rutgers would be an underdog in its first game of the Big Ten Tournament.
4-seeded Scarlet Knights’ opponent.
The Scarlet Knights have a tall task at hand, but that’s been true since the start of February.
The Scarlet Knights hope it adds up to the program’s first appearance in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals, and Rutgers’ first conference tournament semifinal appearance since the 1998 Big East Tournament.
So we’re just going in there with an underdog mindset, an us-against-the-world mindset and we’ll try and win a Big Ten Championship.
