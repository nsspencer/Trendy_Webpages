     Summary: First Sting, now Elvis?
Well, not really, but it looks like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood‘s Austin Butler will be the next actor to portray this eccentric Dune villain.
“Austin Butler, who got his first big break in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is circling the key role of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in Dune: Part Two.
This announcement comes after a report earlier this week touting Florence Pugh’s potential casting as Princess Irulan.”Read more at Den of GeekWho would’ve ever guessed we’d see Hayden Christensen back as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader again?

     Austin Butler is about to be everywhere with latest word that he is in talks to star in Dune 2 as role of Feyd-Rautha
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Austin Butler isn’t a household name.
On the heels of learning that Florence Pugh is up for a major role in Dune 2—still hoping they call this movie Dune Part Deunx—the latest word is that Austin Butler is in talks for the role of Feyd-Rautha, the nephew and heir of Baron Harkonnen, the corpulent slug-man played by Stellan Skarsgard in the first movie.
If you’re an early-to-it Austin Butler stan worried he’ll be saddled with a similar slug-look, don’t be.
This is the role Sting played in the David Lynch version, and he looked like himself, barring the haircut.
You know, starting with Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Timothee Chalamet, and Zendaya, and continuing with maybe Florence Pugh and Austin Butler, Dune is an extremely hot franchise.

     Elvis Star Austin Butler In Talks To Join Dune: Part Two As Feyd-Rautha
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elvis star Austin Butler is being sought to join the ensemble cast of Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two as the villainous Feyd-Rautha.
This week has plenty of big casting news for blockbusters like Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer epic and Dune: Part Two, and it continues today as Elvis star Austin Butler is being eyed to join Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi sequel as the villainous Feyd-Rautha.
After being greenlit a week after Dune's theatrical release back in October, Dune: Part Two is now slated to begin shooting this summer.
Bringing in two incredible talents like Butler and Pugh to join an already stacked ensemble, Dune: Part Two is shaping up to be a worthy second chapter that could most certainly surpass its predecessor.
He will also appear in the upcoming World War II drama miniseries Masters of the Air for Apple TV Plus.
