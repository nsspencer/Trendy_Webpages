     Grimes and Elon Musk secretly welcomed their second child in December
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Singer Grimes and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have welcomed their second child together, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk.
The little girl was born via surrogate in December last year, Grimes revealed in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair, published on Thursday.
Although the 33-year-old Canadian musician apparently had no intention of announcing the birth of their second child, nicknamed "Y," she shared the news after Vanity Fair journalist Devin Gordon overheard a baby crying.
Musk, 48, has five other children -- twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Saxon and Kai -- from a previous marriage.

     Summary: Hours after the news broke that Elon Musk and Grimes welcomed their second child together, the singer revealed that the two are no longer together.
ELON MUSK AND GRIMES SECRETLY WELCOME A SECOND CHILD"I’m not at liberty to speak on these things," Grimes told the outlet.
While Grimes hesitated at first, she finally revealed that yes, she and the Tesla and SpaceX founder welcomed a baby girl.
Grimes shared that she and Musk, 50, "occasionally call her Sailor Mars," which is a nod to the "Sailor Moon" manga.
Musk and Grimes welcomed their firstborn, a son named X Æ A-12, in May 2020.

     Summary: Grimes is setting the record straight about her relationship with Elon Musk: They are broken up.
Then the Vanity Fair story said that the two were kind of back together — albeit living in separate homes in Austin, Texas — and were best friends.
Alas, magazines have long lead times between when articles are written and when they are published, and apparently Grimes’ love life changes faster than that.
Page Six reported Friday that the performer is dating government whistleblower Chelsea Manning, which The Times hasn’t confirmed.
I don’t ascribe to any political party or economic model that currently exists,” she tweeted.

The news broke by accident when the baby started crying in the couple’s home while Grimes was in the middle of speaking with Vanity Fair reporter Devin Gordon.
Gordon wrote that he heard something “vaguely like a lone cry from an infant upstairs” after Grimes mentioned that X was with his dad.
