     Rivian’s Stock Is Hitting New Lows After Weak Earnings—But Analysts Still Predict A Rebound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineShares of Rivian tumbled 7% Friday after the electric-vehicle maker reported lackluster quarterly earnings and warned that supply chain issues would limit vehicle production in 2022, but despite struggling since going public last year, analysts still love the stock and remain optimistic about a rebound.
Rivian shares are down over 60% this year, but analysts aren’t giving up on the stock just yet.
Rivian told investors that it plans to produce just 25,000 electric trucks and SUVs this year amid ongoing supply chain disruptions, while Wall Street analysts had been hoping for closer to 40,000 vehicles.
Big Number: $18.4 BillionRivian is still well-positioned financially, reporting $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents as of the year-end.
Despite slashing his price target for Rivian stock to $60 per share from $130, Ives remains confident that the Rivian story is “fixable” and shares will eventually rebound.

     Why Rivian Stock Is Plunging This Week and Could Fall Further
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After slumping double.digits last week, the electric vehicle (EV) stock has plunged another 18% so far this week as of 9:30 a.m.
So whatEarlier in the week, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson slashed his price target on Rivian stock by a whopping 59% to $47 a share, according to TheFly.com, as he fears margin pressure on the EV maker.
Rivian had earlier revealed it produced 1,015 and delivered 920 vehicles in 2021 against its production target of 1,200 units.
With Rivian also projecting $2.6 billion in capital expenditures and a negative gross margin for 2022, the market is wasting no time in dumping the EV stock that's still commanding a lofty market capitalization of $34 billion even after today's fall.
I believe Rivian stock may have even further to fall.
