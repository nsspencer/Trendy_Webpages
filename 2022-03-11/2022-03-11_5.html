Let me tell you | DurandoAuburn's NCAA Tournament fate rests on guard productionThe up-and-down season for Auburn's guard trio took a drastic downturn for most of the quarterfinal.
He also improved in the second half and finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and four blocks.
But for a frontcourt as good as Auburn's, a double-digit loss in the lane is brutal entering the NCAA Tournament.

     Instant analysis: Auburn bounced from SEC Tournament by Texas A&amp;M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His subdued exasperation in this moment, then, spoke volumes and encapsulated the day for top-seeded Auburn in its SEC Tournament quarterfinal matchup.
The Tigers came to Tampa, Fla., eyeing a championship double-dip after going wire-to-wire to win the SEC regular-season crown.
Texas A&amp;M led by 16 at halftime after Auburn shot just 16.2 percent in the opening period.
If Auburn hopes to avoid replicating its SEC Tournament showing when the NCAA Tournament gets underway, it will need its guards to deliver.
Jasper stole the ball with 1:02 to play and Auburn trailing by seven following an emphatic out-of-timeout dunk by Quenton Jackson.
