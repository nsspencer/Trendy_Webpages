     Purdue 69, Penn State 61: Boilers Look Like A New-Man
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The redshirt sophomore pulled a John Hart as Purdue became the only higher seed to win on Friday in the Big Ten Tournament.
The offense wasn’t consistent, a 12 point lead shrank to one with two minutes and change left, but Purdue’s defense, a sore spot all season, delivered.
It got key stops, it got five big steals, and it recovered from a slow start to hassle Penn State all night.
Your key play came with less than a minute to go and Purdue clinging to a three point lead.
While consistency was an issue, Purdue looked like PURDUE again for the first time in weeks during long stretches of play.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ninth-ranked and third-seeded Boilermakers did just that but they finally put away Penn State 69-61 in quarterfinal action at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.
The Boilermakers’ offense was stagnant, while Penn State was moving without the ball and getting open looks, especially from 3-point range.
Newman continued to deliver a spark with a 3-pointer to answer one made by Penn State with 12:55 to play.
Double post: Edey and Williams were too much for the Nittany Lions to handle.
When Penn State tried to double Williams in the post, he found shooters on the wing.
