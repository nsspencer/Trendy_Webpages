     Summary: Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner recreate a scene from their 2004 rom-com 13 Going on 30 in sweet new photo and video.
In the 18 years 13 Going on 30's release, however, fans have regularly called for a sequel in which Garner and Ruffalo would share the screen again.
It's hard to believe that 13 Going on 30 is now 18 years old, as it's become such an endearing and beloved classic ever since it debuted.
However, it's certainly not too late for the 13 Going on 30 duo to re-team for a new rom-com, as fans would no doubt flock to it.
Until then, they can catch the pair in The Adam Project starting this Friday on Netflix.

     Summary: Ryan Reynolds’ Netflix movie The Adam Project is all about time travel, and the film helped reunite Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner 18 years after they starred together in the 2004 rom-com 13 Going on 30.
On the other hand, Mark Ruffalo joined the Marvel story years later in 2012’s The Avengers and will be soon appearing again in the upcoming She-Hulk series.
With whispers suggesting that a World War Hulk storyline could be in development, there doesn’t appear to be any chance of the actor giving up his Marvel role just yet.
The Adam Project brings Ruffalo and Garner together with Ryan Reynolds in a thrilling adventure that sees Reynolds traveling back in time and teaming up with his child self to save the world.
