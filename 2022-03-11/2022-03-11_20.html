(But the description for his Netflix show says he's got a waitlist of 300,000 people.)

     Life After Death With Tyler Henry review – is this clairvoyant documentary for real?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apparently, one of the things to fear about the afterlife is that it gives you a taste for cheesy showmen.
Their latest wheeze for getting in touch is Life After Death With Tyler Henry (Netflix), a showcase for a young American clairvoyant previously known for the series Hollywood Medium on the E!
What happens in a standard Life After Death scene will, however, be familiar to anyone who has seen clairvoyants in action before.
… Tyler Henry (right) episode one.
The Henry family have discovered, via a DNA test, that Tyler’s grandmother is not in fact Theresa’s biological mother.

     Summary: Our reading, arranged to promote his new Netflix series, "Life After Death with Tyler Henry" (now streaming), mirrors those of his non-celebrity clients.
Ahead of my reading, I'm assured that he has not been given my name in advance.
Henry also notes "a change of plans" when it comes to how my cousin's dad "would have been memorialized or remembered ...
"I feel like part of our reading today really is meant to deliver messages to his (immediate) family," Henry says.
Henry sees two children for my cousin's dad and refers to an unfinished love story, which seems to fit.
