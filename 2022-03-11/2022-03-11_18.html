    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid the Chicago Cubs’ pursuit of free-agent shortstop Carlos Correa, they’ve actually made another move to give them a top-notch defender.
Per Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the Cubs have signed four-time Gold Glover Andrelton Simmons to a one-year, $4 million deal.
However, the franchise still plans to try and bring in Correa:A one-year agreement with Andrelton Simmons – $4M, plus incentives, per @JonHeyman – would not preclude the Cubs from pursuing Carlos Correa, if they choose to move in that direction.
— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) March 11, 2022Simmons is one of the most sure-handed shortstops in the game.
But, since Chicago is linked to Correa, it does mean they’re trying to get back into contention rather than rebuild.
