     What's The Real Meaning Of Boyfriend By Dove Cameron? Here's What We Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Less than a month after "Boyfriend" went live, Cameron finally blessed her fans with the full-length version.
(This, too, went viral, eventually garnering roughly 500,000 streams per day on Spotify, as Rolling Stone reported in March).
Shortly after the release of the track, Cameron took to social media to express the importance of LGBTQ+ visibility.
"Queer representation in music, releasing songs the way straight artist sexy love songs about the objects of their affections MATTERS."
Fortunately for Cameron, the track has continued to reach the masses, with it gaining over 30 million streams on Spotify in two weeks, per Rolling Stone.
