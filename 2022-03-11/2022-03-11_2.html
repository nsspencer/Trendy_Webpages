     'Turning Red' cast responds after controversial review pulled offline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Turning Red” cast members spoke up in support of the new Pixar film and its universality following a controversial review for the animated movie that was published by CinemaBlend.
The review was pulled offline after being called “sexist,” “racist” and more by members of the press.
By rooting ‘Turning Red’ very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto, the film legitimately feels like it was made for [director] Domee Shi’s friends and immediate family members,” O’Connell wrote in the since-pulled review.
‘Turning Red’ is not.
Pixar / DisneyO’Connell also issued the following apology on Twitter: “I’m genuinely sorry for my ‘Turning Red’ review.

     Disney and Pixar's 'Turning Red' is rare coming-of-age tale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And “Turning Red” is no exception.
Pixar has become known for cutting-edge computer animated films that, despite their machine generated visuals, leave audiences sobbing.
“Turning Red” is directed by Chinese Canadian animator Domee Shi, whose Pixar short, “Bao,” opened in front of “Incredibles 2” and took home an Academy Award.
Each of the female characters in “Turning Red” are unique and well-rounded.
“Turning Red” is a film that says fluff to all that.

     Why Turning Red is the Pixar movie we need right now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turning Red is by far Pixar’s most sophisticated character portrait to date, and one of its most challenging, albeit not necessarily for reasons tied to the film’s skilled and joyful cultural and geographic specificity.
Turning Red also reflects a new level of refinement in Pixar’s animation, which increasingly reveals direct and immediate human (as opposed to toy, bug, car, robot, anthropomorphized emotion) experiences.
More than a little bit like Pixar’s wonderful Inside Out, Turning Red tells a powerful story about adolescence, fitting in, and finding oneself at a time when emotional responses to the world can be the most difficult to manage.
Pixar not only creates this variety of viewpoints, but thinks each of them through so that they are complex and dimensionalized.
And Turning Red evidences that approach, and that skill, extraordinarily well—as long as you’re willing to give yourself over to what you can get from their films instead of what you’re already bringing to them.

     'Turning Red' confronts the messiness of adolescence with refreshing honesty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With her first feature, Turning Red, Shi leans further into the complexities of Asian parent-child relationships — and this time, she's come up with an even wilder conceit.
Director Shi, who wrote the script with Julia Cho, confronts the messiness of adolescence with an honesty that's refreshing in the world of studio animation.
And so Turning Red tells a story about shame, repression and social anxiety — areas that I, like more than a few Asian Americans, know a thing or two about.
All of which is to say that Turning Red gives you a lot of ideas to grapple with.
You can see touches of Japanese anime in the character design; Mei's panda has the fluffy, oversized proportions of Hayao Miyazaki's Totoro.

     Summary: Director of Pixar’s “Turning Red” Domee Shi.
In Pixar’s new “Turning Red,” the teenaged heroine turns into a giant red panda when she gets stressed.
The Chinese Canadian director describes “Turning Red” as “the most personal and the weirdest” of the feature film ideas she pitched to the studio.
This meant channeling Shi’s own teen interests, including anime and boy bands.
Family tiesIn “Turning Red,” Mei is caught between her love for her parents and family and her love for her friends and interests her parents don’t quite understand.

     Turning Red Has No Obligations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turning Red is her feature debut, and it’s the best thing Pixar has released in years.
While it’s once again about a Chinese Canadian mother and child, it’s neither dutiful in its treatment of them nor loaded down by obligations to meet the impossible expectations of a whole disparate demographic of viewers.
She also loves herself, at least until she unexpectedly transforms into a giant red panda one night.
There’s a core of raw, unresolved generational hurt in Turning Red, in the way that Mei feels trapped by her mother’s hopes and dreams for her, and the way that Ming harbors tamped-down resentment about never feeling good enough for her own mother, a pattern she couldn’t help repeating.
What Turning Red wants for its characters is only to carve out a space in which being a good daughter doesn’t require an erasure of self.
