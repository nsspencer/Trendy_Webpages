     Turning Red Doesn’t Follow Pixar’s Rules. Good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ultimately, she made Turning Red, the story of Meilin Lee, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl growing up in Toronto in the early 2000s who wakes up one day to discover that she now transforms into a magical giant red panda whenever she gets angry or upset.
It’s an allegory for puberty—and one of the most personal movies Pixar has ever made.
Its rules of storytelling (there are 22) are handed down in earnest screenwriting blogs like the Ten Commandments.
“For me, I just want to go fast because my worst fear is to overthink and overdo and overpolish something until it loses all of its uniqueness.”So with Turning Red, Shi broke some rules.
Likewise, Turning Red is so linked to Shi’s life experiences that setting it anywhere but her hometown would have made it a completely different story.

     Turning Red: Embrace your inner red panda
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, those things fall to the wayside when a family ‘curse’ causes her to turn into a giant red panda when she gets overly emotional.
Yes, puberty certainly is a complicated time, but that chaos is exactly what the filmmakers of Turning Red wanted to capture: “My hope is that audiences embrace all the messiness of life of growing up,” Shi explains.
As the line between obedient child and independent adult becomes blurred for Mei, her relationship with her mother gets complicated.
But perhaps the red panda could help out with that?
“And stay through the credits because there’s a button at the end…”Turning Red is out now on Disney+.

     'Turning Red' confronts the messiness of adolescence with refreshing honesty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With her first feature, Turning Red, Shi leans further into the complexities of Asian parent-child relationships — and this time, she's come up with an even wilder conceit.
Director Shi, who wrote the script with Julia Cho, confronts the messiness of adolescence with an honesty that's refreshing in the world of studio animation.
And so Turning Red tells a story about shame, repression and social anxiety — areas that I, like more than a few Asian Americans, know a thing or two about.
All of which is to say that Turning Red gives you a lot of ideas to grapple with.
You can see touches of Japanese anime in the character design; Mei's panda has the fluffy, oversized proportions of Hayao Miyazaki's Totoro.

     Review: ‘Turning Red’ is a powerful exploration of puberty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jake Coyle | Associated PressFor better and worse, “Turning Red” is like no Pixar film before it.
For Pixar, a factory of childhood whimsy designed to make adults cry, “Turning Red” fills in more than a few blind spots.
The best thing about “Turning Red” is how it broadens the horizons of the 36-year-old animation powerhouse with a refreshing vantage point and some new moves.
But “Turning Red” is surprisingly free of humor or the kind of visual wit that has long been a Pixar hallmark.
But “Turning Red” does nail one rite of female adolescence with remarkable accuracy: the boy band.

     How boy bands and anime inspired Pixar’s magical must-see ‘Turning Red’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Director of Pixar’s “Turning Red” Domee Shi.
In Pixar’s new “Turning Red,” the teenaged heroine turns into a giant red panda when she gets stressed.
The Chinese Canadian director describes “Turning Red” as “the most personal and the weirdest” of the feature film ideas she pitched to the studio.
This meant channeling Shi’s own teen interests, including anime and boy bands.
Family tiesIn “Turning Red,” Mei is caught between her love for her parents and family and her love for her friends and interests her parents don’t quite understand.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney Plus was up and running only about four months when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Is Turning Red streaming?
Like everything else on Disney Plus right now, it's available to stream at no added cost to your standard subscription.
But in all countries where Disney Plus hasn't launched, the company said it would release Turning Red in theaters.
Some of Disney's upcoming smaller movies have already been switched to be Disney Plus originals instead, skipping theaters entirely.
