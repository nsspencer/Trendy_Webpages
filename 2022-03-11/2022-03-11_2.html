     'Turning Red' cast responds after controversial review pulled offline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Turning Red” cast members spoke up in support of the new Pixar film and its universality following a controversial review for the animated movie that was published by CinemaBlend.
The review was pulled offline after being called “sexist,” “racist” and more by members of the press.
By rooting ‘Turning Red’ very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto, the film legitimately feels like it was made for [director] Domee Shi’s friends and immediate family members,” O’Connell wrote in the since-pulled review.
‘Turning Red’ is not.
Pixar / DisneyO’Connell also issued the following apology on Twitter: “I’m genuinely sorry for my ‘Turning Red’ review.

     'Turning Red' is a turning point for Asians in film. Why is it seen as unrelatable?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 'Turning Red' is a turning point for Asians in film.
But in the case of the character of Meilin Lee in Disney and Pixar's latest film, "Turning Red", her teen angst is marred with the slight complication of turning into a red panda bear.
"By rooting 'Turning Red' very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto, the film legitimately feels like it was made for Domee Shi's friends and immediate family members.
Because it's actually probably the more relatable representation of Asians, the most humanized version," Wang Yuen said.
There's emotions in 'Turning Red' that are absolutely part of a human story," she said.

     'Turning Red' confronts the messiness of adolescence with refreshing honesty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With her first feature, Turning Red, Shi leans further into the complexities of Asian parent-child relationships — and this time, she's come up with an even wilder conceit.
Director Shi, who wrote the script with Julia Cho, confronts the messiness of adolescence with an honesty that's refreshing in the world of studio animation.
And so Turning Red tells a story about shame, repression and social anxiety — areas that I, like more than a few Asian Americans, know a thing or two about.
All of which is to say that Turning Red gives you a lot of ideas to grapple with.
You can see touches of Japanese anime in the character design; Mei's panda has the fluffy, oversized proportions of Hayao Miyazaki's Totoro.

     Turning Red is the best Pixar movie in years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our top recommendation of the week is Turning Red.
Last month, we spoke with the creators of Turning Red about the film’s open portrayal of puberty and periods.
Radulovic says that Turning Red ”unabashedly and jovially embraces its own identity in such a tender way that it aches” and calls the film one of Pixar’s best.
We’re bummed for the filmmakers at Pixar that Turning Red isn’t getting a full theatrical release, but selfishly, we’re thrilled that we can watch the movie when we want, as often as we want, on Disney Plus.
This week on YouTube | The Matrix Resurrections is a movie that’s kind of about video games.

     How boy bands and anime inspired Pixar’s magical must-see ‘Turning Red’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Director of Pixar’s “Turning Red” Domee Shi.
In Pixar’s new “Turning Red,” the teenaged heroine turns into a giant red panda when she gets stressed.
The Chinese Canadian director describes “Turning Red” as “the most personal and the weirdest” of the feature film ideas she pitched to the studio.
This meant channeling Shi’s own teen interests, including anime and boy bands.
Family tiesIn “Turning Red,” Mei is caught between her love for her parents and family and her love for her friends and interests her parents don’t quite understand.

     Turning Red Has No Obligations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turning Red is her feature debut, and it’s the best thing Pixar has released in years.
While it’s once again about a Chinese Canadian mother and child, it’s neither dutiful in its treatment of them nor loaded down by obligations to meet the impossible expectations of a whole disparate demographic of viewers.
She also loves herself, at least until she unexpectedly transforms into a giant red panda one night.
There’s a core of raw, unresolved generational hurt in Turning Red, in the way that Mei feels trapped by her mother’s hopes and dreams for her, and the way that Ming harbors tamped-down resentment about never feeling good enough for her own mother, a pattern she couldn’t help repeating.
What Turning Red wants for its characters is only to carve out a space in which being a good daughter doesn’t require an erasure of self.
