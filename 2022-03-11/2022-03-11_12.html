    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After losing to Penn State in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament, the Ohio State basketball team has an uphill climb towards success in the NCAA Tournament.
Last night was a complete debacle for the Ohio State basketball team.
Because of that loss, they will likely fall to an 8-seed in the NCAA Tournament.
It makes the path to any sort of success in this tournament an uphill climb.
They need Zed Key, Kyle Young, and Meechie Johnson to be completely healthy for the NCAA Tournament.

     Men’s Basketball: ‘We wore down’: No. 6 Ohio State outmatched in second half of early Big Ten Tournament exit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Penn State outrebounded Ohio State 29-28 and swiped six steals compared to the Buckeyes’ two.
Liddell said the Nittany Lions played hard en route to overcoming a 13-point deficit.
They just played harder.”Last season, Ohio State won three conference tournament games, two by four points or fewer and one in overtime.
This season, injuries and fatigue marred Ohio State to an early exit, and head coach Chris Holtmann said physicality overcame the Buckeyes Thursday.
Now less than a week before the national tournament, Ohio State has a bit more time off than it has recently.

     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- Ohio State basketball’s 71-68 second-round loss to Penn State in the Big Ten Tournament is inexcusable.
Ohio State may very well answer the questions two weeks from now.
The Ohio State basketball standard shouldn’t be exciting moments early in the season, followed by disappointing flameouts in March.

     Summary: The Nittany Lions used a 19-7 second-half run to beat the Buckeyes, who went nearly seven minutes without a basket.
A really, really tough and physical game,” head coach Chris Holtmann said during his postgame press conference.
“We beat this guys two times earlier, and if you remember, Kyle Young played a major role in both those games,” Holtmann said.
“I thought we played as hard tonight as we’ve played in a couple weeks.
“We’ve got a week to prepare and get ready for whoever we play,” fifth-year senior guard Cedric Russell said.
