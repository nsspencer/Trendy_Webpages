Braylon is accused of breaking the rules and Royce is being blamed.
Royce appears to have cooperated fully with investigators as did her boyfriend.
During the chat, he was asked the last time he saw Howard.

     Court Docs Reveal That Royce Reed’s Underage Son Allegedly Engaged In Inappropriate Conduct With A Minor; Claims Led To Her Child Neglect Charge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier today we reported that former ‘Basketball Wives’ star Royce Reed turned herself in to Florida police due to a third-degree felony charge of child neglect.
Now, according to recently released court documents, the details involving the case have revealed that her underage son’s alleged inappropriate conduct with a minor led to Royce being hit with a felony charge for neglecting a child.
According to court documents, Royce Reed’s young son has an alleged history of inappropriate sexual conduct with minors, that came to a head last year when he allegedly made the minor son of Royce’s boyfriend perform a sexual act while the two boys were at Royce’s home.
Her son and the minor child had been together multiple times throughout the last year, despite him be required not to do so.
In response to her son’s inappropriate conduct, Royce told investigators that he has been seeing a sexual treatment counselor at TrueCore Behavioral Solutions for the past eight months.
