    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers announced their list of non-roster invites to 2022 Spring Training, which is comprised of 21 players and includes a blend of top prospects, veterans and organizational depth.
Each of the five also received a non-roster invite to Spring Training last year.
Friedman also mentioned Bobby Miller and Landon Knack in that same light, though neither of the highly-touted right-handers were part of the Dodgers’ non-roster invites.
The group does include several veterans who signed a Minor League contract during the MLB lockout, with Sam Gaviglio, Tony Wolters and Stefen Romer among them.
With players reporting to camp this weekend, the Dodgers are due to hold their first Spring Training workout on Monday.

     Summary: No major league free agents signed on the first day back, but the Dodgers did add Daniel Zamora, the pitcher announced on Friday.
#dodgers pic.twitter.com/JnNz7p8qSn — Daniel Zamora (@Daniel_Zamora32) March 11, 2022“Time to get to work!
Excited for this new opportunity with the @dodgers organization,” Zamora wrote on both Twitter and Instagram.
Zamora’s deal with the Dodgers is a minor league contract, per Fabian Ardaya at The Athletic.
It’s unclear whether Zamora has a non-roster invitation to major league camp, mostly because there wasn’t yet a major league spring training until this weekend, now that the lockout’s over.
