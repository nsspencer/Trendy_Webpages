    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After another collapse down the stretch, it’s time for the Ohio State basketball team to part ways with head coach Chris Holtmann.
What if this Ohio State basketball team actually gets to the Elite Eight or further?
Since taking over the Ohio State basketball program five years ago, Holtmann is now 9-14 in the month of March.
That includes regular-season games, Big Ten Tournament games, and NCAA Tournament games.
Ohio State clearly isn’t going anywhere with him leading the program.

     Ranking Big Ten basketball head coaching salaries. Where is Chris Holtmann?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Being a big-time college basketball ball head coach can be very lucrative, especially at some of the most storied programs in the country.
The money might not be as stratospheric as college football, but there’s no doubt that the salaries keep rising.
Some of the most iconic coaches in college basketball have called the conference home in years past, and that continues through to today.
USA TODAY releases its coaches’ salaries database for football annually and has just released the same for basketball.
The amount listed may be owed to coach over an extended period of time, rather than as a lump sum at termination.
