     The Adam Project Ending and Time Travel Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Realising he’s misjudged the time jump by four years, Adam has little patience for the tricky situation he’s now in, and the awful way Young Adam treats his mother Ellie (Jennifer Garner) after his father’s sudden death.
The Time JetGritting his teeth and buckling down, Future Adam realizes he needs Young Adam to fix his damaged ship, as the time jet’s controls work by recognizing the user’s DNA.
Unfortunately, Adam doesn’t heal before he jumps back to 2018, and so Young Adam has to stick around.
Time Travel LogicYoung Adam is excited to meet his buff older self, but is naturally very confused and inquisitive about how time travel works.
Or maybe this is a multiverse situation where these events are kickstarting a completely different timeline now that Adam has interfered with the past?

     The Adam Project
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (CNS) — A climactic sequence in the sci-fi action adventure “The Adam Project” (Netflix) finds the preteen version of the eponymous character using hi-tech weapons to fight evil robots.
Adult Adam (Ryan Reynolds) hails from the year 2050.
Youthful Adam is undersized, asthmatic and a victim of bullying, largely because he has a big mouth.
Yet a momentary reference to the idea that the rules of chronology busting may require the two embodiments of the protagonist to forget that they ever met each other might be extended to “The Adam Project” as a whole.

     "The Adam Project" digs into the essential sadness of Ryan Reynolds' heroes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Understanding why "The Adam Project" transcends its otherwise mundane action-adventure trappings requires comprehending the specifics of Ryan Reynolds' intergenerational appeal.
Reynolds' singular style, however, taps into a plausible, palpable sadness that "The Adam Project" capitalizes upon tremendously.
"The Adam Project" re-teams Reynolds with "Stranger Things" director Shawn Levy, who worked with him in 2021's video game comedy "Free Guy."
This aspect of the journey makes "The Adam Project" worth watching, more than the polished visual effects, the crisp action choreography or the clever repartee.
Disappointing as that choice may be, it wasn't egregious enough to make me regret the time spent with "The Adam Project."

     The Adam Project review: Netflix sci-fi movie lets Ryan Reynolds do his thing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Levy and Reynolds — both co-producers on the film — play to their strengths, The Adam Project is zippy, agreeable sci-fi fun that produces a few good chuckles.
Young Adam needs adult Adam to help him work through some issues related to the recent death of their father Louis (Mark Ruffalo), a brilliant but neglectful physicist.
But it is indicative of how The Adam Project loses its grip when the stakes become a little higher.
The form of therapy presented in The Adam Project is obviously impossible, and more than a little simplistic.
The Adam Project debuts on Netflix on March 11.

     The Adam Project Feels Like a Fake Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Doane Gregory/NetflixThe Adam Project doesn’t feel like a real movie.
And the strangest thing is that The Adam Project seems to know this.
Shawn Levy, the director of Free Guy, is also the man behind The Adam Project, and the two films do share an almost psychotic, all-you-can-eat derivativeness.
I assure you that The Adam Project does not answer any of them.
When the two Adams meet, the older Adam assures us that the younger Adam is annoying as hell.
