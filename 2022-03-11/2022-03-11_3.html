     Summary: He referred to her as “little sister,” even though she was several years older.
Little sister Bobbie died March 10 at age 91 surrounded by her family, which makes sense: Willie called his band Willie and Family.
Nearly 50 years ago, Willie had Bobbie play on his “Shotgun Willie” album and she joined the touring band soon after that.
They simply don’t sound the same without little sister doing what she does.
But its core, its most essential core, was a little brother and his little sister.
