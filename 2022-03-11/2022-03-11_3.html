     Deshaun Watson Won’t Face Criminal Charges in Houston Cases, Grand Jury Decides
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grand jury proceedings take place behind closed doors, and Stallings did not answer any questions nor did she say which charges were considered.
As part of the proceedings, grand jurors were shown footage from the videotaped interviews the complainants had given to police.
As the grand jury met, Watson sat for depositions in two of the lawsuits, about a mile away from the courthouse at the downtown skyscraper that houses the offices of his lawyer, Rusty Hardin.
Shortly after the grand jury’s decision Friday afternoon, Watson made his first public remarks about the case since posting a statement to Twitter in March a year ago.
Depositions for two more lawsuits were scheduled for Tuesday, and Hardin said that with the grand jury investigation over Watson would not invoke his Fifth Amendment right.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Y’all know well by now that David Tepper, owner of the Carolina Panthers, wants nothing more than he wants Deshaun Watson under center for his team this season.
The only reason Watson isn’t a Panther today is because nobody was desperate enough to trade for the embattled quarterback while he was facing 22 civil suits alleging sexual assault as well as 10 criminal complaints.
A grand jury convened today and declined to indict Watson on criminal changes.
For now, we just want to ask you what your initial opinion is about a potential Watson trade.
Dream up any cost or scenario you want based on the facts that we have at hand today:Do you want Deshaun Watson to be a Carolina Panther?

     Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson completes first two sessions of depositions in lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON -- Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has completed his first two sessions of depositions as part of the 22 lawsuits filed against him, ESPN confirmed Friday.
His attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously told ESPN his client would assert his Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate himself during his testimony until the criminal investigation had concluded.
Hardin told ESPN in July that 10 women had filed complaints with Houston police about Watson.
Eight of the women have also filed lawsuits against Watson with allegations ranging from sexual assault to harassment during massage sessions.
While the depositions were taking place, a grand jury sat in a Houston courthouse less than a mile away, hearing evidence about criminal complaints to determine whether Watson will face criminal charges.

     Summary: Deshaun Watson did not say much in the first two depositions on Friday.
The long-awaited deposition of Deshaun Watson began Friday, with the first two of 22 total depositions being carried out.
Less than a mile away, a grand jury met to discuss if Watson would face any criminal charges.
While it was reported in the last update that all of the accusations were civil lawsuits, they could still turn into criminal charges.
But that grand jury ruled that Watson will not face criminal charges- news that broke during the writing of this article.

     Seahawks linked to Deshaun Watson after QB avoids criminal charges in sexual assault investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The path for the Seahawks — and any other team in the NFL — to acquire Deshaun Watson became clearer Friday when a grand jury in Houston declined to indict him on sexual assault and harassment charges.
But initial reports are that many teams are expected to immediately look into trading for Watson, including the Seahawks.
AdvertisingRapoport said the Panthers “have been wanting Deshaun Watson for basically a year’’ and are now expected to pursue him aggressively.
Rapoport also mentioned the Seahawks and Eagles as possible suitors for Watson.
Houston, which is in full rebuild mode, also will unquestionably shoot for the moon in what it can get for Watson.

     Grand jury declines to indict Texans QB Deshaun Watson following allegations of sexual misconduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Harris County (Texas) grand jury did not find enough evidence to charge Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson following allegations of sexual misconduct stemming from massage therapy sessions.
"Grand jury proceedings are secret by law, so no information related to their inquiry may be disclosed."
Friday's hearing comes less than one year from the filing of the first two lawsuits for indecent conduct against Watson.
"We are delighted that the grand jury has looked at the matter thoroughly and reached the same conclusion we did.
Watson requested to be traded from the Texans prior to the allegations, and he was inactive for all 17 of the Texans' games during the 2021 NFL season.
