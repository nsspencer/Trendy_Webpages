     Deshaun Watson Won’t Face Criminal Charges in Houston Cases, Grand Jury Decides
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grand jury proceedings take place behind closed doors, and Stallings did not answer any questions nor did she say which charges were considered.
As the grand jury met, Watson sat for depositions in two of the lawsuits, about a mile away from the courthouse at the downtown skyscraper that houses the offices of his lawyer, Rusty Hardin.
Hardin said in a statement that he was “delighted” that the grand jury declined to indict Watson.
“Deshaun Watson did not commit any crimes and is not guilty of any offenses,” Hardin said.
He added that Watson’s defense was prepared for the civil lawsuits.

     Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson completes first two sessions of depositions in lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON -- Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has completed his first two sessions of depositions as part of the 22 lawsuits filed against him, ESPN confirmed Friday.
His attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously told ESPN his client would assert his Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate himself during his testimony until the criminal investigation had concluded.
Hardin told ESPN in July that 10 women had filed complaints with Houston police about Watson.
Eight of the women have also filed lawsuits against Watson with allegations ranging from sexual assault to harassment during massage sessions.
While the depositions were taking place, a grand jury sat in a Houston courthouse less than a mile away, hearing evidence about criminal complaints to determine whether Watson will face criminal charges.

     Summary: Deshaun Watson did not say much in the first two depositions on Friday.
The long-awaited deposition of Deshaun Watson began Friday, with the first two of 22 total depositions being carried out.
Less than a mile away, a grand jury met to discuss if Watson would face any criminal charges.
While it was reported in the last update that all of the accusations were civil lawsuits, they could still turn into criminal charges.
But that grand jury ruled that Watson will not face criminal charges- news that broke during the writing of this article.

     Grand jury declines to charge Deshaun Watson after 22 women accuse quarterback of sexual misconduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Texas grand jury on Friday declined to indict and criminally charge Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by multiple women.
"After a Harris County grand jury was presented all the evidence and had the opportunity to hear from all witnesses, grand jurors declined to indict Deshaun Watson," Dane Schiller, spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, said Friday.
"Grand jury proceedings are secret by law, so no information related to their inquiry may be disclosed."
All 22 of the civil plaintiffs are represented by Houston attorney Tony Buzbee, who said eight of his clients were slated to testify before the grand jury.
Watson, through Hardin, has always maintained his innocence and denied he's committed any acts of sexual misconduct.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The grand jury’s decision essentially means he won’t face criminal charges in this case unless the grand jury revisits it with new evidence.
"Grand jury proceedings are secret by law, so no information related to their inquiry may be disclosed."
The grand jury heard nine cases against him but declined to indict on each.
Buzbee confirmed that Friday and noted that the the criminal case is separate from the civil cases.
"The criminal case doesn’t impact the civil case result," Buzbee said Friday.

     Grand jury declines to indict Texans QB Deshaun Watson following allegations of sexual misconduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Harris County (Texas) grand jury did not find enough evidence to charge Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson following allegations of sexual misconduct stemming from massage therapy sessions.
"Grand jury proceedings are secret by law, so no information related to their inquiry may be disclosed."
Friday's hearing comes less than one year from the filing of the first two lawsuits for indecent conduct against Watson.
"We are delighted that the grand jury has looked at the matter thoroughly and reached the same conclusion we did.
Watson requested to be traded from the Texans prior to the allegations, and he was inactive for all 17 of the Texans' games during the 2021 NFL season.
