     Grimes and Chelsea Manning are Reportedly Dating
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not hard to find a better romantic partner than Elon “Redpilled” Musk, but we’re glad to hear Grimes has traded way up — at least, we’re pretty sure she did.
According to an exclusive in Page Six, the New York Post’s infamous gossip wing, the singer and musician has ditched her billionaire boyfriend Musk for the waiting arms of a very different suitor: notorious whistleblower and activist Chelsea Manning.
Citing an anonymous source claiming to be close with Manning and/or Grimes, Page Six reported that the pair “U-Hauled it” in the grand lesbian tradition and are now living together in Austin, Texas (though Manning still has her Brooklyn apartment).
Page Six also points to various Twitter interactions the two have shared in the last few months, mainly Manning replying to Grimes’ posts with the word “vouch” — though Grimes herself also said she’s “taking [her] word as final these days,” which certainly could indicate some escalating passions.
(It does, however, confirm that Grimes has a Type, and that type is “perennially controversial tech nerds.”)It’s none of our business, and we’re sure Grimes and Manning will reveal whether they’re really dating in their own time — but frankly we still ship it, and we’ll hold out a little hope that Grimes can now safely call herself “anti-imperialist” once again.

     Grimes Is Reportedly Dating Whistleblower Chelsea Manning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Page Six, the 33-year-old singer is now romantically involved with military whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
Sources tell the outlet the two didn’t waste any time before “getting serious” and have been living together in Austin.
News of the alleged relationship came just a day after Vanity Fair published a cover feature in which Grimes revealed she had welcomed a second child with Elon Musk.
It’s unclear how Grimes and Manning were introduced; however, Page Six points out they’ve had multiple vague interactions on social media.
Manning rose to international prominence more than a decade ago, when she leaked a trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks.

     Summary: They U-Hauled it,” a source told Page Six about the fast-moving relationship of Grimes and Manning, both 34.“They’ve been living together in Austin.”Neither Grimes nor Manning returned Page Six’s requests for comments.
Among other things, Manning “liked” multiple tweets having to do with Grimes, Page Six said.
That includes the announcement of the singer’s Vanity Fair cover story, which was published Thursday morning.
The Vanity Fair story also said that Grimes relocated from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, presumably to be closer to Musk.
But that was around the time of their daughter’s birth, and Grimes told Vanity Fair how she would probably refer to him as her boyfriend.

     Summary: Grimes performs on Day 3 of the Osheaga Music and Art Festival at Parc Jean-Drapeau on July 31, 2016 ... [+]6 in Montreal, Canada.
Grimes’ dramatic, unexpected switch from Musk to Manning had the internet wondering if perhaps Musk had a point.
In her Vanity Fair profile, Grimes has described her and Musk’s lifestyle as, at times, living “below the poverty line,” claiming that Musk “wouldn’t even get a new mattress.
A lot of people are understandably upset.”After the profile was released, Grimes clarified her politics on Twitter, writing:“I am not a capitalist democrat.
If reality really is a simulation, Grimes might just be a glitch in the Matrix.
