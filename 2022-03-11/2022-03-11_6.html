    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Penn State outrebounded Ohio State 29-28 and swiped six steals compared to the Buckeyes’ two.
Liddell said the Nittany Lions played hard en route to overcoming a 13-point deficit.
They just played harder.”Last season, Ohio State won three conference tournament games, two by four points or fewer and one in overtime.
This season, injuries and fatigue marred Ohio State to an early exit, and head coach Chris Holtmann said physicality overcame the Buckeyes Thursday.
Now less than a week before the national tournament, Ohio State has a bit more time off than it has recently.

Ohio State may very well answer the questions two weeks from now.
The Ohio State basketball standard shouldn’t be exciting moments early in the season, followed by disappointing flameouts in March.

     Ohio State basketball: Takeaways from surprising loss to Penn State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 16, 2022; Columbus, Ohio, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions guard Jalen Pickett (22) moves to the basket against Ohio State Buckeyes guard Malaki Branham (22) during the first half at Value City Arena.
Mandatory Credit: Joseph Maiorana-USA TODAY SportsThe Ohio State basketball team fell to 11-seed Penn State in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament despite leading by double digits in the second half.
Even without Zed Key and Kyle Young, Ohio State was expected to advance before losing 71-68 to one of the lesser programs in the conference.
Ohio State stopped getting good shots and were forcing the ball into the post even when double teams were constantly rotating over.
There’s no way that Penn State should have been able to climb back into the game but Ohio State has made a habit of doing so recently.

     Ohio State's Holtmann: "We're Not Where We Need To Be Defensively"
    </h2>

     Summary: The Nittany Lions used a 19-7 second-half run to beat the Buckeyes, who went nearly seven minutes without a basket.
A really, really tough and physical game,” head coach Chris Holtmann said during his postgame press conference.
“We beat this guys two times earlier, and if you remember, Kyle Young played a major role in both those games,” Holtmann said.
“I thought we played as hard tonight as we’ve played in a couple weeks.
“We’ve got a week to prepare and get ready for whoever we play,” fifth-year senior guard Cedric Russell said.
