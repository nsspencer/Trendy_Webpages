     Grimes Is Reportedly Dating Whistleblower Chelsea Manning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Page Six, the 33-year-old singer is now romantically involved with military whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
Sources tell the outlet the two didn’t waste any time before “getting serious” and have been living together in Austin.
News of the alleged relationship came just a day after Vanity Fair published a cover feature in which Grimes revealed she had welcomed a second child with Elon Musk.
It’s unclear how Grimes and Manning were introduced; however, Page Six points out they’ve had multiple vague interactions on social media.
Manning rose to international prominence more than a decade ago, when she leaked a trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks.

Among other things, Manning “liked” multiple tweets having to do with Grimes, Page Six said.
That includes the announcement of the singer’s Vanity Fair cover story, which was published Thursday morning.
The Vanity Fair story also said that Grimes relocated from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, presumably to be closer to Musk.
But that was around the time of their daughter’s birth, and Grimes told Vanity Fair how she would probably refer to him as her boyfriend.

The Fifty Shades of Grey star recalled being at the wedding of two complete strangers, who were quite confused to see her.
"There I was, holding up the bride and groom in a chair, and they were just like, 'Who … what are you doing here?'"
She's far from alone in this passion, though, as Andrew Garfield, Ariana DeBose, and Simon Rex all put down a finger, and Rex recounted his own anecdote.
"I looked down off the balcony, and there was a wedding going on, and I'm like, 'That looks like fun,'" he said.

Grimes’ dramatic, unexpected switch from Musk to Manning had the internet wondering if perhaps Musk had a point.
In her Vanity Fair profile, Grimes has described her and Musk’s lifestyle as, at times, living “below the poverty line,” claiming that Musk “wouldn’t even get a new mattress.
A lot of people are understandably upset.”After the profile was released, Grimes clarified her politics on Twitter, writing:“I am not a capitalist democrat.
If reality really is a simulation, Grimes might just be a glitch in the Matrix.

     Is Grimes dating whistleblower Chelsea Manning? Source claims singer has moved on from Elon Musk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's ex-girlfriend Grimes has reportedly already moved on from their relationship with an unlikely new romantic partner: military whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
It does not appear that Grimes has ever tweeted directly to Manning, nor have the two ever been pictured publicly together.
DailyMail.com has reached out to Manning and a spokesperson for Grimes, neither of whom have returned requests for comment.
Manning (pictured in 2013) became a person of notoriety back in 2010 when she was jailed for breaking the Espionage Act after leaking a trove of documents to Wikileaks.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, came out as transgender days after she was sentenced in 2013.
