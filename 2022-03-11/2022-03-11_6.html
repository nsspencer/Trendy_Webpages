     Ohio State basketball: Takeaways from surprising loss to Penn State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 16, 2022; Columbus, Ohio, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions guard Jalen Pickett (22) moves to the basket against Ohio State Buckeyes guard Malaki Branham (22) during the first half at Value City Arena.
Mandatory Credit: Joseph Maiorana-USA TODAY SportsThe Ohio State basketball team fell to 11-seed Penn State in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament despite leading by double digits in the second half.
Even without Zed Key and Kyle Young, Ohio State was expected to advance before losing 71-68 to one of the lesser programs in the conference.
Ohio State stopped getting good shots and were forcing the ball into the post even when double teams were constantly rotating over.
There’s no way that Penn State should have been able to climb back into the game but Ohio State has made a habit of doing so recently.
