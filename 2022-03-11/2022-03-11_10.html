     Arkansas basketball charges past LSU, advances to SEC Tournament semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA, Fla. — The last game between Arkansas basketball and LSU must have been too close for the Razorbacks' comfort.
4 seed Arkansas dominated No.
5 seed LSU in the second half for a 79-67 quarterfinal win.
LSU dominated Arkansas on the offensive glass in the last meeting with LSU, but Arkansas made sure it didn't happen again.
In addition to holding LSU without a field goal for almost five minutes to start the second half, Arkansas contained the Tigers' leading scorers well.

     LSU Can't Find a Rhythm in 79-67 Loss to Arkansas in SEC Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the story of the Tigers 2021-22 season in their SEC tournament quarterfinal matchup against the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Starting the game off strong, but struggling in the second half, the Tigers just couldn’t get things going down the stretch in 79-67 loss.
With neither team getting into a rhythm, shooting under 30% from the field and 20% from three in the half, no team was willing to give up an inch.
“We didn’t make a basket for the first four minutes of the second half,” Wade said.
Fighting until the very end against a fiery Arkansas squad, this LSU team is poised to come back strong to make a run during the Big Dance.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tigers had a perfect opportunity to boost their NCAA Tournament resume in Tampa on Friday at the SEC Tournament.
LSU drew a third matchup of the season against the Arkansas Razorbacks, one of the hottest teams in the country with a No.
20 ranking in the NET and consensus projection as a top-four seed in March Madness.
But, similar to the way the previous two matchups against the Razorbacks played out, LSU was on the losing end when the final buzzer sounded.
With a 79-67 loss, the Tigers missed out on what would have been their seventh Quadrant 1 win of the season despite spending much of the first half in the lead.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fueled by the perceived slight, the 15th-ranked Razorbacks delivered their most- lopsided victory in three games against LSU, a 79-67 victory that sent Arkansas to the semifinals of the Southeastern Conference Tournament.
No one would be surprised to see Arkansas make the tournament final for the first time since 2017.
The Hogs had one more reason to get up for this one: LSU knocked them out of the SEC tourney a year ago in Nashville, Tennessee.
The Tigers missed their first five shots and couldn’t stop the run despite Wade calling two timeouts.
Arkansas: The Razorbacks have been the league’s hottest team for the last two months, thanks mostly to Notae and Williams.
