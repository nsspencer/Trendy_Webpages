     Rivian Stock Slumps After Earnings. Wall Street Says Buy the Dip Of Course.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If we learned anything from Rivian Automotive earnings and the reaction of the stock, it’s that the company’s production ramp-up isn’t happening fast enough for the market.
Wall Street analysts have their concerns too, but they still like the stock—a lot.
The Street is sticking with its Buy call, even though they are revisiting what shares are worth.
Rivian (ticker: RIVN) reported a wider loss from fewer sales than expected for the fourth quarter of 2021.

     Rivian Posts $2.5B Loss, Warns Supply Issues to Limit '22 Output
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Upstart Tesla rival Rivan said supply chain challenges will limit its 2022 output to around 25,000 vehicles, around half of its prior forecast.
Rivian Automotive (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive, Inc. Class A Report shares fell sharply Friday after the upstart EV maker warned that supply chain issues would halve its 2022 production forecasts following a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss of $2.5 billion.
"These challenges have been exacerbated given the state of our global supply chain, tight labor market and of course the complications from COVID."
"The good news is we do not believe any of our supply chain challenges represent long-term systemic issues," he added.
Rivian shares were marked 10.9% lower in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $36.67 each.

     Why Rivian Stock Hit the Skids Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rivian management, though, admitted it was a mistake to apply that move to its already-committed pre-order customers.
That explanation, however, failed to improve the mood of the market, more so because Rivian also failed to deliver on the metrics that matter.
Rivian reported a net loss of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up from a loss of $353 million in the prior-year period as operating expenses spiraled.
In short, Rivian is accumulating billions of dollars in losses and burning through billions of dollars in cash to just deliver its first vehicles.
Suddenly, Rivian no longer looks like the hot and hyped EV company that debuted last year, and investors may be realizing there are better EV stocks they could bet on.

     Rivian Stock: Cash Is Now 50% Of Market Cap (NASDAQ:RIVN)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I recommend that investors concentrate solely on Rivian Automotive's long-term potential in the electric-vehicle market and its high cash-to-market-capitalization ratio.
Rivian Automotive's stock fell as much as 12% on Friday, but recovered some of its losses later in the day.
Rivian Automotive currently has a market capitalization of $37 billion, implying that cash and cash equivalents account for roughly half of the company's market value.
Consolidated Balance Sheet (Rivian Automotive)High Levels Of Cash Limit RisksWith nearly half of Rivian Automotive's market valuation locked up in cash, the stock's risk at this point is extremely low, even though operational headwinds should not be overlooked.
Rivian Automotive is currently one of the best deals in the EV industry due to its high cash value relative to market capitalization.

     Rivian’s Stock Is Hitting New Lows After Weak Earnings—But Analysts Still Predict A Rebound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineShares of Rivian tumbled 7% Friday after the electric-vehicle maker reported lackluster quarterly earnings and warned that supply chain issues would limit vehicle production in 2022, but despite struggling since going public last year, analysts still love the stock and remain optimistic about a rebound.
Rivian shares are down over 60% this year, but analysts aren’t giving up on the stock just yet.
Rivian told investors that it plans to produce just 25,000 electric trucks and SUVs this year amid ongoing supply chain disruptions, while Wall Street analysts had been hoping for closer to 40,000 vehicles.
Big Number: $18.4 BillionRivian is still well positioned financially, reporting $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents as of the year-end.
Despite slashing his price target for Rivian stock to $60 per share from $130, Ives remains confident that the Rivian story is “fixable” and shares will eventually rebound.
