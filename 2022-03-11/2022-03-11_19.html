     Missouri Anti-Abortion Bill Sows Confusion Over Ectopic Pregnancies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But one Missouri bill in particular is drawing ire for criminalizing the use of certain drugs to treat ectopic pregnancies, which are not viable and potentially life-threatening.
Here's a quick rundown on the medical issues associated with the condition and how it fits into the current abortion debate.
Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube or anywhere else outside of the uterus.
They occur in about 1 of every 30,000 spontaneous pregnancies, or 1 of 100 pregnancies for women receiving fertility treatments, according to data from the Mayo Clinic.
If left untreated, they can rupture internal tissue, cause heavy bleeding and pose a significant mortality risk.

     In Missouri, a New Bill Would Make Aborting an Ectopic Pregnancy Illegal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A provision of the bill notes that transferring abortifacient devices or drugs would be considered a criminal act even if the abortion was induced to end an ectopic pregnancy.
For those unfamiliar, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus (most often, in the fallopian tube).
An ectopic pregnancy is not viable; the fertilized egg cannot survive on its own, and the growing tissue can cause life-threatening bleeding in the pregnant person if left untreated.
I would like to see that sort of unlawful activity stopped.” (For the record, ectopic pregnancies cannot be detected from a mere physical examination, and must be diagnosed via blood test or ultrasound.)
The consequences of this bill would be dire for pregnant people in Missouri if the state’s governor signs it into law.

     Missouri bill seeks to ban terminating life-threatening ectopic pregnancies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Missouri state Rep. Brian Seitz (R) introduced a bill in the state House that would ban the termination of ectopic pregnancies.
ADVERTISEMENTEctopic pregnancies comprise roughly 1 to 2 percent of all U.S. pregnancies, according to a 2020 study published by American Family Physician.
Missouri state Rep. Keri Ingle (D) pointed out that Seitz's bill would criminalize those devices or drugs used to treat ectopic pregnancies, according to Newsweek.
Ingle said that very "pro-life" people she knew had undergone treatment to terminate ectopic pregnancies and would be "horribly offended by the language in the bill," Newsweek reported.
"They don't have the hospital machinery to tell if this is an ectopic pregnancy," Seitz said to Newsweek.

     Missouri Republican Proposes Antiabortion Bill That Would Literally Kill Pregnant People

     Summary: When they propose antiabortion laws that could literally kill the pregnant women, as was the case in Missouri this week.
For those who are unaware, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside of the main part of the uterus.
Unfortunately for the women of Missouri, Seitz apparently has no idea how modern medicine works.
“They don’t have the hospital machinery to tell if this is an ectopic pregnancy,” Seitz falsely claimed.
Banning any provision of care related to ectopic pregnancies will put people’s lives at risk."

     Missouri bill proposes making abortion of ectopic pregnancy a felony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It would also make it a felony to perform, induce or attempt an abortion on a woman with ectopic pregnancy.
According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an ectopic pregnancy “occurs when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus.
Lawmakers are on their spring recess next week, with the bill due back in committee March 22.
In committee testimony, Planned Parenthood said the bill could have “chilling effect” on manufacturers of products and medications used in both abortion procedures and labor and delivery.
This bill could make it impossible for Missourians to access these medications for any reason,” the organization said in testimony.

     A Missouri bill could make it illegal to treat ectopic pregnancies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, Missouri legislators held a public hearing on a bill that would make it a felony to "perform or induce an abortion" to treat an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancies never result in a baby and can be fatal if left untreated.
The language in Seitz's bill echoes a misunderstanding of what ectopic pregnancy is, and isn't, and that's what has people concerned.
Ectopic pregnancies are 100% non-viable, and if allowed or forced to continue would result in organ rupture, severe internal bleeding, possible infertility and even death.
"They do believe that this would perhaps bar them from being able to treat ectopic pregnancies," she added.
