     Free Guy's Shawn Levy to direct Deadpool 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The love fest currently running between Free Guy and The Adam Project director Shawn Levy and star Ryan Reynolds has reached a new milestone today, as THR reports that Levy has been tapped to step in as director on the upcoming, Marvel-produced Deadpool 3.
Most notably, Deadpool director Tim Miller (who’d managed to score a major hit with his directing debut) left the second film, reportedly over creative differences with Reynolds.
“Creative differences” does not appear to be a problem, as yet, between Reynolds and Levy, though; Reynolds has starred in Levy’s last two films, the video game-set Free Guy, and this week’s new Netflix time travel movie The Adam Project.
The big question looming over Deadpool 3, of course, is how far Disney will be willing to go with it.
Even his “adult” comedies, like Tina Fey and Steve Car ell’s Date Night, tend to be on the tamer side.

     ‘Deadpool 3’: Shawn Levy to Direct Ryan Reynolds in Marvel Movie (Exclusive)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds attend the opening night of "The Music Man" on Broadway at Winter Garden Theatre on February 10, 2022 in New York City.
Shawn Levy has been tapped — or maybe it should be targeted — to direct Deadpool 3.
The director is in negotiations to team up with star Ryan Reynolds for the Marvel property, after previously collaborating on 20th Century’s pandemic-era hit Free Guy and the just-released sci-fi adventure movie The Adam Project on Netflix.
The Deadpool films are the top-grossing X-Men films of all time, with the original earning $783.1 million, and the sequel bringing in $785.8 million at the worldwide box office.
Those shows include Daredevil and Punisher, which, along with Deadpool, are the most mature Marvel content in the Disney fold.

     Ryan Reynolds Reveals That Shawn Levy is Directing 'Deadpool 3' With Hilarious Poster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deadpool 3 has been in development for years now and today the superhero film finally took a major step forward with the announcement that Shawn Levy would be directing the project.
This choice in director is significant given that star Ryan Reynolds has worked with Levy on last year’s hit comedy Free Guy and The Adam Project.
Reynolds shared a photo of his characters from his two Levy films, Adam Reed(The Adam Project) and Guy(Free Guy), with Deadpool.
Levy has built quite a career in over two decades directing films like Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther, the Night of the Museum trilogy, Free Guy, and The Adam Project.
It is great seeing how much Reynolds and Levy have bonded over their last two projects.
