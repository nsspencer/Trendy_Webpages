Per Wrestling Inc. on Twitter, Big E was giving fans a thumbs-up in the arena as he was being taken to the locker room on a stretcher.
Sheamus and Holland destroyed the ATV that Big E received as a gift from his New Day cohort on last week's SmackDown.
An official timetable for Big E's recovery has not yet been established.
