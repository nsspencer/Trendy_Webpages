     Summary: Scotty Pippen Jr. didn’t blink Wednesday when delivering a line that would loom large over the 24 hours to come.
Calling the Crimson Tide “beatable” and the team they wanted to see in Tampa was a message that didn’t take long to travel two blocks to the Alabama team hotel.
“I didn’t know anything about that,” Oats said when asked about the possibility of a staffer saying something to Pippen.
Pippen and coach Jerry Stackhouse felt like they gave one away to Alabama that night and wanted revenge.
“Me and Coach Stackhouse were just talking about that,” he said with a grin.

     Vanderbilt gets shot at Kentucky in SEC quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "They're a very beatable team, a team we wanted to play," Vanderbilt's star said.
Combined with six 3-pointers and 18 points from Myles Stute, it was enough to enable Vanderbilt (17-15) to overcome a 15-point second-half deficit.
While the Commodores finished 11th in the SEC, Pippen has mostly lived up to billing as the preseason SEC Player of the Year.
Vanderbilt coach Jerry Stackhouse, whose team clinched a winning record with the result, saluted his players' perseverance.
Tshiebwe ended the season averaging 17.3 points and 15.3 rebounds per game; the latter figure easily leads Division I.
