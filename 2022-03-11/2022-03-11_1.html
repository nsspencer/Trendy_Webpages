     Late-Winter Storm Set to Sweep Across the U.S. Into Saturday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sprawling, late-season winter storm was forecast to bring a mixed bag of precipitation across a wide stretch of the United States through Saturday, raising concerns about hazardous driving conditions and scattered power failures, meteorologists said on Friday.
About 20 million people from Tennessee up through Maine were under some sort of winter weather alert, according to the National Weather Service.
The interior Northeast was expected to get the worst of the storm.
“It’s a pretty impressive storm system,” Matthew Clay, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Burlington, Vt., said on Friday.
“For interior New England, we’re expecting pretty much a widespread seven to 14 inches of snow.”Snow may fall in some places at a rate of one to two inches per hour and may combine with winds of up to 50 miles per hour, leading to “blowing and drifting snow even after the snow ends,” the service’s Weather Prediction Center warned on Twitter on Friday afternoon.

     Winter Storm Warning covers most of state
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The National Weather Service has placed most of West Virginia under a winter storm warning beginning early Saturday morning with several inches of snow expected.
Preston County is also in the warned area along with the southern coalfields.
“We’ll have gusts 15 to 20 miles-per-hour for much of the state and then toward the eastern half of the state into the mountains we’re looking at gusts of up to 30 miles-per-hour,” Wawrin said.
Wawrin said it will get into the mid-40s Sunday, melting some of the snow in the lowlands.
The storm is a reminder that winter is still around, Wawrin said.

     Summary: HUNTINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - As of 6 p.m., snow was falling steadily and already accumulating from Cleveland to Dayton-Cincinnati to Louisville and Paducah.
That means later tonight we will be in on snowfall rates of ½”-1″ per hour.
An upgrade from a winter storm watch to a warning is prominently highlighted on the I-64 marquee through Huntington.
Saturday’s howling winds will add a deep wind chill to the dress code for kids heading out sledding.
Plan on 3″-6″ of snow with 3″ more likely at the valley floor and 5″ or 6″ on the hills around our towns.
