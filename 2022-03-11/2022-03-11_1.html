Preston County is also in the warned area along with the southern coalfields.
“We’ll have gusts 15 to 20 miles-per-hour for much of the state and then toward the eastern half of the state into the mountains we’re looking at gusts of up to 30 miles-per-hour,” Wawrin said.
Wawrin said it will get into the mid-40s Sunday, melting some of the snow in the lowlands.
