     Summary: CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The National Weather Service has placed most of West Virginia under a winter storm warning beginning early Saturday morning with several inches of snow expected.
Preston County is also in the warned area along with the southern coalfields.
“We’ll have gusts 15 to 20 miles-per-hour for much of the state and then toward the eastern half of the state into the mountains we’re looking at gusts of up to 30 miles-per-hour,” Wawrin said.
Wawrin said it will get into the mid-40s Sunday, melting some of the snow in the lowlands.
