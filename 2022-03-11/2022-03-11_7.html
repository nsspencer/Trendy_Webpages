     5 takeaways from LSU's loss to Arkansas in SEC Tournament quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tigers had a perfect opportunity to boost their NCAA Tournament resume in Tampa on Friday at the SEC Tournament.
LSU drew a third matchup of the season against the Arkansas Razorbacks, one of the hottest teams in the country with a No.
20 ranking in the NET and consensus projection as a top-four seed in March Madness.
But, similar to the way the previous two matchups against the Razorbacks played out, LSU was on the losing end when the final buzzer sounded.
With a 79-67 loss, the Tigers missed out on what would have been their seventh Quadrant 1 win of the season despite spending much of the first half in the lead.

     LSU Can't Find a Rhythm in 79-67 Loss to Arkansas in SEC Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the story of the Tigers 2021-22 season in their SEC tournament quarterfinal matchup against the Arkansas Razorbacks.
Starting the game off strong, but struggling in the second half, the Tigers just couldn’t get things going down the stretch in 79-67 loss.
With neither team getting into a rhythm, shooting under 30% from the field and 20% from three in the half, no team was willing to give up an inch.
“We didn’t make a basket for the first four minutes of the second half,” Wade said.
Fighting until the very end against a fiery Arkansas squad, this LSU team is poised to come back strong to make a run during the Big Dance.
