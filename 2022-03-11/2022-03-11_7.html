AU has lost three times in the last month after losing just once in the first 23 games.
Fly War Eagle has the Odds and TV Channel for the matchup while laying down a prediction for the 11am central ESPN matchup:Auburn basketball vs Texas A&amp;M Odds: Spread, Over/UnderThe #3 Tigers visit the 21-11 Aggies today at 11AM EST on ESPN.
WynnBET has the Tigers as 9-point favorites (bet $110 to win $100) while the over-under is set at 140.5.
Auburn vs Texas A&amp;M PredictionNine points is a fairly high number for a neutral court matchup between divisional rivals in a Power Five conference, but Las Vegas was clearly valuing the teams’ first matchup when coming up with this number.

     Instant takeaways from Auburn's shocking quarterfinals loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Auburn only got to ride the high of its regular-season SEC championship for just six days.
The Tigers fought valiantly after going down big in the first half, but still eventually dropped their first game of the SEC tournament 67-62 to the Texas A&amp;M Aggies despite being second in odds to win the entire tournament.
The game comes as a disappointment for Auburn and SEC Coach of the Year Bruce Pearl, and it’ll set its sights on the NCAA tournament as Texas A&amp;M will move on.
Auburn will lick their wounds and prepare for their upcoming first-round game.

BUZZ WILLIAMS: “I don’t think that as effective as 13 is in the paint; I think 0 had over 300 field goal attempts.
I don’t know where you would rank us from a talent perspective in the SEC, but it would be in the bottom half.
I just don’t know that you can evaluate the heart and the character and the fabric and the fight.
I don’t know if I’m supposed to say that or not, or if Nashville and Tampa are in, you know, some sort of issue there.
