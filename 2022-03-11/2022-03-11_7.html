     Summary: Bobbie Nelson, a country music pioneer and Willie Nelson's sister, dies at age 91Enlarge this image toggle caption Rich Fury/Invision/AP Rich Fury/Invision/APCountry music pioneer Bobbie Lee Nelson — the sister of Willie Nelson, and a vaunted pianist in her own right — died Thursday at age 91.
Born Jan. 1, 1931, Bobbie Nelson learned to play the piano by reading four-part shape-note harmonies in hymn books.
In his 2015 autobiography, It's a Long Story: My Life, Willie Nelson wrote: "Bobbie became accomplished at an early age.
