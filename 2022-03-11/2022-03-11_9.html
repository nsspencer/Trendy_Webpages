     Men’s Basketball: UConn locks up on defense in double-digit win over Seton Hall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UConn defeats Seaton Hall 62-52 at Madison Square Garden in front of a sold out crowd, March 10, 2022.
The University of Connecticut was able to stick to their brand of basketball as they focused on their defensive identity to move on to round two in the Big East Tournament, defeating Seton Hall 62-52.
Seton Hall couldn’t truly break through on offense.
Even Kadary Richmond, who triumphed over UConn earlier in the season with a 27-point performance, was held to just 14 points in the Seton Hall loss.
Despite UConn’s huge scoring nights from the seniors, the stat sheet didn’t do enough to address the impact of sophomore Andre Jackson.

     Takeaways from UConn men’s basketball’s Big East Tournament win over Seton Hall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UConn men’s basketball has reached the Big East Tournament Semifinals for the second-straight season after a dominant 62-52 win over Seton Hall on Thursday night.
Here are some takeaways from the Huskies’ first tournament win of the season.
The Huskies held Seton Hall to just 18 first half points, the Pirates’ lowest total of the season.
Isaiah Whaley controlled the area around the rim with four of UConn’s seven blocks, and Andre Jackson seemingly covered everything else, deflecting countless passes and disrupting any chance of any Seton Hall comebacks.
But Villanova is frustratingly good at drawing contact, and UConn’s physicality that made life difficult for Seton Hall could be a problem tonight.

     UConn men's basketball fans swarm the Big East Tournament for the first time in a decade: ‘It’s like a madhouse’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It’s a ton of fun, especially for UConn fans because it’s like a madhouse,” Brimecombe said Thursday as they rode a Metro-North train to the game.
It was the first Big East Tournament game either attended, though Fazzina said the trip felt like an overdue reunion.
“The American Conference was never the same level as the Big East, either in competitiveness or history,” Fazzina said.
Lawson, who described himself as a “Big East basketball fan,” said the trip to the Garden also fulfilled a long-time wish.
“It’s going to be great, it’s going to be loud, there’s going to be a lot of UConn fans there tonight,” Zyskowski said.
