     Penn State Basketball: How to beat Purdue in the Big Ten Quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Penn State Basketball faces off against the number three seed Purdue Boilermakers tonight in the Big Ten Tournament Quarterfinals.
Penn State Basketball finds itself just three wins from the unlikeliest of NCAA Tournament berths thanks to Thursday night’s upset win over the Ohio State Buckeyes.
Penn State Basketball hosted Purdue back in January and played them hard, eventually falling 74-67 to the then number three team in the nation.
Since the only way to continue this season is a victory tonight against Purdue, we ask the important question.
How does Penn State Basketball beat the Purdue Boilermakers?

     #9 Purdue vs Penn St. - Big Ten Tournament Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The odds will be stacked Penn State in a rematch of a game Penn State lost at home by 7 points in early January.
In their only regular season match up, Purdue went into Penn State and won 74-67.
Fast forward two months and Penn State has still struggled to win games, but they found a formula against Ohio State.
Their offense, Coach Shrewsberry’s offense, is a beautiful orchestration of hard off ball action, high pick and rolls, constant ball movement, and attacking mismatches.
Instead, any night, a handful of Penn State players can go off, using pick and rolls and isolating against smaller guards.
