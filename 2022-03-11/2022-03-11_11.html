     Hot Stove's burning question: Where will Correa sign?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stroman, Kyle Hendricks, and Wade Miley rely on strong infield defense to a greater extent than many modern starting pitchers.
Correa, the reigning American League Platinum Glove Award winner, could impact the Cubs’ run prevention as much as their lineup.
Nico Hoerner, the top internal candidate to be the Cubs’ primary shortstop in 2022, started only 12 games at the position last season and might be best suited for a multi-position role.

     Carlos Correa Unloading $1.6 Mil Houston Mansion Amid MLB Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB star Carlos Correa is selling his Houston mansion just days away from his official departure from the Astros -- and TMZ Sports has confirmed he's hoping to get $1.6 MILLION for the pad.
The free agent shortstop -- who's expected to ink a deal with a new MLB team at some point in the next few days -- just listed the place ... and it's SUPER nice.
The place is kind of famous too -- Correa's often posted on his social media page with his wife from the yard.
But, with no return to the Astros in sight, Correa is clearly looking to unload the home and grab a new place in his next baseball city.
It'll be a sad goodbye -- both because Correa's home was a beautiful one and because he had a hell of a career in Houston.

     Report reveals new details about what Detroit Tigers offered Carlos Correa before signing Javier Baez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa #1 of the Houston Astros while playing the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park on June 24, 2021 in Detroit, Michigan.
DETROIT – A new report has revealed more details about what the Detroit Tigers offered free agent shortstop Carlos Correa before eventually signing Javier Baez.
As first reported by ESPN’s Buster Olney, Detroit offered Correa a 10-year contract worth $275 million.
Correa preferred to sign after Seager, who agreed to his contract several days after Correa rejected the Tigers’ proposal.
Jon Paul MorosiCorey Seager received 10-year, $325 million deal from the Texas Rangers, so it’s easy to understand why Correa would reject the Tigers’ offer.

The Chicago Cubs are "poised to play a major role in the courtship of Correa," according to MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi.
Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, meanwhile, told Mark Berman of FOX26 of Correa: "I'm sure we'll engage one more time."
Correa, 27 years old, entered the winter ranked by CBS Sports as the top free agent on the market.
Truthfully, even if teams had shown any inclination to punish Astros players in that manner, they might make an exception for Correa.

     NL contender is the Yankees’ main competitor for Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ever since free agency started, the New York Yankees have said they need a shortstop, since Gleyber Torres won’t play at the position in 2022.
Fans would love to welcome Carlos Correa to the Bronx, but several realities could affect those plans.
First and foremost, Correa’s price tag (more than $320 million, most likely) is one the Yankees aren’t all that comfortable paying.
The Yankees have considered a short-term stopgap option, like Andrelton Simmons, for this season, and then hand the keys to the shortstop position to either Volpe or Peraza.
Correa hit 26 home runs, scored 104 runs, and drove in 92 in 2021.

     Astros, Cubs In On Carlos Correa; Tigers Unlikely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correa’s former team, the Astros, has yet to completely move on from the possibility of keeping him in Houston.
Owner Jim Crane told Mark Berman of FOX 26 in Houston last night that the team plans to circle back to Correa now that the market has reopened (Twitter link).
On the subject of that Tigers offer, which came prior to Detroit’s eventual signing of Javier Baez, MLB.com’s Jon Morosi adds some additional context.
The Cubs, like the Tigers, have ample payroll space and could stand to upgrade at shortstop.
Signing Correa, though, wouldn’t really mesh with president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer’s early comments on Chicago’s offseason trajectory.
