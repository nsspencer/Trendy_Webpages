     Hot Stove's burning question: Where will Correa sign?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stroman, Kyle Hendricks, and Wade Miley rely on strong infield defense to a greater extent than many modern starting pitchers.
Correa, the reigning American League Platinum Glove Award winner, could impact the Cubs’ run prevention as much as their lineup.
Nico Hoerner, the top internal candidate to be the Cubs’ primary shortstop in 2022, started only 12 games at the position last season and might be best suited for a multi-position role.

     MLB rumors: Cubs 'among the favorites' for Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB.com's Jon Morosi reported Friday the Cubs are "among the favorites" to sign free agent Carlos Correa with the market reopened.
Source: The #Cubs, who engaged with Carlos Correa in negotiations before the lockout began, are among the favorites to sign him as the market reopens.
Where Correa lands is the biggest question — or $350 million question — with free agency back open.
The Cubs were linked to Correa before the lockout.

     Report reveals new details about what Detroit Tigers offered Carlos Correa before signing Javier Baez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa #1 of the Houston Astros while playing the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park on June 24, 2021 in Detroit, Michigan.
DETROIT – A new report has revealed more details about what the Detroit Tigers offered free agent shortstop Carlos Correa before eventually signing Javier Baez.
As first reported by ESPN’s Buster Olney, Detroit offered Correa a 10-year contract worth $275 million.
Correa preferred to sign after Seager, who agreed to his contract several days after Correa rejected the Tigers’ proposal.
Jon Paul MorosiCorey Seager received 10-year, $325 million deal from the Texas Rangers, so it’s easy to understand why Correa would reject the Tigers’ offer.

     Tigers made big push for Carlos Correa in November. He’s still available in MLB free agency 2.0.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Tigers made a strong push for star shortstop Carlos Correa before the lockout, but ultimately settled for a suitable and far cheaper consolation prize.
When Correa opted to wait for a better deal, the Tigers pivoted to Javier Baez, signing him to a six-year, $140 million contract just before the deadline.
The Tigers’ reported offer to Correa was 10 years and $275 million deal: Respectable and competitive but below the 10-year, $325 million deal signed by Corey Seager with the Texas Rangers.
But MLB Network’s Jon Morosi added a new wrinkle on Friday, reporting the Tigers’ offer was even more competitive than originally believed.
Morosi wrote that the Tigers’ 10-year deal included a whopping three opt-out clauses, allowing Correa various escape routes.

     Carlos Correa rumors: Cubs among favorites for top free agent; Astros to engage again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In other words, it's time for stars like shortstop Carlos Correa to find new homes ahead of Opening Day (April 7).
The Chicago Cubs are "poised to play a major role in the courtship of Correa," according to MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi.
Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, meanwhile, told Mark Berman of FOX26 of Correa: "I'm sure we'll engage one more time."
Correa, 27 years old, entered the winter ranked by CBS Sports as the top free agent on the market.
Truthfully, even if teams had shown any inclination to punish Astros players in that manner, they might make an exception for Correa.

     Astros, Cubs In On Carlos Correa; Tigers Unlikely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Correa’s former team, the Astros, has yet to completely move on from the possibility of keeping him in Houston.
Owner Jim Crane told Mark Berman of FOX 26 in Houston last night that the team plans to circle back to Correa now that the market has reopened (Twitter link).
On the subject of that Tigers offer, which came prior to Detroit’s eventual signing of Javier Baez, MLB.com’s Jon Morosi adds some additional context.
The Cubs, like the Tigers, have ample payroll space and could stand to upgrade at shortstop.
Signing Correa, though, wouldn’t really mesh with president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer’s early comments on Chicago’s offseason trajectory.
