     Upload Season 2 Premiere Recap: 'Goodbye, Angel' — Plus, Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Upload‘s Season 2 premiere, Nora still hasn’t heard from Nathan, and the ghosting goes both ways, because Nathan also gets the unintentional cold shoulder from Nora during the episode.
Back at the Ludd camp, Matteo and Nora share a cute moment over a giant potato, and he asks if he’s alone in feeling something.
An upset Nora returns to the Ludd camp and invites Matteo for a drink, while Nathan gets up from his and Ingrid’s bed to leave Nora a voicemail.
“Goodbye, angel,” he concludes as Nora has a phantom phone ping.
Upload fans, what did you think of the first episode and that Ingrid twist?

Robbie Amell did chime in while Andy Allo was answering, as seen above.
While he didn’t comment on Jake Paul’s inclusion, he did bring up how many backsides were on display on that set.

     Summary: WARNING: Spoilers ahead for season 2 of “Upload”“Upload” has returned on Prime Video, and this season, series stars Andy Allo and Allegra Edwards share more than just a love interest.
Since Nora (Allo) went off the grid for a bit following the events of the season one finale, her chair at Horizen sat empty — as did her Lakeview avatar.
So, when Andy Allo and Robbie Amell reunited on screen, it wasn’t actually Nathan and Nora.
It was Nathan and Tinsley (Mackenzie Cardwell), an angel in training who was using Nora’s avatar until she got her own.
You know, season one I got to do that with Lucy (Andrea Rosen’s character, leading Horizen), and so season two, I got to do that again,” Allo explained.
