     Grimes and Elon Musk secretly welcomed their second child in December
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Singer Grimes and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have welcomed their second child together, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk.
The little girl was born via surrogate in December last year, Grimes revealed in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair, published on Thursday.
Although the 33-year-old Canadian musician apparently had no intention of announcing the birth of their second child, nicknamed "Y," she shared the news after Vanity Fair journalist Devin Gordon overheard a baby crying.
Musk, 48, has five other children -- twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Saxon and Kai -- from a previous marriage.

     Grimes Faces Intense Backlash For Saying Billionaire Elon Musk Lives “Below The Poverty Line”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortly after the interview went live, fans took to Twitter to call Grimes out for her “ beyond offensive ” comments.
Firstly, many users pointed out that living a more frugal lifestyle is in no way synonymous with living below the poverty line, which — according to governmental standards — is the official indicator of being “classified as poor.”

“We’ve always wanted at least three or four,” she told Vanity Fair.
