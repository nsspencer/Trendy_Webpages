     Dodgers, Clayton Kershaw agree to 1-year deal: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to a one-year deal with left-handed starter Clayton Kershaw, sources told The Athletic.
Kershaw, who turns 34 on March 19, has been one of the top pitchers in baseball throughout his 14-year career, all spent with the Dodgers.
Kershaw missed the postseason due to discomfort in his pitching arm and received a platelet-rich plasma injection in October.
Kershaw’s career numbers have him firmly on track to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer five years after he retires, as he is 185-84 with a 2.49 ERA.
He’s won three Cy Young awards, was named NL MVP in 2014, and led the majors in ERA for qualified starters five times.

     Summary: Career Dodger Clayton Kershaw isn't going anywhere just yet.
Still, Kershaw and the Dodgers have been so good for each other, this always seemed like the most logical landing spot.
He was in the Dodgers' rotation into July, but then dealt with left forearm inflammation and was out until the middle of September.
In his 14 years with the Dodgers, Kershaw has put together a Hall of Fame resume.
For now, though, the big news is Kershaw isn't going to pitch for anyone but the Dodgers, at least for another year.

     Trevor Bauer put on administrative leave by MLB ahead of spring training

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers pitcher will start this spring the same way he finished last season: on leave, while Major League Baseball continues what is now an eight-month investigation into sexual assault allegations against him.
The leave extends through March 19 and can be extended through agreement of the league and the players’ union.
Although Bauer was cleared last month of criminal charges, the league retains the right to suspend him for violating its policy on sexual assault.
On Friday, Bauer retweeted a report that a grand jury had declined to indict Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson on sexual assault allegations.
Bauer was accused of sexual assault by a San Diego woman last June, in a petition seeking a restraining order against him.

Texas had discussions with the future Hall of Famer, but he ultimately decided to return to the Dodgers.

     Summary: UPDATE (March 11, 3:15 p.m. PT): Trevor Bauer was placed on administrative leave by MLB and will not be with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the start of 2022 Spring Training.
The MLB lockout ending Thursday afternoon has brought back normalcy and clarity for the sport, but that doesn’t yet apply to Trevor Bauer and his status with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
“So I haven’t heard.”Roberts added he wasn’t sure if Bauer would join the Dodgers once Spring Training camp opens at Camelback Ranch.
“I don’t want to completely close the door on him potentially being in Spring Training, because I just don’t know enough,” Roberts explained.
While it’s plausible that Bauer joins the Dodgers for the start of Spring Training, whether he ever pitches again for the team is another question.

     Dodgers To Re-Sign Clayton Kershaw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clayton Kershaw is staying put, reportedly agreeing to terms on a one-year contract with the Dodgers.
Very early in the offseason, it became apparent that the Dodgers and Rangers were the favorites for his services.
Kershaw is obviously among the greatest pitchers in franchise history, and it stands to reason the Dodgers would’ve wanted to keep him around for legacy purposes alone.
Presuming his physical comes up clean, the Dodgers will install Kershaw back into a key rotation role.
Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic first reported Kershaw was returning to the Dodgers on a one-year deal.
