     Heaven's Gate survivor reflects on the cult's mass suicide 25 years ago

     Summary: On March 26, 1997, an anonymous caller directed police to a mansion outside San Diego where authorities soon discovered the largest mass suicide on U.S. soil.
"I was always looking for answers, looking for purpose in my life," said DiAngelo.

At a moment in his life when he was depressed, hearing voices in his head and having apocalyptic visions, he met Nettles.

     Former Heaven's Gate Cult Member Reveals She 'Never Stepped Foot Out the Door' in New Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Heaven's Gate Cult Member Reveals She 'Never Stepped Foot Out the Door' in New InterviewThe 20th-century religious group known as Heaven's Gate first captured the nation's attention in 1975, when a group of 20 people mysteriously vanished from a motel hall in Waldport, Ore.
ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer and her team revisit the case in a new two-hour special edition of 20/20, "The Cult Next Door: The Mystery and Madness of Heaven's Gate," airing Friday, March 11.
Sawyer conducted an exclusive interview in 1997 with Rio DiAngelo, a member who exited the group prior to the suicides to serve as "a messenger to the world."
"My guess is three-quarters of the people never stepped foot out the door, and I was one of them," Jana Gibbons, a former Heaven's Gate member, tells Sawyer during an exclusive look inside the Southern California mansion where the cult leaders and followers poisoned themselves with the toxin phenobarbital.
She joined Heaven's Gate when she was just 16, the group's youngest recruit.

     Cult members speak out 25 years after mass suicide of Heaven’s Gate acolytes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not only were 39 bodies found in a suburban California home, bodies of cult members buried under blankets and wearing Nike sneakers; a creepy video of a wide-eyed man explaining their Heaven’s Gate philosophy appeared everywhere.
But the clips of cult leader Marshall Applewhite were so jarring that they aired on TV news around the world.
Now new Heaven’s Gate footage will be appearing on screens 25 years after the shocking mass suicide, as former members of the cult speak out.
The show investigates the cult and features never-before-seen footage and audio recordings, in addition to glimpses of the Southern California home where the Heaven’s Gate acolytes were found dead.
The website for Heaven’s Gate remains active, outlining the group’s beliefs – though it’s unclear how many people still subscribe to the ideas.
