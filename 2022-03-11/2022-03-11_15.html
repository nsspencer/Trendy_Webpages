     Carlos Rodon, Giants agree to two-year, $44 million deal, kicking off post-lockout free agent rush
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco Giants made the first significant splash of the post-lockout free agency period, agreeing to a two-year, $44 million deal with left-handed pitcher Carlos Rodon, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.
The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports the condition of anonymity because the Giants had not yet announced the signing.
Rodon's new deal will pay him $21.5 million in 2022 and $22.5 million in 2023 with an opt-out after the first season.
The Giants also inked free agent starter Alex Cobb to a two-year deal in November.
Rodon had dealt with injuries and struggled in recent seasons, making just 43 appearances with a 4.45 ERA from 2017-2020.

     Carlos Rodon, Giants Reportedly Agree to 2-Year, $44M Contract in Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Nam Y. HuhFormer White Sox starting pitcher Carlos Rodon has agreed to sign with the San Francisco Giants on a two-year contract worth $44 million, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
The White Sox didn't give Rodon an $18.4 million qualifying offer prior to the MLB lockout that lasted 99 days, which allowed him to test the open market.
He posted a team-best 2.37 ERA with 185 strikeouts in 132.2 innings pitched, tying for the team lead with 13 wins.
Rodon pitched his first career no-hitter on April 14 against the Cleveland Indians.
Rodon allowed two runs in 2.2 innings as the White Sox went on to lose 10-1.

     Rodon, Giants agree to deal, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB Rumors: Carlos Rodon and the San Francisco Giants have reportedly agreed to terms on a two year, $44 million deal with an opt out after year one.
Rodon, 29, was one of the more interesting free agents on the market this offseason.
The ChiSox actually non-tendered him after the 2020 season, then re-signed him to a lesser deal than what he would have made in arbitration.
Rodon responded with a breakout year, putting up a 2.37 ERA and a 2.65 FIP in 132 innings over 24 starts.
Rodon offers great upside if he can stay healthy, but the injury history and lack of track record was expected to limit the total value of any deal he signed this offseason.

     Summary: Carlos Rodon agrees with the Giants on 2-year, $44M deal.
Check out some of his best strikeouts with the Chicago White Sox last season.
Rodon set a career high for wins with the Chicago White Sox in 2021 in going 13-5 with a 2.37 ERA and made his first All-Star team.
But he also played a big role as the White Sox ran away with the American League Central title at 93-69.
The Giants lost right-hander Kevin Gausman to the Blue Jays earlier this offseason on a $110 million, five-year deal and declined righty Johnny Cueto's $22 million contract option.

     Giants To Sign Carlos Rodon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 3:07pm: The Giants have reached a two-year, $44MM deal with left-hander Carlos Rodon, reports ESPN’s Jeff Passan.
Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reported shortly beforehand that Rodon was “very much in play” for the Giants.
Rodon was still effective in that time (2.35 ERA in 23 innings), but his strikeout rate was down to 27.2% — still strong, but not quite elite.
He ranked among the league leaders in terms of swinging-strike rate, opponents’ chase and overall strikeout rate.
Because Rodon did not receive the QO, the Giants won’t have to surrender any draft picks to sign him — and the White Sox won’t receive any compensation for his departure.
