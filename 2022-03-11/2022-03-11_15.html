     Report: Joe Buck Expected to Leave Fox Sports for MNF; Contract Worth Up to $75M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stacy Revere/Getty ImagesTroy Aikman has reportedly left Fox Sports to serve as a color commentator for ESPN's Monday Night Football broadcast, and it appears longtime broadcasting partner Joe Buck will make the same move.
According to Andrew Marchand of the New York Post, Buck is "expected to sign a contract in the five-year, $60-75 million range with ESPN."
Add in the alternative broadcast with Peyton and Eli Manning, and Marchand noted ESPN will spend around $50 million a year for its MNF broadcast talent.
From 2006 to 2014, ESPN paired Mike Tirico with a number of color commentators, including Tony Kornheiser, Joe Theismann, Ron Jaworski and Jon Gruden.
But Buck and Aikman—the NFL's longest-tenured broadcasting duo at 20 years together—should solidify ESPN's MNF booth.

     Joe Buck will leave Fox Sports, join ESPN to become voice of 'Monday Night Football'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new voice of "Monday Night Football" will link up with his old teammate from their former network.
Joe Buck, formerly the lead play-by-play voice for Fox Sports' NFL broadcasts, has joined ESPN to handle play-by-play duties for ESPN's only NFL broadcast, Buck's wife Michelle Beisner-Buck confirmed Friday in an Instagram post.
The New York Post had reported earlier in the day that Fox had allowed Buck to speak to ESPN and that Buck was expected to jump to the network for "Monday Night Football" duties.
Joe Buck, 52, had been the voice of six Super Bowls for Fox and was also the lead play-by-play announcer for the network's coverage of the World Series.
The Post reported that Buck is expected to sign a five-year contract with ESPN, worth between $60 million and $75 million.

     Kevin Burkhardt "internal favorite" to replace Joe Buck as Fox’s lead NFL announcer, per report Kevin Burkhardt "internal favorite" to replace Joe Buck in Fox's top booth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Andrew Marchand, who broke both the Aikman and Buck stories, the “internal favorite” to take over as Fox’s top NFL announcer is Kevin Burkhardt.
As Marchand notes, this is no small decision as Fox has two of the next three Super Bowls.
Michaels has called 12 Super Bowls and would likely love the chance to surpass Pat Summerall for the most ever.
However, if Fox does elevate Burkhardt, the most obvious decision would be to also elevate second-year analyst Greg Olsen with him.
According to Marchand, it’s more likely that Payton would end up working in the studio, at least at first.

     Joe Buck reportedly leaving Fox, after nearly three decades, for 'Monday Night Football'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And it has been that way for nearly three decades with Buck &amp; Fox Sports.
He’d join 20-year NFL broadcast partner Troy Aikman on “Monday Night Football.” It is widely known that Aikman has made the move, though it has not been announced.
And this wasn’t some limited package of regional telecasts — he broadcast the World Series that year alongside analyst Tim McCarver.
But another well-know partnership, Summerall &amp; Madden, was the gold standard at Fox Sports — probably all of sportscasting — when it debuted.
So Buck then was calling all the big games for Fox, NFL and MLB.
