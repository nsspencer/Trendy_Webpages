     Jurors In Johnny Depp Defamation Trial Pose Question About Headline In Amber Heard’s Op Ed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In their first full day of deliberations in Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation trial against Amber Heard, jurors posted a question to the judge Tuesday about how they should weigh the headline in Heard’s Washington Post op-ed.
The headline for the online version of the December, 2018 piece read, “I Spoke Up Against Sexual Violence — And Faced Our Culture’s Wrath.
“It is clear that the title is the statement.”On the jury verdict forms, the headline is one of three statements that the jury has to weigh in determining whether to rule for Depp.
The seven jurors also have to decide whether statements in the content of the op-ed are defamatory.
During the trial, Heard claimed that Depp sexually assaulted her during an argument in March 2016, but Depp’s legal team spent considerable time trying to undermine that claim.

     Summary: Johnny Depp has been camped out at the Ritz-Carlton in Virginia during his marathon defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, recuperating from his daily courtroom grind with chicken Parmigiana dinners and red wine, sources told Fox News Digital.
The actor has a suite at the hotel and takes most of his meals at The Palm, a fine-dining steakhouse with more than 30 locations across the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico, sources told Fox News Digital.
The venue already had a "Pirates of the Caribbean" banner above an entrance near Depp's secreted dining area – but that has been there for years, a patron told Fox News Digital.
Heard is countersuing for $100 million, alleging that Depp defamed her by calling her abuse allegations a hoax through his attorney, Adam Waldman.

     ‘The world is watching’: Depp-Heard jury faces a difficult task
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is not clear how the outlets have determined the jurors’ races or other details, other than simple observation.
“The gendered distribution of the jury makes that even more interesting.”The jury will attempt to rule on two claims.
That’s even more probable considering that Heard’s team “turned a case about defamation into a case about abuse,” which might muddy the waters for the jury.
“While they’ve been prohibited from accessing social media and media coverage, the frenzy at the courthouse alone is enough for them to understand that the world is watching,” she said.
Complicating things further is how to determine actual damages, if the jury decides anyone is owed them.
