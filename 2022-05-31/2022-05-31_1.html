     Rams have a lingering Aaron Donald problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Rams have done their best to glass-half-full their way through the possibility that defensive tackle Aaron Donald will retire.
The question ultimately becomes whether Donald will play for $14.25 million this year and, if not, how much more it will take to change his mind.
He clearly wants the Rams to think he won’t play without a new deal.
If, for some reason, Donald decides not to play, it will be interesting to see the size of the bill the Rams send Donald.
If so, that’s $13 million the Rams would be able to pursue from Donald.
