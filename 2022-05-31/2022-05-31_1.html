     Aaron Donald 'at peace' with career if no deal with Los Angeles Rams reached
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star defensive tackle Aaron Donald says he'd be "at peace" with his career if he and the Los Angeles Rams can't agree to a new contract.
However, on the "I Am Athlete" podcast, Donald indicated that his return is contingent on getting a new deal.
"But me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl.
I said I'm going to play eight years, and I'm going to probably be done playing football," he said.
Donald said he and the Rams "probably" will work out a deal, but if one can't be reached, he won't walk away "mad."

     Aaron Donald ‘at Peace’ With Potential Retirement Amid Contract Talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While appearing on the I AM ATHLETE podcast, Rams star Aaron Donald brought up his current contract negotiations.
Donald hinted that if he and Los Angeles can‘t agree on a deal, he’s willing to retire.
Donald later shared that he thought that was a private conversation and he wound up committing to return for Los Angeles.
Donald stated several times the NFL is a “business” and that money wasn’t the only reason why he plays.
“It ain’t about the money, it’s a business at the end of the day,” Donald said.

     Aaron Donald 'at peace' with retirement amid contract negotiations with Rams: 'I don’t need to play football to be fine'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald helped lead the Rams to a Super Bowl victory during the 2022 NFL playoffs.
I don’t want to play football if I can’t win anyway, so I feel like if I got a real opportunity to win another Super Bowl, then it makes sense to play.
He noted that rumors of him potentially stepping away from the NFL began before the Rams won Super Bowl 56.
But winning a Super Bowl you get kind of a little addicted to it.

     The number one reason Aaron Donald won’t retire this year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald’s appearance on a recent episode of the “I Am Athlete” podcast has people again asking if he’s going to retire before next season.
Aaron Donald is at peace with retiring if a new contract with the Rams doesn't get worked out.
It’s clear that Aaron Donald, obsessive about being the best football player in the league, is not completely satisfied with only one Super Bowl championship.
The number one reason that Donald will not retire this year is that the Los Angeles Rams have a better-than-average chance at repeating as Super Bowl champions.
Nobody is capable of predicting who will even make the playoffs, let alone win the Super Bowl, but we’re all allowed to be judges of the situation.

     Summary: After pledging he'd return to make a second straight run at a Super Bowl, Donald has yet to sign a deal that matches his market value.
"But me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl.
It just came out and then everybody think that, 'Oh, he said if he wins a Super Bowl he's going to retire.'
"Winning a Super Bowl, you get kind of a little addicted to it," Donald told Marshall, former cornerback Adam Jones and former running back LeSean McCoy.
That's the number that's simply too low, and Donald told Marshall, McCoy and Jones he's "at peace" with leaving football.

     Summary: After winning Super Bowl LVI, Donald checked that last box on his resume and is already a future first-ballot Hall of Famer.
“But me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl,” he continued.
It just came out and then everybody think that, ‘Oh, he said if he wins a Super Bowl, he’s going to retire.’ Nah, I got teammates, coaches, my family know about this.
I said ‘I’m going to play eight years and I’m going to probably be done playing football.’ But winning a Super Bowl you get kind of a little addicted to it.
I’m fine,” he said.
