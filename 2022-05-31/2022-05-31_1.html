     Rams have a lingering Aaron Donald problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Rams have done their best to glass-half-full their way through the possibility that defensive tackle Aaron Donald will retire.
The question ultimately becomes whether Donald will play for $14.25 million this year and, if not, how much more it will take to change his mind.
He clearly wants the Rams to think he won’t play without a new deal.
If, for some reason, Donald decides not to play, it will be interesting to see the size of the bill the Rams send Donald.
If so, that’s $13 million the Rams would be able to pursue from Donald.

     Aaron Donald 'at peace' with retirement amid contract negotiations with Rams: 'I don’t need to play football to be fine'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald helped lead the Rams to a Super Bowl victory during the 2022 NFL playoffs.
I don’t want to play football if I can’t win anyway, so I feel like if I got a real opportunity to win another Super Bowl, then it makes sense to play.
He noted that rumors of him potentially stepping away from the NFL began before the Rams won Super Bowl 56.
But winning a Super Bowl you get kind of a little addicted to it.
“I don’t need to play football to be fine.

     The number one reason Aaron Donald won’t retire this year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Donald’s appearance on a recent episode of the “I Am Athlete” podcast has people again asking if he’s going to retire before next season.
Aaron Donald is at peace with retiring if a new contract with the Rams doesn't get worked out.
It’s clear that Aaron Donald, obsessive about being the best football player in the league, is not completely satisfied with only one Super Bowl championship.
The number one reason that Donald will not retire this year is that the Los Angeles Rams have a better-than-average chance at repeating as Super Bowl champions.
Nobody is capable of predicting who will even make the playoffs, let alone win the Super Bowl, but we’re all allowed to be judges of the situation.

"Winning a Super Bowl, you get kind of a little addicted to it," Donald told Marshall, former cornerback Adam Jones and former running back LeSean McCoy.
That's the number that's simply too low, and Donald told Marshall, McCoy and Jones he's "at peace" with leaving football.
