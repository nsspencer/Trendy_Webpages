     Rams have a lingering Aaron Donald problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Rams have done their best to glass-half-full their way through the possibility that defensive tackle Aaron Donald will retire.
The question ultimately becomes whether Donald will play for $14.25 million this year and, if not, how much more it will take to change his mind.
He clearly wants the Rams to think he won’t play without a new deal.
If, for some reason, Donald decides not to play, it will be interesting to see the size of the bill the Rams send Donald.
If so, that’s $13 million the Rams would be able to pursue from Donald.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star defensive tackle Aaron Donald says he'd be "at peace" with his career if he and the Los Angeles Rams can't agree to a new contract.
However, on the "I Am Athlete" podcast, Donald indicated that his return is contingent on getting a new deal.
"But me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl.
I said I'm going to play eight years, and I'm going to probably be done playing football," he said.
Donald said he and the Rams "probably" will work out a deal, but if one can't be reached, he won't walk away "mad."

     Aaron Donald ‘at Peace’ With Potential Retirement Amid Contract Talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While appearing on the I AM ATHLETE podcast, Rams star Aaron Donald brought up his current contract negotiations.
Donald hinted that if he and Los Angeles can‘t agree on a deal, he’s willing to retire.
Donald later shared that he thought that was a private conversation and he wound up committing to return for Los Angeles.
Donald stated several times the NFL is a “business” and that money wasn’t the only reason why he plays.
“It ain’t about the money, it’s a business at the end of the day,” Donald said.

     Summary: Aaron Donald helped lead the Rams to a Super Bowl victory during the 2022 NFL playoffs.
I don’t want to play football if I can’t win anyway, so I feel like if I got a real opportunity to win another Super Bowl, then it makes sense to play.
He noted that rumors of him potentially stepping away from the NFL began before the Rams won Super Bowl 56.
But winning a Super Bowl you get kind of a little addicted to it.

"But me talking about retirement, that was happening way before we won a Super Bowl.

"Winning a Super Bowl, you get kind of a little addicted to it," Donald told Marshall, former cornerback Adam Jones and former running back LeSean McCoy.
That's the number that's simply too low, and Donald told Marshall, McCoy and Jones he's "at peace" with leaving football.
