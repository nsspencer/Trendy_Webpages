     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos A look at the highlights of the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard as closing arguments begin.
FAIRFAX, Va. -- A jury has resumed deliberations after a sensational six-week trial to resolve defamation claims by Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard over their volatile and unhappy marriage.The seven-person civil jury heard closing arguments Friday and deliberated for about two hours before leaving for the long Memorial Day weekend.
Heard filed a $100 million counterclaim against the "Pirates of the Caribbean" star after his lawyer called her allegations a hoax.
Each accuses the other of destroying their career.Testimony featured a litany of lurid details of their short marriage.
Heard testified that Depp physically or sexually assaulted her more than a dozen times.

     Jurors in Depp-Heard case continue deliberations after question to judge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 31 (Reuters) - Jurors considering opposing lawsuits brought by former spouses Johnny Depp and Amber Heard continued deliberations on Tuesday after sending a question to the judge overseeing the trial on the actors' multimillion-dollar defamation claims.
The article did not mention Depp by name but his lawyer told jurors it was clear that Heard was referring to him.
Throughout the case, jurors listened to recordings of the couple's fights and saw graphic photos of Depp's bloody finger.
Depp lost a libel case less than two years ago against the Sun, a British tabloid that labeled him a "wife beater."
Depp's lawyers filed the U.S. case in Fairfax County, Virginia, because the Washington Post is printed there.

     Monica Lewinsky’s Verdict on the Johnny Depp–Amber Heard Trial: We Are All Guilty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unless you’re a troglodyte, you’ve been exposed to something about the Depp v. Heard trial in the past few weeks.
I wasn’t surprised that the memes about Amber Heard far outnumbered those about Johnny Depp.
I wasn’t surprised that the cruel and vitriolic discourse was predominantly aimed at the woman.
But they were less about Depp and Heard; more seemed to idolize Camille Vasquez (Depp’s lawyer) for her “performance” cross-examining Heard.
This legal spectacle would be sad enough if it just impacted the personal lives of Depp, Heard, and their loved ones.

     Summary: The last seven weeks of the trial have also given rise to a social media spectacle.
Heard under the lensOn social media, Depp fans were often seen zooming in on Heard’s reactions and her facial expression.
Many social media users were busy dissecting Heard’s various expressions to understand the “truth” behind her body language.
After Depp’s testimony, in which he said that Heard defecated on their shared bed, several hashtags were shared on social media mocking Heard.
They have urged that whether the court sides with Heard or not, every claim of domestic violence deserves to be heard fairly.

     Depp-Heard: 6 lessons from ‘Hollywood’s Trial of the Century’
    </h2>

     Summary: Now that the Depp-Heard show is lurching to a close, with the trial in its jury-deliberation phase, it’s hard to imagine what the celebrity-industrial complex, and the media industry in general, will find to replace it.
In the piece, titled “Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence—and faced our culture’s wrath.
It’s been the subject of exhaustive tabloid coverage as well as think pieces in the likes of The Atlantic and The New Yorker.
Depp-Heard has become its own content economy, a massive media machine unto itself.
In other words, Depp-Heard, in one form or another, is here to stay.

     ‘The world is watching’: Depp-Heard jury faces a difficult task
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is not clear how the outlets have determined the jurors’ races or other details, other than simple observation.
“The gendered distribution of the jury makes that even more interesting.”The jury will attempt to rule on two claims.
That’s even more probable considering that Heard’s team “turned a case about defamation into a case about abuse,” which might muddy the waters for the jury.
“While they’ve been prohibited from accessing social media and media coverage, the frenzy at the courthouse alone is enough for them to understand that the world is watching,” she said.
Complicating things further is how to determine actual damages, if the jury decides anyone is owed them.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The jury in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s bombshell defamation trial will resume deliberations Tuesday morning after a three-day break for the Memorial Day weekend.
Getty ImagesTwo days earlier in court, Depp’s lawyer told the jury that the actor was the real victim of domestic abuse in his former relationship with Heard.
“There is an abuser in this courtroom, but it is not Mr. Depp,” Camille Vasquez said in her closing statement.
Depp proposed to Heard in 2014 and they were married in an early 2015 ceremony on Depp’s private island in the Bahamas.
Heard filed for divorce and asked the court for a temporary restraining order against Depp in May 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What the jury considers will be very different from the public debate that has engulfed the high-profile proceedings.
Most of the article discusses public policy as it relates to domestic violence, and Heard’s lawyers say she has a First Amendment right to weigh in.
Depp’s lawyers point to two passages in the article that they say clearly refer to Depp.
Heard’s lawyers say they have presented a mountain of evidence that Heard was abused.
Depp’s lawyers, though, say the two passages are clear references to Depp, given the publicity that surrounded their 2016 divorce proceedings.
