     Summary: Bo Burnham couldn’t let the anniversary of his award-winning comedy special, Inside, pass without acknowledgement.
And ambitious as ever, he acknowledged it by dropping a newly edited, hour-plus long addendum to the original: The Inside Outtakes.
Burnham announced the release on social media on Monday , writing, “A year ago today, I released a special called Inside.
I hope you enjoy it.”Some of the footage is true outtakes, edited together as cleverly as one would expect from Burnham.
Anyone who enjoyed Burnham’s trademark self-deprecation or gleefully vicious social commentary will surely eat up The Inside Outtakes.

     Bo Burnham’s Inside is a masterpiece – even these outtakes are hilarious
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A year after the release of his Netflix special Inside – by any measure, one of the most iconic comedy works of our time – Bo Burnham has released an hour of outtakes from that twisted lockdown masterpiece.
Or the post-show talk by the CEO of Inside Studios (played by you-know-who), launching Burnham’s very own Marvel-like Inside Cinematic Universe?
Healing the world with comedy … Bo Burnham’s 2021 special, Inside.
One funny skit finds the creative team of Inside (eight different Bo Burnhams) interviewed by, er, Bo Burnham about the success of the special.
Inside wasn’t (it’s now even clearer) just about lockdown, it was about being trapped in 2021, being trapped in smart-everything, rolling-infotainment post-post-postmodernity, being trapped in Bo Burnham’s self-absorption and Bo Burnham’s head.
