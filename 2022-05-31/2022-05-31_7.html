    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bo Burnham couldn’t let the anniversary of his award-winning comedy special, Inside, pass without acknowledgement.
And ambitious as ever, he acknowledged it by dropping a newly edited, hour-plus long addendum to the original: The Inside Outtakes.
Burnham announced the release on social media on Monday , writing, “A year ago today, I released a special called Inside.
I hope you enjoy it.”Some of the footage is true outtakes, edited together as cleverly as one would expect from Burnham.
Anyone who enjoyed Burnham’s trademark self-deprecation or gleefully vicious social commentary will surely eat up The Inside Outtakes.

     Bo Burnham Brutally Mocks Joe Rogan in ‘Inside’ Outtakes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Exactly one year after he took the comedy world by surprise with his genre-bending pandemic-era Netflix special Inside, Bo Burnham treated fans to another full hour of material from the project, dropping The Inside Outtakes on his YouTube channel Monday night.
As the elusive comedian announced on Twitter, “a year ago today, i released a special called inside.
i’ve spent the last two months editing together material that i shot for the special but didn’t end up using.
It comes about 18 and a half minutes in when Burnham presents a clip from “Bo Burnham’s Inside the Podcast with Bo Burnham and Bo Burnham.” The split screen chat with himself is an obvious takedown of podcast superstar Joe Rogan, whose Spotify controversy came to a head after Inside’s 2021 release.
In the original Inside special, Burnham used his song “Problematic” to reckon with some of his own past material that could be considered offensive and suggested that ultimately no one was going to hold him “accountable” but himself.

     Bo Burnham’s Inside is a masterpiece – even these outtakes are hilarious
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A year after the release of his Netflix special Inside – by any measure, one of the most iconic comedy works of our time – Bo Burnham has released an hour of outtakes from that twisted lockdown masterpiece.
Or the post-show talk by the CEO of Inside Studios (played by you-know-who), launching Burnham’s very own Marvel-like Inside Cinematic Universe?
Healing the world with comedy … Bo Burnham’s 2021 special, Inside.
One funny skit finds the creative team of Inside (eight different Bo Burnhams) interviewed by, er, Bo Burnham about the success of the special.
Inside wasn’t (it’s now even clearer) just about lockdown, it was about being trapped in 2021, being trapped in smart-everything, rolling-infotainment post-post-postmodernity, being trapped in Bo Burnham’s self-absorption and Bo Burnham’s head.
