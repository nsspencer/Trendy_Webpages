     Two Chick-fil-A restaurants in Dauphin County forging ahead with plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Plans for two proposed Chick-fil-A restaurants in Dauphin County, including one drive-thru only location, are moving forward.
We hope to have the opportunity to serve new guests delicious food in an environment of genuine hospitality,” Chick-fil-A said in a statement.
It’s about three miles from the Chick-fil-A at 4655 Lindle Road in Swatara Township, which opened in 2016.
Chick-fil-A, founded in 1967 by Truett Cathy, ranks as one of the best fast-food restaurants in customer satisfaction.
Every July the restaurants honor cows with a “Cow Appreciation Day.” The restaurants also are closed on Sundays following with the owner’s Christian beliefs.

     Chick-fil-A tests autonomous delivery in Austin, Texas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dive Brief:Two Chick-fil-A restaurants in Austin, Texas, will test Refraction AI’s self-driving vehicles for delivery, Refraction AI announced on Tuesday .
Three Chick-fil-A locations in Santa Monica, California, previously tested robot delivery in 2021 through a partnership with Kiwibot.
Food delivery robots have gained a foothold across college campuses, but are becoming popular outside university settings, especially as the labor shortage drags on.
"Autonomous delivery using Refraction's robots creates an exciting new opportunity to extend the Chick-fil-A experience to a growing number of delivery guests," said Luke Steigmeyer, operator of the first Austin Chick-fil-A to test Refraction’s technology.
Restaurant delivery was the focus of the initial test, but Refraction has since expanded into grocery and retail delivery.

     Chick-fil-A Tests Robotic Sandwich Delivery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday (May 31), Chick-fil-A became the latest major restaurant brand to try out robotic delivery as a way to meet demand in spite of major capacity challenges.
Autonomous robot delivery company Refraction announced that it is trialing self-driving vehicle delivery at two of the chicken sandwich quick-service restaurant (QSR) chain’s locations in downtown Austin, Texas.
These initiatives come as ongoing demand for restaurant delivery comes into conflict with rising prices and a difficult labor market when it comes to delivery drivers, leading to rising costs.
In fact, many restaurants do not have the capacity to meet delivery demand.
