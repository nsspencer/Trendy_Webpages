     LA Clippers' Paul George scores 34 in return from 3-month absence to fuel comeback vs. Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George is unstoppable as he drops 34 points in his return, leading the Clippers to their third 25-point comeback victory of the season.
It was exactly what the Clippers had been missing since George last played on Dec. 22.
George now has more 30-point games this season (7) than the rest of the Clippers team combined (6).
When George hit consecutive 3-pointers late in the third quarter in front of the Clippers bench, Lue knew his star guard was back.
"It changes for us big-time," Lue said of how George alters the complexion of the team heading toward the play-in.

     What Paul George's father had to say about two Clippers comebacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — On the night when LA Clippers star Paul George returned from a 96-day, 43-game absence because of a torn right ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, the Utah Jazz led by 25 points with 8:07 left in the third quarter.
At that point, George had only nine points after a scoreless first quarter, and he split his first free-throw attempts of the game on the possession before Rudy Gobert finished a lob from Mike Conley “I told the guys, ‘We don’t look like a playoff team right now,'” George said Tuesday in his first public comments since his last home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Dec. 20.But George’s personal comeback led to his team’s comeback, something that the Clippers have made a habit of all season .
George scored 25 of his game-high 34 points in the last 20 minutes of the game and led a 31-point turnaround to beat the Jazz, 121-115, to snap a season-long five-game losing streak.It was arguably George’s best game, as he finished with 34 points on 10-of-20 shooting (third-most points all season), a season-best six made 3s out of nine attempts, 8 of 11 free throws (all in the second half), six assists, two turnovers, four steals and a block of Gobert.

     Summary: LOS ANGELES — The Utah Jazz had a 25-point lead against the L.A. Clippers.
Then, slowly and deliberately, the Clippers chipped away at that lead until they had control of the game.
The Jazz were bounced from the 2021 playoffs by blowing a 25-point lead to the Clippers in this building on June 18.
But, if you put aside the more nuanced details of the game, it felt the same as the Game 6 loss.
