     Masters 2022: Tiger Woods practicing at Augusta National in attempt to play major next week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world has been on alert across the last few days as we wait for Tiger Woods to announce whether he will play the 2022 Masters at Augusta National.
Woods is reportedly in town with his son, Charlie, and friend Justin Thomas, according to Sports Illustrated.
He is playing Augusta National on Tuesday in an attempt to get some prep work in ahead of the 86th edition of the tournament.
That's to be celebrated, of course, because a tournament with Tiger Woods in attendance is always better than one in which he's absent, but it's certainly different than what we've come to expect from Woods.
In 23 Masters appearances, Tiger has five victories and and astounding 14 top-10 finishes.

     Summary: Woods suffered serious injuries to his right leg and right foot in a car wreck on Feb. 23, 2021.
He had open fractures in the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula in his right leg.
He told reporters at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in late November that doctors nearly had to amputate his right leg.
"My right leg does not look like my left leg, let's put it that way."
In December, Woods played in the unofficial PNC Championship with Charlie.

     Summary: Tiger Woods practices at Augusta National ahead of the Masters, fueling speculationShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailTiger Woods at the 2020 Masters, walking alongside his caddie Joe LaCava.
Getty ImagesWhat started as hopeful rumors among the most ardent supporters of Tiger Woods became a reality Tuesday as Woods set foot on Augusta National.
According to reports from Sports Illustrated’s Bob Harig, Woods is playing the course Tuesday alongside his son, Charlie, and world No.
Speculation about Woods’ Masters prep initially reached a peak Tuesday morning when reports about his private jet were confirmed that it was traveling from West Palm Beach northbound to Augusta.
Though that has been faulty speculation in the past, sure enough, video footage surfaced of Woods’ plane on the tarmac.

     Summary: Tiger Woods is a five-time Masters champion, his last coming in 2019.
It is believed to be the first time that Charlie Woods, 13, has played at Augusta National.
One of them was Radar Sports (@radarspots), which tweeted a play by play of Woods’ flight.
The source said that Charlie Woods was hitting balls on the range, while Thomas, a good family friend, was also in attendance.
Woods last played at the 2020 Masters that was contested in November that year and he tied for 38th.

     Tiger Woods’ Augusta trip fuels Masters intrigue: ‘I think he plays’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation that Tiger Woods will tee it up in next week’s Masters continues to heat up, particularly after he played 18 holes at Augusta National on Tuesday, according to an ESPN report.
“I think he plays,” one source who knows Woods well told The Post.
A video surfaced over the weekend that showed Woods playing at his home course, Medalist, in Hobe Sound, Fla., where he was joined by caddie Joe LaCava.
“He’s gonna tee it up, I think,” former tour pro Colt Knost said on The Drop Zone podcast on Tuesday.
Woods then missed the Masters each of the next two years and both times announced his withdrawal also on the Friday before those tournaments.

     Summary: Woods was last seen three weeks ago at PGA TOUR Headquarters for his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
“You will see me on the PGA TOUR, I just don’t know when,” Woods told CBS’ Jim Nantz on the telecast of last month’s The Genesis Invitational.
“I’m a lot stronger than I was (at the PNC),” Woods said from The Riviera Country Club.
Videos also recently appeared on social media that showed Woods walking at his home club, Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida, with his caddie, Joe LaCava.
Woods is reportedly using his rounds this week to gauge if his legs can withstand walking the hilly grounds of Augusta National.
