     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn should out the fellow Republicans he claims invited him to orgies and snorted cocaine in front of him, the leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus said.
The comments from freshman congressman Cawthorn, 26, have led to suggestions from some within the Freedom Caucus that he should be ousted from the group, Politico reported.
Perry wouldn’t say whether the caucus would consider booting Cawthorn if he didn’t name names or share evidence to back up his salacious claims.

     Cawthorn’s orgies-and-drugs comment stirs trouble within Freedom Caucus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Perry himself could face further questions about Cawthorn’s place in the Freedom Caucus.
The Freedom Caucus is “way ahead of that at this point,” Perry added.
Other group members, however, shrugged it off and said they did not hear the matter raised on Monday night, when the Freedom Caucus met for its broader weekly meeting.
Within the Freedom Caucus, which still does not publicly disclose its full roster, Cawthorn’s remarks landed with their own force.
Multiple Republican aides and members told POLITICO that members of the Freedom Caucus — who support traditional family values — were particularly alarmed by Cawthorn’s seeming readiness to broach sex and drugs.

     Madison Cawthorn Claims He Was Invited to Orgies and Saw Politicians Do Cocaine: 'Name Names,' Colleagues Say

     Summary: "I look at all these people, a lot of them that I've looked up to through my life, I've always paid attention to politics," Cawthorn said.
Cawthorn did not say specifically to whom he was referring — and that's a problem, fellow Republicans say.
The outlet also reported that Republican Rep. Scott Perry — chair of the House Freedom Caucus, of which Cawthorn is a member — planned to speak with him, too.
"I think it is important, if you're going to say something like that, to name some names," Perry told Politico.
There have also been allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct made against Cawthorn by women who attended college with him.

     GOP’s Cawthorn causes a stir with comments about orgies, cocaine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was just a few weeks ago when Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn generated national headlines by publicly condemning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “thug” who’s leading an “incredibly evil” government.
Cawthorn appeared on a podcast last week and was asked whether the TV show “House of Cards” is realistic.
In case this isn’t obvious, there’s simply no reason to accept the GOP congressman’s claims at face value.
Cawthorn has earned a reputation as a fabulist whose stories are literally unbelievable, and his claims about orgies and cocaine seem ridiculous.
In other words, if elected lawmakers have invited him to orgies and done cocaine around him, Cawthorn should either expose the miscreants or shut up.

     House Republicans Angry With Junior Member for Claiming They’re Cool as Hell
    </h2>

     Summary: Every so often, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy says—meaningfully—that he will have a stern chat with one of his fellow Republican House members.
The remarks, which Cawthorn made on a podcast last week, have stirred up the QAnon wing of the party yet again, and Cawthorn’s fellow Republicans are peeved that they’re getting bugged about it.
podcast, said House of Cards’ depiction of D.C. as a hotbed of sleaze, sex, and drugs is totally accurate.
This could have passed as a dumb thing a spiraling member of the House said on a podcast that was forgotten a day later.
But the allegation has spread enough that members, including GOP members, are getting asked about it by their constituents.

     Summary: Photo: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/ShutterstockMadison Cawthorn is in for a stern talking-to, Politico reported on Tuesday.
You should come,’” Cawthorn said on the Warrior Poet Society podcast.
A former friend, Bradley Ledford, said Cawthorn falsely accused him of leaving the future congressman to die in the burning car.
So it’s difficult to believe that Cawthorn is now telling the truth about the unsavory habits of his fellow Republicans.
Cawthorn hasn’t been tempered by bad press or by credible accusations of sexual misconduct or the opprobrium of his own party.
