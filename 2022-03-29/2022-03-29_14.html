     Dodgers Renew Contract of Andrew Toles For 2022 Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2020 World Series Champions renewed the contract of former outfielder Andrew Toles, who has not played for the team since 2018, and is currently on the restricted list.
However, by having his contract renewed by the Dodgers, Toles will have access to health insurance and much-needed mental health services.
He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of trespassing and eventually released to his father, Alvin Toles.
Toles' father told USA Today last year that his son has bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
"We are having challenges,'' Alvin told USA Today.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers failed to win the World Series this past season, but they are still acting like champions in one regard.
The Dodgers decided last week to renew the contract of troubled former outfielder Andrew Toles, who has battled mental health issues and has not played for the team since 2018.
Blake Williams of Dodger Blue noted that keeping Toles under contract allows the Dodgers to continue providing him with access to healthcare services and financial support.
You can read more about Tolesâ€™ mental health battle in this USA Today piece from that year.
Toles has remained under contract with the Dodgers throughout that time, though, as the team continues to do everything they can to get their beloved ex-player back on the mend.

     Dodgers Re-Sign Andrew Toles to Assist with His Access to Medical Care

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In March 2019, the Dodgers moved outfielder Andrew Toles to the restricted list.
Information came to light that Toles had been dealing with mental health issues, which explained why he wasn't actively playing in the Dodgers system.
USA Today's Bob Nightengale subsequently reported that Toles had been in and out of mental health facilities since leaving the Dodgers.
Per the Associated Press' Ronald Blum, the Dodgers elected to renew Toles' contract.
The former outfielder being under contract with the Dodgers allows him access to health insurance and mental health care - should he seek it.
