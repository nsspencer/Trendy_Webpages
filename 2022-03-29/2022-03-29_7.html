     Summary: House Republicans are angry over comments Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) made on a podcast on March 24.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will talk with North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn about his recent claim that lawmakers in Washington have orgies, according to Politico and CNN.
Politico reported that House Republicans have demanded Cawthorn identify any people who were involved in the activities he alleged to prove that the claims are true.
McCarthy never punished Cawthorn after he was arrested earlier in March for driving with a revoked license.
However, McCarthy's talk with Cawthorn looks to be coming faster than his conversations with other GOP lawmakers who have made offensive comments.
