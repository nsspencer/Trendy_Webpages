     'Top Gun: Maverick's' latest trailer sets up a showdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) We can thank the Iceman for the return of Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.
In it, we learn that Val Kilmer's character is the one who requests Mitchell (played by Tom Cruise, of course) as teacher to a new group of pilots.
In that group is Bradley "Rooster" Bradshaw (played by Miles Teller), who has a grudge against Mitchell because of his history with Bradshaw's father, Goose.
"My dad believed in you," Rooster tells Maverick.
"I'm not going to make the same mistake."

     The ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ trailer rides into the danger zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of our favorite bits from the post-shutdown phase of the pandemic was returning to movie theaters for, say, Spiral or Cruella, and discovering that, at the theater’s concession stand, the folks at your local AMC were still using cups and popcorn bags advertising the release of Top Gun: Maverick… in May 2020.
It’s actually fucking coming out, and Tom Cruise is ready to lecture you about how you’ve got the settings on your TV wrong once again.
Paramount dropped a brand-new trailer for the film on Tuesday, and it rocks pretty hard.
If there’s not a new Kenny Loggins song on the soundtrack, we’ll riot.
Well, we’ll actually probably just write a strongly-worded article and not do much else.

     A new ‘Top Gun’ sequel trailer teases Iceman’s return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The past becomes the future in the newest trailer for “Top Gun: Maverick,” the long-awaited sequel to the original 1986 hit.
Iceman, of course, was Maverick’s rival in the original “Top Gun,” famously portrayed by Val Kilmer.
Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise helped make "Top Gun" one of the most iconic movies of the '80s.
“We all wanted him, but Tom was really adamant that if he’s going to make another ‘Top Gun,’ Val had to be in it,” he told People in 2021.
“Top Gun: Maverick,” which has experienced numerous delays due to the pandemic after it was initially supposed to come out in 2020, is now due to land in theaters May 27.
