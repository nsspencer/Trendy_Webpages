    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Have you been receiving spam text messages that appear to come from your own phone number?
Verizon said it is working to block spam texts some customers say they have received from their own numbers.
Several customers have complained about the spam texts, which say they've paid a March bill while offering a free gift redeemed through a mysterious link.
A USA TODAY reporter also received a similar spam text on Monday, which offered a free gift for paying a bill.
"So I'm getting spam texts from my own cell phone number now?"

     Spam text messages flood Verizon Wireless phones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Verizon Wireless, the company is currently investigating a mass spam text message campaign targeting its customers.
"Verizon is aware that bad actors are sending spam text messages to some customers which appear to come from the customers’ own number," a Verizon spokesperson stated in a statement first provided to The Verge .
However, this specific spam campaign seems fairly widespread among Verizon Wireless customers specifically.
Complaints to the FCC regarding spam text messages have continued to rise, showing this is clearly a widespread problem in recent years.
However, it's unclear why this specific flood of spam texts appears to be targeting Verizon Wireless customers.

     Verizon says it's working to resolve the outbreak of spam texts that appear to come from customers' own numbers

     Summary: "Bad actors" are reportedly responsible for texts to Verizon customers that come from their own number.
"Verizon is aware that bad actors are sending spam text messages to some customers which appear to come from the customers' own number.
Verizon continues to work on behalf of the customer to prevent spam texts and related activity," a Verizon spokesperson told Insider.
However, Verizon told The Verge the texts were not the result of some sort of hack.
You can forward a spam text to SPAM (7726) and block spam numbers or report spammers to carriers and the Federal Trade Commission.

     People Are Getting Spam Text Messages From Their Own Cell Number

     Summary: He wrote: "This morning, I received a very blatant spam text offering me 'a little gift' for supposedly paying my phone bill.
Although phone users are advised never to click on links that could be spam, the reporter wanted to investigate.
One tweeter, using the handle @jeffNDfan, posted: "So I just got a spam text from my own cell number.
It revealed Americans received 87.8 billion spam text messages – an increase of 58 per cent compared to the year before.
