     Verizon Customers Report Receiving Spam Text Messages From Their Own Numbers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNETIf you're a Verizon customer who's been receiving mysterious spam text messages with a link attached coming from your own phone number, you're not alone.
Multiple Verizon customers have reported receiving similar messages this week, where they are encouraged to click on an obscure link in order to receive a free gift.
"Free Msg: Your bill is paid for March," said a message received by a relative of a CNET team member, which matched the description of similar messages received by other Verizon customers, according to social media and news reports.
The message ends with a mysterious link that makes it impossible to know what it's about.
Verizon didn't immediately respond to a comment request.

It’s Spam: Have you experienced that you got a spam text…from yourself?
This morning, We got a very heinous spam text offering me “a little gift” for allegedly paying my phone bill.
Spoofed texts and calls are nothing new; most individuals face a constant flood of spam calls that comes up on called ID as from a number similar to their own.

     Verizon customers are receiving spam texts from their own number
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verizon customers are receiving spam texts from their own numberSMS isn’t the most robust technology around, and it has often been used to send scam and spam messages while obscuring the original sender.
However, Verizon customers have been dealing with an especially ridiculous form of text spam: messages that appear to come from their own phone number.
There have been many reports from Verizon subscribers about spam texts from their own phone number, many of which are disguised as confirmation messages for bill payment with a shortened link.
Links in spam texts are fairly common, but the sender usually appears as a number other than the recipient’s, which makes the new trend more unusual.

     Summary: A number of Verizon users have reported that they have been getting spam text messages from their own numbers.
As we look into the current issue, here’s how you can stop spam text messages.

Although phone users are advised never to click on links that could be spam, the reporter wanted to investigate.
One tweeter, using the handle @jeffNDfan, posted: "So I just got a spam text from my own cell number.
It revealed Americans received 87.8 billion spam text messages – an increase of 58 per cent compared to the year before.
But it's unclear if that would be helpful in this case, since phone users would effectively be reporting their own phone number as a scam line.
