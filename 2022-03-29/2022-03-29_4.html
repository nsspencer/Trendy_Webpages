     Snow Squall Leads to 50-Car Pileup on Pennsylvania Highway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Several people were killed and at least a dozen were injured after a blinding snow squall on Monday led to a fiery pileup of at least 50 vehicles, including several tractor-trailers, on a Pennsylvania interstate, the authorities said.
On Tuesday, as rescuers worked to clear the extensive wreckage from the interstate, the state police confirmed there were fatalities but said they were still working to get an accurate total.
The wreckage was “far from being clear” from the roadway, Trooper David Beohm, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said on Tuesday in a telephone interview.
“We searched all vehicles that were not on fire,” he said.
The Associated Press reported at least three people were killed.
