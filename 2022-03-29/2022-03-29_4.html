     'The Girl From Plainville' is a bland take on Michelle Carter case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The strange case of Michelle Carter turns out to have been better suited to a documentary than a drama, as "The Girl From Plainville" -- Hulu's stark, spare eight-episode series -- proves too inward and clenched, despite Elle Fanning's convincing portrayal of the central player in the "texting suicide" case.
The story hinges on the death of Conrad "Coco" Roy III (Colton Ryan), who took his own life after Carter (Fanning) prodded him to do so.
More sober than made-for-Lifetime underpinnings, the fights of fancy and what-ifs in the presentation don't entirely work, however well intended.
Indeed, both Carter and Roy (or Coco, as his family called him) come across as enigmatic figures, failing to provide much insight into what made either of them tick.
Fanning aptly captured Carter's distant, haunted quality, including her preoccupation with the show "Glee" and identification with Lea Michele's character and the tragic death of co-star Cory Monteith.

     The Girl from Plainville: What is the true story behind the Michelle Carter case?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new Hulu drama, The Girl from Plainville starring Elle Fanning, tells the horrifying story of Michelle Carter, the American teen convicted of involuntary manslaughter for goading her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, into taking his own life.
Carter meanwhile had suffered from anorexia as a child, had likewise been placed on medication and attended counselling sessions at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
Michelle Carter was indicted on 4 February 2015 (as a “youthful offender” so that she could be tried as an adult despite being 17 at the time) on charges of involuntary manslaughter.
The case was heard two years later by Judge Lawrence Moniz of the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts in Taunton, who found Carter guilty on 16 June 2017.
On 6 February 2019, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Carter had acted with criminal intent, so the involuntary manslaughter conviction stood and she was jailed for 15 months.

     Hulu’s bleak The Girl From Plainville struggles to justify its existence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Girl From Plainville tries to justify its existence by leaning heavily on Michelle and Conrad’s (Colton Ryan) individual struggles, told through their point-of-view, and what drew them to each other.
And for the most part, this is because of rousing performances by Fanning, Ryan, and Chloë Sevigny (who plays Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy).
However, in trying to ascertain Michelle and Conrad’s toxic dynamic, The Girl From Plainville narratively flounders with overwrought script choices (think lots of unclear timeline-jumping).
The Girl From Plainville has Michelle griping about possibly being bisexual, adding a different layer to what might be driving her decisions.
The whole cast is splendid actually, which might be the biggest reason to tune into The Girl From Plainville, despite its unsteady and drawn-out run.

     The True Story Behind Hulu's The Girl From Plainville
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This story contains spoilers for The Girl From PlainvilleLiz Hannah and Patrick Macmanus, the creators of the Hulu limited series The Girl From Plainville, out March 29, knew they had to handle the true story of Michelle Carter’s unprecedented “texting-suicide” case with care.
“Instead of judging her for being opaque and seeming performative as the media had, I felt like she was this intensely lonely girl,” Hannah said.
“Her prevailing sense of loneliness provided a jumping off point for the character.”Here’s how the creators of The Girl From Plainville worked to stay true to the story behind the series.
“This is a story about the Michelle Carter case and every case is special, every person is special.
People have to know there’s help out there for them.”What was Michelle Carter thinking?

     Summary: (For some reason, Michelle is represented as 18 at the time of Conrad’s death, when she was a year younger.)
Artistically, there’s nothing wrong with this — it comprises a kind of epistolary play, like “Love Letters,” within the play.
It is no better than partially true, as much as it might be essentially true.
Adults may have some thoughts about kids these days with their phones and their earbuds, and “The Girl From Plainville” is happy for you to have them.
It may spark questions to feed the dialogue you are bound to have with any such series — Is this part real?

     The Girl From Plainville Can Only Say So Much
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite a strong performance by Elle Fanning, Michelle Carter, the teen accused of talking her boyfriend into suicide, remains an enigma.
The Girl From Plainville, a new Hulu limited series debuting today, introduces yet another depiction of a master of fraud: a teenager who misrepresents her role in and sadness over the untimely death of her boyfriend.
Like the previously cited examples, The Girl From Plainville is based on a true story, the so-called texting-suicide case in which Michelle Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to take his own life.
If you come to The Girl From Plainville seeking answers to questions that start with why, you’ll be disappointed.
As much as Fanning’s performance illuminates and informs our ideas about her character, The Girl From Plainville can never fully explain the person its title references.
