     Summary: Have you been receiving spam text messages that appear to come from your own phone number?
Verizon said it is working to block spam texts some customers say they have received from their own numbers.
Several customers have complained about the spam texts, which say they've paid a March bill while offering a free gift redeemed through a mysterious link.
A USA TODAY reporter also received a similar spam text on Monday, which offered a free gift for paying a bill.
"So I'm getting spam texts from my own cell phone number now?"

     Verizon blames ‘bad actors’ for the spam text you got from your own number
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yesterday, I wrote about receiving a spam text that bizarrely looked as though it came from my own phone number.
“Verizon is aware that bad actors are sending spam text messages to some customers which appear to come from the customers’ own number,” Verizon spokesperson Rich Young told The Verge by email.
Verizon continues to work on behalf of the customer to prevent spam texts and related activity.”In the hours since we published our original story, many more Verizon customers have reported receiving that same exact text about a free gift with a link at the end.
“We believe this activity is being generated from external bad actors with no direct tie to our company,” he said.
Either way, I’m still seeing reports of people getting these spam texts today, so Verizon seems to be having a difficult time fully putting a stop to the messages.

     Summary: If you get a text message that looks to be from yourself, don't click on it.
That's the sage advice of experts and of Verizon, which has received numerous complaints about customers getting spam text messages that seem to come from their own phone numbers.
I’ve seen a significant increase in spam texts, including spoofed messages, that appear to come from my own mobile number.
Verizon customer support is taking a different tone today after many reports of customers receiving spam texts from their own number.

     Summary: Many Verizon customers have reported the spam messages in recent days, with the company formally acknowledging the issue Tuesday.
"Verizon is aware that bad actors are sending spam text messages to some customers which appear to come from the customers' own number.
The spam messages look like a text from themselves that reads: "Free Msg: Your bill is paid for March.
Now that you’ve avoided that, Verizon has asked customers to forward the text to SPAM (7726) and write "spoofed number."
"No one wants to wade through voicemail spam, or miss important messages because their mailbox is full.

     People Are Getting Spam Text Messages From Their Own Cell Number

     Summary: He wrote: "This morning, I received a very blatant spam text offering me 'a little gift' for supposedly paying my phone bill.
Although phone users are advised never to click on links that could be spam, the reporter wanted to investigate.
One tweeter, using the handle @jeffNDfan, posted: "So I just got a spam text from my own cell number.
It revealed Americans received 87.8 billion spam text messages – an increase of 58 per cent compared to the year before.
But it's unclear if that would be helpful in this case, since phone users would effectively be reporting their own phone number as a scam line.
