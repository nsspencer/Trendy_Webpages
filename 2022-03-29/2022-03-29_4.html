     Nigeria vs Ghana LIVE! World Cup play-off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: T homas Partey’s early strike via a goalkeeper error helped Ghana secure a 1-1 draw with hosts Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday, as they became the first African side to book a place at the World Cup in Qatar.
Ghana advance to the finals on the away goals rule after the first leg finished goalless on Friday, and will take part in their fourth World Cup after appearing in three in a row between 2006 and 2014.
But for Ghana, and their newly appointed technical advisor Chris Hughton, it is a major triumph in a qualification campaign in which they never really impressed and had looked a shadow of the side that reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2010.
They defended for much of the 90 minutes in Abuja, rarely looking threatening after they scored, but also faced few alarms themselves from a Nigeria side devoid of attacking threat.
Nigeria thought they had a second when Victor Osimhen scored, but the VAR correctly ruled he was offside in the build-up.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nigerian Super Eagles and the Ghanaian black stars will battle in the decisive second leg of their World Cup play-off in Abuja tonight.
However, Nigeria now return to home soil where they have struggled to get going, claiming just two wins from their last nine games since 2019, while losing three and claiming four draws in that time.
Ahead of Tuesday’s cracker, Coach Austin Eguavoen is likely going to drop Nantes winger and Villarreal forward Samuel Chukwueze for Ademola Lookman and Dennis Emmanuel respectively.
Meanwhile, the Otto-Addo led Black stars will be boosted by the return of skipper Andre Ayew who will be coming back after missing the first leg due to suspension.
Nigeria possible starting lineup:Uzoho; Aina, Troost-Ekong, Balogun, Sanusi; Onyeka, Etebo; Lookman, Aribo, Dennis; OsimhenGhana possible starting lineup:Wollacott; Mensah, Amartey, Djiku, Odoi; Partey, Baba, Kudus; J Ayew, Afena-Gyan, A AyewPredictionNigeria 1-0 Ghana
