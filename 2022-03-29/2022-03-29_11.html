     Kevin McCarthy will reportedly talk with Madison Cawthorn about his cocaine and orgy comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin McCarthy reportedly told House Republicans that he will give a talking-to to Rep. Madison Cawthorn.
Cawthorn recently suggested that "House of Cards" was accurate in how it depicted sex and drugs in Washington.
McCarthy has already had to publicly rebuke the North Carolina Republican in recent weeks.
Politico reported that McCarthy told Republican lawmakers in a closed-door meeting that he would talk to Cawthorn after some of their colleagues expressed consternation over Cawthorn's implication about sex and drugs.
McCarthy publicly rebuked Cawthorn on March 18 for a separate brouhaha over Cawthorn calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a "thug."

     House Republicans Angry With Junior Member for Claiming They’re Cool as Hell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every so often, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy says—meaningfully—that he will have a stern chat with one of his fellow Republican House members.
The remarks, which Cawthorn made on a podcast last week, have stirred up the QAnon wing of the party yet again, and Cawthorn’s fellow Republicans are peeved that they’re getting bugged about it.
podcast, said House of Cards’ depiction of D.C. as a hotbed of sleaze, sex, and drugs is totally accurate.
This could have passed as a dumb thing a spiraling member of the House said on a podcast that was forgotten a day later.
But the allegation has spread enough that members, including GOP members, are getting asked about it by their constituents.

     Cawthorn’s orgies-and-drugs comment stirs trouble within Freedom Caucus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Perry himself could face further questions about Cawthorn’s place in the Freedom Caucus.
The Freedom Caucus is “way ahead of that at this point,” Perry added.
Other group members, however, shrugged it off and said they did not hear the matter raised on Monday night, when the Freedom Caucus met for its broader weekly meeting.
Within the Freedom Caucus, which still does not publicly disclose its full roster, Cawthorn’s remarks landed with their own force.
Multiple Republican aides and members told POLITICO that members of the Freedom Caucus — who support traditional family values — were particularly alarmed by Cawthorn’s seeming readiness to broach sex and drugs.

     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) said on a podcast earlier this week that fellow lawmakers have invited him to orgies and done cocaine in front of him.

You should come,’” Cawthorn said on the Warrior Poet Society podcast.
A former friend, Bradley Ledford, said Cawthorn falsely accused him of leaving the future congressman to die in the burning car.
So it’s difficult to believe that Cawthorn is now telling the truth about the unsavory habits of his fellow Republicans.
Cawthorn hasn’t been tempered by bad press or by credible accusations of sexual misconduct or the opprobrium of his own party.
