     Biden signs bill making lynching a federal hate crime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Darlene Superville | Associated PressWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed a bill into law to make lynching a federal hate crime, more than 100 years after such legislation was first proposed.
It only hides.”The new law makes it possible to prosecute a crime as a lynching when a conspiracy to commit a hate crime leads to death or serious bodily injury, according to the bill’s champion, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill.
The House approved the bill 422-3 on March 7, with eight members not voting, after it cleared the Senate by unanimous consent.
Rush also had introduced a bill in January 2019 that the House passed 410-4 before that measure stalled in the Senate.
A federal hate crime statute eventually was passed and signed into law in the 1990s, decades after the civil rights movement.
