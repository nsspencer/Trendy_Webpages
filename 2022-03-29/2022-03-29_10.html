     CNN: ‘Realistic chance’ Hunter Biden could be indicted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A top legal analyst at CNN said it is possible President Biden’s son Hunter Biden could be indicted by the U.S. government following an investigation into his foreign business dealings.
Former President Trump relentlessly attacked President Biden over his son’s struggles with addiction and what he alleged to be corrupt overseas business affairs during the 2020 presidential campaign.
On Tuesday, Trump took his attacks on the Bidens a step further, asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to release any damning information the Russian government may have on Hunter Biden.
Yet The Washington Post this week published a 3,000-word investigative report confirming key details of Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China.
The Justice Department is reportedly continuing to look into potential illegal lobbying allegations against a consulting firm tied to Ukrainian energy company Burisma, on whose board Hunter Biden once sat.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The federal investigation into President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over his tax affairs has intensified in recent weeks, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.
