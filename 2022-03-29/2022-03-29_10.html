     Masters 2022: Tiger Woods visits Augusta, still unclear if he'll play tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the weekend, a video surfaced showing Woods playing a round at his home course of Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Fla., and various reports have suggested Woods has ramped up his practice in recent weeks with a goal of teeing it up at Augusta National.
Woods is a five-time winner of the Masters, and this year's tournament marks 25 years since his first major championship victory there.
He has said that while he will return to golf, his time as a "full-time" golfer are over and that he will have to play a limited schedule moving forward.

     Masters 2022: Tiger Woods practicing at Augusta National in attempt to play major next week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world has been on alert across the last few days as we wait for Tiger Woods to announce whether he will play the 2022 Masters at Augusta National.
He is playing Augusta National on Tuesday in an attempt to get some prep work in ahead of the 86th edition of the tournament.
This after it was reported that Woods' caddie, Joe LaCava, joined him in Florida for those aforementioned rounds at Medalist.
That's to be celebrated, of course, because a tournament with Tiger Woods in attendance is always better than one in which he's absent, but it's certainly different than what we've come to expect from Woods.
In 23 Masters appearances, Tiger has five victories and and astounding 14 top-10 finishes.

     Summary: Woods suffered serious injuries to his right leg and right foot in a car wreck on Feb. 23, 2021.
He had open fractures in the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula in his right leg.
He told reporters at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in late November that doctors nearly had to amputate his right leg.
"My right leg does not look like my left leg, let's put it that way."
In December, Woods played in the unofficial PNC Championship with Charlie.

     Summary: Woods was last seen three weeks ago at PGA TOUR Headquarters for his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
“You will see me on the PGA TOUR, I just don’t know when,” Woods told CBS’ Jim Nantz on the telecast of last month’s The Genesis Invitational.
“I’m a lot stronger than I was (at the PNC),” Woods said from The Riviera Country Club.
Videos also recently appeared on social media that showed Woods walking at his home club, Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida, with his caddie, Joe LaCava.
Woods is reportedly using his rounds this week to gauge if his legs can withstand walking the hilly grounds of Augusta National.

     Summary: Tiger Woods practices at Augusta National ahead of the Masters, fueling speculationShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailTiger Woods at the 2020 Masters, walking alongside his caddie Joe LaCava.
Getty ImagesWhat started as hopeful rumors among the most ardent supporters of Tiger Woods became a reality Tuesday as Woods set foot on Augusta National.
According to reports from Sports Illustrated’s Bob Harig, Woods is playing the course Tuesday alongside his son, Charlie, and world No.
Speculation about Woods’ Masters prep initially reached a peak Tuesday morning when reports about his private jet were confirmed that it was traveling from West Palm Beach northbound to Augusta.
Though that has been faulty speculation in the past, sure enough, video footage surfaced of Woods’ plane on the tarmac.
