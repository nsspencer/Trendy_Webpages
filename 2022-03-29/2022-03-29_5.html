     Madison Cawthorn Should Name Who Invited Him to Orgy, Meghan McCain Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freshman Congressman Madison Cawthorn, a North Carolina Republican, is facing calls to reveal more information about his recent claims that fellow lawmakers in Washington have invited him to an orgy and done cocaine in front of him.
McCain, a TV personality and daughter of the late John McCain, speculated that those lawmakers are likely MAGA supporters.
"So, Madison Cawthorne [sic] only hangs out with hard core MAGA people in DC..." McCain began.
Earlier this month, Cawthorn faced criticism from the party for referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a "thug."
Senator Richard Burr, a fellow North Carolina Republican, said in an interview on Tuesday that Cawthorn has "been an embarrassment at times."

     Kevin McCarthy reportedly confronted over Madison Cawthorn's cocaine and orgy comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reportedly plans to talk to North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn about the freshman congressman's recent comments regarding some of his colleagues.
During a recent podcast appearance, Cawthorn compared Washington D.C. to the Netflix hit "House of Cards" — and accused lawmakers of... things.
McCarthy, who hails from Bakersfield, reportedly promised to address the matter with Cawthorn.
In November, McCarthy reportedly got into a "heated exchange" with Texas Rep. Chip Roy over 13 Republicans voting for a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden.
At that same meeting, McCarthy had to address Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar tweeting an anime video that depicted him killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

     Summary: Every so often, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy says—meaningfully—that he will have a stern chat with one of his fellow Republican House members.
The remarks, which Cawthorn made on a podcast last week, have stirred up the QAnon wing of the party yet again, and Cawthorn’s fellow Republicans are peeved that they’re getting bugged about it.
podcast, said House of Cards’ depiction of D.C. as a hotbed of sleaze, sex, and drugs is totally accurate.
This could have passed as a dumb thing a spiraling member of the House said on a podcast that was forgotten a day later.
But the allegation has spread enough that members, including GOP members, are getting asked about it by their constituents.

You should come,’” Cawthorn said on the Warrior Poet Society podcast.
A former friend, Bradley Ledford, said Cawthorn falsely accused him of leaving the future congressman to die in the burning car.
So it’s difficult to believe that Cawthorn is now telling the truth about the unsavory habits of his fellow Republicans.
Cawthorn hasn’t been tempered by bad press or by credible accusations of sexual misconduct or the opprobrium of his own party.
