     Kenneth Branagh Explores Death on the Nile's Love Triangle in an Exclusive Clip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖Director and producer Kenneth Branagh breaks down the racy love triangle between Linnet Ridgeway Doyle (Gal Gadot), Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer), and Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey) in an exclusive clip from Death on the Nile.
The clip from 20th Century Home Entertainment is titled "Love Triangle" and puts the focus on our three central characters, with Branagh explaining how Linnet comes between Simon and Jacqueline, with the latter plotting her revenge.
He continues: "So a human love triangle that goes bad is the rotten fruit at the center of this murderous holiday [laughs]."
Death on the Nile opened with $12.8 million over its first three days at the box office.
Branagh and writer Michael Greene are well aware of this and clearly love the literary icon's work.
