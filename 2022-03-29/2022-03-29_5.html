     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reportedly plans to talk to North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn about the freshman congressman's recent comments regarding some of his colleagues.
During a recent podcast appearance, Cawthorn compared Washington D.C. to the Netflix hit "House of Cards" — and accused lawmakers of... things.
McCarthy, who hails from Bakersfield, reportedly promised to address the matter with Cawthorn.
In November, McCarthy reportedly got into a "heated exchange" with Texas Rep. Chip Roy over 13 Republicans voting for a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden.
At that same meeting, McCarthy had to address Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar tweeting an anime video that depicted him killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
