     Safety harness, seat were locked in 14-year-old boy's death on Florida park ride, accident report says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The safety harness and seat of the 14-year-old boy who fell to his death from an amusement park ride in Florida last week were still locked at the end of the ride, according to the accident report.
Tyre fell when the magnets engaged to slow the ride as passengers came down the tower, according to the report filed by the ride operator to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Safety experts and other riders have questioned why the ride did not have a secondary safety belt in addition to the over-the-shoulder harness.
Such a belt is generally a standard part of ride safety in similar attractions and could have been life-saving, Ken Martin, a Virginia-based amusement park safety analyst who works with parks, fairs, government entities, insurance companies and attorneys, told USA TODAY.
A person riding the drop tower can be heard questioning its restraints before it took off in a clip published by WESH 2 News.

     ICON Park pushes to suspend 2 rides after death of 14-year-old boy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Orlando's ICON Park is pushing to suspend two rides operated by the SlingShot Group after a 14-year-old boy died when he fell off one of the company's attractions at the Florida park.
In a statement, park officials demanded the company suspend the Orlando FreeFall and the Orlando SlingShot after Tyre Sampson fell off the FreeFall ride last Thursday.
"As the landlord of the 20-acre entertainment destination in the center of the Orlando Entertainment District, ICON Park’s mission is to provide safe, family entertainment," park authorities said.
When contacted by The Hill, a person who said they were a manager for the StarFlyer said the SlingShot Group declined to comment.
The FreeFall ride was new and inspected for the first time in December, according to officials with the state department.
