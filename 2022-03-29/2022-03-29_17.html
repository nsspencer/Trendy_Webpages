     NFL Rumors: Jabrill Peppers, Patriots agree to one-year contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jabrill Peppers' visit with the New England Patriots went well, it appears.
The free-agent safety has agreed to a one-year contract with the Patriots after meeting with the team Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter and Mike Reiss reported Tuesday.
Peppers was a highly-touted defensive back out of Michigan and went 25th overall to the Cleveland Browns in the 2017 NFL Draft.
Versatile safety the Patriots could use in a variety of roles.
https://t.co/N5B9peGFst — Phil Perry (@PhilAPerry) March 29, 2022Peppers is also an experienced punt returner who could help fill Gunner Olszewski's void following his signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

     Summary: Mike Tannenbaum dissects Bill Belichick's coaching tree and whether Matt Patricia can effectively replace him as head coach of the Patriots once he retires.
(0:56)PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The New England Patriots and free-agent safety Jabrill Peppers have reached agreement on a one-year deal that is worth up to $5 million, sources told ESPN on Tuesday.
The 5-foot-11, 215-pound Peppers joins a safety group headlined by longtime captain Devin McCourty, veteran Adrian Phillips and third-year player Kyle Dugger.
Peppers' 2021 season ended prematurely when he ruptured the ACL in his right knee during a Week 6 win over the Carolina Panthers.
He is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, sources told ESPN.

New England hosted Jabrill Peppers on Monday, who spent the last three seasons with the New York Giants.

     Patriots signing former first-rounder Jabrill Peppers, per report; ex-Giants safety recovering from torn ACL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots have stayed relatively quiet during the 2022 NFL offseason, but they added a notable name to their defense on Tuesday, reaching an agreement with former Giants starter and first-round pick Jabrill Peppers on a one-year deal, according to ESPN.
The 26-year-old Peppers, who suffered a torn ACL in 2021, is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, per Adam Schefter, when he figures to compete for a top spot in New England's safety rotation.
Peppers, who brings 59 games of starting experience from his time with the Browns (2017-2018) and Giants (2019-2021), is likely to split time on the back end, if not also at linebacker.
Traded to the Giants as part of the Odell Beckham Jr. deal, he's played a full season just once, however, missing five games in 2019 due to a back fracture and all but six games in 2021 with a high-ankle sprain and ACL tear.
Peppers is the third former Browns defender added by New England this year, after cornerback Terrance Mitchell and linebacker Mack Wilson, who was acquired via trade in exchange for Chase Winovich.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots have added a versatile player in Jabrill Peppers who could contribute in so many ways in 2022.
Throwing it all the way back to his days with the Michigan Wolvers, Peppers played 11 positions between offense, defense and special teams.
In the NFL, Peppers has been a similarly multiple contributor, whether as a returner on special teams or a three-down safety.
He’s an impressive player who does many of the same things that New England’s safeties — especially Adrian Phillips and Kyle Dugger — already do.
But the Patriots will likely find a way to make use of him in one way or another.

     Summary: Jabrill Peppers is leaving home again, and this time he's following the man who coached him for the last two years with the New York Giants.
Judge, who was fired as head coach of the Giants at season's end, returned to the Patriots as an offensive assistant coach on Bill Belichick's staff.
Peppers, 26, spent the last three seasons with the Giants, the last two as a captain under Judge.
Then things fell apart for the Giants, and prior to Judge's ouster and Brian Daboll's arrival as head coach, Peppers suffered a knee injury that ended his season.
Peppers' season ended when he tore the ACL in his right knee during a Week 6 win over the Carolina Panthers at MetLife Stadium.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots reportedly hosted veteran free agent safety Jabrill Peppers on Monday and the immediate reaction for most might have been along the lines of, ‘Sure.
The Michigan alum has experience in the Patriots scheme having played under Joe Judge in each of the last two seasons.
The Patriots declined to tender a contract to wide receiver and punt returner Gunner Olszewski, who then proceeded to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It could be assumed the team is looking to replace that production on special teams this offseason.
Peppers screams Patriots, and his visit Monday very well could signal an intent for both sides to work out a contract.
