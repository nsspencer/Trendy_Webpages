     Snow Squall Leads to 50-Car Pileup on Pennsylvania Highway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Several people were killed and more than two dozen were injured after a blinding snow squall on Monday led to a fiery pileup of at least 50 vehicles, including several tractor-trailers, on a Pennsylvania interstate, the authorities said.
On Tuesday, as rescuers worked to clear the extensive wreckage from the interstate, the state police confirmed there were fatalities but said they were still working to get an accurate total.
The wreckage was “far from being clear” from the roadway, Trooper David Beohm, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said on Tuesday in a telephone interview.
“We searched all vehicles that were not on fire,” he said.
The Associated Press reported at least three people were killed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video captured the scene of a massive pileup on Monday along a Pennsylvania highway during a snow squall, killing at least three people and injuring more than a dozen others.
A screengrab from video shows the deadly pileup along Interstate 81 on March 28, 2022, near Minersville, Pennsylvania.
John Blickley, the Schuylkill County Office of Emergency Management’s deputy coordinator, said a snow squall clouded visibility and likely contributed to the crash.
A screengrab from video shows the fiery scene of the pileup along Interstate 81 on March 28, 2022, near Minersville, Pennsylvania.
"Think of a snow squall like a miniature blizzard with gusty winds that typically lasts less than an hour," FOX Weather says of the conditions.
