    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Andy Dalton lands with new team, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Longtime Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton has found his new team in the New Orleans Saints, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Dalton is signing a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, including $3 million guaranteed, with the Saints, per the report.
He will likely serve as a backup to Jameis Winston, who agreed on a two-year, $28 million deal with New Orleans on March 21.
This will be Dalton’s third team in three seasons since being released by the Bengals in 2020.
Drafted by the Bengals in the 2nd round of the 2011 NFL Draft, Dalton spent nine seasons in Cincinnati with much success.

     Former Bengals QB Andy Dalton loves playing against his old team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From 2011 to 2019, Andy Dalton was the starting quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals.
During his time in the Queen City, Dalton led the Bengals to the playoffs five times.
In that game, Dalton threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns in a blowout Cowboys win.
Dalton faced the Bengals in Week 2 of the 2021 season, making it the first time he squared off against Burrow.
While Dalton could have avoided playing the Bengals by signing with an NFC team each year, it’s been quite the opposite.

     Summary: The Bears' signing of quarterback Trevor Siemian became official on Tuesday after it had been reported last week.
ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network reported the signing at $6 million with $3 million guaranteed for one season.
When Dalton signed with the Bears, he got $10 million for one season, eight games and six starts.
In fact, Dalton didn't even last as long as Glennon, who made it through Week 4 before giving way.
He suffered a bone bruise to a knee in the second quarter of Week 2 against Cincinnati with the Bears leading 7-0.

     Andy Dalton to Saints; Bengals could face him for third straight season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, the backup quarterback market is still solidifying before the NFL Draft next month.
A familiar face to Cincinnati Bengals fans has found yet another new home for the 2022 season.
That is to say that clearly the idea is to have Dalton as the backup quarterback.
This left a pretty big void at backup quarterback that Dalton fits very nicely in.
Another interesting note is that since Dalton was released by the Bengals prior to the 2020 season, he has played his former team each season.

     Saints sign QB Andy Dalton to back up Jameis Winston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday that the Saints are signing Andy Dalton to a one-year contract worth $3 million guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
Enter Dalton, who lands in a spot where he'll play the veteran backup role while giving him a chance to start if Winston isn't healthy, is ineffective, or gets re-injured.
After nine years as the Cincinnati Bengals starter, Dalton has become a nomad.
He signed in Dallas in 2020 to be Dak Prescott's backup before an injury forced Dalton into nine starts.
News of the Dalton signing comes after new head coach Dennis Allen said Tuesday that Taysom Hill will be focusing on the tight end role.
