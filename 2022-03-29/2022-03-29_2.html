     Soccer’s Biggest Show Will Have Its Biggest Star: Ronaldo And Portugal Qualify For 2022 World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before Portugal’s World Cup qualifying playoff game vs. North Macedonia Cristiano Ronaldo said, “There is no World Cup without Portugal.” Have no fear soccer fans, there will be a World Cup this year courtesy of Portugal defeating North Macedonia 2-0 on Tuesday to secure a spot in the 2022 World Cup.

This would end up playing right into Portugal’s hands as one quick counterattack in the 65th minute caught North Macedonia out of position.
