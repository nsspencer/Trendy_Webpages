     Soccer’s Biggest Show Will Have Its Biggest Star: Ronaldo And Portugal Qualify For 2022 World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before Portugal’s World Cup qualifying playoff game vs. North Macedonia Cristiano Ronaldo said, “There is no World Cup without Portugal.” Have no fear soccer fans, there will be a World Cup this year courtesy of Portugal defeating North Macedonia 2-0 on Tuesday to secure a spot in the 2022 World Cup.
Fans feared they might not see Ronaldo at the World Cup after the initial UEFA playoff draw pitted Portugal and defending European champions Italy in the same bracket.
This would end up playing right into Portugal’s hands as one quick counterattack in the 65th minute caught North Macedonia out of position.

     Portugal 2-0 North Macedonia live: Latest updates from World Cup play-offs as Bruno Fernandes helps Portugal qualify
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Portugal booked their place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after a brace from Bruno Fernandes helped them to a 2-0 win over North Macedonia in Porto.
The Manchester United midfielder scored two well-taken goals either side of half-time to secure Portugal’s qualification for their sixth consecutive World Cup finals.
Moments later, Portugal almost took the lead when Diogo Jota met a Fernandes corner at the back post, but his powerful header bounced over the bar.
North Macedonia gave the ball away cheaply in their own half and the chance was seized upon by Ronaldo, who combined well with Fernandes, who slotted a low shot past Dimitrievski from a central position.
North Macedonia, on the other hand, can hold their heads high after a superb qualifying journey, which included a stunning victory against the European champions, Italy.
