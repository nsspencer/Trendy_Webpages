     Summary: A more than century-long effort to pass anti-lynching legislation culminated Tuesday when President Joe Biden signed a landmark bill that makes lynching a federal hate crime.
But the Senate passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act in March, setting it up for a Biden signature.
Then, four nights later on Aug. 28, two men abducted Till from his relatives’ home in the middle of the night.
Roy and Milam were put on trial for Till’s murder just weeks later, but they were acquitted by an all-white, male jury.
Following their acquittal, they were paid to confess to Till's murder for a magazine story.
