     Nigeria 1-1 Ghana, Senegal 1-0 Egypt live updates: Follow key Africa 2022 World Cup play-offs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ghana qualified for their fourth World Cup after defeating West African rivals Nigeria on away goals in Abuja.
The visitors took the lead after just 11 minutes when Thomas Partey fired from range towards goal.
The effort looked to be relatively comfortable for Super Eagles goalkeeper Francis Uzoho, but the shot-stopper made an awful mess of the shot to gift the Black Stars a vital away goal.
The hosts were unable to break down an impenetrable Black Stars defence in the second half, meaning they will sit out their first World Cup since 2006.
Boulaye Dia scored in the fourth minute as the Lions of Teranga won the second leg 1-0 for a 1-1 aggregate draw.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadio Mane delivered the winning spot kick as Senegal edged Egypt 3-1 on penalties at the end of a tempestuous World Cup playoff second leg in Dakar on Tuesday to win a place at the finals in Qatar later this year.
Boulaye Dia scored in the fourth minute as Senegal won the second leg 1-0 for a 1-1 aggregate draw at the new Diamniadio Olympic Stadium, which was packed with a capacity 50,000 crowd hours before kickoff.
The nerve-filled shootout started with four misses, including from both captains - Kalidou Koulibaly and then Mohamed Salah - but Mane won the shootout, reprising his heroics in last month’s Africa Cup of Nations final.
Egypt had netted a fourth-minute goal last Friday in the first leg in Cairo but that advantage was quickly eroded on Tuesday.

     World Cup qualifiers: Sadio Mane sends Senegal to Qatar as they beat Egypt on penalties again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadio Mane delivered the winning spot kick as Senegal edged Egypt 3-1 on penalties at the end of a tempestuous World Cup playoff second leg in Dakar on Tuesday to win a place at the finals in Qatar later this year.
Egypt had netted a fourth-minute goal last Friday in the first leg in Cairo but that advantage was quickly eroded on Tuesday.
But for Ghana, and their newly appointed technical advisor Chris Hughton, it is a major triumph in a qualification campaign in which they never really impressed and had looked a shadow of the side that reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2010.
Nigeria thought they had a second when Victor Osimhen scored, but the VAR correctly ruled he was offside in the build-up.
