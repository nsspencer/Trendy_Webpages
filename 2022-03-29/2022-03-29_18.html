     Top Takeaways from Warriors vs. Grizzlies with Stephen Curry, Ja Morant Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 3Jesse D. Garrabrant/Getty ImagesThe Memphis Grizzlies moved to 18-2 without Ja Morant on Monday night.
The second-place team in the Western Conference easily beat the short-handed Golden State Warriors, who were on the final leg of a five-game road trip.
Golden State is gearing up for a six-game stretch that starts at home on Wednesday against Phoenix Suns in which it will try to hold on to the No.
The Grizzlies are five games ahead of the Warriors.
The Grizzlies will not be able to win a title without Morant, but they could win a first-round series with Bane, Brooks and others in starring roles while Morant gets healthier.

One thing is for sure: the Grizzlies are having a much better season than Iguodala and the Warriors.
