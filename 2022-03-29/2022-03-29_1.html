     Summary: In 2020, Variety reported that Ezra Miller appears in a video in which they choke a woman at a bar in Reykjavik, Iceland.
The seven-second video of Miller grabbing “the girl by the throat” and “throwing her to the ground,” went viral—though there were few repercussions.
According to reports, Miller allegedly became frustrated by “a group of eager fans, who were ‘quite pushy’” when things escalated.
More recently, and less controversially, Miller suggested that members of the Ku Klux Klan kill themselves.
“This is a message for the Beulaville chapter of the North Carolina Ku Klux Klan,” Miller said in an Instagram video.
