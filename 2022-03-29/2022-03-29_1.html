     Curious About ‘Moon Knight’? Here’s What You Need to Know.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Created by the writer Doug Moench and the artist Don Perlin, Moon Knight debuted in a 1975 issue of the horror-adventure comic Werewolf by Night as a mercenary out to capture the series’s title monster.
That classic all-white look has survived for the TV version.
For later versions of the character, other writers gave him dissociative identity disorder, and the aliases became separate personalities.
In Disney’s “Moon Knight,” Isaac begins as Steven Grant, who is not a billionaire but rather a meek gift shop employee at a British museum.
By the end of the first episode, he begins to understand that whenever he is unconscious, his body is being inhabited by the troubled mercenary Marc Spector.

     Moon Knight Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s not to say this new Moon Knight mini-series is about some obscure figure.
With the right pizazz, however, that origin is worth delving into—and surely star Oscar Isaac could make it watchable, right?
As shaped by showrunner Jeremy Slater, Moon Knight introduces us to Steven Grant (Isaac), a nobody working at London’s National Gallery who has trouble sleeping and often loses track of entire days.
Both men share one body, however, which is further crowded by Khonshu, the Egyptian God of the Moon (voiced by F. Murray Abraham).
I like Isaac and Hawke and I enjoy the overall vibe of Moon Knight in concept, a comic book tale that features all these strange, disparate elements.

     MOON KNIGHT features quality that waxes and wanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Disney+)In general, Moon Knight does better than most fictional depictions of DID, but that’s a very low bar.
Speaking of visuals, the costuming, especially on Moon Knight and Mr. Knight—a white three-piece suit-wearing version of the hero—are striking in exactly the right ways.
As a former avatar of Khonshu, Harrow knows the attention the vestiges of Moon Knight bring.
Moon Knight fighting an invisible jackal monster should make for something spooky and disquieting, but it never visually coheres.
Additionally, for a show called Moon Knight, it provides very little of either version of the white-wrapped wielder of vengeance.

     Oscar Isaac gets to be a hero, dork, and Egyptian god in Moon Knight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first moments of Moon Knight alert you that our protagonist, British gift shop worker Steven Grant (Oscar Isaac), is a little unusual.
The disgusting idea of gritty sediment in your sheets and between your toes aside, the implication here is that Grant knows he’s sleepwalking.
It’s not difficult to read between the lines and see how Marvel is positioning Moon Knight to operate as an allegory for mental health.
I suppose all heroes get there eventually (perhaps because of the contractual obligations of the MCU), but as Moon Knight shows us in flashes, it might be more powerful when they don’t.
Moon Knight is streaming on Disney+.

     Review: A Mind Bendingly Strong Beginning For ‘Moon Knight’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suffice to say, all three of us were pretty impressed with what we’ve seen so far from the Oscar Isaac-led Marvel series.
As I mentioned in some “first impressions” posts on my Twitter, Moon Knight really came out swinging with one of the strongest opening episodes of any Marvel series.
Hope you enjoyed my review of the first four episodes of Moon Knight which starts streaming on Disney+ tomorrow!

     Moon Knight Review: Marvel's latest series gets off to a promising start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a storytelling tactic, these blindspots already give Moon Knight a different narrative rhythm from the MCU properties that preceded it (on screens both big and small).
Which begs the question: What is happening to Steven Grant?
The joy of this pilot is how Grant’s bumbling persona becomes our introduction to the occult world of Moon Knight.
For just as Arthur is convinced in a higher power who’ll guide him well in the path ahead, I am hopeful that Moon Knight can keep the promise of what’s on display here.
Oh, and yes, we must ask all the big questions we’ve been left with here (on top of “Who is Moon Knight?”).
