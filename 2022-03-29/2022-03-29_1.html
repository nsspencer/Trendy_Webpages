     Portugal 2-0 North Macedonia live: Latest updates from World Cup play-offs as Bruno Fernandes helps Portugal qualify
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Portugal booked their place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after a brace from Bruno Fernandes helped them to a 2-0 win over North Macedonia in Porto.
The Manchester United midfielder scored two well-taken goals either side of half-time to secure Portugalâ€™s qualification for their sixth consecutive World Cup finals.
Moments later, Portugal almost took the lead when Diogo Jota met a Fernandes corner at the back post, but his powerful header bounced over the bar.
North Macedonia gave the ball away cheaply in their own half and the chance was seized upon by Ronaldo, who combined well with Fernandes, who slotted a low shot past Dimitrievski from a central position.
North Macedonia, on the other hand, can hold their heads high after a superb qualifying journey, which included a stunning victory against the European champions, Italy.
