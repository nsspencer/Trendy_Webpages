     Summary: The U.S. said Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains under threat even after Russia promised to scale back military operations there.
De-escalation does not mean a cease-fire or complete withdrawal of troops from around Kyiv, said a person close to the Kremlin.
Moscow’s likely war goals now are to take two eastern provinces, together with a land corridor from the Russian border to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, they said.

     Summary: Russia vows to reduce Ukraine attacks after talks, but the U.S. is skepticalEnlarge this image toggle caption Cem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Cem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesPeace talks between Russia and Ukraine appeared to deliver the first tentative signs of progress on Tuesday, as Russia said it would significantly scale back its military activity around Kyiv and northern Ukraine.
Ukraine proposes to accept a neutral and nonnuclear statusDuring Tuesday's round of talks, Ukraine delivered a proposal for accepting a neutral and nonnuclear status, including a plan to host no foreign military bases.
Russian military leaders signaled a shift of focus toward maintaining a hold over the eastern Donbas region.
Russia first deployed its troops into east Ukraine on Feb. 24, declaring "a special military operation" to disarm Ukraine and claiming "genocide" against Russian speakers of Donbas.
Turkey is one of the NATO nations that is seeking to maintain good relations with both Ukraine and Russia.

     ‘Not naive’: Ukraine questions Russian pledge to reduce attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Peace talks to resume as Ukraine and the West warn Moscow may be preparing a major offensive despite a promise to reduce military operations near Kyiv and Chernihiv.
Ukraine has reacted with incredulity to Russia’s promise in negotiations to scale down military operations around the capital, Kyiv, and another main city Chernihiv.
“The Ukrainians have said, ‘well actually we stopped you from coming into Kyiv since the war began’.
“We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,” spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.
Russia calls its assault a “special military operation” to disarm and “de-Nazify” Ukraine.

Ukraine and Western leaders had cautioned that Moscow's apparent peace gesture at Tuesday's talks in Istanbul was a cover for reorganizing forces that had failed to take Kyiv.
Irpin itself was recaptured by Ukrainian forces this week.
Russian forces were shelling nearly all cities along the region's frontline on Wednesday, said the governor of Donetsk, which is part of the Donbas.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”.
“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so?

Western officials and security analysts cautioned against taking at face value Russia’s statements about its aims in Kyiv or elsewhere.
Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.
Though it is a NATO member, Turkey has refused to put in place sanctions against Russia, even as it offers military support to Ukraine.
They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Russian war in Ukraine has proven itself to be one of the most consequential political events of our time — and one of the most confusing.
On paper, Russia’s military vastly outstrips Ukraine’s.
The Ukraine war has produced a similarly sized exodus in just a month, leading to truly massive refugee flows to its European neighbors.
In his speech declaring war on Ukraine, Putin all but openly vowed that any international intervention in the conflict would trigger nuclear retaliation.
The current draft agreement, per the Financial Times, does preclude Ukrainian NATO membership, but it permits Ukraine to join the EU.
