    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan got destroyed last time it played Louisville earlier in the season — could it get revenge with the program’s first-ever Final Four berth on the line?
The Cardinals started out hot from 3, which caused an early deficit until the maize and blue started getting hot themselves.
The fourth quarter started with a 5-0 Louisville run to push the lead back to seven.
But Michigan didn’t give up, cutting the lead to just two, yet again, halfway through the fourth quarter.
But if Michigan was going to come back and win the game, it would have to do it without Leigha Brown, who was injured in the fourth quarter.
