     Summary: Have you been receiving spam text messages that appear to come from your own phone number?
Verizon said it is working to block spam texts some customers say they have received from their own numbers.
Several customers have complained about the spam texts, which say they've paid a March bill while offering a free gift redeemed through a mysterious link.
A USA TODAY reporter also received a similar spam text on Monday, which offered a free gift for paying a bill.

     Your Next Spam Text Might Come From Your Own Number
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Are you getting spam text messages sent from your own phone number?
Confused smartphone owners are receiving spam text messages from themselves, especially lately, and you should never click links in the message.
All major carriers in the United States suggest that owners forward spam messages in a text to the number “7726” which stands for SPAM.
Again, do not click the link in the text message or any fishy-looking link, for that matter.
I don’t click any links in a text message unless I know good and well who it came from and where it’s going.

     Summary: If you get a text message that looks to be from yourself, don't click on it.
That's the sage advice of experts and of Verizon, which has received numerous complaints about customers getting spam text messages that seem to come from their own phone numbers.
Another who reported getting the same message said the "link goes to a Russian State-Operated Live TV broadcast."
I’ve seen a significant increase in spam texts, including spoofed messages, that appear to come from my own mobile number.
Verizon customer support is taking a different tone today after many reports of customers receiving spam texts from their own number.

     Verizon Customers Report Receiving Spam Text Messages From Their Own Numbers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNETIf you're a Verizon customer who's been getting mysterious spam text messages that have a link attached and come from your own phone number, you're not alone.
Multiple Verizon customers have reported receiving similar messages this week, in which they're encouraged to click an obscure link to receive a gift.
In other cases, Verizon customers reported that the mysterious link in the spam text message took them to a Russian news outlet.
"Verizon is aware that bad actors are sending spam text messages to some customers which appear to come from the customers' own number," a Verizon representative said in a statement sent via email.
The uptick in spam messages mobile phone users are receiving comes after the US government doubled down on its fight against robocalls.

     People Are Getting Spam Text Messages From Their Own Cell Number

     Summary: He wrote: "This morning, I received a very blatant spam text offering me 'a little gift' for supposedly paying my phone bill.
Although phone users are advised never to click on links that could be spam, the reporter wanted to investigate.
One tweeter, using the handle @jeffNDfan, posted: "So I just got a spam text from my own cell number.
It revealed Americans received 87.8 billion spam text messages – an increase of 58 per cent compared to the year before.
But it's unclear if that would be helpful in this case, since phone users would effectively be reporting their own phone number as a scam line.
