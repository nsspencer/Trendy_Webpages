     Live updates as Ghana and Senegal beat Nigeria and Egypt to qualify for World Cup: Reaction to Africa 2022 World Cup play-offs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ghana qualified for their fourth World Cup after defeating West African rivals Nigeria on away goals in Abuja.
The visitors took the lead after just 11 minutes when Thomas Partey fired from range towards goal.
The effort looked to be relatively comfortable for Super Eagles goalkeeper Francis Uzoho, but the shot-stopper made an awful mess of the shot to gift the Black Stars a vital away goal.
The hosts were unable to break down an impenetrable Black Stars defence in the second half, meaning they will sit out their first World Cup since 2006.
Boulaye Dia scored in the fourth minute as the Lions of Teranga won the second leg 1-0 for a 1-1 aggregate draw.

     Lasers Ruin Penalty Shootout As Sadio Mane Sends Senegal To World Cup After Egypt's Mo Salah Misses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lasers Ruin Penalty Shootout As Sadio Mane Sends Senegal To World Cup After Egypt's Mo Salah MissesSenegal are going to Qatar 2022 after beating Egypt in another penalty shootout.
Sadio Mane scored the winning spot-kick for Senegal, after Liverpool teammate Mo Salah had sent his penalty over the crossbar.
Egypt have now lost back-to-back shootouts against Senegal, who beat them by the same method in February's Africa Cup of Nations final.
Salah had not taken a penalty in the AFCON final as he was Egypt's fifth taker and the shootout was over by the time his turn came around.
They did not need it though, as Mane converted Senegal's fifth penalty to wrap up a 3-1 win in the shootout.

     World Cup qualifiers: Sadio Mane sends Senegal to Qatar as they beat Egypt on penalties again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadio Mane delivered the winning spot kick as Senegal edged Egypt 3-1 on penalties at the end of a tempestuous World Cup playoff second leg in Dakar on Tuesday to win a place at the finals in Qatar later this year.
Egypt had netted a fourth-minute goal last Friday in the first leg in Cairo but that advantage was quickly eroded on Tuesday.
But for Ghana, and their newly appointed technical advisor Chris Hughton, it is a major triumph in a qualification campaign in which they never really impressed and had looked a shadow of the side that reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2010.
Nigeria thought they had a second when Victor Osimhen scored, but the VAR correctly ruled he was offside in the build-up.
