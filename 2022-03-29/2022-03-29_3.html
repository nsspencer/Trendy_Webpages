     ‘Moon Knight’ Review: Raiders of the Lost Identity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The hero of the new Marvel Comics series, “Moon Knight,” has a superior costume.
His wife, who has an abundance of common sense and very little patience, yells at him: “Summon the suit!
Summon the suit!” But he just dithers or pouts or stares at her blankly while the bad guys close in.
With “Moon Knight,” which premieres Wednesday on Disney+, it also has to do with concept and casting.
The show features a relatively minor Marvel hero, created in the 1970s, whose defining character trait is what is now known as dissociative identity disorder.

     Summary: In Marvel's uneven 'Moon Knight,' Oscar Isaac waxes and wanesEnlarge this image toggle caption Csaba Aknay/Marvel Studios Csaba Aknay/Marvel StudiosThe 'reluctant hero' cliche is a tough thing to get right.
In Marvel's Moon Knight, Steven Grant (Oscar Isaac), the meek museum gift-shop clerk who learns that his sleepwalking condition is more a sleepmurdering condition, is your classic Option 2 kind of guy.
But in the underwritten role of Marc, Isaac seems determined to disavow his natural actorly charisma to play a glum, laconic cipher.
Moon Knight is mostly not about Moon KnightYou might notice I haven't gotten around to Moon Knight himself, yet.
Moon Knight, though a Marvel Universe series, maintains a narrow, almost hermetic focus on the Steven/Marc dynamic in its early episodes.

     Moon Knight review: Oscar Isaac can’t save Marvel’s unbearable new show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Premiering on March 30, Moon Knight stars Oscar Isaac as Marc Spector (aka, Moon Knight), a vigilante with Dissociative Identity Disorder and super-powers rooted in the Ancient Egyptian god of the Moon, Khonshu.
With Isaac and Hawke as the leads, Moon Knight has the starpower to do something great.
Mister Knight in Moon Knight.
Episode 4 is where Moon Knight finally gets interesting — and harkens back to the comics in ways I won’t spoil here.
Then again, the Moon Knight character still has the potential to disrupt this broader universe once he’s escaped from his subpar introduction.

     Summary: In the months leading up to “Moon Knight,” the hype was real.
But the show isn’t necessarily about Moon Knight the hero, but rather the personality behind the mask.
“Moon Knight” is not a show where a hero hits the streets to start fighting crime.

     Moon Knight review: the return of Marvel’s resurrection machine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: True to Moon Knight’s roots in Marvel’s horror comics, Moon Knight dabbles in moments of genuinely unsettling visual mayhem as it’s first introducing Khonshu — a lumbering, skeksis-like being who’s invisible to most everyone but a perpetually-terrified Steven.
But Steven’s willingness to trust the voice in his head is what gives birth to the MCU’s Moon Knight, a billowing specter of fury and vengeance powered by ancient moon magic and an impressive amount of Marvel’s VFX.
Moon Knight might have been able to work as a show about a man at war with himself as he single-handedly battled against hordes of demons while also trying to hold down a job at a museum.
Rather than going that route, though, the show pits the new Moon Knight — that is, Steven / Marc as Moon Knight — against Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke), a former partner of Khonshu’s whose twisted sense of justice led to the two parting ways sometime in the past.
The Batman comparisons are apt here if only because of how brutal Moon Knight often is and the hero’s penchant for dramatic leaps from tall buildings to show off the striking shape of his cape.

     Review: A Mind Bendingly Strong Beginning For ‘Moon Knight’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suffice to say, all three of us were pretty impressed with what we’ve seen so far from the Oscar Isaac-led Marvel series.
As I mentioned in some “first impressions” posts on my Twitter, Moon Knight really came out swinging with one of the strongest opening episodes of any Marvel series.
Hope you enjoyed my review of the first four episodes of Moon Knight which starts streaming on Disney+ tomorrow!
