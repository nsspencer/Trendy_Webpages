     Saints sign Andy Dalton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Saints weren’t done signing quarterbacks when they brought Jameis Winston back.
Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton has agreed to a one-year contract with the Saints, with $3 million guaranteed and a maximum value of $6 million, according to multiple reports.
So Dalton’s presence gives the Saints a reliable backup who may have to start, at least early in the season.
The 34-year-old Dalton spent his first nine NFL seasons with the Bengals, then spent one year with the Cowboys and one with the Bears.
He joins a quarterback room that also includes Ian Book and Blake Bortles behind Winston on the depth chart.

     Andy Dalton signs one-year deal with Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton is poised to join the fourth team of his career in 2022.
The Saints are reportedly signing Dalton to a one-year contract to presumably serve as Jameis Winston’s backup in New Orleans, as first reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
An 11-year veteran, Dalton will likely slot into the Saints quarterback room as a veteran backup after the franchise re-signed Winston to a two-year deal earlier this offseason.
Dalton lined up under center in the Bears first two regular season games before a knee injury sidelined him in Week 3.
When all was said and done, Dalton made six starts for Chicago, while appearing in eight regular season games.

     Ex-Bears QB Andy Dalton signs with Saints to back up Jameis Winston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PALM BEACH, Fla. — Former Bears quarterback Andy Dalton is signing a one-year, $3 million with the Saints, a source said, to be Jameis Winston’s backup.
Former Bears general manager Ryan Pace and former coach Matt Nagy thought signing Dalton, now 34, was the key to unlocking the struggling offense.
Shortly after signing Dalton, the Bears traded up to draft Justin Fields at No.
“Last year was kinda weird,” Fields said in January.
Incidentally, the Bears replaced Dalton with former Saints backup Trevor Siemian.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Longtime Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton has found his new team in the New Orleans Saints, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Dalton is signing a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, including $3 million guaranteed, with the Saints, per the report.
He will likely serve as a backup to Jameis Winston, who agreed on a two-year, $28 million deal with New Orleans on March 21.
This will be Dalton’s third team in three seasons since being released by the Bengals in 2020.
Drafted by the Bengals in the 2nd round of the 2011 NFL Draft, Dalton spent nine seasons in Cincinnati with much success.

     Summary: (0:40)The New Orleans Saints' quarterback room will have a new look in 2022.
Meanwhile, coach Dennis Allen confirmed Tuesday that New Orleans plans to use Taysom Hill primarily as a tight end.
Dalton, 34, certainly qualifies as an upgrade after starting 148 career games with a 77-69-2 record with the Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys and Bears over his 11-year career.
"I think the role for Taysom really is going to be a lot more of the kind of F tight end, move tight end type of role.
Dalton spent his first nine seasons as Cincinnati's starting quarterback after being drafted in the second round in 2011.

     Saints sign QB Andy Dalton to back up Jameis Winston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday that the Saints are signing Andy Dalton to a one-year contract worth $3 million guaranteed, per a source informed of the agreement.
Enter Dalton, who lands in a spot where he'll play the veteran backup role while giving him a chance to start if Winston isn't healthy, is ineffective, or gets re-injured.
After nine years as the Cincinnati Bengals starter, Dalton has become a nomad.
He signed in Dallas in 2020 to be Dak Prescott's backup before an injury forced Dalton into nine starts.
News of the Dalton signing comes after new head coach Dennis Allen said Tuesday that Taysom Hill will be focusing on the tight end role.
