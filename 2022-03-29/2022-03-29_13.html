     Summary: Mike Tannenbaum dissects Bill Belichick's coaching tree and whether Matt Patricia can effectively replace him as head coach of the Patriots once he retires.
(0:56)PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The New England Patriots and free-agent safety Jabrill Peppers have reached agreement on a one-year deal that is worth up to $5 million, sources told ESPN on Tuesday.
The 5-foot-11, 215-pound Peppers joins a safety group headlined by longtime captain Devin McCourty, veteran Adrian Phillips and third-year player Kyle Dugger.
Peppers' 2021 season ended prematurely when he ruptured the ACL in his right knee during a Week 6 win over the Carolina Panthers.
He is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, sources told ESPN.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots have added a versatile player in Jabrill Peppers who could contribute in so many ways in 2022.
Throwing it all the way back to his days with the Michigan Wolvers, Peppers played 11 positions between offense, defense and special teams.
In the NFL, Peppers has been a similarly multiple contributor, whether as a returner on special teams or a three-down safety.
He’s an impressive player who does many of the same things that New England’s safeties — especially Adrian Phillips and Kyle Dugger — already do.
But the Patriots will likely find a way to make use of him in one way or another.

     Summary: The New England Patriots have been very passive in free agency, and that mindset has led to starters like JC Jackson leaving for greener pastures.

     Patriots signing former first-rounder Jabrill Peppers, per report; ex-Giants safety recovering from torn ACL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots have stayed relatively quiet during the 2022 NFL offseason, but they added a notable name to their defense on Tuesday, reaching an agreement with former Giants starter and first-round pick Jabrill Peppers on a one-year deal, according to ESPN.
The 26-year-old Peppers, who suffered a torn ACL in 2021, is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, per Adam Schefter, when he figures to compete for a top spot in New England's safety rotation.
Peppers, who brings 59 games of starting experience from his time with the Browns (2017-2018) and Giants (2019-2021), is likely to split time on the back end, if not also at linebacker.
Traded to the Giants as part of the Odell Beckham Jr. deal, he's played a full season just once, however, missing five games in 2019 due to a back fracture and all but six games in 2021 with a high-ankle sprain and ACL tear.
Peppers is the third former Browns defender added by New England this year, after cornerback Terrance Mitchell and linebacker Mack Wilson, who was acquired via trade in exchange for Chase Winovich.

     Former Giants Safety Jabrill Peppers Inks Deal with Patriots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jabrill Peppers, the former Giants starting strong safety and primary punt returner, is moving on to a fresh start with the New England Patriots.
Joe Judge might not be the Giants head coach anymore--he's not even the head coach of the New England Patriots, for that matter.
But it would not be surprising if Judge, who during his time in New York was a self-professed big fan of safety Jabrill Peppers, was behind the New England Patriots' move to sign the unrestricted free agent.
According to Adam Schefter, Peppers signed a one-year deal with the Patriots, reuniting with Judge, who was re-hired by head coach Bill Belichick as an offensive assistant.
Before being relieved of his head coaching duties by the Giants, Judge often spoke glowingly of Peppers, a two-time team captain for Judge's Giants for whom Judge showed empathy given the player's injury status.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots reportedly hosted veteran free agent safety Jabrill Peppers on Monday and the immediate reaction for most might have been along the lines of, ‘Sure.
The Michigan alum has experience in the Patriots scheme having played under Joe Judge in each of the last two seasons.
The Patriots declined to tender a contract to wide receiver and punt returner Gunner Olszewski, who then proceeded to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It could be assumed the team is looking to replace that production on special teams this offseason.
Peppers screams Patriots, and his visit Monday very well could signal an intent for both sides to work out a contract.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to a report from Mike Reiss of ESPN, the Patriots are signing former Giants safety Jabrill Peppers to a contract, Peppers had reportedly visited with New England on Monday.
Peppers' versatility has long been an intriguing fit in New England, and though his position might say safety, he's well-versed in linebacker and slot roles within the defense, along with special teams.
Peppers will be looking to get healthy and back on track in New England where his versatility will be put to good use.
Peppers can play just about anywhere and has two years of experience working with Joe Judge.
"While Peppers doesn't have the production teams expect from first-round defenders, he should benefit from a role that is more clearly defined on the next level."
