     Summary: Evan Rachel Wood shares many abuse allegations against Marilyn Manson in "Phoenix Rising."
Some of said allegations directly correlate to her Jewish ancestry.
Evan Rachel Wood shares many abhorrent abuse allegations – including rape – against former beau Marilyn Manson in her new two-part documentary "Phoenix Rising," airing on HBO this week.
Some of these allegations directly correlate to her Jewish ancestry, a revelation that should not be overlooked.
In "Phoenix Rising: Part I: Don't Fall," Wood says Manson has an affinity for Adolf Hitler, stating he filled paintings with swastikas and Nazi imagery.

     Evan Rachel Wood Says Marilyn Manson Tortured Her With Nazi Whip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Radar reported, Wood’s latest claims against Manson revealed in Phoenix Rising come just days after Manson – whose real name is Brian Warner – filed a lawsuit against the actress, claiming that her allegations against him are a “malicious falsehood” that have since “derailed” his career in the entertainment industry.
“This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career,” the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month, reads.

     Summary: “From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using,” Wood said.
So essentially, he didn’t want me using birth control.
Phoenix Rising concludes with the moment when Wood publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time in 2021.
Manson has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual assault.
Before the televised premiere of Phoenix Rising, Manson sued Wood and Illma Gore for defamation.

     Summary: Evan Rachel Wood.
(Getty)Evan Rachel Wood said she has the “truth on her side” after her alleged abuser Marilyn Manson sued her for defamation.
He denies sexually assaulting Evan Rachel Wood or any of the other women, and has filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood.
“People in my life said, ‘You need to get a restraining order.’ And I said, ‘Absolutely not, absolutely not.’ Getting a restraining order seemed absolutely crazy to me, because I was like, ‘You’re only going to make him more mad.
Howard King, Warner’s attorney, said in a statement to ABC News: “As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In “Phoenix Rising,” a new HBO documentary about actor Evan Rachel Wood’s struggle to name her alleged abuser and reclaim her story, we see how telling completely upends her life.
Evan Rachel Wood and Marilyn Manson arrive for the after-party for a special screening of "Across the Universe" at Bette in New York in September 2007.
In 2019, Wood also appeared in front of the California Senate to testify in behalf of a bill she proposed, the Phoenix Act.
In fact, the documentary’s name refers to the Phoenix Act, which passed in California in January 2020.
During her testimony, Wood said she was inspired to push the Phoenix Act after she realized she wasn’t alone.

     Phoenix Rising Documentary Complicated by Manson Lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In no scenario would Phoenix Rising have gone down easy.
Complicating matters is the defamation lawsuit that Manson filed earlier this month against Wood and Illma Gore.
Manson’s complaint reiterates his denial of any wrongdoing and accuses Wood of having “handpicked co-conspirators” to bolster her abuse claims.
It’s worth repeating that Phoenix Rising ends in February 2021 when Wood named Manson as her abuser.
AdvertisementWhether he’s telling the truth or not, his complaint constitutes interference and it complicates the Phoenix Rising viewing experience.

     Summary: Evan Rachel Wood has described in horrific detail how her ex-boyfriend Marilyn Manson allegedly tied her up, beat her with a Nazi whip, and electrically shock her genitals when she tried to break up with him.
'After he tied me up, and hit me over and over and over again with a whip.
'I didn't know what meth was, I didn't know I was doing meth,' she says, adding that she'd be covered in scars from picking her skin.
'I didn’t know where to go, so I was the perfect candidate for somebody to pop up and say, "Come with me,"' she says.
She recalls how he suddenly kissed her, that he 'stuck his tongue down my throat... Everything went white and I just didn’t know how to respond.'
