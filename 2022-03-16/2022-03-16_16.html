     Summary: Evan Rachel Wood shares many abuse allegations against Marilyn Manson in "Phoenix Rising."
Some of said allegations directly correlate to her Jewish ancestry.
Evan Rachel Wood shares many abhorrent abuse allegations – including rape – against former beau Marilyn Manson in her new two-part documentary "Phoenix Rising," airing on HBO this week.
Some of these allegations directly correlate to her Jewish ancestry, a revelation that should not be overlooked.
In "Phoenix Rising: Part I: Don't Fall," Wood says Manson has an affinity for Adolf Hitler, stating he filled paintings with swastikas and Nazi imagery.

     Summary: “From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using,” Wood said.
So essentially, he didn’t want me using birth control.
Phoenix Rising concludes with the moment when Wood publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time in 2021.
Manson has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual assault.
Before the televised premiere of Phoenix Rising, Manson sued Wood and Illma Gore for defamation.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In “Phoenix Rising,” a new HBO documentary about actor Evan Rachel Wood’s struggle to name her alleged abuser and reclaim her story, we see how telling completely upends her life.
Evan Rachel Wood and Marilyn Manson arrive for the after-party for a special screening of "Across the Universe" at Bette in New York in September 2007.
In 2019, Wood also appeared in front of the California Senate to testify in behalf of a bill she proposed, the Phoenix Act.
In fact, the documentary’s name refers to the Phoenix Act, which passed in California in January 2020.
During her testimony, Wood said she was inspired to push the Phoenix Act after she realized she wasn’t alone.

     Why Evan Rachel Wood Doc ‘Phoenix Rising’ Was More Challenging Than Amy Berg’s Past Projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ***Why did you decide to split Phoenix Rising up into two parts, and what was the overall intention with the second part?
We didn’t negotiate; Evan was an open book from start to finish with me, so there was no negotiation.
I spoke to him early on and told him about what we were doing, but we didn’t really talk about interviewing him.
At one point in the film, Evan says that “her team” attempted to dissuade her from going public with her Manson allegations to protect her career.
I didn’t really want to widen the lens too much; I didn’t really want to do a bunch of talking-head interviews.

     Summary: Evan Rachel Wood has described in horrific detail how her ex-boyfriend Marilyn Manson allegedly tied her up, beat her with a Nazi whip, and electrically shock her genitals when she tried to break up with him.
'After he tied me up, and hit me over and over and over again with a whip.
'I didn't know what meth was, I didn't know I was doing meth,' she says, adding that she'd be covered in scars from picking her skin.
'I didn’t know where to go, so I was the perfect candidate for somebody to pop up and say, "Come with me,"' she says.
She recalls how he suddenly kissed her, that he 'stuck his tongue down my throat... Everything went white and I just didn’t know how to respond.'
