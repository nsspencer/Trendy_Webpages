     Kanye West Suspended From Instagram For One Day After Posting Slur Targeting Trevor Noah
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after the rapper posted a slur targeting The Daily Show host Trevor Noah, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.
As part of the temporary suspension, West — who legally goes by “Ye” — will not be able to post, comment or send DMs, the spokesperson said.
Earlier on Wednesday, West directed a slur toward Noah after the talk show host addressed the contentious divorce between the Donda artist and Kim Kardashian.
I do however care when I see you on a path that’s dangerously close to peril and pain.
But you have to know the difference between that and fighting your family,” Noah wrote.

     Kanye West insults Trevor Noah after host likens harassment of Kim Kardashian to abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TV host Trevor Noah came out guns blazing Tuesday night with a monologue that discussed the harassment Kim Kardashian is experiencing from ex-husband Kanye West.
The rapper, now known as Ye, responded Wednesday morning by calling “The Daily Show” host a racist slur.
His slam on Noah was part of Ye’s most recent social-media tear, which included new criticisms of “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who has been dating Kardashian.
“I’m not saying Kanye will,” Noah said.
Since then, Kardashian has changed her lifestyle, no longer making information about her location and her jewelry readily available on social media.
