     Fed Raising Interest Rates 25 Basis Points, Warns Of Even More Rate Hikes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (New York, NY) — Interest rates are being raised by the Federal Reserve for the first time in more than three years.
The quarter of a percentage point hike will have Americans seeing higher credit card and mortgage rates.
Meantime, the central bank warned more rate hikes could be coming in the future as well.
The Fed has been allowing for massive amounts of credit to help curb fears of a possible global recession caused by the pandemic.

     Fed raises interest rates for first time in 3 years, projects 6 more hikes as inflation soars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The widely anticipated move – that the Fed would raise rates by 25-basis points – brings to an end the ultra-easy monetary policy put in place two years ago to prop up the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
It marks a considerable shift from just six months ago, when half of the central bankers believed interest rate increases were not warranted until at least 2023.
Fed officials also expect inflation to remain elevated, ending 2022 at 4.3% – far above the Fed's annual target of 2.3%.
Although Fed officials carefully telegraphed to the public their rate-hike plans, the Russian invasion of Ukraine , which has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis, has upended those plans.
"All signs that are this is a strong economy, and one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."

     Why rates are going up.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prices for groceries, couches and rent are all climbing rapidly, and Federal Reserve officials have been warily eyeing that trend.
On Wednesday, they took their biggest step yet toward counteracting it, raising their policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
That small change carries a major signal: Policymakers have fully pivoted to inflation-fighting mode and will do what is necessary to make sure price gains do not remain hot for months and years to come.
The Fed is acting at a tense moment for many consumers and investors.
Here’s what happened, and what it is likely to mean for markets and the economy.

     Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for the first time since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates for the first time since 2018, the central bank announced Wednesday at the conclusion of its highly anticipated two-day monetary policy meeting.
Thequarter-percentage-point increase had been well telegraphed by the central bank, with Powell hinting at it repeatedly over the past few months.
The central bank has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment at the maximum.
The central bank has six meetings left this year.
Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit the US economy and are already putting upward pressure on inflation, Powell said Wednesday.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time since 2018Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday for the first time since 2018, kick-starting its efforts to tackle the country's highest inflation in four decades.
On average, Fed policymakers said they expect interest rates, which have been near zero, to climb to around 1.9% by the end of this year.
"It's going to be quite some time before interest rates themselves become a headwind to the economy," McBride said.
Rising interest rates will quickly result in higher borrowing costs for credit cards and car loans.
"They're going to be very slow to raise interest rates and pass along those benefits to savers, if they even do so at all."

     How will higher interest rates affect American finances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit card interest rates and the costs of an auto loan will also likely move up.
The Fed’s initial quarter-point rate hike Wednesday in its benchmark short-term rate won’t have much immediate impact on most Americans’ finances.
“The impact of a single quarter-point interest rate hike is inconsequential on the household budget,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.
Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers.
They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.
