     Hogwarts Legacy release window set for Holiday 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Hogwarts Legacy release window has been set for 'Holiday 2022' as part of a special PlayStation State of Play live stream.
Initially due to launch in 2021, the game was then delayed into 2022 with the caveat that it would arrive after Fantastic Beasts 3.
Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world RPG set in the world of Harry Potter, albeit in the 1800s - so several hundred years before The Boy Who Lived and friends wandered the halls.
It's here you'll be able to practice potions, as well as build a menagerie of magical beasts to call your own - Newt Scamander-style.
Hogwarts Legacy is launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and PC.

     Hogwarts Legacy’s big gameplay trailer reveals holiday 2022 release date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s, about 100 years before Harry Potter enrolls.
In Hogwarts Legacy, the player character is a new wizard or witch, except they’re starting as a fifth-year student.
Though the game fits into the overall Harry Potter canon, creator J.K. Rowling is not involved in Hogwarts Legacy’s creation.
Immediately after announcing Hogwarts Legacy in September 2020, last Warner Bros. Games distanced the project from her in light of Rowling’s public, and transphobic, remarks on gender identity.
So the reception Hogwarts Legacy gets from the general public will be closely watched.

     Hogwarts Legacy Is Apparently Coming To Nintendo Switch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As for Rowling herself, I've spoken before how I have somewhat Conservative views as a person of the Christian faith.
I don't fault Rowling for speaking her mind, necessarily, though I think some of her comments have been needlessly inflammatory.
If you happen to be trans, whether or not we see eye-to-eye, I still love you, and you deserve respect.
Someone may not agree with Rowling's views and feel personally hurt by them, so they don't necessarily feel great about buying the game.
Maybe they're even trans themselves, so now they feel like they aren't accepted by conservative OR liberal-minded people.

     JK Rowling's Anti-Transgender Stance And Hogwarts Legacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While GCFs will often publicly state they only believe "some" trans women will target cisgender women, their language implicates all trans women, often only discussing trans women in such contexts.
While GCFs will often publicly state they only believe "some" trans women will target cisgender women, their language implicates all trans women, often only discussing trans women in such contexts.
In 2018, Australian GCF Shelia Jeffrey described trans women to UK parliament as "parasites," language that frames trans people as subhuman.
All of this finally brings us back to the Harry Potter franchise and Hogwarts Legacy.
If you would like to help support transgender causes, please consider donating to the National Center for Transgender Equality or the Transgender Law Center.
