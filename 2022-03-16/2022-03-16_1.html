     Buffalo Bills sign defensive end Von Miller to a six-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was 10 years ago that the Buffalo Bills made a big splash in free agency when they signed Mario Williams to a $100 million contract.
A decade later the Bills once again sign one of the top defensive ends available by agreeing to a six-year deal with former Los Angeles Rams pass rusher Von Miller.
Miller spent most of his career with the Denver Broncos after they drafted him second overall in 2011.
Buffalo Bills get that top tier edge rusher to transform their defenseThe Buffalo Bills had one of the top defenses in the NFL but one area they really struggled with was getting consistent pressure on the quarterback.
The Buffalo Bills certainly had to pay a premium price to achieve this but now have the most talented pass rusher since they added Mario Williams 10 years ago.

     Rams lose another super contributor as Von Miller gets six-year deal with Buffalo Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams will attempt to “run it back” without outside linebacker Von Miller.
The Rams attempted to retain him, but Miller announced in an Instagram video that he was signing with the Bills.
Donald clearly enjoyed playing with Miller, a certain Hall of Famer who encouraged Donald to become a more vocal leader.
The Rams had prioritized re-signing Miller, tackle Joe Noteboom and center Brian Allen, along with receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who suffered a knee injury during the Super Bowl.
Noteboom and Allen agreed to terms with the Rams on Monday, and the Rams announced that Noteboom signed his contract Wednesday.

     Summary: 3 / 12FILE - In this Sept. 29, 2019, file photo, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew (15) throws a pass under pressure from Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, left, during the first half of an NFL football game in Denver.
Denver has lost both home games on last-second field goals.
... One way to turn that around would be for star linebacker Miller to start getting to quarterbacks.
Miller has 10Â½ sacks in his last 10 home games but just two sacks this season.

     Bills, Von Miller Agree To Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The decorated edge rusher is set to sign with the Bills, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com tweets.
Miller is heading to Buffalo on a six-year deal worth $120MM, Rapoport adds (on Twitter).
The rental worked out, but the Bills giving Miller his second $100MM-plus contract weakens Los Angeles’ pass rush.
This also marks yet another NFC-to-AFC transaction on the edge rusher circuit.
Gregory, Miller, Chandler Jones, Za’Darius Smith and Khalil Mack are now in the AFC, which features some oft-discussed quarterbacks as well.
