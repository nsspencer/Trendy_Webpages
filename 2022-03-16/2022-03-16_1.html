Gary ParrishClick to enlarge Gary's bracketYes, once again, I'm picking Gonzaga to win the national title.
I've maintained the entire season that teams as low as the 4-line are good enough to make it to New Orleans.
There have been great Gonzaga teams -- even some better than this one.
This Gonzaga team isn't last year's squad, and is a bit more flawed, but it's certainly good enough to finish the job.
