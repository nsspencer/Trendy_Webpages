Gary ParrishClick to enlarge Gary's bracketYes, once again, I'm picking Gonzaga to win the national title.
I've maintained the entire season that teams as low as the 4-line are good enough to make it to New Orleans.
There have been great Gonzaga teams -- even some better than this one.
This Gonzaga team isn't last year's squad, and is a bit more flawed, but it's certainly good enough to finish the job.

The Red Raiders are the 13th best team in the country per the consensus rankings of 59 different methods and also boast the No.
The Longhorns are the 15th best team per Pomeroy’s ratings and feature an opportunistic defense that forces turnovers on over 23 percent of possessions.
5 Iowa is a solid contrarian Final Four, and a bracket with Houston or Iowa winning eliminates almost the entire field from contention.
