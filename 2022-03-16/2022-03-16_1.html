     Summary: Well, March has been here for a couple of weeks, but the most important part of March has arrived: the NCAA Tournament.
This week, 68 teams will begin competing to take home the national title in college basketball.
There are a handful of teams, however, that will come from lower seeds and surprising regions, ready to upset the balance of college basketball.
That’s the beauty of college basketball.
Let’s rank the 10 teams most likely to win the national championship next month, working in reverse order (to build intrigue, naturally).

Three of those victories came at the SEC tournament over Florida, No.
Williams also said that his research focused on who was on the selection committee and how those members were chosen.
“Until there is complete transparency and accountability, the system will stay broken and this will continue to happen.”More College Basketball Coverage:

Gary ParrishClick to enlarge Gary's bracketYes, once again, I'm picking Gonzaga to win the national title.
I've maintained the entire season that teams as low as the 4-line are good enough to make it to New Orleans.
There have been great Gonzaga teams -- even some better than this one.
This Gonzaga team isn't last year's squad, and is a bit more flawed, but it's certainly good enough to finish the job.

     Iowa vs. Richmond: Previewing Game One of the NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Iowa to accomplish this goal, it must first contend with the Richmond Spiders, a surprising qualifier to the field of 64 who earned four of its 23 wins by running the table in the A-10 conference tournament.
Perhaps that’s why DraftKings Sportsbook set the opening line at Iowa -9 - the highest of any 5/12 matchup in the tournament.
Iowa and Richmond both excel in two of the same areas: creating turnovers and preventing their opponents from doing the same.
Richmond is averaging 7.9 steals per game with Iowa close behind them at 7.4, while both teams rank in the top ten in the country in fewest turnovers allowed per game (9.2 for Iowa and 9.8 for Richmond).
If Iowa struggles with ball security in this game, don’t be surprised to see Richmond keep things competitive long enough to make Hawkeye fans nervous.

     Summary: If you’re an NBA fan who hasn’t watched a minute of college basketball this season, welcome to the party.
Then subtract Shaedon Sharpe, who isn’t actually playing for Kentucky right now, and that’s 41 prospects in action this week.
Potential matchups against Memphis, UConn, Texas Tech or Duke, physical teams that can make him uncomfortable, would be analyzed closely.
I spent three days last week at the ACC tournament evaluating Banchero and a Duke team with five projected first-rounders.
5 on our most recent Big Board, but his shooting struggles over the past couple months have been getting nitpicked by NBA teams.
