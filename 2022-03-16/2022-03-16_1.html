     Emotional Buzz Williams blasts NCAA selection committee for excluding Texas A&amp;M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buzz Williams voices his frustration with the NCAA tournament selection process after Texas A&amp;M was not picked to be in the field.
1 seed as one of the first four teams left out of the 68-team NCAA tournament bracket.
With three wins in Tampa, Florida -- part of a seven-game winning streak -- it was anticipated that Texas A&amp;M had played its way into the NCAA tournament.
He said his research also focused on the selection committee itself: its members, how they are appointed -- "in other words, what committee selected the committee?"
"After studying all this nonstop the last two days and looking at it from every vantage point," he continued, "it defies logic that we are not in the NCAA tournament."

Three of those victories came at the SEC tournament over Florida, No.
Williams also said that his research focused on who was on the selection committee and how those members were chosen.
“Until there is complete transparency and accountability, the system will stay broken and this will continue to happen.”More College Basketball Coverage:

     The NCAA Tournament’s Best Upset Picks Are Not Exactly Cinderellas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As caretaker of a frighteningly powerful NCAA tournament prediction algorithm, Ezekowitz doesn’t waste time on identifying the No.
For a machine tasked with making bold predictions, Ezekowitz’s creation is admirably modest: It only picks the upsets that are most likely to happen.
Michigan may be the only one identified by the algorithm, but it isn’t the only upset you should pick.
Here are some others to keep in mind before your bracket is due—and how the Ezekowitz model’s odds contrast with the win probabilities from Pomeroy and the crowd’s picks on ESPN.
But they have the best shot of any team outside the Big Ten because of their incredible offense, which ranks No.

Then subtract Shaedon Sharpe, who isn’t actually playing for Kentucky right now, and that’s 41 prospects in action this week.
Potential matchups against Memphis, UConn, Texas Tech or Duke, physical teams that can make him uncomfortable, would be analyzed closely.
I spent three days last week at the ACC tournament evaluating Banchero and a Duke team with five projected first-rounders.
5 on our most recent Big Board, but his shooting struggles over the past couple months have been getting nitpicked by NBA teams.
