     Summary: On Sunday, the field of contenders shrunk to just 68, teams as the NCAA Tournament selection committee revealed the 2022 NCAA Tournament bracket for the first time.
Gary ParrishClick to enlarge Gary's bracketYes, once again, I'm picking Gonzaga to win the national title.
I've maintained the entire season that teams as low as the 4-line are good enough to make it to New Orleans.
There have been great Gonzaga teams -- even some better than this one.
This Gonzaga team isn't last year's squad, and is a bit more flawed, but it's certainly good enough to finish the job.
