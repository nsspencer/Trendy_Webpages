    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tokyo (CNN) A 7.3-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Japan on Wednesday, cutting power to millions of homes and leading to a tsunami advisory being issued around the Fukushima prefecture, where a 2011 quake caused a disaster at a nuclear power plant.
A bullet train derailed near Fukushima as a result of the earthquake but no injuries were reported, he said at a press conference.
People injured from the quake have been taken to the hospital in Fukushima's Soma city, Kyodo News agency reported, without specifying the number of people injured.
Power has been restored in all of Tokyo, Tokyo Electric Power said.
Japan's Meteorological Agency on Thursday urged the public to watch out for more seismic activity in the next few days.

     Japan hit by 7.3-magnitude earthquake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 jolted Japan's northeast coast on March 16, shaking buildings as far away as Tokyo.
Earthquake Detailed Report – 3/16At around 11:36pm, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 occurred offshore Fukushima Prefecture at a depth of 60km.
#earthquake pic.twitter.com/nnD83Kuzkd — NERV (@EN_NERV) March 16, 2022That’s still enough to inundate some vulnerable pockets of the shoreline, but Japanese infrastructure is designed around mitigating earthquake and tsunami risk.
The March 11, 2011, earthquake in Japan registered more than a 9 on the moment magnitude scale — meaning it released about 355 times as much energy as Thursday’s quake.
That’s because the moment magnitude scale isn’t linear.
