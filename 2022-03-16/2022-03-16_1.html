     NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament: Top-24 teams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sweet 16 probables, and possible party-crashers...What follows is a prediction of the Sweet 16 field in the NCAA Tournament (with rankings based roughly on my confidence in the teams making the Sweet 16), eight teams that might crash my predicted Sweet 16 (regardless of region), and my prediction for the rest of the NCAA Tournament (Elite Eight, Final Four, Champion) with any comments if I feel they are needed.
Comments:I will never understand why so many lower-seeded teams get home-court advantage in the NCAA Tournament.
Rutgers will win a couple games before running into the Texas Tech buzzsaw, and Michigan State matches up well against both Davidson and Duke.
The TRUE depth-charts and rankings of the ACTUAL Top-16 (plus-8) NCAA Tournament men’s basketball teams:(Please DO let me know about factual or obvious omissions and errors)1.
Despite that potential scare, Baylor has too much experience and moxie to lose before the Sweet 16.
