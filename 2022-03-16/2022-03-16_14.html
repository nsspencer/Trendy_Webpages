    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year, Purim begins the night of Wednesday, March 16 and ends the night of Thursday, March 17.
SEATTLE — Jewish people all over the world are celebrating a big holiday this week, but not many people outside the religion know about it.
It's called Purim.
In Hebrew, Purim means "lots," as in "casting lots," like flipping a coin today – a way to finish a debate.
During the holiday, Jews often wear costumes to synagogue, sing happy songs, keep perspective on freedom by donating charity to the poor and eat lots and lots of sweets.

     Chabad in Kishinev looks to provide Purim cheer for Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The narrow alleyway leading to the Chabad House in Kishinev, Moldova, was blocked by a truck; the beautiful, 130-year-old synagogue is undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
“We planned on only doing a cosmetic renovation,” said Rabbi Zusha Abelsky.
Since the war in Ukraine began, he hasn’t left Kishinev, even though his wife and children are across the ocean.
“On [Wednesday afternoon] we will erect a large tent in the yard, with heaters, where we will read the Scroll of Esther,” said Rabbi Abelsky.
Every Chabad emissary knows that even in normal times, Passover plans begin as early as Hanukkah.
