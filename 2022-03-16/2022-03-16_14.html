     Chabad in Kishinev looks to provide Purim cheer for Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The narrow alleyway leading to the Chabad House in Kishinev, Moldova, was blocked by a truck; the beautiful, 130-year-old synagogue is undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
“We planned on only doing a cosmetic renovation,” said Rabbi Zusha Abelsky.
Since the war in Ukraine began, he hasn’t left Kishinev, even though his wife and children are across the ocean.
“On [Wednesday afternoon] we will erect a large tent in the yard, with heaters, where we will read the Scroll of Esther,” said Rabbi Abelsky.
Every Chabad emissary knows that even in normal times, Passover plans begin as early as Hanukkah.

     Summary: A Disney film inspires a slew of Jewish parodies.
(New York Jewish Week) – Students at Brooklyn’s Yeshivah of Flatbush are celebrating Purim by joining a new-old tradition of writing and singing pop song parodies for Jewish holidays.
This was the first year the school made a Purim parody video, but it certainly won’t be the last.
There are just over 1,400 students in the Yeshivah of Flatbush lower school, which includes an early childhood program, as well as an elementary and middle school.
“We wanted to empower our students to deliver that message themselves.”The students, she said, are very excited about how the video turned out.

     What is Purim? Meaning of the Jewish holiday explained, the story behind it, and when it falls in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jewish holiday of Purim is here once again, and it is a time of year for celebration.
Purim is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the defeat of an attempted genocide of the Jews of the Persian Empire around the fifth century BCE.
At the 11th hour, Esther revealed to the king that she was Jewish, meaning Haman’s plan would result in her death.
A Jewish girl, Esther, found favour in his eyes and became the new queen, though she refused to divulge her nationality.
Fancy dress is a must, with girls dressing up as Queen Esther, boys as King Ahasuerus and rabbis donning comedy hats.

     Summary: On Purim, Jews fought back against the Persians.
During the Shoah, Jews fought back — in the ghettos and sometimes in the camps.
“F— with me/us and you die.”A total Jewish revenge fantasy — which projected a different ending to World War II.
Then, there is “Defiance,” starring Daniel Craig, about the heroic Bielski brothers, who saved Jews in Belarus during World War II.
But, on the other hand, such revenge fantasies constitute the yetzer ha-ra, the base inclination of the Jews.
