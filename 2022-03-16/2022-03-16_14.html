     Chelsea put off-field woes aside to reach Champions League last eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LILLE, France, March 16 (Reuters) - Holders Chelsea made light of their off-pitch problems to reach the Champions League quarter-finals by beating Lille 2-1 away on Wednesday to complete a 4-1 aggregate victory.
French champions Lille dominated for long spells and opened the scoring thanks to a Burak Yilmaz penalty in the opening half, but lacked precision up front and paid dearly for lapses in concentration.
Football is the priority at Chelsea, that's why we're focused on what happens on the pitch," Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel told French TV channel RMC Sport.
Jocelyn Gouvennec's side put Chelsea on the back foot as Mateo Kovacic, Jorginho and N'Golo Kante struggled to take control of the midfield.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ricketts Family and Ken Griffin are set to tabel a bid 'well in excess of' $3 billion for Chelsea Football Club to Raine Group on Friday.
As per Ben Jacobs, the details of the $3 billion bid have been revealed.
The sources close to the bid state that the Ricketts Family have the desire to 'maintain' on-field and 'modernise' off-field.
It was earlier reported that the Ricketts Family are at the 'head of the queue' to purchase Chelsea as they will join hedge fund billionaire Griffin to mount a 'blockbuster' bid for Chelsea.
It is believed that the Ricketts Family have the 'most complete bid' of all interested parties due to their experience rebuilding the Cubs' stadium, as redevelopment of Stamford Bridge is required.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pulisic scored his second goal in his past three appearances for Chelsea as the defending UEFA Champions League winners advanced into the quarterfinals by a 4-1 aggregate scoreline.
Burak Yilmaz cut Lille’s deficit to 2-1 on aggregate with his 38th minute penalty-kick goal, but Pulisic re-extended Chelsea’s advantage before halftime.
The 23-year-old received a stellar pass from Jorginho in the box before unleashing a right-footed shot into the bottom-left corner from a tight angle.
Pulisic was substituted off in the 74th minute with Chelsea’s FA Cup quarterfinal tie at Middlesbrough coming up on Saturday.
Chelsea will learn its opponents for the UCL quarterfinals on Friday, with fellow English Premier League sides Manchester City and Liverpool also advancing to the final eight.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have been urged to remove the logo of sponsor Three from their match-day shirts “as soon as possible” by the British telecommunications company.
But Chelsea have had to keep the company’s logo on the front of their match-day shirts in order to meet the terms of the special licence the club received from the government to keep operating.
Three have now urged Chelsea to find a way of removing their logo from the club’s shirts “as soon as possible”.
A Three spokesperson said: “We understand from discussions with Chelsea FC that there are ongoing issues with removing the Three logo from the shirts, as a result of kit supply issues and licence restrictions.
However, license restrictions have prevented Three’s logo from being removed from all of the club’s physical assets, such as perimeter boards.
