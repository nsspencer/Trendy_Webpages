     What happens to the stock market when the Fed raises interest rates?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point stocks fell, but then reversed course.
Historically, stocks have tended to move higher after the Federal Reserve raises rates.
But basing your investment decision off past market performance is dangerous, said a senior investment research specialist.
In theory, stocks should perform worse when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The common convention is as follows: If the Fed raises what's known as the Federal Funds rate – the interest rate commercial banks charge each other to borrow money – to compensate banks must raise interest rates on loans to businesses and individuals.

     Fed Raises Interest Rates for First Time Since 2018: Latest News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are a few things we learned:–The Fed is moving to a more hawkish position, determined to bring down inflation however possible.
Mr. Powell warned that we may see high inflation readings through the middle of the year before they start to come down.
–The Fed is looking to take some of the air out of the labor market.
Mr. Powell sees the U.S. economy as not only very strong, but perhaps too strong.
The labor market is tight “to an unhealthy level,” he said.

     It’s a Big Deal that the Fed Raised Interest Rates Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up for the free Mother Jones newsletterIt finally happened: For the first time since 2018, after months of murmurs, the Federal Reserve rose interest rates.
As I wrote previously, it has been clear for the past few weeks that the Fed would begin raising rates.
Raising rates is a big deal, and it could (likely will!)
A traditional view of interest rates is that raising them is monetary policy that helps curb inflation.
1/9 — Mike Konczal (@rortybomb) March 16, 2022Some economists, even on the left, are hopeful we can edge interest rates up without hiking them aggressively.

     Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for the first time since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates for the first time since 2018, the central bank announced Wednesday at the conclusion of its highly anticipated two-day monetary policy meeting.
Thequarter-percentage-point increase had been well telegraphed by the central bank, with Powell hinting at it repeatedly over the past few months.
The central bank has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment at the maximum.
The central bank has six meetings left this year.
Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit the US economy and are already putting upward pressure on inflation, Powell said Wednesday.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time since 2018Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday for the first time since 2018, kick-starting its efforts to tackle the country's highest inflation in four decades.
On average, Fed policymakers said they expect interest rates, which have been near zero, to climb to around 1.9% by the end of this year.
"It's going to be quite some time before interest rates themselves become a headwind to the economy," McBride said.
Rising interest rates will quickly result in higher borrowing costs for credit cards and car loans.
"They're going to be very slow to raise interest rates and pass along those benefits to savers, if they even do so at all."

     How will your credit cards, car and home loans change with the rise in interest rates?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On March 16, the Federal Reserve announced it would raise interest rates for the first time since 2018.
One of the bank’s responsibilities is to moderate long-term interest rates for the U.S. economy.
Higher rates on credit cards, home and car loansBanks use the federal interest rates as a baseline to decide where to set their own rates that they offer to customers, The Hill reported.
Similarly, home buyers will probably see interest rates on their mortgages rise throughout the year, the news outlet reported.
Loans with fixed interest rates, such as federal student loans, won’t be affected by the hike, Forbes reported.
