     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry went down with a left foot injury late in the first half and Golden State coach Steve Kerr didn’t like Marcus Smart’s lunging move at the reigning NBA scoring champ.
Smart got an earful from Kerr, then they chatted again after the Boston Celtics beat the Warriors 110-88 on Wednesday night.
I thought Marcus dove into Steph’s knee,” Kerr said.
Curry grimaced in pain and got up but hobbled along before exiting on the next dead ball moments later.
Kerr said Curry was having an MRI exam after the game, the results of which reportedly will be revealed Thursday morning.
