Addressing one of the longest-standing holes on their roster, the Blue Jays have acquired third baseman Matt Chapman from the Oakland Athletics, per Jon Morosi and Carlos Baerga.

     Summary: Matt Chapman cranked 27 home runs in 2021; check out some of them.
(1:52)The Oakland Athletics have traded away another former All-Star, sending third baseman Matt Chapman to the Toronto Blue Jays for four prospects, the A's announced Wednesday.
Chapman, 28, is a three-time Gold Glove winner (2018, 2019 and 2021) and was an All-Star in 2019.
"You see what was happening around here,'' Chapman said of Oakland.
Toronto went 91-71 last year but finished one game behind Boston and New York in the AL wild-card race.

     Matt Chapman trade: Toronto Blue Jays acquire third baseman as Oakland A's fire sale continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oakland has reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays in a trade that will send All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman north of the border, the teams announced.
He hit .210/.314/.403 (100 OPS+) with 15 doubles, three triples, 27 homers, 72 RBI, 75 runs and 3.5 WAR last season.
The three-time Gold Glover obviously slides in as the everyday third baseman for the Blue Jays.
In the biggest move, they shipped first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves, effectively ruling last season's World Series champions out of the sweepstakes for franchise legend Freddie Freeman.
In light of Anthony Rizzo re-signing with the Yankees and the Blue Jays getting Chapman, the race for Freeman is down to the Rays, Red Sox, Padres and Dodgers, according to Bowden.

     Summary: Jays, I thought we had a deal; you don't do things before 8:00 am my time, and I don't whine and complain.
Anyway, there are many reports that the Blue Jays have traded for Matt Chapman from the A's.
The last time we traded for an A's third baseman, it went very well, so I'm expecting the same this time.
Shi Davidi tells us that Gunnar Hoglund, Kevin Smith, Zach Logue and Kirby Snead are heading to Oakland.
He's a right-handed hitter, so it doesn't help the Jays' need for a lefty bat, but he fills our need at third base.

Don’t get me wrong, each of these prospects has something to offer, but not at the level of costing Chapman.
If this was all they could get for Chapman, then keeping him might have been the better bet.

     Summary: Statcast’s Outs Above Average metric largely agrees, ranking him tenth among all big league players, regardless of position, since 2017.
Indeed, Chapman has twice been recognized as the league’s best all-around defender by being named the league’s Platinum Glove winner.
Snead, 27, gives the A’s an MLB-ready bullpen piece who made his big league debut late in the ’21 season.
Snead allowed three runs (two earned) on seven hits and a pair of walks with seven strikeouts through his first 7 2/3 big league innings last year.
The Chapman trade marks the latest step in the dismantling of a roster that was largely foreseeable but is nevertheless disheartening for the fanbase.
