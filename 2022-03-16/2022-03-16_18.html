The following day, Schefter relayed a report from Chris Mortensen that the Falcons made Ryan aware of their interest in Watson.

“We talked about two of the plaintiffs, we have about 18 to go.”Watson’s civil complaints contain graphic accounts of sexual harassment and sexual assault.

     Summary: If the Falcons do acquire Watson, then that means it would be the end of the Matt Ryan era in Atlanta.
Ryan does not have a no-trade clause in his contract, which a potential trade that much easier.
However, the Colts have $44 million in cap space to take on Ryan, who has a $48 million cap hit this season and $43 million cap hit in 2023.
But if they want to compete right away, then they could trade for Ryan.
Cleveland is the discussion to get Watson, but if they can’t land him, then why not trade for Ryan?

     Deshaun Watson rumors: Falcons informed Matt Ryan about pursuing Texans quarterback, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There will be no hard feelings between the Atlanta Falcons and Matt Ryan as they intend to acquire Deshaun Watson.
Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Falcons told Ryan they intended to pursue Watson before making an offer and remain in constant communication with their quarterback.
Ryan has thrown for 59,735 passing yards in his career, the eighth-most in NFL history.
Ryan's 367 passing touchdowns are ninth all time, 83 behind Aaron Rodgers for fifth.
The Browns quarterback didn't have to stick with the organization through the injury and get the surgery, yet he played through the pain -- and it ended up costing him his future in Cleveland.
