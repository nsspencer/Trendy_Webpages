     Texas A&amp;M’s Buzz Williams hammers NCAA selection committee: ‘It defies logic that we are not in’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Calling the systen flawed, an emotional Texas A&amp;M coach Buzz Williams blasted the NCAA selection committee Tuesday night for the exclusion of his Aggies in the NCAA tournament.
“I wanted to make sure that I studied it all with the lens they do, so that I could better understand how what we did this season wasn’t enough.
I wanted this understanding so I could have an explanation for our players, their parents and coaches, and be accountable in my relationship with each of them,” Williams explained.
“What has transpired is wrong,” Williams stated.

Oregon advanced to the second round of the NIT tournament by winning on the road at No.

     Texas A&amp;M Basketball: Buzz Williams’ NCAA Tourney rant is a must-watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’ve said it a million times and I’ll say the unfortunate truth again — the Texas A&amp;M basketball team was snubbed from the NCAA Tournament.
The win proved that Texas A&amp;M earned its 1-seed in the NIT Tournament but perhaps more importantly — it proved that the Aggies should have been in the NCAA Tournament.
There’s no changing the fact that Texas A&amp;M may have just become the biggest NCAA Tournament snub of all time.
Still, this is something worth fighting for, which is exactly what Buzz Williams did after his team defeated Alcorn State in the less prestigious NIT Tournament.
Texas A&amp;M basketball HC Buzz Williams’ post-game rant is something you simply cannot missWithout further ado, here’s what Buzz Williams said about the situation in his post-game press conference.

     Summary: Buzz Williams voices his frustration with the NCAA tournament selection process after Texas A&amp;M was not picked to be in the field.
1 seed as one of the first four teams left out of the 68-team NCAA tournament bracket.
With three wins in Tampa, Florida -- part of a seven-game winning streak -- it was anticipated that Texas A&amp;M had played its way into the NCAA tournament.
He said his research also focused on the selection committee itself: its members, how they are appointed -- "in other words, what committee selected the committee?"
"After studying all this nonstop the last two days and looking at it from every vantage point," he continued, "it defies logic that we are not in the NCAA tournament."

     Summary: The experienced Tigers — three-time victors in the opening game of the NCAA Tournament — used that knowledge along with a height advantage to continue their season in Fort Worth against Midwest No.
Texas Southern was credited with eight blocks, including five from University of Houston transfer Brison Gresham, the amount of deflections and decisions that were changed due to early inability to score inside had a huge impact.
A&amp;M-Corpus Christi also shot a season-worst 47% from the free throw line, nearly 30 points lower than its season average.
“From the beginning, I remember coach Lutz pulled us in a group and said we have enough to get it done,” Fryer said.
It turns out, he was right and the immediate future looks bright for Lutz and the Islanders.

     Summary: “After studying this non-stop for the past two days and looking at it from every vantage point, it defies logic that we are not in the NCAA Tournament,” he said.
What has transpired is wrong.”Buzz Williams Buzz Williams AggiesTexas A&amp;M (24-12) reached the SEC Tournament championship game, part of a seven-game winning streak that included three wins over ranked teams currently in the NCAA tourney.
Many fellow coaches and college basketball observers felt that was enough to get the Aggies into the field of 68.
“We won five of our last six to finish the regular season and won three of our last four games last week while advancing to the championship game of the conference tournament,” Williams said.
Since our return late Sunday night, I have spent all of my waking hours trying to better understand the data on how those 12 SEC-competition-only wins weren’t enough.
