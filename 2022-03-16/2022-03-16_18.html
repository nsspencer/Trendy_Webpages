     Summary: Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki to huge five-year deal originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoThe Cubs focused their attention on the outfield and landed Japanese star Seiya Suzuki, according to NBC Sports Chicago's David Kaplan.
After meeting with the #Cubs front office and chairman Tom Ricketts on Monday evening, Japanese star Seiya Suzuki has agreed to a 5 year/70 million dollar deal with the Chicago Cubs.
#TakeThat — David Kaplan (@thekapman) March 16, 2022Sources also told Kaplan and NBC Sports Chicago's Gordon Wittenmyer the Cubs' meeting with Japanese free agent Seiya Suzuki included chairman Tom Ricketts flying to Arizona Monday to make a pitch to the four-time NPB All-Star.
The #Cubs also made a very extensive pitch to Japanese star Seiya Suzuki last night with Tom Ricketts personally involved in the meeting and the team's pitch.
— David Kaplan (@thekapman) March 16, 2022The Cubs were among a half dozen teams reportedly pursuing Suzuki, who was available to sign with any MLB team this offseason through the league's posting process.

     Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki: Japanese slugger gets five-year, $85 million deal with Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Full Scouting Report For Outfielder Seiya Suzuki
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have agreed to sign outfielder Seiya Suzuki to a five-year, $85 million contract, the largest deal ever for a Japanese position player.
Suzuki, 27, was a five-time all-star and five-time Gold Glove winner in Nippon Professional Baseball and helped lead Japan to the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics last summer.
Scouting Report: While many Japanese hitters keep their hands inside and take short, direct swing paths to the ball, Suzuki takes powerful uppercuts more conducive to the modern MLB game.
Suzuki rarely faced mid-90s fastballs in Japan and opinions are split how effectively he’ll adjust to that velocity in MLB.
The Future: Suzuki has all the traits to be a power-hitting, everyday right fielder in the major leagues.

     Who is Seiya Suzuki? How former Hiroshima star fits in with Cubs roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs landed the biggest player in the international market on Wednesday, reportedly signing Hiroshima Carp outfielder Seiya Suzuki to a five-year contract worth $85 million.
Suzuki hit a career-high 38 home runs last season, and he's hit 25-plus in every year since 2017.
Suzuki met with the Cubs' front office and Tom Ricketts before signing, and he must have liked something he heard.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MESA, Ariz. — Less than 48 hours after the Cubs’ brass met with Seiya Suzuki’s camp, the Japanese outfielder had made his decision: He was going to Chicago.
Suzuki reportedly agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract with the Cubs, pending a physical.
Before the lockout, the Cubs signed right-hander Marcus Stroman to a three-year, $71 million deal.
The Cubs’ commitment to Suzuki also begins to answer questions about the direction of the club after its trade-deadline sell-off last summer broke up the 2016 championship core.
In the present, the Cubs have to figure out their defensive plan with Suzuki in the outfield mix.

     Summary: Without discussing Suzuki specifically, Cubs manager David Ross acknowledged the impact that kind of addition could make for the club.
Over the weekend, reports noted that Suzuki worked out for the Padres and met with Darvish.
The fee consists of 20% of the first $25 million, 17.5% of the next $25 million and 15% of any remaining salary.
In the immediate picture, he joins a Cubs outfield that includes Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega.
Behind that group are Michael Hermosillo, Harold Ramírez and Greg Deichmann, who came into camp to compete for part-time roles.

     Summary: Today, the Chicago Cubs landed one of the top free agents on the market, Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, who was available to MLB teams via the NPB posting process.
• Suzuki also gets a full no-trade clause from the Cubs, which has been a rare give for them, but I think it’s pretty appropriate in this situation.
• To that end, a deep scouting dive on Suzuki from before he was posted:Seiya Suzuki is heading to the Cubs!
Although Ohtani was and is a different animal, the hype around Seiya Suzuki is there for a reason.

     Summary: 9:20am: Suzuki’s contract is worth $85MM over five years, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, who also notes the inclusion of a full no-trade clause.
8:00am: The Cubs have agreed to sign outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to Sanspo and David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
The Cubs will also owe a posting fee to the Hiroshima Carp, Suzuki’s former team.
The news of the Suzuki signing comes on the heels of Anthony Rizzo’s two-year, $32MM deal with the Yankees.
On the position player side, Suzuki eclipses the four-year, $48MM deal outfielder Kosuke Fukudome signed with the Cubs in December 2007.
