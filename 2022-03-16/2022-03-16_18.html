     Trevor Noah: Addressing Congress, Zelensky ‘Knew His Audience’

     Summary: “Yeah, that’s right, Zelensky brought out all of America’s major moments: ‘I have a dream,’ 9/11, Mount Rushmore.
You know he was on Wikipedia last night planning this out: [imitating Zelensky] ‘OK, Pearl Harbor, Boston Tea Party — should I mention Hulk Hogan sex tape, maybe?” — TREVOR NOAH“And by the way, props to him, I mean he knows way more about America than most U.S. senators know about his country.
Like, can you imagine how they would sound if they had to give an inspiring speech using Ukrainian history?
[imitating U.S. senator] ‘Uh, people of Ukraine, remember the vision of your founder — I want to say Daniel Ukraine?’” — TREVOR NOAH“I’m also impressed that Zelensky was able to dodge so many land mines in his research, because you realize this could have gone very wrong: [imitating Zelensky] ‘And now to 9/11, which as we all know from YouTube was inside job.
I see you, Bush.’” — TREVOR NOAH

     Kanye picks up a 24-hour Instagram ban after Trevor Noah comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instagram has finally reached the state that so many of us have achieved over the last decade and change.
I .e., being all full up on hearing from Kanye West.
Which is to say that the Meta-owned social media network has issued a 24-hour ban to the musician, presumably linked to comments he recently made about Daily Show host Trevor Noah.
West’s response to Noah’s commentary has since been deleted, but, per Variety, it apparently involved at least one racial slur.
Anyway, we can’t wait for this 24-hour ban from social media to help Kanye get his head right and stop doing stuff like this, once and for all.

I do however care when I see you on a path that’s dangerously close to peril and pain.
But you have to know the difference between that and fighting your family,” Noah wrote.
