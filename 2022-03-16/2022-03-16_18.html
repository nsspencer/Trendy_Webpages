     Villarreal’s late salvo sends Juventus crashing out of Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three late goals earned Villarreal a stunning 3-0 second-leg victory at Juventus on Wednesday to condemn the Serie A side to a 4-1 aggregate loss and a Champions League last-16 exit for the third successive season.
Substitute Gerard Moreno, who had only just come on, stepped up and squeezed the ball home to edge the Spanish visitors in front.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri reacted angrily to questions about his side’s disappointing season following their exit.
Serie A’s most successful side have not enjoyed the most fruitful season domestically either.
It’s useless to talk now, we must remain quiet, focus on the league and the Coppa Italia to see if we can take a trophy at home.”

     Summary: Questions will continue to be asked of Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri after the Bianconeri were humiliated at home to Villarreal on Wednesday, losing 3-0 on the night and 4-1 on aggregate to fall out of the Champions League.
Dreadful Juventus?
Where does this leave Dybala??
That lead was doubled eight minutes later and with five to play as Pau Torres converted from inside the Juventus box after some woeful defending.
Matthijs de Ligt conceded another penalty in the last minute of the 90 with his best impression of a goalkeeper, allowing Arnaut Danjuma to convert.

Beginning this year, the away-goal rule is no longer in effect in the UEFA Champions League, meaning that the team that scores the most goals over two legs will advance to the next round.
Juventus are under pressure to qualify and claim a spot in the UEFA Champions League quarter finals, a stage that was last reached by an Italian soccer club during the tournament’s 2019/20 edition.
