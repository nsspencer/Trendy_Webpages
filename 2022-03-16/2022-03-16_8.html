     Invoking America’s Darkest Days, Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.
Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.
“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations.
Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world.
Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

Medinsky, a presidential aide, said Moscow wants a “peaceful, free, independent and neutral” Ukraine, as quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday.
“We need a peaceful, free, independent Ukraine, neutral -- not a member of military blocs, not a member of NATO.

     Summary: President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, March 16.
(Pool)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is delivering a virtual address via video to members of the US House and Senate.
The remarks come as the United States is under pressure from Ukraine to supply more military assistance to the embattled country.
These two controversial options divide lawmakers, with Republicans more hawkish about giving Ukraine jets, but some Democrats — and the White House — concerned Russia could consider such a move an escalation and potentially draw America into war.
US President Joe Biden plans to detail US assistance to Ukraine in a speech of his own later in the day Wednesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN Business) Facebook and YouTube said Wednesday that they removed uploads of a deepfake video of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky that purported to show him yielding to Russia.
Wearing a green shirt, Zelensky speaks in Ukranian, appearing to tell Ukranians to put down their weapons in the weeks-old war against Russia.
YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said the video and reuploads of it have been removed from the platform because it violates the company's misinformation policies.
The video comes weeks after the official Facebook account for Ukraine Land Forces posted a warning that such videos of Zelensky may appear .
That warning was accompanied by an image that appeared to show Zelensky in a similar shirt as what appeared in the deepfake video, in front of the same backdrop and behind the same podium.

When Ukrainians elected former comedian and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky as their president in 2019, we joined in welcoming him, even as we recognized his lack of government or leadership experience.
And we wondered how Zelensky, who played the president of Ukraine for laughs on TV, would redeem himself now that he was elected president for real.
And on that stage, his performance has been extraordinary and inspiring.
