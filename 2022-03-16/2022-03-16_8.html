     Invoking America’s Darkest Days, Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.
Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.
“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations.
Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world.
Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

Addressing President Biden directly, Zelensky said, "I wish for you to be the leader of the world.

The new funding is part of a $13.6 billion aid package to Ukraine that Congress passed last week and will include anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons that Ukraine had specifically requested.

     Five Takeaways From Zelensky Virtual Address To US Congress – OpEd
    </h2>

     Summary: By Shabbir H. KazmiUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky brought a moment of enormous drama to Washington Wednesday, when he gave a virtual address to Congress.
Here are the major takeaways:Sticks with no-fly zoneThe Ukrainian president is not budging from his demands for the imposition of a “no-fly” zone.
It’s an uncomfortable request, not just for President Biden but for American lawmakers in general.
Biden announced later another huge tranche of military aid — valued at around $800 million — just hours after Zelensky finished speaking.
While his Wednesday speech was itself impressive, the most emotive moment came when Zelensky paused to show a video.

Medinsky, a presidential aide, said Moscow wants a “peaceful, free, independent and neutral” Ukraine, as quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday.
“We need a peaceful, free, independent Ukraine, neutral -- not a member of military blocs, not a member of NATO.

When Ukrainians elected former comedian and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky as their president in 2019, we joined in welcoming him, even as we recognized his lack of government or leadership experience.
And we wondered how Zelensky, who played the president of Ukraine for laughs on TV, would redeem himself now that he was elected president for real.
And on that stage, his performance has been extraordinary and inspiring.
