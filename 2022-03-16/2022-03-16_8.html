     Zelensky's speech rekindles congressional no-fly talk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned pleas Wednesday rekindled congressional talk of supporting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
What they're saying: "I wouldn't say [a no-fly zone] is off the table," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told Axios while leaving the auditorium where members watched Zelensky's virtual address.
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, made the case for a limited humanitarian no-fly zone over a part of the country.
He also advocated for using non-kinetic ways to enforce a no-fly zone.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran who's feverishly pushed Congress and the Biden administration to send fighter jets and military aid, spelled out why a no-fly zone could not be implemented.

     Zelensky speech live: Biden will send drones, anti-aircraft aid to Ukraine after stirring address to Congress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Zelensky asks Americans to remember Pearl Harbour and 9/11Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has addressed the US Congress virtually after being invited by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
During his remarks, he called on the US to remember Pearl Harbour and the September 11 terrorist attacks as it sees the people of Ukraine attacked and killed by Russian forces.
The Ukrainian president told lawmakers in his wartime address to Congress on Wednesday that Ukraine “experiences the same every day” now as America did during its own darkest days.
Mr Zelensky also asked Congress for Soviet-made air defence systems and fighter jets as an alternative to a Nato-enforced humanitarian no-fly zone over his country’s airspace.
President Joe Biden has responded to Mr Zelensky’s remarks by announcing $800m (£612m) of new aid, bringing the total aid sent to Ukraine in the last week alone to $1bn.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was also aimed squarely at the White House, where President Joe Biden was expected to unveil new assistance later Wednesday.
Speaking directly to the President, in English, Zelensky said as his speech concluded: "Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace."
But the centerpiece of his address was a dramatic appeal for help defending Ukraine from Russian aerial bombardments, including calling for a no-fly zone.
"Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe, you know that they exist, and you have them.
Switching into English as he concluded his address, Zelensky punctuated an emotional appeal with words appealing to American global preeminence.
