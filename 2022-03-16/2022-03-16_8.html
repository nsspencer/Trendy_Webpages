     Chicago Cubs Owners Launching Bid to Buy EPL Club Chelsea

     Summary: By ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterLONDON (AP) — The owners of the Chicago Cubs said Wednesday that they will make a bid to buy Premier League club Chelsea.
“I am certain that Sir Martin is the right man to lead Chelsea Football Club into its next chapter," Coe, a Chelsea fan like Broughton, said in a statement released Wednesday.
He has the vision, acumen and financial backing to ensure our club’s future success, keeping Chelsea Football Club at the top of European football and challenging for trophies."
The Ricketts family bought the Cubs for $845 million in 2009, and in 2016 the franchise won its first World Series title since 1908.
"We have requested that Chelsea reverts with a solution to this issue as soon as possible.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports

     Chelsea urged to remove Three logo from shirts ‘as soon as possible’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have been urged to remove the logo of sponsor Three from their match-day shirts “as soon as possible” by the British telecommunications company.
But Chelsea have had to keep the company’s logo on the front of their match-day shirts in order to meet the terms of the special licence the club received from the government to keep operating.
Three have now urged Chelsea to find a way of removing their logo from the club’s shirts “as soon as possible”.
A Three spokesperson said: “We understand from discussions with Chelsea FC that there are ongoing issues with removing the Three logo from the shirts, as a result of kit supply issues and licence restrictions.
However, license restrictions have prevented Three’s logo from being removed from all of the club’s physical assets, such as perimeter boards.

The likeable and erudite German continues to navigate a devilishly difficult path expertly in his role as part-coach, part ambassador.
Chelsea goal-scorers Cesar Azpilicueta and Christian Pulisic celebrate the Blues' win on Wednesday.
Because this mentality is installed over years and years, over the decades, that's why it is possible that we can stay focused.
Tuchel took the unusual step of adopting a 3-5-2 system to accommodate an additional central midfielder, presumably to shore up central areas and help stifle Lille.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The owners of the Chicago Cubs, the Ricketts family, are set to launch a bid for Chelsea after joining forces with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin.
Interested bidders have until Friday to submit takeover proposals to the Raine Group, the US bank handling the process, and the race to buy the club from Roman Abramovich is hotting up.
The Ricketts family have a longstanding interest in Chelsea, having tried to buy the club in 2018, and are confident they will succeed this time.
In 2019 Tom Ricketts, the face of the bid for Chelsea, distanced himself from the comments and said his father was not involved with the Cubs.
Another issue for the family could be that Tom Ricketts, Cubs executives and Raine formed a special purpose acquisition company in 2020.
