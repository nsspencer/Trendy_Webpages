     Invoking America’s Darkest Days, Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.
Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.
“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations.
Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world.
Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

Laurent Van der Stockt for Le Monde/Getty ImagesKey FactsUkraine 24 and the Ukraine-based Russian-language tabloid Segodnya published an announcement, falsely attributed to Zelensky, that Ukraine was “capitulating” and would “give up arms,” the Daily Mirror reported Wednesday.
Zelensky quickly responded via YouTube, calling the false announcement a “childish provocation” and declaring that Ukraine would not give up arms until it had achieved victory against Russia.
In March, Russian organizations used malware to launch further attacks against Ukrainian Ministry of Defense websites.
Triolan, a major Ukrainian internet provider, reported being hacked in February and again March 9, resulting in widespread internet outages.

     Summary: (CNN Business) Facebook and YouTube said Wednesday that they removed uploads of a deepfake video of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky that purported to show him yielding to Russia.
Wearing a green shirt, Zelensky speaks in Ukranian, appearing to tell Ukranians to put down their weapons in the weeks-old war against Russia.
YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said the video and reuploads of it have been removed from the platform because it violates the company's misinformation policies.
The video comes weeks after the official Facebook account for Ukraine Land Forces posted a warning that such videos of Zelensky may appear .
That warning was accompanied by an image that appeared to show Zelensky in a similar shirt as what appeared in the deepfake video, in front of the same backdrop and behind the same podium.

When Ukrainians elected former comedian and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky as their president in 2019, we joined in welcoming him, even as we recognized his lack of government or leadership experience.
And we wondered how Zelensky, who played the president of Ukraine for laughs on TV, would redeem himself now that he was elected president for real.
And on that stage, his performance has been extraordinary and inspiring.
