     The Atlanta Falcons need to bring Julio Jones back to Atlanta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Atlanta Falcons receiver Julio Jones was a surprise cut this afternoon as the Titans and Jones parted ways opening up the possibility of a reunion.
Julio Jones and the Atlanta Falcons parted ways last year when Jones was tired of losing and perhaps had frustration with the previous Atlanta front office.
The Atlanta Falcons bringing Julio Jones back would be a perfect move for a franchise needing the production Julio still can bringIf Atlanta were able to bring Julio back they wouldn’t be getting the elite player Julio was for nearly a decade.
However, there is no reason to think as a number two receiver Jones cannot still be a productive part of an offense.
Julio back in an Atlanta Falcons jersey feels like the perfect move no matter who is under center this season for Atlanta and would bring some much needed production.
