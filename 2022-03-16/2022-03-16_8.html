     Lille 1-2 Chelsea (1-4 agg.): Blues into Champions League quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lille put up a good fight, but Chelsea's quality shone through as the Premier League club won 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 second-leg meeting on Wednesday.
Wednesday's victory combined with the first-leg result means Chelsea claims a 4-1 aggregate victory over the French champions.
After going down a goal thanks to Burak Yilmaz's 38th-minute penalty kick, Chelsea found the motivation needed to kick things into a higher gear.
Then, in the 71st minute, Chelsea made the hosts pay for their misses as César Azpilicueta scored to put the result out of reach.
Chelsea moves on to the quarterfinals as the English club looks to repeat as Champions League titleholder.

After winning the first leg 2-0 at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were heavily expected to progress.

The sources close to the bid state that the Ricketts Family have the desire to 'maintain' on-field and 'modernise' off-field.

     Summary: Chelsea are set to play any remaining home Champions League fixtures behind closed doors after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU, The Athletic understands.
If they progress to the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to have fans present at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea are not allowed to sell tickets in order to generate revenue.
On Tuesday afternoon, Chelsea complained to the FA that playing without away fans in the FA Cup threatened “sporting integrity”, an appeal which was withdrawn hours later.
A UEFA statement said: “UEFA is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions.

     Summary: The sense was this is how Chelsea like it: a hostile crowd on their backs, impertinent opponents, the weight of the world on their shoulders.
Chelsea had not played well and in truth the notion of them retaining their European crown might seem fanciful on the basis of this performance.
All the same this was a reminder that Chelsea have not lost the art of grinding on a difficult European night.
The free-kick led to a scramble and Lille screamed for a penalty when Jorginho handled as he challenged Xeka.
Timothy Weah was dozing and Azpilicueta charged in, kneeing the ball past Jardim to give Chelsea a fleeting sense of control over their destiny.

     Summary: By ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterLONDON (AP) — The owners of the Chicago Cubs said Wednesday that they will make a bid to buy Premier League club Chelsea.
“I am certain that Sir Martin is the right man to lead Chelsea Football Club into its next chapter," Coe, a Chelsea fan like Broughton, said in a statement released Wednesday.
He has the vision, acumen and financial backing to ensure our club’s future success, keeping Chelsea Football Club at the top of European football and challenging for trophies."
The Ricketts family bought the Cubs for $845 million in 2009, and in 2016 the franchise won its first World Series title since 1908.
