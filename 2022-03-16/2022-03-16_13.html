     Who is Seiya Suzuki? How former Hiroshima star fits in with Cubs roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs landed the biggest player in the international market on Wednesday, reportedly signing Hiroshima Carp outfielder Seiya Suzuki to a five-year contract worth $85 million.
Suzuki hit a career-high 38 home runs last season, and he's hit 25-plus in every year since 2017.
Suzuki met with the Cubs' front office and Tom Ricketts before signing, and he must have liked something he heard.

     AP Source: Cubs, Seiya Suzuki Agree to $85M, 5-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By ANDREW SELIGMAN, AP Sports WriterCHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Cubs and star Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki have agreed to an $85-million, five-year deal, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The person, confirming several reports, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.
The agreement signals the Cubs hope to speed up the rebuilding process after breaking up their 2016 championship core before last season's trade deadline.
The 27-year-old Suzuki was a five-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner over nine seasons with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Nippon Professional Baseball.
The Cubs also have Ian Happ, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega in the outfield, with prized prospect Brennen Davis in the system.

     Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki: Japanese slugger gets five-year, $85 million deal with Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Summary: MESA, Ariz. – Less than 48 hours after the Cubs brass met with Seiya Suzuki’s camp, the Japanese star had made his decision.
“They’re gonna try to accrue as much talent as they possibly can,” Cubs manager David Ross said of the front office.
The Cubs don’t look like a team that’s going to be competing for the 2022 World Series.
But they’ve promised their fans that the Cubs’ trade deadline flurry last year would reposition the roster and lay the groundwork for another period of sustained success.
In the present, the Cubs just have to figure out their defensive plan with Suzuki in the outfield mix.

     Summary: Without discussing Suzuki specifically, Cubs manager David Ross acknowledged the impact that kind of addition could make for the club.
Over the weekend, reports noted that Suzuki worked out for the Padres and met with Darvish.
The fee consists of 20% of the first $25 million, 17.5% of the next $25 million and 15% of any remaining salary.
In the immediate picture, he joins a Cubs outfield that includes Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega.
Behind that group are Michael Hermosillo, Harold Ramírez and Greg Deichmann, who came into camp to compete for part-time roles.
