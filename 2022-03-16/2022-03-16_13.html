     What the Fed’s move could mean for mortgage interest rates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As predicted, the Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates Wednesday for the first time in more than three years.
The housing market has been bracing for the impact of higher mortgage rates on affordability, and therefore sales.
But the relationship between Fed policy and mortgage rates isn’t as simple as it might seem.
“And so I think most market observers would, would expect that this has already been baked into today’s mortgage rates,” Keys said.
This is because when bond investors see higher inflation on the horizon, they want to be compensated for it in the form of higher interest rates.

     Fed Raises Interest Rates for First Time Since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Federal Reserve officials voted Wednesday to lift interest rates and penciled in six more increases by year’s end, the most aggressive pace in more than 15 years, in an escalating effort to slow inflation that is running at its highest levels in four decades.
The Fed will raise its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 0.25% and 0.5%, the first rate increase since 2018.

     Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for the first time since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates for the first time since 2018, the central bank announced Wednesday at the conclusion of its highly anticipated two-day monetary policy meeting.
Thequarter-percentage-point increase had been well telegraphed by the central bank, with Powell hinting at it repeatedly over the past few months.
The central bank has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment at the maximum.
The central bank has six meetings left this year.
Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit the US economy and are already putting upward pressure on inflation, Powell said Wednesday.

     Why rates are going up.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prices for groceries, couches and rent are all climbing rapidly, and Federal Reserve officials have been warily eyeing that trend.
On Wednesday, they took their biggest step yet toward counteracting it, raising their policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
That small change carries a major signal: Policymakers have fully pivoted to inflation-fighting mode and will do what is necessary to make sure price gains do not remain hot for months and years to come.
The Fed is acting at a tense moment for many consumers and investors.
Here’s what happened, and what it is likely to mean for markets and the economy.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time since 2018Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday for the first time since 2018, kick-starting its efforts to tackle the country's highest inflation in four decades.
On average, Fed policymakers said they expect interest rates, which have been near zero, to climb to around 1.9% by the end of this year.
"It's going to be quite some time before interest rates themselves become a headwind to the economy," McBride said.
Rising interest rates will quickly result in higher borrowing costs for credit cards and car loans.
"They're going to be very slow to raise interest rates and pass along those benefits to savers, if they even do so at all."

     How will higher interest rates affect American finances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit card interest rates and the costs of an auto loan will also likely move up.
The Fed’s initial quarter-point rate hike Wednesday in its benchmark short-term rate won’t have much immediate impact on most Americans’ finances.
“The impact of a single quarter-point interest rate hike is inconsequential on the household budget,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.
Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers.
They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.
