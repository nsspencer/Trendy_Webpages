Those who need peace, those who suffer inhumane destruction.
I ask you to watch one video — video of what the Russian troops did in our country, in our land.
And in the end, to sum it up, today — today it’s not enough to be the leader of the nation.
Today it takes to be the leader of the world, being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.

     Zelensky's speech rekindles congressional no-fly talk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned pleas Wednesday rekindled congressional talk of supporting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
What they're saying: "I wouldn't say [a no-fly zone] is off the table," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told Axios while leaving the auditorium where members watched Zelensky's virtual address.
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, made the case for a limited humanitarian no-fly zone over a part of the country.
He also advocated for using non-kinetic ways to enforce a no-fly zone.
Fitzpatrick specified in a later interview "we have to jam MAV systems and jam radar, you can ground aircraft without kinetic strikes," adding, "There's more to the story than just 'no-fly zone means WWIII.'"

     Six takeaways from Zelensky's address to Congress and Biden's response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it was his time to speak, Biden thanked Zelensky for his speech, calling it a "convincing and significant" address.
But the centerpiece of his address was a dramatic appeal for help defending Ukraine from Russian aerial bombardments, including calling for a no-fly zone.
"Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe, you know that they exist, and you have them.
In his speech, Zelensky appealed for the lawmakers to step up, aware the direct and dramatic appeal would be difficult to deny.
But he did attempt to claim a world leader stature after Zelensky directly challenged him to step into the role.
