     'Bad Vegan': What Happened to Sarma Melngailis And Where Is She Now?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The four-part series delves deep into the jaw-dropping true story surrounding Vegan restaurateur Sarma Melngailis, and her then-husband, Anthony Strangis.
In 2004, she opened the high-end restaurant, Pure Food and Wine, with famed American chef Matthew Kenney and investor Jeffrey Chodorow.
When Melngailis questioned his financial demands, Strangis would aggressively yell at her over the phone, some of which appear in Bad Vegan.
In the end, he ultimately conned Strangis out of millions of dollars and eventually took control of her vegan food business.
Alongside a photo of her and Leon, Melngailis wrote: "If you need me for the foreseeable future... will be hiding under covers spooning Leon watching videos of woodchucks.
