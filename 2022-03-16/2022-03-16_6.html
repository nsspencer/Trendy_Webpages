     Summary: If anyone says Trent cannot defend, let them come to me and I will knock them down.
But it was not a big problem, because we were prepared for a really difficult game.
I was not angry at half-time – I just wanted us to change a few things, and that’s what the boys did.
“[On the instant substitution after the first goal] We wanted to bring fresh players on.
All I care about is preparing for the next game, then finding solutions in the game: play football, be cheeky and all those things.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s also why the most encouraging performance from Arsenal so far this year was probably the 2–1 defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day.
Arsenal has lost five out of five in the league against teams who finished in the top four last season.
It went into the Premier League game at Anfield this season on a run of eight games unbeaten in the league and lost 4–0.
After Manchester City was held at Crystal Palace on Monday, a win for Liverpool would lift it to within a point of the top.
Alan Martin/Colorsport/Imago ImagesArsenal has conceded just seven goals in its last 11 league games.

     Summary: Arsenal v Liverpool predictionsLiverpool will stumbleWith all due respect to Liverpool, they are going to stumble here.
Since the 1st of January and their loss to Manchester City, Arsenal have won five and drawn only one game.
Arsenal and Liverpool played once this season and Liverpool won 4-0, which sounds good for the Reds coming into this game.
In the next few weeks, apart from the Champions League matchup, they are going to play, the Reds have Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, and Newcastle away from home.
While Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham are obvious, they are also not going to glide through Everton, Villa, and Newcastle as well.
