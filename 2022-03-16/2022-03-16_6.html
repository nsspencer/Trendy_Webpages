     Cubs agree to deal with Japanese star Seiya Suzuki
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs and star Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki have agreed to an $85 million, five-year deal, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The person, confirming several reports, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.
The agreement signals the Cubs hope to speed up the rebuilding process after breaking up their 2016 championship core before last season’s trade deadline.
The 27-year-old Suzuki was a five-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner over nine seasons with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Nippon Professional Baseball.
Suzuki plays right field, a position five-time Gold Glove winner Jason Heyward has manned for the Cubs since signing a $184 million, eight-year contract before the 2016 World Series championship season.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Summary: Now the Cubs must figure out what to do with Jason Heyward.
The 12-year veteran is entering the final two years of his eight-year, $184 million contract.
The Cubs were likely already going to need to platoon him, but with Happ and Suzuki essentially locked into the starting lineup, it potentially leaves manager David Ross juggling some combination of Clint Frazier, Rafael Ortega, Michael Hermosillo and Heyward for plate appearances.

     Cubs To Sign Seiya Suzuki

     Summary: 9:20am: Suzuki’s contract is worth $85MM over five years, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, who also notes the inclusion of a full no-trade clause.
8:00am: The Cubs have agreed to sign outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to Sanspo and David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
The Cubs will also owe a posting fee to the Hiroshima Carp, Suzuki’s former team.
The news of the Suzuki signing comes on the heels of Anthony Rizzo’s two-year, $32MM deal with the Yankees.
On the position player side, Suzuki eclipses the four-year, $48MM deal outfielder Kosuke Fukudome signed with the Cubs in December 2007.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Multiple reports indicated that the Cubs' brass met with Suzuki's camp Monday evening.
Over the weekend, reports noted that Suzuki worked out for the Padres and met with Darvish.
Suzuki was not subject to international signing bonus limitations, because he’s at least 25 years old with six or more seasons of professional experience.
In the immediate picture, he joins a Cubs outfield that includes Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega.
Suzuki would seemingly be best suited for right field, where Heyward has been a staple for the Cubs dating back to the 2016 season.
