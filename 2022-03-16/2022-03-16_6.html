     Invoking America’s Darkest Days, Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.
Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.
“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations.
Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world.
Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

     Zelensky urges Congress to "remember 9/11" as he pleads for more aid

     Summary: “Remember Sept. 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields.
“Every night for three weeks now ... Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people."
Addressing President Biden directly, Zelensky said, "I wish for you to be the leader of the world.

The new funding is part of a $13.6 billion aid package to Ukraine that Congress passed last week and will include anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons that Ukraine had specifically requested.

     Summary: Russia’s negotiating position in talks with Ukraine is becoming “more realistic,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday.
Speaking in a televised message, Zelensky stressed the need for his country to "keep fighting," but struck a more positive note on negotiations.
"The meetings are ongoing, as I am told the positions are sounding more realistic," he said.
Medinsky, a presidential aide, said Moscow wants a “peaceful, free, independent and neutral” Ukraine, as quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday.
“We need a peaceful, free, independent Ukraine, neutral -- not a member of military blocs, not a member of NATO.

     Summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave an unsurprisingly impassioned virtual speech before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday morning.
In recent days, Zelensky has beseeched previous Western audiences to impose a no-fly zone above his country.
AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementHowever, in his speech to Congress, Zelensky tried a new tack.
If a no-fly zone “is too much to ask,” he said, “we offer an alternative”—send Ukraine advanced anti-aircraft systems.
These systems would improve the Ukrainians’ ability to shoot down Russian airplanes, which have been bombing civilian and military targets.

     Summary: We learn from the Purim story that leadership can be thrust upon an individual in unanticipated ways.
When Ukrainians elected former comedian and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky as their president in 2019, we joined in welcoming him, even as we recognized his lack of government or leadership experience.
And we wondered how Zelensky, who played the president of Ukraine for laughs on TV, would redeem himself now that he was elected president for real.
And on that stage, his performance has been extraordinary and inspiring.
Zelensky is Ukraine.
