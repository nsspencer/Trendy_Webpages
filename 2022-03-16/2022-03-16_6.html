     Japan earthquake: 7.3 quake off Fukushima sparks memories of 2011 tsunami
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima in northern Japan on Wednesday evening, triggering a tsunami advisory and plunging more than 2 million homes in the Tokyo area into darkness.
The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 quake and tsunami 11 years ago that also caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
The agency issued a tsunami advisory for up to a meter (3-foot) sea surge in parts of Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures.
More than 2 million homes were without electricity in the Tokyo region serviced by TEPCO due to the quake, the utility said on its website.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings swayed violently.

     Summary: Tokyo (CNN) A tsunami advisory was issued by Japanese officials Wednesday following a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that hit off the coast of Fukushima prefecture, where a 2011 quake caused a disaster at a nuclear power plant.
The tsunami advisory was made for Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures in eastern Japan following the quake that had a preliminary epicenter depth of 60 kilometers (37 miles), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.
Tremors could be felt in Miyagi and the capital Tokyo, with footage showing shaking lights and buildings.
The quake knocked out power to more than 2 million households in Tokyo and nearby prefectures, Tokyo Electric Power said on its website.
According to the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, a Pacific-basin-wide tsunami is not expected at this time.

     Japan earthquake knocks out power to millions, prompts brief tsunami advisory

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not long after the quake struck at 11:36 p.m. an advisory for tsunami waves of about three feet was issued for parts of the northeast coast.
PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later said there was no longer a tsunami threat, though the Japan Meteorological Agency kept its low risk advisory in place.
NHK national television said tsunami waves of 8 inches had already reached shore in one area.
The flooding swamped the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing a meltdown.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that there were also no abnormalities at two other nuclear power plants in the region.
