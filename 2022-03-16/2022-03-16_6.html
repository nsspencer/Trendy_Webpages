     UConn eager for NCAA Tournament redemption
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Bluejays outscored the Huskies, 9-3, won the game 59-56, and probably knocked UConn down a seed line or two in the NCAA.
There, as a 7 seed, UConn was pretty thoroughly outplayed by 10th-seeded Maryland in the East Regional’s first round.
“Before you talk about getting on a run in this tournament,” Hurley said, “you have to win your first game.
And that’s what we’re focusing on.”Actually, it’s about all they’ve thought about since March, since Mackey Arena, since the Huskies shot 32.3 percent against the Terrapins and fell into the abyss.
This is Hurley’s fourth NCAA as a coach (his second at UConn after two at Rhode Island).
