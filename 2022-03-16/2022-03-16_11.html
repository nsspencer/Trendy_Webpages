     Multiple people killed in crash involving University of the Southwest's golf teams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A vehicle carrying members of the University of the Southwest's golf teams collided head-on with a pickup truck in West Texas, killing multiple people, authorities said.
"It’s very, very tragic.”University president Quint Thurman said in a statement that Tyler James, who was in his first season as coach of the men's and women's golf teams, was among those killed.
Blanco said the pickup crossed the center line of a highway before crashing into the team's van, which the university stated was carrying nine passengers.
The golf teams had just completed the first day of the TankLogix Collegiate at Ranchland Hills Golf Club in Midland, Texas, about 315 miles west of Dallas.
The crash was under investigation, Blanco said, and details about the number of people in each vehicle weren't immediately released.
