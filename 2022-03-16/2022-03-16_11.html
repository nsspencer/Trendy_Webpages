    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Zelensky's speech rekindles congressional no-fly talk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned pleas Wednesday rekindled congressional talk of supporting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
What they're saying: "I wouldn't say [a no-fly zone] is off the table," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told Axios while leaving the auditorium where members watched Zelensky's virtual address.
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, made the case for a limited humanitarian no-fly zone over a part of the country.
He also advocated for using non-kinetic ways to enforce a no-fly zone.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran who's feverishly pushed Congress and the Biden administration to send fighter jets and military aid, spelled out why a no-fly zone could not be implemented.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it was his time to speak, Biden thanked Zelensky for his speech, calling it a "convincing and significant" address.
But the centerpiece of his address was a dramatic appeal for help defending Ukraine from Russian aerial bombardments, including calling for a no-fly zone.
"Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe, you know that they exist, and you have them.
In his speech, Zelensky appealed for the lawmakers to step up, aware the direct and dramatic appeal would be difficult to deny.
But he did attempt to claim a world leader stature after Zelensky directly challenged him to step into the role.

     Zelensky’s speech is a new precedent for a modern address to Congress from a leader in war time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His address, delivered from an undisclosed area in Ukraine, was short and to the point, clocking in around 15 minutes.
But Zelensky’s speech, conducted over a livestream, was the most modern ever and likely a model for speeches in the future.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not the first foreign leader to address a full session of the United States Congress, nor was he the first one to do so while their nation was at war.
A requestZelensky asked for the United States to help create a no-fly zone over his nation, but also basically conceded that wasn’t going to be granted.
(Biden has concerns that if the US shot down a Russian plane, it would spark World War III.)
