     Summary: The Tennessee Titans have released wide receiver Julio Jones, per Dianna Russini and Adam Schefter.
The Titans are planning on releasing WR Julio Jones, sources tell @AdamSchefter and me — Dianna Russini (@diannaESPN) March 16, 2022Designating Jones a post-June 1st release will save the Titans about $9.5 million in cap space, per ESPN’s Dan Graziano.
General manager Job Robinson swung big and missed even bigger when he decided to acquire Jones in hopes of forming a “Big 3” alongside Derrick Henry and A.J.
Robinson parted with a second-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft, along with a fourth-round selection in the 2023 NFL Draft in order to acquire Jones from the Atlanta Falcons.
Jones appeared in just 10 games with the Titans while recording career-lows in receptions (31), receiving yards (434), yards per catch and touchdowns (one) while averaging the second-lowest yards per reception total (14.0) of his career.

     Titans release Julio Jones after one season in Tennessee, star receiver hits open market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Julio Jones experience in Tennessee is over after just one season.
Jones was acquired by the Titans in a trade with the Falcons back in June.
Tennessee shipped a second-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft and their fourth-rounder in 2023 for Jones and a 2023 sixth-round pick.
While there was the initial optimism that Jones would be the ideal complement opposite of ascending superstar receiver A.J.
While he may be past his prime, Jones will certainly have no shortage of suitors on the market as contenders look for a veteran pass-catching option to help boost their offense for the 2022 season.
