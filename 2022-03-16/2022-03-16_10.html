     Phillies, Schwarber agree to deal, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies and free agent Kyle Schwarber have agreed to terms of a 4 year, $79 million deal, per reports.
Schwarber, 29, was the 4th overall pick of the 2014 draft by the Chicago Cubs out of the University of Indiana.
Schwarber signed a one year, $7 million deal with the Washington Nationals and had his best season in the majors.
The Rangers reportedly had some interest in Schwarber, but at this price, I can see why the team would pass.
Kiley McDaniel had Schwarber ranked #21 on his free agent board, projecting he would get 3 years, $45 million.

     Summary: Dave Dombrowski, former President of Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Chaim Bloom approves of Kyle Schwarber signing with PhilliesThe Philadelphia Phillies are signing Kyle Schwarber to a four-year deal, beating out several competing teams for the veteran slugger.
And in a somewhat ironic twist, the deal has the stamp of approval of the man who traded for Schwarber last summer and replaced Phillies President of Baseball Operations, Dave Dombrowski, after the 2019 season.
As reported by Alex Speier of the Boston Globe, Bloom said the Red Sox were also in the Schwarber race down to the wire:““We’re trying to stay focused on chasing down things that make sense for us.
However veteran DH JD Martinez had not opted in to his final year with the Sox, this conversation might be very different.
However, most teams do not employ one DH nowadays, so fans can expect to see Schwarber patrolling the field on occasion.

     Phillies finally make big splash in free agency with slugger Kyle Schwarber
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies are signing Kyle Schwarber to a 4-year deal.
And according to the Boston Globe’s Alex Speier, the Phillies beat out the Boston Red Sox to get him.
And with the CBT increased by $20M, the Phillies have the payroll flexibility they were so concerned about last fall, when they came close to signing Schwarber, but stalled before the lockout.
The signing also reunites Schwarber with the hitting coach whom he credits with his resurgence last season, Kevin Long, whom the Phillies hired at the beginning of the offseason.
The hiring was actually one of the first indicators that Schwarber would consider the Phillies as a landing spot in free agency.

     Summary: (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Kyle from Waltham is leaving the Red SoxFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder, Kyle Schwarber, has penned a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
This is disheartening because there aren’t many Red Sox fans that didn’t want him back.
He was, arguably, the only free agent that the majority of Sox fans could agree on signing.
He only played 41 games this past season and Red Sox fans treated him like a seasoned veteran with the team.
All in all, speaking on behalf of Red Sox fans, thank you, Kyle Schwarber for an amazing 41 games that will never be forgotten.

The slugger has agreed to sign with Philadelphia, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan on Wednesday.
Schwarber will join a Phillies lineup that features reigning National League MVP Bryce Harper and also includes veterans J.T.
Harper said earlier this week that it would be a "downer" if the Phillies didn't sign Kris Bryant, Nick Castellanos or Schwarber.
"I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team," Harper said.
