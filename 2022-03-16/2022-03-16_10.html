     Summary: Everyone knew this day was coming, Matt Chapman included.
On Wednesday, the A's traded the star third baseman to the Toronto Blue Jays for four prospects.
The trade happened days after the A's traded star first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves and right-hander Chris Bassitt to the New York Mets.
"I just don’t think it was realistic," Chapman said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Chronicle's Matt Kawahara.
Last season, Chapman hit just .210 with 27 home runs and 72 RBI.

     Grading the Blue Jays-Athletics Matt Chapman trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Blue Jays made a serious splash on Wednesday, trading for Oakland Athletics third basemen Matt Chapman.
Grading Blue Jays-Athletics Matt Chapman TradeBlue Jays: B+Getting a player like Chapman is certainly a huge plus for the Blue Jays.
Last season, Chapman hit just .210 and struggled to get on base, but the slugger smacked 27 homers and drove in 72 runs.
For the Blue Jays, this is such an important move because they needed an upgrade at third.
But, the Blue Jays already have a very promising rotation and numerous bullpen arms who can come in and shut the door.

     Matt Chapman trade: Toronto Blue Jays acquire third baseman as Oakland A's fire sale continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oakland has reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays in a trade that will send All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman north of the border, the teams announced.
He hit .210/.314/.403 (100 OPS+) with 15 doubles, three triples, 27 homers, 72 RBI, 75 runs and 3.5 WAR last season.
The three-time Gold Glover obviously slides in as the everyday third baseman for the Blue Jays.
In the biggest move, they shipped first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves, effectively ruling last season's World Series champions out of the sweepstakes for franchise legend Freddie Freeman.
In light of Anthony Rizzo re-signing with the Yankees and the Blue Jays getting Chapman, the race for Freeman is down to the Rays, Red Sox, Padres and Dodgers, according to Bowden.

     Jays Trade for Matt Chapman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jays, I thought we had a deal; you don't do things before 8:00 am my time, and I don't whine and complain.
Anyway, there are many reports that the Blue Jays have traded for Matt Chapman from the A's.
The last time we traded for an A's third baseman, it went very well, so I'm expecting the same this time.
Shi Davidi tells us that Gunnar Hoglund, Kevin Smith, Zach Logue and Kirby Snead are heading to Oakland.
He's a right-handed hitter, so it doesn't help the Jays' need for a lefty bat, but he fills our need at third base.
