     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Steph Curry got an MRI on the top of his left foot following the Warriors loss to Boston on Wednesday night.
The Warriors will know the MRI results and injury severity in the coming days, head coach Steve Kerr said.
Curry injured his left foot with 4:18 left in the second quarter when Boston’s Marcus Smart rolled over Curry’s left leg while the two scrapped for a loose ball.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry went down with a left foot injury late in the first half and Golden State coach Steve Kerr didn’t like Marcus Smart’s lunging move at the reigning NBA scoring champ.
Smart got an earful from Kerr, then they chatted again after the Boston Celtics beat the Warriors 110-88 on Wednesday night.
