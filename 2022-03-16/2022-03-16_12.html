     Blue Jays reportedly acquiring Matt Chapman from the A’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blue Jays fans woke up to some great news on Wednesday, as they are reportedly acquiring Matt Chapman from the Oakland A’s to upgrade their infield.
Chapman brings a needed upgrade in their infield, and one that improve the overall team defence, especially on the left side of the infield.
The #BlueJays are finalizing a trade for 2-time Platinum Glove-winning 3B Matt Chapman, source confirms.
@MLBNetwork @FAN590 @Sportsnet — Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) March 16, 2022It’s not yet known what the return for Chapman will be, but it likely doesn’t preclude the Blue Jays from adding another impact bat before their offseason is complete.
It’s definitely a step in the right direction for the Blue Jays with this move, and something tells me there’s more to come.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB Trade Rumors: Matt Chapman is headed to the Toronto Blue Jays from the Oakland A’s, per multiple reports.
Chapman, 28, was the A’s first round pick in 2014 out of Cal State-Fullerton, and has manned the hot corner for them since the middle of 2017.
Chapman is considered the gold standard as far as third base defense goes, and won his third gold glove in 2021.
Hogland, 21, is a righthanded pitcher who was the Jays’ first round pick (#19 overall) in the 2021 draft out of Ole Miss.
Smith, 25, was the Jays’ fourth round pick in 2017.

     Matt Chapman trade: Toronto Blue Jays acquire third baseman as Oakland A's fire sale continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oakland has reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays in a trade that will send All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman north of the border, the teams announced.
He hit .210/.314/.403 (100 OPS+) with 15 doubles, three triples, 27 homers, 72 RBI, 75 runs and 3.5 WAR last season.
The three-time Gold Glover obviously slides in as the everyday third baseman for the Blue Jays.
In the biggest move, they shipped first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves, effectively ruling last season's World Series champions out of the sweepstakes for franchise legend Freddie Freeman.
In light of Anthony Rizzo re-signing with the Yankees and the Blue Jays getting Chapman, the race for Freeman is down to the Rays, Red Sox, Padres and Dodgers, according to Bowden.

    </h2>

     Summary: Jays, I thought we had a deal; you don't do things before 8:00 am my time, and I don't whine and complain.
Anyway, there are many reports that the Blue Jays have traded for Matt Chapman from the A's.
The last time we traded for an A's third baseman, it went very well, so I'm expecting the same this time.
Shi Davidi tells us that Gunnar Hoglund, Kevin Smith, Zach Logue and Kirby Snead are heading to Oakland.
He's a right-handed hitter, so it doesn't help the Jays' need for a lefty bat, but he fills our need at third base.

Don’t get me wrong, each of these prospects has something to offer, but not at the level of costing Chapman.
If this was all they could get for Chapman, then keeping him might have been the better bet.

     Grading the Blue Jays-Athletics Matt Chapman trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Blue Jays made a serious splash on Wednesday, trading for Oakland Athletics third basemen Matt Chapman.
Grading Blue Jays-Athletics Matt Chapman TradeBlue Jays: B+Getting a player like Chapman is certainly a huge plus for the Blue Jays.
Last season, Chapman hit just .210 and struggled to get on base, but the slugger smacked 27 homers and drove in 72 runs.
For the Blue Jays, this is such an important move because they needed an upgrade at third.
But, the Blue Jays already have a very promising rotation and numerous bullpen arms who can come in and shut the door.

     Matt Chapman trade grades: Blue Jays make splash, but blockbuster move comes with some risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From Oakland's perspective, Chapman is the second Matt the Athletics have traded this week, joining new Atlanta Braves first baseman Matt Olson.
This likely won't be the final time this month the Athletics are featured in one of our "Trade Grade" pieces.
Blue Jays grade: BThere's no denying that Chapman is a phenomenal talent.
You're unlikely to reach base 40 percent of the time or post a .500 slugging percentage if you're hitting around .215, the way Chapman has the last two years.
(His career average, even with last season taken into account, is 326 feet.)
