     Ukraine says a 4th Russian general was killed trying to storm Mariupol
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy announced Tuesday night that a fourth Russian general has been killed in Moscow's war in his country.
Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko later identified the slain officer as Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev, the 46-year-old commander of Russia's 150th motorized rifle division.
Gerashchenko said Mityaev died Tuesday as Russian forces stormed Mariupol, The Associated Press reports.
Russia's ground invasion appears to be stalled, and on Tuesday evening Ukrainian forces repelled an attack on Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, according to regional leader Oleh Synehubov.
"It's the most destructive known strike the Ukrainian military has conducted against Russian helicopters during the war, with at least three Russian helicopters seen on fire, or destroyed, at the airport."

     Ukraine Mounts Counteroffensive to Drive Russians Back From Kyiv, Key Cities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Satellite imagery showed the aftermath of a suspected Ukrainian strike Tuesday on Russian forces at Kherson’s airport.
The U.S. Embassy Twitter account said they had been shot dead by Russian forces.
But that offensive stalled out amid poor planning and logistics, and unexpectedly stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces armed with Western-provided antitank and antiaircraft missiles.
Increasingly, Russian forces have resorted to bombing residential areas and civilian infrastructure in an effort to wear down Ukrainian resistance.
A convoy of food, water and medicine destined for the city has been held up for several days by Russian forces near Berdyansk.
