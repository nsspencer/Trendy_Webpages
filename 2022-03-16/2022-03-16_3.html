     Kyle Schwarber signs four-year deal with Philadelphia Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opponents already had to account for one slugging lefty in the middle of the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup in Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP.
Kyle Schwarber and the Phillies agreed to a four-year deal worth $79 million on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.
NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported the news and The Athletic said the contract has an average annual value of just under $20 million per year.
“I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team,” Harper said Wednesday.
After the Cubs non-tendered him during the 2020-21 offseason, Schwarber signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals.

     Summary: (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Kyle from Waltham is leaving the Red SoxFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder, Kyle Schwarber, has penned a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
This is disheartening because there aren’t many Red Sox fans that didn’t want him back.
He was, arguably, the only free agent that the majority of Sox fans could agree on signing.
He only played 41 games this past season and Red Sox fans treated him like a seasoned veteran with the team.
All in all, speaking on behalf of Red Sox fans, thank you, Kyle Schwarber for an amazing 41 games that will never be forgotten.

     Summary: Unfortunately, it came less than 12 hours after Anthony Rizzo signed with the Yankees and right before the Philadelphia Phillies signed Kyle Schwarber.
All of this equated to a 3.2 WAR for a year split between the Washington Nationals and Boston Red Sox.
Kyle Schwarber headed to the Philadelphia Phillies on a four-year contract.
For one, based on his cup of coffee with the Red Sox, people seem to really like him.
He also now has deep postseason experience with multiple MLB franchises (Cubs, Red Sox).

Phillies officials were unable to comment on the 29-year-old left fielder because the agreement is pending a physical.
