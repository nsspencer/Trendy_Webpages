     Summary: Doyel:IU has a blast in NCAA tournament return, maybe we shouldn't be surprised anymoreNCAA dealt IU unnecessarily tough hand:But tight turnaround is right in Mike Woodson's wheelhouse.
The Hoosiers left Dayton so late Tuesday night/early Wednesday morning because they had to switch planes.
IU, like all teams, submitted paperwork declaring its traveling party size (the NCAA pays for team travel during the tournament).
They had to wait on a new plane in Dayton, hence the late takeoff.
It sounds like some luggage still had to be left behind and is going to be shipped to IU in Portland.

     March Madness 2022: Mike Woodson says Indiana basketball 'answered the bell' in First Four win over Wyoming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time since the 2015-16 season, the Indiana Hoosiers have won a game in the NCAA Tournament.
First-year head coach Mike Woodson led Indiana into the First Four on Tuesday night in Dayton, Ohio, and came out on the other side with a win over Wyoming to advance into the field of 64.
Indiana won the game by eight points, led by Trayce Jackson-Davis with a game-high 29 points on 10-of-16 shooting from the floor.
With the win, Indiana has now placed itself in the 12/5 game in the East region, facing Saint Mary’s this Thursday.
After the game, Woodson, Jackson-Davis and Geronimo all spoke to the media in Dayton about the win and what comes next.

     For Indiana basketball, it's finally all about the present now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Indiana basketball has spent a lot of time trapped in amber since Bob Knight was fired in 2000.
It was the 3rd-best NCAA Tournament scoring debut for an Indiana player in program history.
Given Wyoming’s offensive struggles, Indiana should have spent most of this game winning by 10-20 points.
But when Johnson gets going, Indiana can create enough offense to not completely waste its defensive effort.
And if that happens, these Hoosiers will keep the fanbase happily locked in to the present day.

     My Two Cents: For Hoosiers, It's Survive and Advance, And Acting Like You Want to Be There

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Outside of a few snarky tweets from point guard Xavier Johnson, the Hoosiers were happy to be here.
Wyoming guard Hunter Maldonado (24) is sealed off by Indiana forward Race Thompson duiring the Hoosiers' 66-58 win on Tuesday in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio.
It was much-needed on Tuesday night, and the Hoosiers will need him going forward if they want this season to continue.
Indiana sophomore Jordan Geronimo shook off an ankle injury and scored 15 huge points on Tuesday night in the Hoosiers' win over Wyoming.
Indiana came to Dayton with a purpose — to get a long-awaited NCAA Tournament win — and they never complained.
