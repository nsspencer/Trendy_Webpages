Defensively is where the Tigers can set the tone here and separate themselves from a sloppy Cyclones team.
Limiting three-point attempts and getting out in transition will be the Tigers best friend in their first-round matchup.

     Iowa vs. Richmond: Previewing Game One of the NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Iowa to accomplish this goal, it must first contend with the Richmond Spiders, a surprising qualifier to the field of 64 who earned four of its 23 wins by running the table in the A-10 conference tournament.
Perhaps that’s why DraftKings Sportsbook set the opening line at Iowa -9 - the highest of any 5/12 matchup in the tournament.
Iowa and Richmond both excel in two of the same areas: creating turnovers and preventing their opponents from doing the same.
Richmond is averaging 7.9 steals per game with Iowa close behind them at 7.4, while both teams rank in the top ten in the country in fewest turnovers allowed per game (9.2 for Iowa and 9.8 for Richmond).
If Iowa struggles with ball security in this game, don’t be surprised to see Richmond keep things competitive long enough to make Hawkeye fans nervous.
