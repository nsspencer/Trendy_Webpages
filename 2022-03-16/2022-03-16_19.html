     March Madness 2022: Rutgers-Notre Dame First Four picks, predictions | Will Scarlet Knights advance in NCAA Tournament?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Scarlet Knights will take on Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament First Four on Wednesday night (9:10 p.m.
Here are NJ.com’s staff picks:Brian Fonseca, beat reporter: Notre Dame has a solid record (22-10, 15-5 in ACC) and some gaudy numbers (29th most efficient offense nationally, 19th nationally in 3-point percentage at 37.7%).
Notre Dame has one good win in 2022, a road win over current 10-seed Miami.
The Scarlet Knights have length that Notre Dame has rarely seen this season.
Fact is, the Scarlet Knights have a much lengthier list of victories against quality opponents, and that toughness and experience will benefit them in a win-or-go-home atmosphere.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I implore you all to dive in below and arm yourselves with knowledge before the Irish’s big game tonight — you absolutely will not regret doing so.
The next game Rutgers trailed at Northwestern by 24 points in the second half before Mulcahy led a furious comeback.
How do you think Rutgers plans to defend those two, and how effective do you think they’ll be?
I do think Rutgers will mix in some full-court pressure to try and speed the game up.
Irish fans will truly feel like they’ve learned what makes this Rutgers team tick prior to tip-off this evening.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today is the day that Rutgers men’s basketball takes on Notre Dame in the First Four round of the NCAA Tournament!
PS: He’s been a game-changer, just because he brings an athleticism, aggression, and skill set that no one else on the Notre Dame team really has.
All those similar teams I mentioned above, as you might have noted, are teams that Notre Dame went winless against this season.
Thanks so much to Patrick for giving such great insight on Notre Dame basketball ahead of tonight’s NCAA Tournament First Four game against the Scarlet Knights.
