     Yankees’ Infield Is Complete, but Comes With Questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By bringing back first baseman Anthony Rizzo on a two-year contract, the Yankees’ 2022 infield is now complete.
But some big questions loom for a team that is no longer at the top of baseball’s spending perch.
Rizzo’s deal, which is pending a physical, will pay him $32 million over two years and has an opt-out clause after the first season.
With Rizzo, the Yankees will have a three-time All-Star at first base, a two-time All-Star at second base (Gleyber Torres), a one-time American League most valuable player at third base (Josh Donaldson) and a Gold Glove winner at shortstop (Isiah Kiner-Falefa).
Included in that figure is $5.25 million owed to Luke Voit, a power-hitting right-handed bat whom Manager Aaron Boone had referred to as this season’s first baseman but will now presumably seek at-bats as a backup first baseman and designated hitter.

More from Luke Voit after the Anthony Rizzo signing: "This is the best place to play baseball.
— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) March 16, 2022The Yankees made it awkward for Luke Voit after signing Anthony Rizzo.
Why did they not trade Voit if they knew they were bringing in another first baseman to supplant him?
Trading for Donaldson and signing Rizzo weren’t necessarily bad moves.

     How Anthony Rizzo’s signing impacts payroll, prospects, and future moves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As we did yesterday with the Josh Donaldson trade, let’s break down what Rizzo’s signing means for the Yankees’ roster construction, payroll, prospects, and future moves.
The Yankees have Rizzo, Voit, LeMahieu, Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and Gleyber Torres to cover four positions.
According to Cot’s Contracts at Baseball Prospectus, his signing brings the Yankees’ 2022 payroll to just over $251 million.
This means they will be taxed at 20 percent on the $20 million over the $230 million threshold and 32 percent on the $1.5 million and change over the $250 million threshold.
This calculates out to right around a $4.5 million tax bill for 2022 (should they decline to increase payroll further).

     MLB free agency: Yankees bring back Anthony Rizzo on two-year deal worth $32 million, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Yankees are bringing back a familiar face to balance out their righty-heavy lineup.
New York has agreed to a two-year contract worth $32 million with lefty-hitting, free-agent first baseman Anthony Rizzo, reports ESPN's Jesse Rogers and The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.
Rizzo, 32, joined the Yankees in a deadline trade with the Chicago Cubs last season.
MLB's home run leader during the shortened 2020 season, Voit dealt with a series of knee injuries last season, prompting the Yankees to trade for Rizzo at the deadline.
Last season the Yankees went 92-70 and were eliminated by the rival Boston Red Sox in the AL Wild Card Game.

     Yankees' Luke Voit Comments on Uncertain Future After Anthony Rizzo Signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees re-signed Rizzo on Tuesday night, likely supplanting Voit as New York's starting first baseman.
TAMPA — Two days ago, Luke Voit was dubbed the Yankees starting first baseman by his manager, a title that promised more playing time after an injury-plagued campaign a year ago.
New York re-signed Anthony Rizzo on Tuesday night, a move that appears to erase all question marks regarding the first base position for this coming season.
When Rizzo was brought in last year at the trade deadline from Chicago, the ex-Cub immediately transitioned into a starting role.
"I know they want to be left-handed so I get it," Voit said Wednesday morning, speaking for the first time since the Rizzo signing.

     Bummed Luke Voit reacts to Yankees signing Anthony Rizzo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Luke Voit was politically correct standing at his locker Wednesday morning commenting on the Yankees signing free agent Anthony Rizzo about 10 hours earlier.
Tuesday’s late night signing of Rizzo to a two-year, $32-million deal wasn’t just a late-season deal to address Voit having an injury-plagued year.
This move was more permanent and likely will result in Voit being moved before the Yankees’ April 7 season opener.
“These next 19 games are important for me to show other teams … prove that I’m healthy again,” Voit said.
Voit, 31, spent a little time in Triple-A following the deal, but was a highly impactful Yankees first baseman by year’s end.

I guess that reason isn’t what it used to be.”As for Rizzo, Boone called him “a great player.
