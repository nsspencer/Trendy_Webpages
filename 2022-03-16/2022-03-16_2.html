     Davante Adams' reunion with Derek Carr gives Las Vegas Raiders an elite, All-Pro WR in his prime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Gutierrez breaks down how trading for Davante Adams is beneficial to Derek Carr and the Raiders.
So yeah, Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has had "names" to throw the ball to in his eight-year NFL career.
But with Thursday's blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers for Davante Adams, Carr not only has his first true, still-in-his-prime No.
Because unless the Raiders shore up things up front to give Carr time, it won't matter who is running routes for him.
Adams as WR1 also gives Carr in particular, the Raiders in general, a dominating pass-catching corps.

     Packers Trade Davante Adams in Stunning Blockbuster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers is back but without his right-hand man as the Packers traded Davante Adams to the Raiders on Thursday night.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – In a stunning trade for the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl aspirations, the team traded All-Pro receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday night.
Perhaps the Packers can land a veteran in free agency; Adams cost $20.1 million under the franchise tag.
Everyone in the stadium knew where Rodgers wanted to fire the football and it usually didn’t matter.
Adams wanted to be more of a force after the catch, so he forced 13 missed tackles compared to only four in 2020 and 15 the previous three seasons combined.

3) Chiefs GM Brett Veach: As happy as Hill has to be with this Adams news, the opposite should be said of Veach.
The hot topic around Kansas City may be the negotiations Veach is having with left tackle Orlando Brown Jr., who received the franchise tag.
If they have to overpay to keep Brown, then the Hill negotiation could become even more difficult.
