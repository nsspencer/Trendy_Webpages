    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham ace Harry Kane became the Premier League's highest away goalscorer in history on Wednesday as he fired his side two goals ahead against Brighton.
While Spurs won 2-0 and stayed in the hunt for a Champions League place in the Premier League table, the night was all about a new individual record in Premier League play.
More notably, it also earned him a slice of Premier League history as well as putting Spurs on the way to a valuable win on the road.
MORE: Updated Premier League table, CL &amp; relegation battlesSpurs moved to 48 points on the season with the victory, in seventh place and level with sixth-placed West Ham in the Premier League table.
Spurs three points back of Arsenal in the final Champions League place, with the Gunners holding one game in hand.

     Liverpool's win at Arsenal gives them the momentum to eclipse Manchester City in Premier League chase
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Momentum is a vital ingredient for any team chasing a league title and Liverpool are over-flowing with it right now.
Second-half goals by Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino at the Emirates secured Liverpool's ninth straight league win and moved them to just one point behind leaders City, who they face at the Etihad on April 10.
Monday's 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was an unexpected stumble by City, but Liverpool still had to beat Arsenal to capitalise on it.
The reality of this Arsenal team is that it now has an identity and a clear pathway in front of it.
They have won their last nine league games -- if they win their next nine, Liverpool will be champions.

     Jurgen Klopp Hints At Summer Transfer Swoop For Premier League Star Ahead of Liverpool Vs Arsenal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his pre-Arsenal press conference, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp hinted at his next transfer target when discussing Manchester City's recent match against Crystal Palace.
Jurgen Klopp's side will be hoping to leave Emirates Stadium with all three points after title rivals Manchester City dropped points to Crystal Palace.
Despite all eyes being on tonight's match, many are looking forward to the summer transfer window.
However, if you look closely, they hint at a potential Liverpool transfer.
The 20-year-old has been very impressive since he joined Crystal Palace from Reading this past summer in an £8.37 million transfer move.

The club were bottom of the table in August, and players such as Ben White were yet to establish themselves.
But as the season progressed, players such as Martin Odegaard, Buyako Saka, and Aaron Ramsdale started to prove their worth.
They then proceeded to secure a famous Premier League title in the eerie atmosphere of the pandemic-inflicted season.

     Summary: Arsenal v Liverpool predictionsLiverpool will stumbleWith all due respect to Liverpool, they are going to stumble here.
Since the 1st of January and their loss to Manchester City, Arsenal have won five and drawn only one game.
Arsenal and Liverpool played once this season and Liverpool won 4-0, which sounds good for the Reds coming into this game.
In the next few weeks, apart from the Champions League matchup, they are going to play, the Reds have Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, and Newcastle away from home.
While Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham are obvious, they are also not going to glide through Everton, Villa, and Newcastle as well.
