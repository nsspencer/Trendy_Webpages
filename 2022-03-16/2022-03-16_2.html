     Japan earthquake: 7.3 quake off Fukushima sparks memories of 2011 tsunami
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima in northern Japan on Wednesday evening, triggering a tsunami advisory and plunging more than 2 million homes in the Tokyo area into darkness.
The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 quake and tsunami 11 years ago that also caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
The agency issued a tsunami advisory for up to a meter (3-foot) sea surge in parts of Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures.
More than 2 million homes were without electricity in the Tokyo region serviced by TEPCO due to the quake, the utility said on its website.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings swayed violently.

     Live Updates: Quake Near Fukushima in Japan Prompts Tsunami Alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video The 7.3 magnitude earthquake lasted more than two minutes.
The magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit at 11:36 p.m. and the shaking lasted more than two minutes.
The Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami advisories for Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures and residents were warned that waves of up to 1 meter could hit the coasts.
The intensity of the earthquake equaled that of the Kobe earthquake of 1995, which killed more than 6,000 people.
After the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011, three reactors at the Daiichi plant melted down after tsunami waves breached the power station’s protective sea walls and inundated the facility.

     Japan hit by 7.3 magnitude earthquake, tsunami advisory issued
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 jolted Japan's northeast coast on March 16, shaking buildings as far away as Tokyo.
A tsunami advisory was issued for Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, but the surge in water levels wasn’t expected to crest above three feet.
Earthquake Detailed Report – 3/16At around 11:36pm, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 occurred offshore Fukushima Prefecture at a depth of 60km.
The March 11, 2011, earthquake in Japan registered more than a 9 on the moment magnitude scale — meaning it released about 355 times more energy than Thursday’s quake.
That’s because the moment magnitude scale isn’t linear.

     Japan earthquake knocks out power to millions, prompts brief tsunami advisory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not long after the quake struck at 11:36 p.m. an advisory for tsunami waves of about three feet was issued for parts of the northeast coast.
PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later said there was no longer a tsunami threat, though the Japan Meteorological Agency kept its low risk advisory in place.
NHK national television said tsunami waves of 8 inches had already reached shore in one area.
The flooding swamped the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing a meltdown.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that there were also no abnormalities at two other nuclear power plants in the region.
