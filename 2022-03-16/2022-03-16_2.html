     Tsunami alert issued after 7.3 earthquake strikes near Fukushima, Japan, site of 2011 nuclear disaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A strong 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook off the coast near Fukushima, Japan – site of a nuclear disaster in 2011 – late Wednesday, prompting a tsunami alert and knocking out power to more than 2 million customers across the country.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings shook violently.
The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami 11 years ago that also caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
Wednesday’s quake came only days after the area marked the 11th anniversary of the disaster in March 2011.
The 2011 earthquake was 9.1 magnitude, some 63 times stronger, and released about 500 times more energy than Wednesday's quake, CNN reported.

     Summary: A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima in northern Japan on Wednesday evening, triggering a tsunami advisory and plunging more than 2 million homes in the Tokyo area into darkness.
The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 quake and tsunami 11 years ago that also caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
The agency issued a tsunami advisory for up to a meter (3-foot) sea surge in parts of Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures.
More than 2 million homes were without electricity in the Tokyo region serviced by TEPCO due to the quake, the utility said on its website.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings swayed violently.

     Live Updates: Quake Near Fukushima in Japan Prompts Tsunami Alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video The 7.3 magnitude earthquake lasted more than two minutes.
The magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit at 11:36 p.m. and the shaking lasted more than two minutes.
The Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami advisories for Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures and residents were warned that waves of up to 1 meter could hit the coasts.
The intensity of the earthquake equaled that of the Kobe earthquake of 1995, which killed more than 6,000 people.
After the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011, three reactors at the Daiichi plant melted down after tsunami waves breached the power station’s protective sea walls and inundated the facility.

     Summary: The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 quake and tsunami 11 years ago that also triggered nuclear plant meltdowns, spewing massive radiation that still makes some parts uninhabitable.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no longer a tsunami threat though the Japan Meteorological Agency kept its low risk advisory in place.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake hit at 11:36 p.m. at a depth of 60 kilometers (36 miles) below the sea.
