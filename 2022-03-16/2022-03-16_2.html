     Buffalo Bills sign defensive end Von Miller to a six-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was 10 years ago that the Buffalo Bills made a big splash in free agency when they signed Mario Williams to a $100 million contract.
A decade later the Bills once again sign one of the top defensive ends available by agreeing to a six-year deal with former Los Angeles Rams pass rusher Von Miller.
Miller spent most of his career with the Denver Broncos after they drafted him second overall in 2011.
Buffalo Bills get that top tier edge rusher to transform their defenseThe Buffalo Bills had one of the top defenses in the NFL but one area they really struggled with was getting consistent pressure on the quarterback.
The Buffalo Bills certainly had to pay a premium price to achieve this but now have the most talented pass rusher since they added Mario Williams 10 years ago.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams will attempt to run it back without outside linebacker Von Miller.
On Wednesday, the Rams lost a key part of their Super Bowl-winning team when Miller announced he was signing with the Buffalo Bills.
The six-year contract averages $17.5 million per year for the first four years, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL.com.
After the Super Bowl, star defensive lineman Aaron Donald said the Rams could “run it back” if they kept their “super” team in place, and that included Miller.
Noteboom and Allen agreed to terms with the Rams, and the Rams announced that Noteboom signed his contract Wednesday, the first day of the NFL’s new league year.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller has agreed to terms with the Buffalo Bills on a six-year contract, the team announced Wednesday.
The Bills also brought in the veteran tight end they were looking for, agreeing with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end O.J.
Miller immediately becomes the best pass-rusher on the Bills' roster, despite the team significantly investing in defensive ends in the past two drafts.
It was Miller's second Super Bowl championship.
The Bills used two-plus tight ends on a league-low 100 plays last season, per ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.

     Von Miller signing with Bills on six-year, $120M deal; Buffalo also adds TE O.J. Howard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bills added to the other side of the ball, too, signing Buccaneers tight end O.J.
Evidently, the price wasn't too rich for Buffalo's blood, as the Bills added a huge name to a defensive front that also includes promising second-year player Greg Rousseau.
In simple terms, Miller's deal is massive for a player who turns 33 before the end of March.
The eight-time Pro Bowler and three-time first-team All-Pro has been an elite edge rusher at his peak, but injuries have hampered him in recent seasons.
Howard joins a tight end group headlined by surprise contributor Dawson Knox, who set career-high marks in receptions (71), yards (587) and touchdown catches (nine) in 2021.
