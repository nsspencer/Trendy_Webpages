     Anthony Rizzo returns, but move only creates more questions for Bombers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gleyber Torres’ struggles at shortstop created the dire need for the Yankees to go out and get Isiah Kiner-Falefa to fill that spot.
The easy answer for the Yankees is to move him to second base, but that causes a domino effect of questions.
That is where LeMahieu was expected to play when he signed the six-year, $90 million deal with the Yankees before last season.
Moving him to third was an option, but the Yankees also brought in former American League MVP Josh Donaldson with Kiner-Falefa so that limits his time there.
LeMahieu can also play a utility role, which he played perfectly in 2019, but it dilutes the value of one of their best right-handed hitters.

     Yankees re-sign Anthony Rizzo on 2-year deal worth $32 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsThe New York Yankees are bringing back Anthony Rizzo on a two-year, $32 million deal, according to reports late Tuesday night.
His signing settles the search for New York’s first baseman while also providing a much-needed left-handed bat in a right-handed heavy lineup.
The Yankees had been linked to free-agent Freddie Freeman, who will not be returning to the Atlanta Braves after they acquired Matt Olson from the Oakland Athletics on Monday.
Rizzo, a three-time All-Star, was acquired by the Yankees at the trade deadline last season from the Chicago Cubs — the organization he spent nine-plus seasons with.
Rizzo’s return will shake up the Yankees’ fielding tactics further after acquiring Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa from the Minnesota Twins for Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela on Monday.

     Anthony Rizzo agrees to $32M, 2-year deal with Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articleAnthony Rizzo is staying with the New York Yankees, agreeing Tuesday night to a $32 million, two-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.
A three-time All-Star first baseman, Rizzo was acquired by the Yankees from the Chicago Cubs on July 29 and added a left-handed bat to a heavily right-handed batting order in New York.
Rizzo also provided plate discipline and smooth fielding at first, where he has won a pair of Gold Gloves.

Unless New York City changes its requirement, he will need to be vaccinated in order to play at Yankee Stadium.

Late on Tuesday night, it came out that the New York Yankees were going to re-sign Rizzo.
Former Chicago Cubs superstar Anthony Rizzo is headed to the New York Yankees.
He brought so much to that Cubs team in 2016 that he has earned the right to make some money with the Yankees.

     MLB News: New York Yankees Sign First Baseman Anthony Rizzo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Normally, who the Yankees decide to sign, or not sign, has little impact on the Dodgers.
But when a team that was reportedly in on Freddie Freeman seemingly exits the sweepstakes, it’s newsworthy.
On Tuesday night, the Yankees, according to multiple reports, re-signed Anthony Rizzo to a two-year deal.
Like the Dodgers, New York is a major market club that was sorely in need of a left-handed slugger.
Atlanta, where Freeman has played all 12 of his MLB seasons, traded four top prospects for the Oakland Athletics for All-Star first baseman Matt Olson.

     Summary: If the Yankees were to acquire any of them, it could mean the end of Voit’s time in pinstripes.
Hours later, the Yankees turned one of those rumors to reality: They re-signed Rizzo for two years and $32 million.
MLB Trade Rumors projected that Voit could make $5.4 million via salary arbitration in 2022.
It’s difficult to question the impact Voit could have on the Yankees’ offense if he stays healthy.
At the trade deadline, the Yankees acquired Rizzo from the Cubs, unsure whether Voit would be able to play every day.

     Yankees bring back Anthony Rizzo: PSA Community Reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday afternoon, manager Aaron Boone declared Luke Voit the Yankees starting first baseman.
At the time, he was technically correct, as Voit was the only natural first baseman still on the roster.
I am, of course, referring to the news that the NYC private sector mandate does, in fact, apply to the New York Yankees.
Also signing someone who may not be able to play home games and 9 games against Toronto isn't exactly wise imo.
Your thoughts on the Yankees bringing Rizzo back into the fold last night were very, very clear.
