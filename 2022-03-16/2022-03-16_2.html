     Summary: AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHere is a region by region breakdown of which teams to focus on and which teams should be discounted based on public perception.
The Red Raiders are the 13th best team in the country per the consensus rankings of 59 different methods and also boast the No.
The Longhorns are the 15th best team per Pomeroy’s ratings and feature an opportunistic defense that forces turnovers on over 23 percent of possessions.
5 Iowa is a solid contrarian Final Four, and a bracket with Houston or Iowa winning eliminates almost the entire field from contention.

Gary ParrishClick to enlarge Gary's bracketYes, once again, I'm picking Gonzaga to win the national title.
I've maintained the entire season that teams as low as the 4-line are good enough to make it to New Orleans.
There have been great Gonzaga teams -- even some better than this one.
This Gonzaga team isn't last year's squad, and is a bit more flawed, but it's certainly good enough to finish the job.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second straight season, the Gonzaga Bulldogs will open the men's NCAA tournament as the betting favorite.
ESPN's Basketball Power Index gives Mark Few's team a 56.9% chance to reach the Final Four, the best percentage in this field.
1 seed Arizona (29 picks) was the top choice, but perhaps concerns over Kerr Kriisa's injury helped generate additional counter support for 3-seed and SEC champ Tennessee (13 picks), Villanova (6 picks), Houston (4 picks) and Illinois (2 picks).
Create BracketRoughly 75% of ESPN respondents picked Gonzaga to win the title last season -- this season the number was less than 50%.
A high level of support exists for Arizona (15 picks), with multiple championship picks for the likes of Kansas (4 picks), Kentucky (3 picks), Houston (3 picks), Purdue (2 picks) and Tennessee (2 picks).
