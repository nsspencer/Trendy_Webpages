     Summary: Opponents already had to account for one slugging lefty in the middle of the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup in Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP.
Kyle Schwarber and the Phillies agreed to a four-year deal worth $79 million on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.
NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported the news and The Athletic said the contract has an average annual value of just under $20 million per year.
“I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team,” Harper said Wednesday.
After the Cubs non-tendered him during the 2020-21 offseason, Schwarber signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals.

     Phillies finally make big splash in free agency with slugger Kyle Schwarber
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies are signing Kyle Schwarber to a 4-year deal.
And according to the Boston Globe’s Alex Speier, the Phillies beat out the Boston Red Sox to get him.
And with the CBT increased by $20M, the Phillies have the payroll flexibility they were so concerned about last fall, when they came close to signing Schwarber, but stalled before the lockout.
The signing also reunites Schwarber with the hitting coach whom he credits with his resurgence last season, Kevin Long, whom the Phillies hired at the beginning of the offseason.
The hiring was actually one of the first indicators that Schwarber would consider the Phillies as a landing spot in free agency.

     Summary: (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Kyle from Waltham is leaving the Red SoxFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder, Kyle Schwarber, has penned a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
This is disheartening because there aren’t many Red Sox fans that didn’t want him back.
He was, arguably, the only free agent that the majority of Sox fans could agree on signing.
He only played 41 games this past season and Red Sox fans treated him like a seasoned veteran with the team.
All in all, speaking on behalf of Red Sox fans, thank you, Kyle Schwarber for an amazing 41 games that will never be forgotten.

All of this equated to a 3.2 WAR for a year split between the Washington Nationals and Boston Red Sox.
Kyle Schwarber headed to the Philadelphia Phillies on a four-year contract.
For one, based on his cup of coffee with the Red Sox, people seem to really like him.
He also now has deep postseason experience with multiple MLB franchises (Cubs, Red Sox).
