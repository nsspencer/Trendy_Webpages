     Yankees’ Infield Is Complete, but Comes With Questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By bringing back first baseman Anthony Rizzo on a two-year contract, the Yankees’ 2022 infield is now complete.
But some big questions loom for a team that is no longer at the top of baseball’s spending perch.
Rizzo’s deal, which is pending a physical, will pay him $32 million over two years and has an opt-out clause after the first season.
With Rizzo, the Yankees will have a three-time All-Star at first base, a two-time All-Star at second base (Gleyber Torres), a one-time American League most valuable player at third base (Josh Donaldson) and a Gold Glove winner at shortstop (Isiah Kiner-Falefa).
Included in that figure is $5.25 million owed to Luke Voit, a power-hitting right-handed bat whom Manager Aaron Boone had referred to as this season’s first baseman but will now presumably seek at-bats as a backup first baseman and designated hitter.

     Yankees re-sign Anthony Rizzo on 2-year deal worth $32 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsThe New York Yankees are bringing back Anthony Rizzo on a two-year, $32 million deal, according to reports late Tuesday night.
His signing settles the search for New York’s first baseman while also providing a much-needed left-handed bat in a right-handed heavy lineup.
The Yankees had been linked to free-agent Freddie Freeman, who will not be returning to the Atlanta Braves after they acquired Matt Olson from the Oakland Athletics on Monday.
Rizzo, a three-time All-Star, was acquired by the Yankees at the trade deadline last season from the Chicago Cubs — the organization he spent nine-plus seasons with.
Rizzo’s return will shake up the Yankees’ fielding tactics further after acquiring Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa from the Minnesota Twins for Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela on Monday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs traded Anthony Rizzo at last year’s MLB Trade Deadline.
Rizzo ended up with the New York Yankees where he was welcomed with open arms.
Late on Tuesday night, it came out that the New York Yankees were going to re-sign Rizzo.
Former Chicago Cubs superstar Anthony Rizzo is headed to the New York Yankees.
He brought so much to that Cubs team in 2016 that he has earned the right to make some money with the Yankees.

     Bummed Luke Voit reacts to Yankees signing Anthony Rizzo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Luke Voit was politically correct standing at his locker Wednesday morning commenting on the Yankees signing free agent Anthony Rizzo about 10 hours earlier.
Tuesday’s late night signing of Rizzo to a two-year, $32-million deal wasn’t just a late-season deal to address Voit having an injury-plagued year.
This move was more permanent and likely will result in Voit being moved before the Yankees’ April 7 season opener.
“These next 19 games are important for me to show other teams … prove that I’m healthy again,” Voit said.
Voit, 31, spent a little time in Triple-A following the deal, but was a highly impactful Yankees first baseman by year’s end.

     Yankees' Luke Voit Comments on Uncertain Future After Anthony Rizzo Signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees re-signed Rizzo on Tuesday night, likely supplanting Voit as New York's starting first baseman.
TAMPA — Two days ago, Luke Voit was dubbed the Yankees starting first baseman by his manager, a title that promised more playing time after an injury-plagued campaign a year ago.
New York re-signed Anthony Rizzo on Tuesday night, a move that appears to erase all question marks regarding the first base position for this coming season.
When Rizzo was brought in last year at the trade deadline from Chicago, the ex-Cub immediately transitioned into a starting role.
"I know they want to be left-handed so I get it," Voit said Wednesday morning, speaking for the first time since the Rizzo signing.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Anthony Rizzo’s arrival likely means the end of Luke Voit’s time with the Yankees.
Rizzo’s two-year deal — not official as of Wednesday morning, but Rizzo did have a jersey in the clubhouse — means there’s no logical spot for Voit on the roster.
“Obviously, everyone saw the speculation, so you guys got it right,” Voit said.
Anthony Rizzo singles during a Yankees game on Sept. 19, 2021.
“These next 19 games are important for me to prove myself and show that I’m healthy again,” Voit said.

     AP source: 1B Anthony Rizzo agrees to $32M, 2-year deal with Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP source: 1B Anthony Rizzo agrees to $32M, 2-year deal with YankeesAnthony Rizzo is staying with the New York Yankees, agreeing Tuesday night to a $32 million, two-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.
A three-time All-Star first baseman, Rizzo was acquired by the Yankees from the Chicago Cubs on July 29 and added a left-handed bat to a heavily right-handed batting order in New York.
Rizzo also provided plate discipline and smooth fielding at first, where he has won a pair of Gold Gloves.
The deal makes it less likely the Yankees will sign former Atlanta All-Star Freddie Freeman.
Both Rizzo and outfielder Joey Gallo, a strikeout-prone left-handed hitter, were New York's primary acquisitions at last summer's trade deadline.
