     Premier League: Liverpool Pick Up Crucial Arsenal Win To Close Down Gap On Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool reignited the Premier League title race and came within a point of the top spot with a 2-0 win over Arsenal on Wednesday after scoring two second-half goals to extend their winning streak to nine games.
Liverpool now has 69 points, one behind Manchester City, which slipped up with a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace on Monday.
If Liverpool can win its remaining nine matches, including against City on April 10, the Reds will win the league.
“But momentum is the most fragile flower on the planet.”His team is trying to reclaim the Premier League title from City, which lifted the trophy last season.
Liverpool left back Andy Robertson predicted the title race could go down to the wire.

     Liverpool's win at Arsenal gives them the momentum to eclipse Manchester City in Premier League chase
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Momentum is a vital ingredient for any team chasing a league title and Liverpool are over-flowing with it right now.
Second-half goals by Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino at the Emirates secured Liverpool's ninth straight league win and moved them to just one point behind leaders City, who they face at the Etihad on April 10.
Monday's 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was an unexpected stumble by City, but Liverpool still had to beat Arsenal to capitalise on it.
The reality of this Arsenal team is that it now has an identity and a clear pathway in front of it.
They have won their last nine league games -- if they win their next nine, Liverpool will be champions.

     Summary: Mikel Arteta’s men had been closing in on a Champions League finish this season, with games in hand on Manchester United.
The club were bottom of the table in August, and players such as Ben White were yet to establish themselves.
But as the season progressed, players such as Martin Odegaard, Buyako Saka, and Aaron Ramsdale started to prove their worth.
They then proceeded to secure a famous Premier League title in the eerie atmosphere of the pandemic-inflicted season.

     Summary: Arsenal v Liverpool predictionsLiverpool will stumbleWith all due respect to Liverpool, they are going to stumble here.
Since the 1st of January and their loss to Manchester City, Arsenal have won five and drawn only one game.
Arsenal and Liverpool played once this season and Liverpool won 4-0, which sounds good for the Reds coming into this game.
In the next few weeks, apart from the Champions League matchup, they are going to play, the Reds have Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, and Newcastle away from home.
While Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham are obvious, they are also not going to glide through Everton, Villa, and Newcastle as well.
