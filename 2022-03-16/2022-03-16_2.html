     Japanese officials say 4 dead after 7.4 earthquake near Fukushima, site of 2011 nuclear disaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A strong 7.4 magnitude earthquake shook off the coast near Fukushima, Japan – the site of a nuclear disaster in 2011 – late Wednesday, killing four people according to Japanese officials.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings shook violently.
The region is part of northern Japan that was devastated by a deadly 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami 11 years ago that also caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
Wednesday’s quake came only days after the area marked the 11th anniversary of the disaster in March 2011.
The 2011 earthquake was 9.1 magnitude, some 63 times stronger, and released about 500 times more energy than Wednesday's quake, CNN reported.

     Japan hit by 7.3-magnitude earthquake

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 jolted Japan's northeast coast on March 16, shaking buildings as far away as Tokyo.
Earthquake Detailed Report – 3/16At around 11:36pm, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 occurred offshore Fukushima Prefecture at a depth of 60km.
#earthquake pic.twitter.com/nnD83Kuzkd — NERV (@EN_NERV) March 16, 2022That’s still enough to inundate some vulnerable pockets of the shoreline, but Japanese infrastructure is designed around mitigating earthquake and tsunami risk.
The March 11, 2011, earthquake in Japan registered more than a 9 on the moment magnitude scale — meaning it released about 355 times as much energy as Thursday’s quake.
That’s because the moment magnitude scale isn’t linear.
