     Summary: Matt Chapman cranked 27 home runs in 2021; check out some of them.
(1:52)The Oakland Athletics have traded away another former All-Star, sending third baseman Matt Chapman to the Toronto Blue Jays for four prospects, the A's announced Wednesday.
Chapman, 28, is a three-time Gold Glove winner (2018, 2019 and 2021) and was an All-Star in 2019.
"You see what was happening around here,'' Chapman said of Oakland.
Toronto went 91-71 last year but finished one game behind Boston and New York in the AL wild-card race.

     Summary: Jays, I thought we had a deal; you don't do things before 8:00 am my time, and I don't whine and complain.
Anyway, there are many reports that the Blue Jays have traded for Matt Chapman from the A's.
The last time we traded for an A's third baseman, it went very well, so I'm expecting the same this time.
Shi Davidi tells us that Gunnar Hoglund, Kevin Smith, Zach Logue and Kirby Snead are heading to Oakland.
He's a right-handed hitter, so it doesn't help the Jays' need for a lefty bat, but he fills our need at third base.

Don’t get me wrong, each of these prospects has something to offer, but not at the level of costing Chapman.

     Summary: TORONTO (AP) — All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman was acquired by the Toronto Blue Jays from the payroll-shredding Oakland Athletics for four players on Wednesday.
“He’s a big-time threat on both sides of the ball and that’s hard to find,” Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said of Chapman from spring training in Dunedin, Florida.
He is expected to join the Blue Jays on Thursday.
“Our defense just got a lot better,″ Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo.
The Blue Jays have had success in the past with former Oakland infielders.

     Matt Chapman trade: Toronto Blue Jays acquire third baseman as Oakland A's fire sale continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oakland has reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays in a trade that will send All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman north of the border, the teams announced.
He hit .210/.314/.403 (100 OPS+) with 15 doubles, three triples, 27 homers, 72 RBI, 75 runs and 3.5 WAR last season.
The three-time Gold Glover obviously slides in as the everyday third baseman for the Blue Jays.
In the biggest move, they shipped first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves, effectively ruling last season's World Series champions out of the sweepstakes for franchise legend Freddie Freeman.
In light of Anthony Rizzo re-signing with the Yankees and the Blue Jays getting Chapman, the race for Freeman is down to the Rays, Red Sox, Padres and Dodgers, according to Bowden.

     Summary: From Oakland's perspective, Chapman is the second Matt the Athletics have traded this week, joining new Atlanta Braves first baseman Matt Olson.
This likely won't be the final time this month the Athletics are featured in one of our "Trade Grade" pieces.
Blue Jays grade: BThere's no denying that Chapman is a phenomenal talent.
You're unlikely to reach base 40 percent of the time or post a .500 slugging percentage if you're hitting around .215, the way Chapman has the last two years.
(His career average, even with last season taken into account, is 326 feet.)
