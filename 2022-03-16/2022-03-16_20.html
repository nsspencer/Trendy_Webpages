     Summary: “I’m excited,” Chapman said.
“They’ve already got a great thing going, and I just want to come in and do my part and be a part of a great team that’s already achieved so much.
And now coming back after what they did last year ready to rock, and they keep adding pieces.
… They’ve got a lot of good pieces, good pitching.
I get to go play defense and show people what I can do.”

     Blue Jays acquire All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman from the Athletics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fire sale continues for the Oakland Athletics, who traded All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman to the Blue Jays, Toronto announced Wednesday.
The injury caused him to fall to 19th and the Blue Jays in the 2021 draft.
Former All-Star second baseman Carlos Baerga first reported on Instagram that a trade agreement is in place.
It's the second time in eight years the A's and Blue Jays completed a deal for an All-Star third baseman with multiple seasons before free agency.
In 2015, Donaldson won the AL MVP award as the Blue Jays returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1993.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jays, I thought we had a deal; you don't do things before 8:00 am my time, and I don't whine and complain.
Anyway, there are many reports that the Blue Jays have traded for Matt Chapman from the A's.
The last time we traded for an A's third baseman, it went very well, so I'm expecting the same this time.
Shi Davidi tells us that Gunnar Hoglund, Kevin Smith, Zach Logue and Kirby Snead are heading to Oakland.
He's a right-handed hitter, so it doesn't help the Jays' need for a lefty bat, but he fills our need at third base.

     Matt Chapman trade: Toronto Blue Jays acquire third baseman as Oakland A's fire sale continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oakland has reached an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays in a trade that will send All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman north of the border, the teams announced.
He hit .210/.314/.403 (100 OPS+) with 15 doubles, three triples, 27 homers, 72 RBI, 75 runs and 3.5 WAR last season.
The three-time Gold Glover obviously slides in as the everyday third baseman for the Blue Jays.
In the biggest move, they shipped first baseman Matt Olson to the Atlanta Braves, effectively ruling last season's World Series champions out of the sweepstakes for franchise legend Freddie Freeman.
In light of Anthony Rizzo re-signing with the Yankees and the Blue Jays getting Chapman, the race for Freeman is down to the Rays, Red Sox, Padres and Dodgers, according to Bowden.

In return for Chapman, the A’s receive four prospects from the Jays: RHP Gunnar Hoglund, SS Kevin Smith, LHP Zach Logue, and LHP Kirby Snead.

Don’t get me wrong, each of these prospects has something to offer, but not at the level of costing Chapman.
If this was all they could get for Chapman, then keeping him might have been the better bet.

Chapman, 28, was the A’s first round pick in 2014 out of Cal State-Fullerton, and has manned the hot corner for them since the middle of 2017.
Chapman is considered the gold standard as far as third base defense goes, and won his third gold glove in 2021.
Hogland, 21, is a righthanded pitcher who was the Jays’ first round pick (#19 overall) in the 2021 draft out of Ole Miss.
Smith, 25, was the Jays’ fourth round pick in 2017.

     Summary: From Oakland's perspective, Chapman is the second Matt the Athletics have traded this week, joining new Atlanta Braves first baseman Matt Olson.
This likely won't be the final time this month the Athletics are featured in one of our "Trade Grade" pieces.
Blue Jays grade: BThere's no denying that Chapman is a phenomenal talent.
You're unlikely to reach base 40 percent of the time or post a .500 slugging percentage if you're hitting around .215, the way Chapman has the last two years.
(His career average, even with last season taken into account, is 326 feet.)

“He’s a big-time threat on both sides of the ball and that’s hard to find,” Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said of Chapman from spring training in Dunedin, Florida.
He is expected to join the Blue Jays on Thursday.
“Our defense just got a lot better,″ Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo.
