     Summary: USA TODAY Atlantic Digital TeamAfter waiting 30 years to return to the NCAA Tournament, Rutgers and senior guard Geo Baker are hoping to make a second consecutive run in the Big Dance.
Rutgers basketball:Steve Pikiell foresaw big things for this team.
Rutgers basketball cornerstoneAlong with fellow seniors Ron Harper Jr. and Caleb McConnell, Baker is part of arguably the most important Rutgers basketball core group in recent memory.
“They have done it the right way, with class,” Pikiell said ahead of Rutgers' Senior Day.
Baker has clearly dedicated himself to become an outstanding college basketball player, but this was not the dream he envisioned as a child.

     Summary: I implore you all to dive in below and arm yourselves with knowledge before the Irish’s big game tonight — you absolutely will not regret doing so.
The next game Rutgers trailed at Northwestern by 24 points in the second half before Mulcahy led a furious comeback.
How do you think Rutgers plans to defend those two, and how effective do you think they’ll be?
I do think Rutgers will mix in some full-court pressure to try and speed the game up.
Irish fans will truly feel like they’ve learned what makes this Rutgers team tick prior to tip-off this evening.
