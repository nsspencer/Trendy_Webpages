     Jussie Smollett Released From Jail on Order of Appellate Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Illinois appellate court ruled Wednesday that the actor Jussie Smollett be released from jail on bond pending his appeal of his conviction for falsely reporting that he had been the victim of a hate crime.
Mr. Smollett was sentenced last week to five months in jail, but his lawyers quickly asked a panel of judges to stay the sentence while they appealed the conviction.
Mr. Smollett’s lawyers had argued in court papers that the sentence should be stayed because his term would likely be finished before his appeal was completed and that being incarcerated threatened his health and safety.
On Wednesday night, Mr. Smollett walked out of Cook County Jail with supporters at his side.
Nenye Uche, Mr. Smollett’s lead lawyer, said in a video posted to his client’s Instagram account, “They released him and that says a lot about what the appellate court thinks of this case.”

     Summary: Court orders Jussie Smollett released from jail during appealEnlarge this image toggle caption Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty ImagesJussie Smollett was ordered released from jail Wednesday by an appeals court that agreed with his lawyers that he should be released pending the appeal of his conviction for lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack.
The ruling came after a Cook County judge sentenced Smollett last week to immediately begin serving 150 days in jail for his conviction on five felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police.
The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, said Smollett could be released after posting a personal recognizance bond of $150,000, meaning he doesn't have to put down money but agrees to come to court as required.
Judge James Linn sentenced Smollett last week to 150 days in jail, but with good behavior he could have been released in as little as 75 days.
Appellate Court Justices Thomas Hoffman and Joy Cunningham signed the order, while Justice Maureen Connors dissented.

     Jussie Smollett freed from jail pending appeal, court orders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was ordered released from jail Wednesday after a court agreed to stay the sentence a judge handed down last week, according to court documents.
Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail and probation after he was convicted of falsely reporting to police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019.
A court granted a motion Wednesday that he be allowed to be freed on bond pending an appeal.
Linn last week sentenced Smollett to 30 months’ probation, including 150 days in jail.
They argued for the stay of the jail sentence by saying Smollett would be likely serve the 150 days of jail time as the appeals are pending.

     No Hoax: Jussie Smollett Freed After Less Than a Week in Jail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor, 39, walked out of Cook County jail minutes before 8 p.m. local time, hugged his lawyers and other supporters, and then climbed into a waiting SUV without answering reporters’ questions, according to a live feed from NBC Chicago.
Speaking outside the jail, Uche said his client was stunned by the decision.
“At this point, our biggest priority is getting our brother out of jail,” Jussie’s brother, Jocqui Smollett, told Rolling Stone on Tuesday.
His $10,000 fine hasn’t even been returned to him.”He called Jussie’s sentence “wrong” and racially motivated: “Some people might think that Mr. Smollett is guilty.
“The safety and security of all detained individuals, including Mr. Smollett, is the Sheriff’s Office’s highest priority,” the statement said.
