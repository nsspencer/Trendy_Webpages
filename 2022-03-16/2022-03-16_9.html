     Lille 1-2 Chelsea Highlights And Match Stats As Christian Pulisic Helps Seal 4-1 Aggregate Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by beating Lille 2-1 on Wednesday night.
The victory, sealed by goals from Christian Pulisic and captain Cesar Azpilicueta, completed a 4-1 win on aggregate for the reigning champions.
After winning the first leg 2-0 at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were heavily expected to progress.
But Lille's hopes of providing a shock were boosted when Jorginho was penalized for handball seven minutes before half-time.
But Chelsea's two-goal aggregate lead was restored just before half-time as Jorginho redeemed himself with an assist for Pulisic.

     Christian Pulisic scores another Champions League goal, helping Chelsea reach quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pulisic scored his second goal in his past three appearances for Chelsea as the defending UEFA Champions League winners advanced into the quarterfinals by a 4-1 aggregate scoreline.
Burak Yilmaz cut Lille’s deficit to 2-1 on aggregate with his 38th minute penalty-kick goal, but Pulisic re-extended Chelsea’s advantage before halftime.
The 23-year-old received a stellar pass from Jorginho in the box before unleashing a right-footed shot into the bottom-left corner from a tight angle.
Pulisic was substituted off in the 74th minute with Chelsea’s FA Cup quarterfinal tie at Middlesbrough coming up on Saturday.
Chelsea will learn its opponents for the UCL quarterfinals on Friday, with fellow English Premier League sides Manchester City and Liverpool also advancing to the final eight.

     Chelsea ownership uncertainty and EU sanctions overshadow Pulisic's big Champions League night vs. Lille OSC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea marched on in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday with a 2-1 win away at Lille OSC, confirming the titleholders' quarterfinal berth with a 4-1 aggregate success, but the result has taken a backseat as news over the Blues' immediate future remains shrouded in uncertainty.
Chelsea have been embroiled in controversy this week after requesting that their FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough be played behind closed doors to maintain "sporting integrity" with ticket sales prohibited due to Abramovich's sanctions which was rightly ridiculed.
The Premier League giants swiftly withdrew that request and despite speculation over the team's ability to reach Lille for their Champions League clash, whether it would go ahead at all and Three's continued attempts to have their name removed from the team's shirts, they have weathered those storms to reach the final eight.
UEFA said earlier on Wednesday that they are seeking European Union clarification regarding future Champions League fixtures due to Abramovich's sanctions.
Perhaps Jocelyn Gourvennec and his Renato Sanches-less squad were hoping that the external pressure would finally tell with Chelsea but there was no cracking and they will head to the Riverside Stadium to continue their FA Cup run before the post-internationals Premier League resumption.

     Summary: By ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterLONDON (AP) — The owners of the Chicago Cubs said Wednesday that they will make a bid to buy Premier League club Chelsea.
“I am certain that Sir Martin is the right man to lead Chelsea Football Club into its next chapter," Coe, a Chelsea fan like Broughton, said in a statement released Wednesday.
He has the vision, acumen and financial backing to ensure our club’s future success, keeping Chelsea Football Club at the top of European football and challenging for trophies."
The Ricketts family bought the Cubs for $845 million in 2009, and in 2016 the franchise won its first World Series title since 1908.

The likeable and erudite German continues to navigate a devilishly difficult path expertly in his role as part-coach, part ambassador.
Chelsea goal-scorers Cesar Azpilicueta and Christian Pulisic celebrate the Blues' win on Wednesday.
Because this mentality is installed over years and years, over the decades, that's why it is possible that we can stay focused.
Tuchel took the unusual step of adopting a 3-5-2 system to accommodate an additional central midfielder, presumably to shore up central areas and help stifle Lille.
