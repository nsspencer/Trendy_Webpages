     Fed raises interest rates for first time in 3 years, projects 6 more hikes as inflation soars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The widely anticipated move – that the Fed would raise rates by 25-basis points – brings to an end the ultra-easy monetary policy put in place two years ago to prop up the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
It marks a considerable shift from just six months ago, when half of the central bankers believed interest rate increases were not warranted until at least 2023.
Fed officials also expect inflation to remain elevated, ending 2022 at 4.3% – far above the Fed's annual target of 2.3%.
Although Fed officials carefully telegraphed to the public their rate-hike plans, the Russian invasion of Ukraine , which has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis, has upended those plans.
"All signs that are this is a strong economy, and one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."

     What the Fed’s move could mean for mortgage interest rates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As predicted, the Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates Wednesday for the first time in more than three years.
The housing market has been bracing for the impact of higher mortgage rates on affordability, and therefore sales.
But the relationship between Fed policy and mortgage rates isn’t as simple as it might seem.
“And so I think most market observers would, would expect that this has already been baked into today’s mortgage rates,” Keys said.
This is because when bond investors see higher inflation on the horizon, they want to be compensated for it in the form of higher interest rates.

     Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for the first time since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates for the first time since 2018, the central bank announced Wednesday at the conclusion of its highly anticipated two-day monetary policy meeting.
Thequarter-percentage-point increase had been well telegraphed by the central bank, with Powell hinting at it repeatedly over the past few months.
The central bank has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment at the maximum.
The central bank has six meetings left this year.
Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit the US economy and are already putting upward pressure on inflation, Powell said Wednesday.

     Summary: The Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time since 2018Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday for the first time since 2018, kick-starting its efforts to tackle the country's highest inflation in four decades.
On average, Fed policymakers said they expect interest rates, which have been near zero, to climb to around 1.9% by the end of this year.
"It's going to be quite some time before interest rates themselves become a headwind to the economy," McBride said.
Rising interest rates will quickly result in higher borrowing costs for credit cards and car loans.
"They're going to be very slow to raise interest rates and pass along those benefits to savers, if they even do so at all."

     How will higher interest rates affect American finances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit card interest rates and the costs of an auto loan will also likely move up.
The Fed’s initial quarter-point rate hike Wednesday in its benchmark short-term rate won’t have much immediate impact on most Americans’ finances.
“The impact of a single quarter-point interest rate hike is inconsequential on the household budget,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.
Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers.
They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers.

     Federal Reserve raises interest rates for first time since 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s partially because most mortgage rates come with fixed rates, meaning their interest payments are fixed for the entire life of the loan.
BorrowersConsumers with debt — especially on a high-interest rate credit card — will want to prioritize paying their obligations off fast.
Credit card rates are almost certainly going to rise with every Fed rate hike, and some might see their annual percentage rates (APRs) climb at faster rates than others.
If you’re hoping to avoid feeling the pinch of higher interest rates, make boosting your credit score a goal for your personal finances.
All of those factors illustrate the complicated economic backdrop within which Fed officials are having to set rates.
