     Lille 1-2 Chelsea (1-4 agg.): Blues into Champions League quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lille put up a good fight, but Chelsea's quality shone through as the Premier League club won 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 second-leg meeting on Wednesday.
Wednesday's victory combined with the first-leg result means Chelsea claims a 4-1 aggregate victory over the French champions.
After going down a goal thanks to Burak Yilmaz's 38th-minute penalty kick, Chelsea found the motivation needed to kick things into a higher gear.
Then, in the 71st minute, Chelsea made the hosts pay for their misses as César Azpilicueta scored to put the result out of reach.
Chelsea moves on to the quarterfinals as the English club looks to repeat as Champions League titleholder.

     Summary: By ROB HARRIS, AP Global Soccer WriterLONDON (AP) — The owners of the Chicago Cubs said Wednesday that they will make a bid to buy Premier League club Chelsea.
“I am certain that Sir Martin is the right man to lead Chelsea Football Club into its next chapter," Coe, a Chelsea fan like Broughton, said in a statement released Wednesday.
He has the vision, acumen and financial backing to ensure our club’s future success, keeping Chelsea Football Club at the top of European football and challenging for trophies."
The Ricketts family bought the Cubs for $845 million in 2009, and in 2016 the franchise won its first World Series title since 1908.

Because this mentality is installed over years and years, over the decades, that's why it is possible that we can stay focused.
Tuchel took the unusual step of adopting a 3-5-2 system to accommodate an additional central midfielder, presumably to shore up central areas and help stifle Lille.

     Chelsea ownership uncertainty and EU sanctions overshadow Pulisic's big Champions League night vs. Lille OSC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea marched on in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday with a 2-1 win away at Lille OSC, confirming the titleholders' quarterfinal berth with a 4-1 aggregate success, but the result has taken a backseat as news over the Blues' immediate future remains shrouded in uncertainty.
Chelsea have been embroiled in controversy this week after requesting that their FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough be played behind closed doors to maintain "sporting integrity" with ticket sales prohibited due to Abramovich's sanctions which was rightly ridiculed.
The Premier League giants swiftly withdrew that request and despite speculation over the team's ability to reach Lille for their Champions League clash, whether it would go ahead at all and Three's continued attempts to have their name removed from the team's shirts, they have weathered those storms to reach the final eight.
UEFA said earlier on Wednesday that they are seeking European Union clarification regarding future Champions League fixtures due to Abramovich's sanctions.
Perhaps Jocelyn Gourvennec and his Renato Sanches-less squad were hoping that the external pressure would finally tell with Chelsea but there was no cracking and they will head to the Riverside Stadium to continue their FA Cup run before the post-internationals Premier League resumption.

     Summary: Chelsea are set to play any remaining home Champions League fixtures behind closed doors after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU, The Athletic understands.
If they progress to the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to have fans present at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea are not allowed to sell tickets in order to generate revenue.
On Tuesday afternoon, Chelsea complained to the FA that playing without away fans in the FA Cup threatened “sporting integrity”, an appeal which was withdrawn hours later.
A UEFA statement said: “UEFA is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions.
