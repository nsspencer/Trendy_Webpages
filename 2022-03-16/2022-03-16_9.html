     Invoking America’s Darkest Days, Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.
Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.
“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations.
Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world.
Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

     Zelensky accuses Germany of putting economy before Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during his virtual address to the Bundestag on Thursday, accused Germany of putting its economic interests ahead of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, telling the lawmakers their support "came too late to stop war," according to the BBC.
Why it matters: Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian petroleum products and imports in general, was hesitant to raise harsh sanctions on Russia for fear it could hurt the economy.
Germany also reversed its restrictive European arms export policy in response to Russia's invasion by supplying Ukrainian forces with anti-tank and air-defense weapons.
Already, German economic sentiment indexes are dropping at record amounts, indicating that expectations for growth are collapsing, Axios' Matt Phillips reports.

     Summary: President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that another $800 million in military aid will be approved for Ukraine; this after President Volodymyr Zelensky made an appeal for assistance before a joint session of Congress.
Biden said the military support will include 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms, drones and other equipment.
Presenting a video that showed graphic footage on the ground in Ukraine, Zelensky said: “Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people.
To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, to save people, is this too much to ask?
Powerful, strong aviation to protect our people.”In his address, Zelensky directly asked Biden:“I wish you to be the leader of the world.

Russian troops detained Mayor Alexander Yakolev, his deputy Alexander Grischenko and the city council secretary Yuri Palyukha on Wednesday morning, the citizen said.
Yakolev was released, according to a video he posted on Telegram, but the fate of his deputy and the city council secretary is not known.
Russian troops have frequently tried to disperse protesters with gunfire, shooting over their heads.
On March 5, at least one protester was shot in the leg in the eastern town of Novopskov in such an instance.

In his speech, Zelensky implored lawmakers to do more.
"To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people, is this too much to ask?"
Lawmakers of both parties say they are wary of a no-fly zone at this time because they think it could pit the US directly against Russia in the skies over Ukraine.

When Ukrainians elected former comedian and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky as their president in 2019, we joined in welcoming him, even as we recognized his lack of government or leadership experience.
And we wondered how Zelensky, who played the president of Ukraine for laughs on TV, would redeem himself now that he was elected president for real.
And on that stage, his performance has been extraordinary and inspiring.
Zelensky is Ukraine.
