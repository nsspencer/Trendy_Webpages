     Summary: Close Klopp: 'Mo is ready to train'Tonight’s clash between Arsenal and Liverpool will have big ramifications at the top of the Premier League table.
For Arsenal, tonight’s fixture is an opportunity to show how far they have progressed under manager Mikel Arteta.
If Liverpool win all their remaining league fixtures – including a clash with City – they will lift the Premier League trophy in May.
Since 2014/15 Arsenal have only beaten their Merseyside opponents once in the top-flight - and that came immediately after Liverpool sealed the Premier League title and had noticeably dropped the pace post-pandemic shutdown in 2019/20.
Follow the action as the Gunners take on Liverpool in the Premier League:

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s also why the most encouraging performance from Arsenal so far this year was probably the 2–1 defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day.
Arsenal has lost five out of five in the league against teams who finished in the top four last season.
It went into the Premier League game at Anfield this season on a run of eight games unbeaten in the league and lost 4–0.
After Manchester City was held at Crystal Palace on Monday, a win for Liverpool would lift it to within a point of the top.

     Summary: Arsenal v Liverpool predictionsLiverpool will stumbleWith all due respect to Liverpool, they are going to stumble here.
Since the 1st of January and their loss to Manchester City, Arsenal have won five and drawn only one game.
Arsenal and Liverpool played once this season and Liverpool won 4-0, which sounds good for the Reds coming into this game.
In the next few weeks, apart from the Champions League matchup, they are going to play, the Reds have Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, and Newcastle away from home.
While Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham are obvious, they are also not going to glide through Everton, Villa, and Newcastle as well.
