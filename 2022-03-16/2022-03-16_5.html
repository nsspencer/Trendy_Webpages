     Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki: Japanese slugger gets five-year, $85 million deal with Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Cubs agree to deal with Japanese star Seiya Suzuki
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs and star Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki have agreed to an $85 million, five-year deal, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The person, confirming several reports, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.
The agreement signals the Cubs hope to speed up the rebuilding process after breaking up their 2016 championship core before last season’s trade deadline.
The 27-year-old Suzuki was a five-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner over nine seasons with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Nippon Professional Baseball.
Suzuki plays right field, a position five-time Gold Glove winner Jason Heyward has manned for the Cubs since signing a $184 million, eight-year contract before the 2016 World Series championship season.
