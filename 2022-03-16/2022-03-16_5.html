     Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki: Japanese slugger gets five-year, $85 million deal with Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Cubs To Sign Seiya Suzuki
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 9:20am: Suzuki’s contract is worth $85MM over five years, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, who also notes the inclusion of a full no-trade clause.
8:00am: The Cubs have agreed to sign outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to Sanspo and David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.

     Seiya Suzuki, Cubs agree on 5-year deal (source)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Multiple reports indicated that the Cubs' brass met with Suzuki's camp Monday evening.
Over the weekend, reports noted that Suzuki worked out for the Padres and met with Darvish.
Suzuki was not subject to international signing bonus limitations, because he’s at least 25 years old with six or more seasons of professional experience.
In the immediate picture, he joins a Cubs outfield that includes Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega.
Suzuki would seemingly be best suited for right field, where Heyward has been a staple for the Cubs dating back to the 2016 season.
