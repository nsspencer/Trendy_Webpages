     Fed Hikes Rates 25 Basis Points at March 2022 Meeting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In line with widespread expectations, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bp) at its meeting on March 15-16, 2022.
Key Takeaways The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to increase the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at its meeting on March 15-16, 2022.
The FOMC sees Russia's war on Ukraine as a key risk that may produce higher inflation and decreased economic activity.
Near-Unanimous VoteOf the nine voting members present at the meeting, eight voted in favor of the 25 bp rate increase, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Nominee Lael Brainard.
In addition to raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 bp, the FOMC voted unanimously to raise the interest paid on reserve balances to 40 bp and to increase the primary credit rate by 25 bp to 50 bp.

     Federal Reserve approves first interest rate hike in more than three years, sees six more ahead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its first interest rate increase in more than three years, an incremental salvo to address spiraling inflation without torpedoing economic growth.
Fed officials indicated the rate increases will come with slower economic growth this year.
Along with the rate hikes, the committee also penciled in increases at each of the six remaining meetings this year, pointing to a consensus funds rate of 1.9% by year's end.
"We are attentive to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations," Powell said at the news conference.
Officials also adjusted their economic outlook on multiple fronts, seeing much higher inflation than they expected in December and considerably slower GDP growth.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.
In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.
The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.
Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Esther L. George; Patrick Harker; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.
Voting against this action was James Bullard, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1/2 to 3/4 percent.

     Fed Raises Interest Rates for First Time Since 2018: Latest News

     Summary: Here are a few things we learned:–The Fed is moving to a more hawkish position, determined to bring down inflation however possible.
Mr. Powell warned that we may see high inflation readings through the middle of the year before they start to come down.
–The Fed is looking to take some of the air out of the labor market.
Mr. Powell sees the U.S. economy as not only very strong, but perhaps too strong.
The labor market is tight “to an unhealthy level,” he said.

     Federal Reserve Meeting: One Rate Hike Down, Six More Coming In 2022; Dow Jones Climbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Policymakers revealed their expectation for a total of seven quarter-point rate hikes this year and at least three more in 2023.
Dow Jones Reaction To Federal Reserve MeetingAfter release of the Fed meeting policy statement, the Dow Jones erased healthy gains but rallied as Powell spoke, running up 1.55%.
Ahead of the Fed meeting decision, CME Group showed 75% odds of at least seven quarter-point rate hikes by December 2022.
The impact of that $1.9 trillion in balance-sheet reduction might be like 3.5 rate hikes, Deutsche Bank says.
Eventually, the Fed signaled retreat in early 2019, as rate hikes turned to rate cuts and QT gave way to more bond purchases.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "At the Federal Reserve we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability.
Today in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by one quarter of a percentage point," said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, wrapping up the two-day meeting.
But the Fed is starting interest rate hikes with a more conservative approach amid uncertainty over Russia's war in Ukraine.
Impact for consumersAs the Federal Reserve raises the federal interest rate, borrowing costs are going to go up for consumers.
"Look to grab a 0% or other low rate balance transfer offer that can insulate you from the rate hikes we expect to see."
