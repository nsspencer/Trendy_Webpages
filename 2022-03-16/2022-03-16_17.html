     Report: Raiders releasing Carl Nassib
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesIt looks like the start of the new league year will mark the end of defensive end Carl Nassib‘s time with the Raiders.
Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Raiders are releasing Nassib on Wednesday.
Nassib’s contract called for him to make a salary of $7.75 million this season and carry a cap number of more than $9.6 million.
Schefter reports that he’ll be designated as a post-June 1 cut, which means the team will create $8 million in cap space via the move.
Nassib, who became the first active NFL player to publicly come out as gay last June, had 21 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble in 13 games last season.

     Raiders Release DE Carl Nassib
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Raiders are releasing defensive end Carl Nassib (Twitter link via Adam Schefter of ESPN.com).
Nassib made national news last summer when he announced that he was gay, making the 28-year-old the first active NFL player to do so.
“The NFL family is proud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today,” commissioner Roger Goodell said afterwards.
We wish Carl the best of luck this coming season.”Later that year, following the leak of Jon Gruden‘s emails, Nassib took personal time away from the team.
The Raiders will designate Nassib as a post-June 1 cut, enabling them to save $8MM against the 2022 cap (Twitter link via Schefter).

     Raiders release DE Carl Nassib after 2 seasons in Las Vegas: Source
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Raiders have released defensive end Carl Nassib, a source confirmed to The Athletic.
It will be a post-June 1 cut, meaning Nassib will hit the market now but the Raiders won't get the cap relief until June 2.
He came to Vegas from the Bucs, where he had his best two seasons, going for 63 tackles and 12.5 sacks.
He started his career with the Browns, where he spent two seasons, picking up 52 tackles and 5.5 sacks.
In June 2021, during Pride Month, Nassib released a statement on his Instagram account stating that he is gay, becoming the first active NFL player to come out publicly.

     Report: Raiders cutting DE Carl Nassib
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders are cutting ties with defensive lineman Carl Nassib in a salary cap move after two mostly unproductive seasons.
ESPN reported Wednesday that the Raiders will cut Nassib in a move that will save them $8 million in room on this year's salary cap as of June.
The Raiders signed Nassib to a three-year, $25 million contract in 2020 but he never took on a big role on defense, playing less than half the snaps on defense each season.
In 27 games over two seasons with the Raiders, Nassib had four sacks and 13 quarterback hits.
Nassib was due a $7.75 million salary this season, which was too expensive for the Raiders given his production.

     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- The Las Vegas Raiders are releasing defensive end Carl Nassib, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Las Vegas is also releasing linebacker Cory Littleton with the post-June 1 designation, which will give the Raiders another $11.75 million in cap savings then.
Nassib, 28, initially signed a three-year, $25.25 million free-agent deal with $16.75 million guaranteed with the Raiders in March 2020.
He started five of 27 games for Las Vegas and had four combined sacks and an interception.
He was expected to man the middle of Las Vegas' defense, despite having never been a fulltime NFL starter in four previous seasons with the Bears.

Nassib spent two seasons in Vegas, generating four sacks, 49 tackles and an interception as a rotational edge rusher.
The Raiders will designate Nassib as a post-June 1 cut, saving the team $8 million on the salary cap in 2022 by spreading the hit over two years.
Nassib was the first move of multiple moves on the front-seven by the Raiders on Wednesday.
A former third-round pick by the Browns in 2016, Nassib spent two seasons in Cleveland and two years in Tampa Bay before landing in Vegas.
