     Stephen Curry injury update: Warriors star to undergo MRI after Celtics' Marcus Smart lands on his foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors lost Stephen Curry for the remainder of their game vs. the Boston Celtics on Wednesday with what the team described as a left foot soreness.
Curry left late in the second quarter and was ruled out shortly after halftime.
The injury occurred as Curry and Marcus Smart were pursuing a loose ball.
Smart dove and landed on Curry's left foot.
He went to the floor immediately, and in fact, Curry stepped under him after Smart was already into his dive.

     Injury Update: Steph Curry Will Not Return vs. Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sustaining a left foot injury during the first half of Wednesday's contest vs. the Boston Celtics, the Golden State Warriors announce that Steph Curry will not return to the game.
The severity of the injury is yet to be determined, but Steve Kerr and the Warriors were not happy about the play Steph's injury occurred on.
The Warriors certainly hope this is nothing serious for Steph Curry, as the NBA playoffs are just weeks away.
For now, the Warriors will have to find a way to turn their game around and pick up a win against a red hot Boston Celtics team.

     Steph Curry gets MRI on injured foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Steph Curry got an MRI on the top of his left foot following the Warriors loss to Boston on Wednesday night.
The Warriors will know the MRI results and injury severity in the coming days, head coach Steve Kerr said.
Curry injured his left foot with 4:18 left in the second quarter when Boston’s Marcus Smart rolled over Curry’s left leg while the two scrapped for a loose ball.
“I’m not sure the severity of what happened to Steph, but he’s a trooper,” Juan Toscano-Anderson said.
Shortly after Curry’s injury, Smart was called for a flagrant foul after kicking Klay Thompson’s neck in mid-air.

     Stephen Curry injures foot vs. Boston Celtics; Golden State Warriors' Steve Kerr believes play was 'dangerous'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Asked about his level of concern surrounding Curry's foot, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, "We'll know after the MRI."
Warriors forward Draymond Green said he wasn't willing to say Smart committed a "dirty play."
So I can't call it a dirty play.
Between that game on Monday and Wednesday's game, Curry, Green and Klay Thompson have played a total of just 11 minutes together this season.
And the Warriors have yet to play a game with all five of their regular starters -- Curry, Green, Thompson, Kevon Looney and Andrew Wiggins.
