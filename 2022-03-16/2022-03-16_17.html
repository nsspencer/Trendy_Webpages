     Cubs sign Seiya Suzuki: Japanese slugger gets five-year, $85 million deal with Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Full Scouting Report For Outfielder Seiya Suzuki
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs have agreed to sign outfielder Seiya Suzuki to a five-year, $85 million contract, the largest deal ever for a Japanese position player.
Suzuki, 27, was a five-time all-star and five-time Gold Glove winner in Nippon Professional Baseball and helped lead Japan to the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics last summer.
Scouting Report: While many Japanese hitters keep their hands inside and take short, direct swing paths to the ball, Suzuki takes powerful uppercuts more conducive to the modern MLB game.
Suzuki rarely faced mid-90s fastballs in Japan and opinions are split how effectively he’ll adjust to that velocity in MLB.
The Future: Suzuki has all the traits to be a power-hitting, everyday right fielder in the major leagues.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs landed the biggest player in the international market on Wednesday, reportedly signing Hiroshima Carp outfielder Seiya Suzuki to a five-year contract worth $85 million.
Suzuki hit a career-high 38 home runs last season, and he's hit 25-plus in every year since 2017.
Suzuki met with the Cubs' front office and Tom Ricketts before signing, and he must have liked something he heard.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Without discussing Suzuki specifically, Cubs manager David Ross acknowledged the impact that kind of addition could make for the club.
Over the weekend, reports noted that Suzuki worked out for the Padres and met with Darvish.
The fee consists of 20% of the first $25 million, 17.5% of the next $25 million and 15% of any remaining salary.
In the immediate picture, he joins a Cubs outfield that includes Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, Clint Frazier and Rafael Ortega.
Behind that group are Michael Hermosillo, Harold Ramírez and Greg Deichmann, who came into camp to compete for part-time roles.

     Summary: MESA, Ariz. — Less than 48 hours after the Cubs’ brass met with Seiya Suzuki’s camp, the Japanese outfielder had made his decision: He was going to Chicago.
Suzuki reportedly agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract with the Cubs, pending a physical.
Before the lockout, the Cubs signed right-hander Marcus Stroman to a three-year, $71 million deal.
The Cubs’ commitment to Suzuki also begins to answer questions about the direction of the club after its trade-deadline sell-off last summer broke up the 2016 championship core.
In the present, the Cubs have to figure out their defensive plan with Suzuki in the outfield mix.
