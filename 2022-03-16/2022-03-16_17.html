     The New Season of 'The Bachelorette' Will Be Historic — Here's Everything We Know
    </h2>

     Summary: Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for the Season 26 finale of The Bachelor.
We are finally done with Clayton’s season of The Bachelor, and thank goodness.
What a whiplash of emotion, all for a relatively unlikable season lead (according to many Bachelor Nation fans).
Regardless, the one thing we can’t fault Clayton for is ending up with three incredible women at the end of his season.
And not one, but two of them, will be the new Bachelorette!

     What Does ‘The Bachelorette’ Summer Move Mean for ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ Season 8?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bachelorette Season 19 will mark a first for the franchise.
But what does this mean for Bachelor in Paradise Season 8, which typically serves as the franchise’s summer content?
The lack of a renewal plus the Bachelorette Season 19 premiere date implies the show may not be coming back in 2022.
Katie’s season surprisingly ended early, and then BIP Season 7 started in mid-August, ending two weeks before Michelle’s season began in October.
We only need The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise.”“ABC should just cancel #TheBachelor &amp; only do Bachelorette &amp; BIP bc I cannot think of a season of The Bachelor that wasn’t a flop,” said another.
