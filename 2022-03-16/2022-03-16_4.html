     4 dead after 7.4-magnitude earthquake hits coast off Japan's Fukushima prefecture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tokyo (CNN) A 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Japan late Wednesday night, killing at least four people and injuring over 100 others, and cutting power to millions of homes.
One of the people who died was a man in his 60s who lived in the city of Soma, the local disaster prevention office said on Thursday.
The quake hit off the coast of Japan's eastern Fukushima prefecture, a region devastated by a powerful quake and tsunami 11 years ago that resulted in a nuclear power plant meltdown.
The quake was originally designated 7.3-magnitude, but was upgraded to 7.4 on Thursday.
A tsunami advisory was issued after Wednesday's quake for the coastal prefectures of Fukushima and Miyagi, but was lifted on Thursday morning and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later said "no abnormalities" had been detected at any of the country's nuclear plants.

     Japan hit by 7.3-magnitude earthquake

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 jolted Japan's northeast coast on March 16, shaking buildings as far away as Tokyo.
Earthquake Detailed Report – 3/16At around 11:36pm, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 occurred offshore Fukushima Prefecture at a depth of 60km.
#earthquake pic.twitter.com/nnD83Kuzkd — NERV (@EN_NERV) March 16, 2022That’s still enough to inundate some vulnerable pockets of the shoreline, but Japanese infrastructure is designed around mitigating earthquake and tsunami risk.
The March 11, 2011, earthquake in Japan registered more than a 9 on the moment magnitude scale — meaning it released about 355 times as much energy as Thursday’s quake.
That’s because the moment magnitude scale isn’t linear.
