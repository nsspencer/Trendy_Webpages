     Anne Hathaway Is Dressing For Spring In Joyful Christopher John Rogers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nothing says spring is here like vibrant colours and prints, especially when mixed together.
And Hollywood actor Anne Hathaway has the right idea with her latest look.
For an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the 39-year-old Oscar-winner wore a head-turning full look by New York designer Christopher John Rogers – look 18 from his 2022 Resort collection, to be precise.
The outfit comprised a zip-up corset, high-waisted tailored trousers, and a matching oversized single-breasted jacket, all in the same multi-coloured gradient dot print.
Why not make like Hathaway and evoke a sense of optimism with an uplifting all-over print?
