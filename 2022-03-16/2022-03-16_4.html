    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MOUNT PLEASANT, MI — St. Patrick’s Day is Thursday, March 17, and Mount Pleasant’s Green Spot Pub is getting ready to celebrate with a full day of Irish food, beer and fellowship.
It’s an Irish pub so what better place to celebrate?” said owner Jim Holton, who purchased the pub last year.
“We are cooking over 30 corned beefs just for this one day,” Holton said.
Mount Pleasant resident Amy Christensen was at the Green Spot Pub a week before the holiday.
She’s a longtime costumer who likened the pub to a “home away from home” for locals and “the place to be for St. Patrick’s Day.”“It’s like way more low-key than all the college spots, and the vibe here, especially on St. Patrick’s Day, is just on a whole other level.

     Summary: Last year, 50 face-masked soldiers conducted an abbreviated parade once again to maintain the traditions of the St. Patrick's Day Parade.
This year's parade celebrations will include that salute following a special mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
The 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry, supposedly earned the nickname "Fighting 69th" from the Confederate General Robert E. Lee.
Because of the regiment's roots in Irish-American history St. Patrick's Day is also the 1st Battalion, 69th's "Unit Day," during which the battalion's soldiers are recognized for their accomplishments.
A host of traditions surround the 69th and the St. Patrick's Day Parade.
