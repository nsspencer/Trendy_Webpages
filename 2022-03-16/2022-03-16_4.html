    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs and star Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki have agreed to an $85 million, five-year deal, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The person, confirming several reports, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.
The agreement signals the Cubs hope to speed up the rebuilding process after breaking up their 2016 championship core before last season’s trade deadline.
The 27-year-old Suzuki was a five-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner over nine seasons with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Nippon Professional Baseball.
Suzuki plays right field, a position five-time Gold Glove winner Jason Heyward has manned for the Cubs since signing a $184 million, eight-year contract before the 2016 World Series championship season.

     Summary: The Chicago Cubs have agreed to terms with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki, according to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000.
He has impressive raw power and feel for the strike zone, and he has a big arm that should make him an asset in right field.
He's likely to take over in right field on a full time basis, usurping Jason Heyward.
Suzuki will attempt to end a recent trend of Japanese hitters disappointing upon their arrival to the majors.
Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels, is the last Japanese position player to play up to forecasts in MLB.

     Cubs, Japanese OF Seiya Suzuki agree to 5-year deal: Roundtable reaction from The Athletic’s MLB writers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs are in agreement with Japanese outfielder Seiya Suzuki on a five-year, $85 million deal, pending a physical, sources told The Athletic on Wednesday.
Suzuki will reportedly get a full no-trade clause in the deal.Suzuki immediately helps raise the profile of the retooling Cubs, who went 71-91 last season.
The team traded away most of its core at last year’s trade deadline but added Marcus Stroman prior to the lockout.
With the Pirates and Reds on a downswing, Suzuki certainly bolsters the Cubs’ chances against the Brewers and Cardinals in the NL Central.Arguably the best all-around player in Nippon Professional Baseball, Suzuki broke in with the Hiroshima Carp as a 19-year-old in 2013.
He had a .315/.414/.570 line with 182 homers in nine seasons with the Carp.Hiroshima posted Suzuki’s rights to major-league teams on Nov. 22, after what was perhaps the best season of his career — Suzuki, 27, hit 38 home runs with a 1.069 OPS in 2021.

     Chicago Cubs Sign Seiya Suzuki As Cornerstone Of Overhauled Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is a strong move for a team that went 21-38 after trading Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant and Javier Baez last July.
Including Suzuki and Stroman (three years, $71 million), the Cubs are carrying only five players earning $10 million-plus on their payroll, which currently projects at about $130 million.
With the National League teams adding a designated hitter, it would be no problem carrying both Suzuki and Heyward.
Suzuki was posted by the Carp after he hit .317/.433/.639 with 38 home runs in 533 plate appearances last season.
The Cubs hope he will have more impact than Kosuke Fukudome, who they gave a four-year, $48-million deal before the 2008 season.
