     4 dead after 7.4-magnitude earthquake hits coast off Japan's Fukushima prefecture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tokyo (CNN) A 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Japan late Wednesday night, killing at least four people and injuring over 100 others, and cutting power to millions of homes.
One of the people who died was a man in his 60s who lived in the city of Soma, the local disaster prevention office said on Thursday.
The quake hit off the coast of Japan's eastern Fukushima prefecture, a region devastated by a powerful quake and tsunami 11 years ago that resulted in a nuclear power plant meltdown.
The quake was originally designated 7.3-magnitude, but was upgraded to 7.4 on Thursday.
A tsunami advisory was issued after Wednesday's quake for the coastal prefectures of Fukushima and Miyagi, but was lifted on Thursday morning and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later said "no abnormalities" had been detected at any of the country's nuclear plants.

     Summary: TOKYO — A massive 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck off Fukushima on Wednesday, leaving four dead and more than 90 injured, and triggering a 1-meter tsunami advisory 11 years after the region was devastated by a deadly quake.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake struck about 36 miles below the sea.
The Japan Meteorological Agency, however, kept a low-risk advisory in place.
The northern Japan region was devastated by a deadly 9.0 quake and tsunami 11 years ago that caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
The power company and the fire department investigated the alarm and determined there was no fire, NHK Fukushima reported.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima in north-east Japan on Wednesday evening, leaving four dead, and plunging more than 2m homes in the Tokyo area into darkness.
The Japan Meteorological Agency later lifted its low risk tsunami advisory issued along the coasts of Fukushima and Miyagi early Thursday.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake hit at 11.36pm at a depth of 60km (36 miles) below the sea.
The quake shook large parts of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, where buildings swayed violently.
A Tohoku Shinkansen express train partially derailed between Fukushima and Miyagi due to the quake, but nobody was injured, Kishida said.
