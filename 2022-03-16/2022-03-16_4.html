     Kyle Schwarber signs four-year deal with Philadelphia Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opponents already had to account for one slugging lefty in the middle of the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup in Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP.
Kyle Schwarber and the Phillies agreed to a four-year deal worth $79 million on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.
NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported the news and The Athletic said the contract has an average annual value of just under $20 million per year.
“I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team,” Harper said Wednesday.
After the Cubs non-tendered him during the 2020-21 offseason, Schwarber signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals.

     Summary: Dave Dombrowski, former President of Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Chaim Bloom approves of Kyle Schwarber signing with PhilliesThe Philadelphia Phillies are signing Kyle Schwarber to a four-year deal, beating out several competing teams for the veteran slugger.
And in a somewhat ironic twist, the deal has the stamp of approval of the man who traded for Schwarber last summer and replaced Phillies President of Baseball Operations, Dave Dombrowski, after the 2019 season.
As reported by Alex Speier of the Boston Globe, Bloom said the Red Sox were also in the Schwarber race down to the wire:““We’re trying to stay focused on chasing down things that make sense for us.
However veteran DH JD Martinez had not opted in to his final year with the Sox, this conversation might be very different.
However, most teams do not employ one DH nowadays, so fans can expect to see Schwarber patrolling the field on occasion.

     Summary: (0:52)Kyle Schwarber has found a new home with the Philadelphia Phillies.
The slugger has agreed to sign with Philadelphia, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan on Wednesday.
Schwarber will join a Phillies lineup that features reigning National League MVP Bryce Harper and also includes veterans J.T.
Harper said earlier this week that it would be a "downer" if the Phillies didn't sign Kris Bryant, Nick Castellanos or Schwarber.
"I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team," Harper said.

     Summary: (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Kyle from Waltham is leaving the Red SoxFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder, Kyle Schwarber, has penned a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
This is disheartening because there aren’t many Red Sox fans that didn’t want him back.
He was, arguably, the only free agent that the majority of Sox fans could agree on signing.
He only played 41 games this past season and Red Sox fans treated him like a seasoned veteran with the team.
All in all, speaking on behalf of Red Sox fans, thank you, Kyle Schwarber for an amazing 41 games that will never be forgotten.

     Summary: Sure enough, shortly after arriving in the clubhouse Wednesday morning, Harper learned from the media that the Phillies reached an agreement on a four-year contract with free-agent slugger Kyle Schwarber.
Phillies officials were unable to comment on the 29-year-old left fielder because the agreement is pending a physical.
» READ MORE: Matt Vierling comes into Phillies camp eyeing an everyday jobTwo days ago, Harper stumped publicly for the Phillies to sign Schwarber or fellow free agents Kris Bryant or Nick Castellanos.
But he also had success in the leadoff spot last year for the Washington Nationals.
“It was something like I’ve never seen before in baseball,” said new Phillies reliever Brad Hand, Schwarber’s teammate in Washington.

     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies and free agent Kyle Schwarber have agreed to terms of a 4 year, $79 million deal, per reports.
Schwarber, 29, was the 4th overall pick of the 2014 draft by the Chicago Cubs out of the University of Indiana.
Schwarber signed a one year, $7 million deal with the Washington Nationals and had his best season in the majors.
The Rangers reportedly had some interest in Schwarber, but at this price, I can see why the team would pass.
Kiley McDaniel had Schwarber ranked #21 on his free agent board, projecting he would get 3 years, $45 million.

Although hitting has always been his strong suit, Schwarber has shown improvement in the field over the course of his career.
