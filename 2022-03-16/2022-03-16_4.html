     Summary: Former Cub Schwarber agrees to deal with Phillies originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoThe Phillies have agreed to a deal with former Cubs outfielder Kyle Schwarber, NBC Sports Philadelphia's Jim Salisbury reported Wednesday.
Bryce Harper endorsed a potential Schwarber signing this week when discussing the Phillies potentially signing one of the ex-Cubs hitters on the free agent market.
“I think they’ve proven that.
The Cubs were among the teams to show interest in Schwarber in recent days, NBC Sports Chicago's David Kaplan reported.
They've agreed to a deal with another outfielder — Japanese free agent Seiya Suzuki.

     Summary: Dave Dombrowski, former President of Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Chaim Bloom approves of Kyle Schwarber signing with PhilliesThe Philadelphia Phillies are signing Kyle Schwarber to a four-year deal, beating out several competing teams for the veteran slugger.
And in a somewhat ironic twist, the deal has the stamp of approval of the man who traded for Schwarber last summer and replaced Phillies President of Baseball Operations, Dave Dombrowski, after the 2019 season.
As reported by Alex Speier of the Boston Globe, Bloom said the Red Sox were also in the Schwarber race down to the wire:““We’re trying to stay focused on chasing down things that make sense for us.
However veteran DH JD Martinez had not opted in to his final year with the Sox, this conversation might be very different.
However, most teams do not employ one DH nowadays, so fans can expect to see Schwarber patrolling the field on occasion.

     Kyle Schwarber signs four-year deal with Philadelphia Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opponents already had to account for one slugging lefty in the middle of the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup in Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP.
Kyle Schwarber and the Phillies agreed to a four-year deal worth $79 million on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.
NBC Sports Philadelphia first reported the news and The Athletic said the contract has an average annual value of just under $20 million per year.
“I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team,” Harper said Wednesday.
After the Cubs non-tendered him during the 2020-21 offseason, Schwarber signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals.

     Summary: (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Kyle from Waltham is leaving the Red SoxFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder, Kyle Schwarber, has penned a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
This is disheartening because there aren’t many Red Sox fans that didn’t want him back.
He was, arguably, the only free agent that the majority of Sox fans could agree on signing.
He only played 41 games this past season and Red Sox fans treated him like a seasoned veteran with the team.
All in all, speaking on behalf of Red Sox fans, thank you, Kyle Schwarber for an amazing 41 games that will never be forgotten.

Harper said earlier this week that it would be a "downer" if the Phillies didn't sign Kris Bryant, Nick Castellanos or Schwarber.
"I know the fans want us to be a winning team and this organization wants us to be a winning team," Harper said.

Phillies officials were unable to comment on the 29-year-old left fielder because the agreement is pending a physical.

     Report: Phillies reach deal with coveted free agent Kyle Schwarber
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Phillies have reportedly reached a deal with Kyle Schwarber, according to multiple reports, removing another coveted player from free agency as the league's frenetic post-lockout rush continues.
Jayson Stark of The Athletic reports the contract is for four years and worth just under $20 million per season.
Several teams were believed to be in the running for Schwarber, including the Toronto Blue Jays, though as Sportsnet's Shi Davidi reported earlier today, pessimism had grown that the team and him would reach a deal.
Schwarber, who won a World Series with the Chicago Cubs in 2016, just turned 29 and is fresh off a career-best season split between the Washington Nationals and Boston Red Sox.
Despite the injury, Boston acquired Schwarber in a deadline deal.
