     Summary: Forgive Indiana's basketball team if the players and staff are a little tired.
The Hoosiers wound up taking off a little after 4 a.m. and didn't land in Portland until around 9 a.m.
The one waiting at the airport was too small to accommodate their traveling party.
It sounds like some luggage still had to be left behind and is going to be shipped to the team in Portland.
Per IndyStar correspondent Matt Cohen, that baggage was the band equipment and cheer equipment, It got shipped to Portland.

     For Indiana basketball, it's finally all about the present now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Indiana basketball has spent a lot of time trapped in amber since Bob Knight was fired in 2000.
It was the 3rd-best NCAA Tournament scoring debut for an Indiana player in program history.
Given Wyoming’s offensive struggles, Indiana should have spent most of this game winning by 10-20 points.
But when Johnson gets going, Indiana can create enough offense to not completely waste its defensive effort.
And if that happens, these Hoosiers will keep the fanbase happily locked in to the present day.
