     Ukraine Mounts Counteroffensive to Drive Russians Back From Kyiv, Key Cities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine—Ukraine said its military had launched a counteroffensive in its capital, Kyiv, and other key cities, as President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the U.S. Congress to provide more weapons and increase economic pressure on Russia.
The thump of distant shelling echoed through the center of Kyiv overnight, while Ukrainian forces appeared to counterattack in the outlying towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have been severely damaged in weeks of street fighting and artillery exchanges.
The city and the surrounding region were under an all-day curfew Wednesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy announced Tuesday night that a fourth Russian general has been killed in Moscow's war in his country.
Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko later identified the slain officer as Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev, the 46-year-old commander of Russia's 150th motorized rifle division.
Gerashchenko said Mityaev died Tuesday as Russian forces stormed Mariupol, The Associated Press reports.

     Summary: In an exclusive interview with @LesterHoltNBC, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy discusses President Biden's concern about triggering World War III.
“The Russian military attacked #Mariupol's Drama Theater, where a large number of citizens were hiding!,” the Ukrainian parliament tweeted.
“These are direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military,” he said.
In lieu of a no-fly zone, Zelenskyy asked the U.S. for more defense systems and continued pressure, including through sanctions, on Russia.
Russia’s Defense Ministry reported fighting near the separatist-held eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk Wednesday but did not comment on Russian military activity elsewhere.
