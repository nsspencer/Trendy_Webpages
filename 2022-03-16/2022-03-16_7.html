     Matt Chapman traded to Blue Jays for 4 prospects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith should be an immediate contributor for the A’s, potentially sliding right in at third base.
Few prospects in the Blue Jays' organization have seen their prospect status rise and fall as much as Smith, who broke out in 2018 but came back down to earth in ’19 before making great use of the lost ’20 season and rebounding.
Smith made his MLB debut in ’21, and while the results weren’t there over parts of 18 games, he posted a .931 OPS with 21 home runs over 94 games in Triple-A and brings above-average defense at third with the ability to play shortstop.

     Oakland A's trade 3B Matt Chapman to Toronto Blue Jays for prospects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Matt Chapman cranked 27 home runs in 2021; check out some of them.
(1:52)The Oakland Athletics have traded away another former All-Star, sending third baseman Matt Chapman to the Toronto Blue Jays for four prospects, the A's announced Wednesday.
The rebuilding A's will receive four minor league prospects -- right-handed pitcher Gunnar Hoglund, IF Kevin Smith and left-handed pitchers Zach Logue and Kirby Snead.
Chapman, 28, is a three-time Gold Glove winner (2018, 2019 and 2021) and was an All-Star in 2019.
Last season, he batted just .210, with 27 home runs and 72 RBIs, while striking out more than 200 times.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB Trade Rumors: Matt Chapman is headed to the Toronto Blue Jays from the Oakland A’s, per multiple reports.
Chapman, 28, was the A’s first round pick in 2014 out of Cal State-Fullerton, and has manned the hot corner for them since the middle of 2017.
Chapman is considered the gold standard as far as third base defense goes, and won his third gold glove in 2021.
Hogland, 21, is a righthanded pitcher who was the Jays’ first round pick (#19 overall) in the 2021 draft out of Ole Miss.
Smith, 25, was the Jays’ fourth round pick in 2017.

     Blue Jays, A's Discussing Matt Chapman Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Statcast’s Outs Above Average metric largely agrees, ranking him tenth among all big league players, regardless of position, since 2017.
Indeed, Chapman has twice been recognized as the league’s best all-around defender by being named the league’s Platinum Glove winner.
Snead, 27, gives the A’s an MLB-ready bullpen piece who made his big league debut late in the ’21 season.
Snead allowed three runs (two earned) on seven hits and a pair of walks with seven strikeouts through his first 7 2/3 big league innings last year.
The Chapman trade marks the latest step in the dismantling of a roster that was largely foreseeable but is nevertheless disheartening for the fanbase.
