     Lille 1-2 Chelsea (1-4 agg.): Blues into Champions League quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lille put up a good fight, but Chelsea's quality shone through as the Premier League club won 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 second-leg meeting on Wednesday.
Wednesday's victory combined with the first-leg result means Chelsea claims a 4-1 aggregate victory over the French champions.
After going down a goal thanks to Burak Yilmaz's 38th-minute penalty kick, Chelsea found the motivation needed to kick things into a higher gear.
Then, in the 71st minute, Chelsea made the hosts pay for their misses as César Azpilicueta scored to put the result out of reach.
Chelsea moves on to the quarterfinals as the English club looks to repeat as Champions League titleholder.

     Chelsea urged to remove Three logo from shirts ‘as soon as possible’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have been urged to remove the logo of sponsor Three from their match-day shirts “as soon as possible” by the British telecommunications company.
But Chelsea have had to keep the company’s logo on the front of their match-day shirts in order to meet the terms of the special licence the club received from the government to keep operating.
Three have now urged Chelsea to find a way of removing their logo from the club’s shirts “as soon as possible”.
A Three spokesperson said: “We understand from discussions with Chelsea FC that there are ongoing issues with removing the Three logo from the shirts, as a result of kit supply issues and licence restrictions.
However, license restrictions have prevented Three’s logo from being removed from all of the club’s physical assets, such as perimeter boards.

     Summary: The owners of the Chicago Cubs, the Ricketts family, are set to launch a bid for Chelsea after joining forces with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin.
Interested bidders have until Friday to submit takeover proposals to the Raine Group, the US bank handling the process, and the race to buy the club from Roman Abramovich is hotting up.
The Ricketts family have a longstanding interest in Chelsea, having tried to buy the club in 2018, and are confident they will succeed this time.
In 2019 Tom Ricketts, the face of the bid for Chelsea, distanced himself from the comments and said his father was not involved with the Cubs.
Another issue for the family could be that Tom Ricketts, Cubs executives and Raine formed a special purpose acquisition company in 2020.

Chelsea goal-scorers Cesar Azpilicueta and Christian Pulisic celebrate the Blues' win on Wednesday.
Because this mentality is installed over years and years, over the decades, that's why it is possible that we can stay focused.
Tuchel took the unusual step of adopting a 3-5-2 system to accommodate an additional central midfielder, presumably to shore up central areas and help stifle Lille.

If they progress to the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to have fans present at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea are not allowed to sell tickets in order to generate revenue.
On Tuesday afternoon, Chelsea complained to the FA that playing without away fans in the FA Cup threatened “sporting integrity”, an appeal which was withdrawn hours later.
A UEFA statement said: “UEFA is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions.

Chelsea had not played well and in truth the notion of them retaining their European crown might seem fanciful on the basis of this performance.
All the same this was a reminder that Chelsea have not lost the art of grinding on a difficult European night.
The free-kick led to a scramble and Lille screamed for a penalty when Jorginho handled as he challenged Xeka.
Timothy Weah was dozing and Azpilicueta charged in, kneeing the ball past Jardim to give Chelsea a fleeting sense of control over their destiny.
