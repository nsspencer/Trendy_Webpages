     Summary: Al Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo, centre, jumps for the ball against Al Ettifaq's players during the Saudi Pro League match between Al Nassr and Al Ettifaq at Mrsool Park Stadium, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Sunday, Jan. 22, 2023.
(AP Photo)RIYADH – Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score in his Saudi Pro League debut for Al Nassr, but his presence electrified fans at King Saud University Stadium as the team beat Ettifaq 1-0 to retake first place on Sunday.
Al Nassr, which has played 14 games, moved a point ahead of defending champion Al Hilal, which has played a game more.
On Thursday, Ronaldo played for a combined XI from Al Nassr and Al Hilal in an exhibition game against a Paris Saint-Germain team featuring old foe Lionel Messi.
Al Nassr president Musalli Almuammar would not confirm the figures in Ronaldo’s two-and-a-half-year contract but said the 37-year-old deserves to be the highest paid player on the planet.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Nassr-Ettifaq: match reportCristiano Ronaldo was handed a debut for Al Nassr against Ettifaq on Sunday as the veteran striker made his first Saudi Pro League appearance.
His debut for Al Nassr was delayed as 37-year-old Ronaldo served a two-match ban imposed by the English Football Association for an incident that saw him slap a phone from the hand of a young Everton supporter in a game at Goodison Park last season.
Ronaldo was handed the captain's armband, having already featured for a Riyadh All-Stars team – scoring twice – against Lionel Messi's Paris Saint-Germain this week.
The striker from Madeira enjoyed a winning start as his Al Nassr side overcame a gritty Ettifaq in a game which started brightly but lost its spark as the contest unfolded.
Cristiano showed flashes but was well marshalled by the 'Commandos' from Dammam.

     Summary: Brazilian forward Talisca put Al Nassr ahead in the 31st minute, when he rose to meet Abdulmajeed Al-Sulaiheem's cross and plant a header past Al Ettifaq goalkeeper Paulo Victor.
Victor was kept on his toes, as Al-Sulaiheem and Talisca forced him into saves with well-struck efforts from long range, but Al Nassr were unable to find another goal.
Al Ettifaq are in 10th place.
Our goal was to return to the top and we succeeded in that, and I congratulate the players on achieving our goal," Talisca added.
Al Nassr next face Al Ittihad in a Saudi Super Cup semi-final on Thursday.

Ronaldo's debut for his new club Al Nassr didn't get the big moment he will have been hoping for, but the time will come for goals.
