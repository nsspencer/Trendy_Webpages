     George Kittle Just Made an INCREDIBLE One-Handed Catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a defensive battle like this, it takes one play to change the trajectory of things.
This incredible scramble drill catch by George Kittle could be that play.
That‚Äôs a scramble drill play, and Kittle was barely ready for it!
Despite clearly being caught off guard, Kittle made a fantastic catch, and the 49ers are humming along with the ball in the red zone at the end of the third quarter.
If San Francisco wins, I‚Äôm willing to bet this is one of those plays we look back on as a game-changer.

     Summary: The 49ers‚Äô offense was struggling to move the ball against a good Dallas defense.
Then they ran a play action bootleg that gave QB Brock Purdy time to find TE George Kittle alone in the middle of the field.
The throw was a little off target, but Kittle helped out his QB with maybe the 49ers‚Äô catch of the year.

     Summary: If that wasn't there, the ball was supposed to go to wideout Deebo Samuel farther down the left side.
Kittle waved his right hand at Purdy, who spotted him and threw it just in front of his tight end.
After the game, Purdy joked that it seemed Kittle was bobbling the ball for about 10 seconds.
The play went for 30 yards and led to the Niners' first touchdown of the game eight plays later.
Before this season, there had never been a rookie quarterback to throw for 200-plus yards and have no interceptions in a playoff game.

     Summary: And Kittle‚Äôs made-for-TV catch was not only dramatic, it was also the biggest play in a 19-12 victory over Dallas.
The win put the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game for the third time in four seasons.
After gaining 141 yards and three field goals in the first half, the 49ers started the second half inauspiciously: a special teams fumble and a three-and-out.
‚ÄúIt definitely got the boys going.‚ÄùKittle, who had just one catch in the Dallas game a year ago, was just getting started.
In this win over the Cowboys, the 49ers didn‚Äôt have Joe Cool sending Dwight Clark into the sky for a game-winning catch.
