Eddie Nketiah pictured celebrating one of his two goals during Arsenal's 3-2 win over Manchester United IMAGO/PA Images/John WaltonArsenal fell behind for only the fourth time in the Premier League this season when Marcus Rashford scored a superb long-range goal for United.
Arsenal completed the turnaround and took the lead eight minutes into the second half courtesy of a fine strike from Bukayo Saka.
But Arsenal could only hold onto their lead for five minutes before Lisandro Martinez equalized with his first Premier League goal.
But both Zinchenko and Nketiah had been onside, so the goal stood and Arsenal fans could celebrate all over again.

     Arsenal 3-2 Manchester United analysed: Are Arteta’s men really going to win this title?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eddie Nketiah’s stoppage-time winner kept Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League as they beat Manchester United 3-2 in a thriller at the Emirates on Sunday.
Rather, Arsenal continued to be on the front foot, and it was their closing down of a Manchester United goal kick that ultimately brought their equaliser.
The England right-back was on a booking, had struggled all game and would probably have become an ever-bigger target for Manchester United in the second half.
Defensively, Arsenal looked more secure against United’s counters with the Japan international sitting deeper to protect the space Rashford likes to burst into.
He is ending it making defensive clearances for Manchester United against arguably the best team in Europe.
