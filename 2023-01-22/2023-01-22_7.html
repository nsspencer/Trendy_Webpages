     49ers take fourth quarter lead on Christian McCaffrey’s touchdown run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe 49ers finally have found their running game.
That includes Christian McCaffrey‘s 2-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter.
Dallas opted to punt after reaching the San Francisco 40, while facing a fourth-and-five.
They took the delay of game and Ray-Ray McCloud made a fair catch at the San Francisco 9.
Dallas had three defensive penalties in the drive — an offsides on DeMarcus Lawrence, a holding penalty on Donovan Wilson and a holding penalty on Johnathan Hankins.

     Christian McCaffery makes 49ers history not seen in 25 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey has been a big addition to the 49ers offense this season.
This is the longest streak by a 49ers player since wide receiver Terrell Owens in 1998.
McCaffrey’s touchdown served as the only touchdown for either side in this game, as San Francisco kicker Robbie Gould provided the rest of the scoring.
In return, San Francisco sent Carolina four draft picks, including a 2023 second-round pick.
“Kyle’s (Shanahan) going to coach everyone hard, and when he makes comments to Christian, Christian listens,” Lynch told the media recently, “and Christian’s become a better football player since being here, and that’s kind of cool to watch.

     Summary: (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)Twitter loses its mind after George Kittle catch vs. CowboysTwitter loses its mind after George Kittle catch vs. Cowboys by Peter PanacyGeorge Kittle had a little fun after Christian McCaffrey scored SF 49ers’ first TDThe story of the San Francisco 49ers’ first half against the Dallas Cowboys was missed opportunities.
Naturally George Kittle, who’d had big moment after big moment on the drive, had a little more fun, grabbing McCaffrey’s colossal spike and handing the ball to 49ers great Jerry Rice.
He started off with an amazing one-handed catch for 30 yards that got the 49ers to midfield.
George Kittle is a treasure.
— Chris Holski (@ChrisHolski) January 23, 2023Not just a treasure, but …George Kittle is a national treasure.
