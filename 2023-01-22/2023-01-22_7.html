     'The Last of Us' Episode 2: Teaser Trailer Breakdown: What To Expect Next From Ellie, Joel, And Tess?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the FEDRA guard attacked Ellie, Joel got a flashback from when his daughter, Sarah, was killed by the military when the Cordyceps Brain Infection had just started to spread.
Joel killed the guard, and Ellie froze as she didn’t expect Joel to act in that manner.
Ellie, Joel, and Tess walked into the unknown even though they knew about the perils that existed in the post-apocalyptic world.
Joel, Ellie, and Tess would also be on the hit list of FEDRA, as the military would come to know about their escape sooner rather than later.
In the trailer for the second episode of “The Last of Us,” we see Melanie Lynskey, who plays the character of Kathleen in the series.

     HBO’s ‘The Last of Us’ Episode 2 Review - The Deadworld of Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second episode of HBO’s The Last of Us opens like the pilot.
The second episode is written by Craig Mazin and directed by Druckman who seems to be the perfect pair.
They have managed to do the impossible and make a perfect video game adaptation that is carried over and improved in the second episode.
Well, this second episode introduces a change to the fungus that expands on the impact of the physical cordyceps but also makes the physical part of the fungus just as much of a threat as the infected hosts.
Tess fits in more with the plot of the second episode, in comparison to the pilot, where it felt like the character didn’t quite slot into the plot of the show.
