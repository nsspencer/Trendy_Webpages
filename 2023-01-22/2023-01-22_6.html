     Haaland fires another hat-trick to earn Man City comfortable win over Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a matter of time until City got that crucial second goal, with Haaland converting from the spot following a foul on Ilkay Gundogan five minutes after the break.
Haaland broke former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of being the fastest player to four Premier League hat-tricks.
His remarkable 25-goal league haul from 19 matches would have been enough to win the Premier League golden boot in each of the previous four seasons.
Dixie Dean's record of 60 goals scored in a single league season, set in 1928, remains in sight.
"We made mistakes, but the first half worried me more than the second half," coach Julen Lopetegui said.

     Haaland scores hattrick as Man City thrash Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Erling Haaland scored his fourth hattrick of the season as Manchester City thrashed a helpless Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday evening.
The Norwegian striker now has 25 goals in 19 Premier League appearances, already surpassing the tally of the highest goal scorer from last season.
Wolves keeper Jose Sa had earlier made two good saves to keep out the hosts but as soon as Haaland scored, Wolves looked rattled and hardly recovered.
Ruben Neves brought down Ilkay Gundogan 4 minutes after the restart and Haaland stepped up to send Sa the wrong way to make it 2-0 for City.
City held on to their clean sheet despite some late Wolves pressure who looked rusty with manager Julen Lopetegui cutting a frustrating figure on the sidelines.

     Summary: Erling Haaland’s fourth Premier League treble swept him to 25 competition goals, 31 in all, and may signal Manchester City are again the slick winning machine Pep Guardiola wants them to be.
The victory took the champions to two points behind Arsenal before Manchester United’s arrival for Sunday afternoon’s late match.
Then, Guardiola had branded City a “happy flowers team” so he was asked if they remained so.
Erling Haaland rises to win a header for Manchester City against Wolves.

     Summary: Erling Haaland's fourth hat-trick in 19 Premier League appearances hauled Manchester City to within two points of leaders Arsenal with a 3-0 win over Wolves on Sunday.
Wolves then gifted Haaland his hat-trick just four minutes later as goalkeeper Jose Sa presented the ball to Riyad Mahrez, who unselfishly squared for his teammate to roll into an unguarded net.
Guardiola quickly took the chance to give his star striker a rest as Haaland was replaced on the hour mark by Julian Alvarez to Wolves' relief.
Just a second league defeat since Lopetegui took charge leaves Wolves still outside the relegation zone only on goal difference.
Leeds edged one point clear of the bottom three, but remain without a league win since November after a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.

Champions react to blood in the water (Man City 3-0 Wolves): Pep Guardiola’s incredible midweek rant appeared to have the desired impact as Man City looked hungry from the start and ready to deliver.
Wolves sat back and made it pretty easy for City but this was like watching City from the past few seasons.
Man City are sharks who are circling and can smell blood in the water.
Such is life in the incredibly congested bottom-third of the Premier League table these days that the Forest’s equalizer leaves the Cherrie sin the bottom three.
