    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a defensive battle like this, it takes one play to change the trajectory of things.
This incredible scramble drill catch by George Kittle could be that play.
That‚Äôs a scramble drill play, and Kittle was barely ready for it!
Despite clearly being caught off guard, Kittle made a fantastic catch, and the 49ers are humming along with the ball in the red zone at the end of the third quarter.
If San Francisco wins, I‚Äôm willing to bet this is one of those plays we look back on as a game-changer.

McCaffrey, 26, scored the only touchdown of the night for San Francisco, rushing into the end zone on the first play of the fourth quarter.
Purdy, 23, threw for 214 yards on 19-for-29 completed passes, enough to earn the victory.
The defensive clash between Cowboys and 49ers didn't have too many highlights for the visitors.
In fact, quite the contrary, with Tony Pollard going down due to injury and Brett Maher missing another extra point.

     Summary: The 49ers‚Äô offense was struggling to move the ball against a good Dallas defense.
Then they ran a play action bootleg that gave QB Brock Purdy time to find TE George Kittle alone in the middle of the field.
The throw was a little off target, but Kittle helped out his QB with maybe the 49ers‚Äô catch of the year.
