     Cowboys' Brett Maher settles down after blocked extra point vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher had a forgetful performance in Monday's wild-card win, and Sunday's divisional round game started in a similar way.
Maher had his extra-point attempt blocked by San Francisco 49ers linebacker Samson Ebukam during the second quarter of the NFC divisional round game.
But in the third quarter, Maher converted a 25-yard field goal to tie the game at 9 apiece.
According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, who cited NFL Research, there have been a total of eight blocked extra point attempts this season and playoffs.
The Cowboys kicker made 50 of 53 extra-point attempts and connected on 29 of 32 field goals in the regular season.

     Summary: Brett Maher lines up for his first extra point and it gets blocked.
(0:16)SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The Dallas Cowboys' decision to stick with Brett Maher as their kicker remained a storyline in their final game of the season.
In last weekend's NFC wild-card win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Maher missed four PAT attempts, the most in one game since 1932.
Maher missed eight extra points this season, including the playoffs.
Eventually, San Francisco kicker Robbie Gould played peacemaker, and Maher was able to continue with his pregame work.

     Brett Maher kicking struggles: Jerry Jones says Cowboys 'exonerated' from sticking with veteran after meltdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys' coaching staff has been "exonerated" from sticking with Brett Maher after his historically dreadful kicking performance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- at least according to owner Jerry Jones.
On each of the Cowboys' first four touchdowns last week versus the Buccaneers in the wild-card round, Maher missed the extra point.
He pushed the first two kicks wide to the right, then pulled the third one wide to the left.
Even with Maher's historic struggles, the Cowboys sent him out for a 25-yard field goal after failing on third-and-goal in the third quarter.
Maher bounce-back effort served as a bittersweet moment after a nightmare of a game last week.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The kicking woes continue for the Dallas Cowboys.
Dallas advanced to the Divisional Round with a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but it was not a perfect performance.
Kicker Brett Maher missed four extra points in the win, and that called into question how the Cowboys would handle the kicking position against the San Francisco 49ers.
It was time for Maher’s first attempt of the game.
This time, Maher’s kick attempt was blocked by the 49ers’ kick block unit, but looking at the kick as it came off his foot, it seems like Maher’s kicking woes might continue.

     Summary: Brett Maher's first kick on Sunday was blocked, and it might not have been good even if it wasn't.
Maher's first extra point attempt against the San Francisco 49ers, which had as much attention as any first-half extra point in recent memory, was blocked.
The Cowboys didn't replace Maher as their primary kicker, and publicly supported him all week.
With all eyes watching, Maher's kick never got to the uprights.
Late in the second quarter the Cowboys had a decision: Go for it on fourth-and-four or try a 53-yard field goal.
