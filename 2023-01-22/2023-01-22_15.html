     Splash Mountain closing at Disney World: Ride marks its final day of operation on Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Splash Mountain, the popular log flume ride, is closing at Walt Disney World.
Sunday marked its final day of operation to riders.
The ride will close at the Orlando theme park starting Monday, Jan. 23, as work is underway for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure.
Splash Mountain is undergoing a transformation and will reopen as the new whimsical attraction inspired by “The Princess and the Frog” movie.

     Imagineers testing Tiana's Bayou Adventure at Splash Mountain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We believe this ride-through was to listen to new attraction audio as a group.
As we know, the upcoming Tiana’s Bayou Adventure ride will have the same ride path layout as the current Splash Mountain.
So we assumed the Imagineers were listening to the upcoming attraction audio in real time.
That doesn’t necessarily mean the ride audio is final and the music is ready to go though.
But we can confirm this group of Disney Executives and Imagineers were continually pointing at specific ride scenes, animatronics, and props.

     Splash Mountain Closes Today. Here’s Why it Should Have Happened Sooner. - Inside the Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thousands of Guests flocked to Walt Disney World Resort on Sunday to ride Splash Mountain for the last time.
Disneyland Resort’s Splash Mountain will also close to make way for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, a Princess and the Frog (2009) retheme, though a date hasn’t been announced.
The animated animals in Song of the South who make up Splash Mountain’s storyline – Br’er Fox, Br’er Rabbit, Br’er Bear – speak with painfully stereotypical dialect.
The song is questionable enough that Tokyo Disney Resort, the only Disney Park not retheming Splash Mountain, removed it from its music loop.
Despite petitions and social media movements, Splash Mountain is changing.

     Splash Mountain Wraps Up Final Weekend Before Transformation Into Tiana's Bayou Adventure

     Summary: It's the end of the line for Splash Mountain, as the ride is offiically closing down at the end of the weekend on Jan. 23.
Back in 2020, it was reported that Disneyland and Disney World would be abandoning the Splash Mountain ride.
"The retheming of Splash Mountain is of particular importance today," a statement from the House of Mouse read at the time.

     ‘Save Splash Mountain’ Trended As The Longtime Disney World Ride Prepares To Close To Long Lines And Nostalgia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While some fans have been vocal for months about the ride’s end, as the ride prepares to say goodbye at Disney World on January 23, fans have actually helped “Save Splash Mountain” to trend.
As of the time of this article being written on Sunday, Splash Mountain was at a whopping 200-minute wait time.
In fact, Splash Mountain doesn't crack the Top 10 of longest Disney World wait times.
Though we have some questions about the Splash Mountain redo, given the nature of the drop ride, it will seemingly have all of the major ride facets its previous iteration will have, but that hasn’t stopped this “Save Splash Mountain” trend.
It might also give the ride the opportunity to fix issues like Disney World log flumes frequently sinking, who knows?

     Disney Patrons Flock to Splash Mountain, Last Ride Before Shutdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The days of 'Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah' at Disney parks in the U.S. are about to be long gone -- which is why folks are forming massive lines this weekend for a final go-around.
Tons of Disneyland &amp; Disney World patrons posted photos/videos Saturday and Sunday that show them waiting for their chance to hop on a log and cruise through Splash Mountain one final time before it officially closes down for a re-imagining starting Monday.
That version is expected to reopen sometime in 2024 ... so SM will go dark until at least then.
The riders don't seem to care though -- frankly, this is the last opportunity anyone is going to have to enjoy Splash Mountain as it originally was ... and it seems Disney fiends want their fill.
Splash Mountain has been around since the late '80s, and it's become a staple for many in any Disney park visit.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MerlinTheGoat 2 minutes agoI've seen it multiple times and think it's a very good movie.
A good movie doesn't necessarily make a good ride, and a bad movie doesn't necessarily guarantee a bad ride.
A huge problem is that I do not trust the current crop of imagineers to do a Tiana ride justice.
At bare minimum, it HAS to be at least as good as Splash Mountain.
Tokyo was/is still getting some cool additions in recent years, but even those are made with modern design philosophies that would be an ill fit for a Splash replacement.

     Summary: ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — After 30 years, it's time to say so long to Splash Mountain at Disney World.
Disneyland's Splash Mountain will also be transformed into Tiana's Bayou Adventure, but a closing date for that attraction has not yet been announced.
Splash Mountain opened at Magic Kingdom in October 1992.
