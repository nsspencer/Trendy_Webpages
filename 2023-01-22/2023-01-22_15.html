     ‘Saturday Night Live’ targets George Santos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Saturday Night Live” targeted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) in its opening sketch this weekend, roasting the embattled lawmaker over his embellished résumé and recent controversies.
The skit featured Santos, played by Bowen Yang, as an NFL sideline reporter covering Saturday’s Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants playoff game for Fox.
The hosts joked that Santos was the first player in NFL history to lead the league in passing and rushing yards at the same time.
“I am proud to be the first African American quarterback to ever dunk a football,” the fake Santos said.
Sue me for having a life,” Santos said to reporters at an airport when asked about the claim on Saturday.

     Aubrey Plaza's SNL Gifts Us Biden, Knope, and an (Even More) Unhinged M3GAN
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Weekend Update segment alone would’ve rendered the episode the best of the season even if the rest of the show had stuck to pat Joe Biden impressions.
On Update, Plaza reprised one of her most beloved roles: Here to comment on local government, Parks and Recreation's April Ludgate!
“Just ask my old boss, Leslie Knope.” As the 8H nation held its breath, Amy Poehler rolled up, complete with Knope’s signature crisp blazer and can-do attitude.
Like, could he comment on why Seth Meyers used to do Weekend Update alone and make it look so easy?
Did it seem like her longtime crush Joe Biden was looking directly at her during his earlier address?

     Summary: More:Aubrey Plaza is hosting 'Saturday Night Live.'
Looking stylish in a black, sparkly spaghetti strap dress, her new blond hair sleekly styled, Plaza quickly established both her "SNL'' and Delaware bonafides.
"I was actually voted the most famous person from Delaware,'' Plaza said.
That "vote'' was a 2018 Delaware Online poll, in which the actress, writer and producer beat out Delaware's most famous politician.
That cast also includes Adam Driver, Forest Whitaker, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Shia LaBeouf and Dustin Hoffman.

     Saturday Night Live Recap: Aubrey Plaza Is the Moment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many years, in viewers’ eyes, Aubrey Plaza was her Parks and Recreation character, April Ludgate.
Plaza has worked so steadily and accrued so much goodwill that her hosting SNL for the first time in 2023 feels bizarrely belated.
Unfortunately for him, that story did not involve having once worked as a page at Saturday Night Live, so Aubrey Plaza wins.
Now, Bowen Yang has joined their ranks since there was no way SNL could have possibly let the goofiest political story in recent months slip by unremarked upon.
Stray Observations• Turns out Aubrey Plaza was indeed voted the most famous person from Delaware back in 2018.

     Aubrey Plaza and Amy Poehler reprise Parks and Recreation roles on SNL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aubrey Plaza and Amy Poehler reprise Parks and Recreation roles on Saturday Night LiveDevoted Pawnee public servant Leslie Knope (Poehler) crashed apathetic coworker April Ludgate's (Plaza) Weekend Update segment centered on the ins and outs of local government, but couldn't help but be distracted by the Joe Biden cameo in the monologue and the glitz and glamor of the Studio 8H stage.
"Work for the water department, you can drain the reservoir and find all the bodies and murder clues."
In her return to Weekend Update, Poehler picked Colin Jost's brain about his job and referenced her own co-anchoring days.
Along with Biden, Poehler made a cameo in Plaza's monologue when the latter looked back on her days as part of NBC's Page Program, a year-long fellowship at the network.
Read EW's recap of the episode, and watch Plaza's reunion with Poehler and her monologue above.
