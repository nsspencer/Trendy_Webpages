     Cowboys take 6-3 lead after Dalton Schultz touchdown, blocked PAT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Cowboys have taken a 6-3 lead on the 49ers, again missing an extra point.
Brett Maher, who missed four extra points last week and one in Week 18, had his first try Sunday blocked bySamson Ebukam.
It appeared, though, that the low kick was going to be wide left anyway.
The Cowboys scored on a 4-yard pass from Dak Prescott to Dalton Schultz with 9:25 left in the second quarter.
The Cowboys converted a fourth-and-one from the San Francisco 19 on a 4-yard run by CeeDee Lamb.

     Dalton Schultz gave pathetic effort on Cowboys’ final drive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dalton Schultz gave pathetic effort on Cowboys’ final driveDalton Schultz had a good season for the Dallas Cowboys, but his pathetic effort on the team’s final possession of the season will be hard to forget.
Greg Olsen was all over the ruling to wind the clock on a Dalton Schultz catch.
Nobody was near Schultz, who made zero effort ensure he got both feet in bounds.
He cost his team a play with the six seconds lost, and he cost them a 15-yard catch with his poor effort.
It’s amazing a player could have gone into the final possession of the season already having given up, but that’s how it felt things were for Schultz.

     Cowboys' Dak Prescott connects with Dalton Schultz for TD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the Dallas Cowboys' second drive, Dak Prescott was intercepted by Deommodore Lenoir at the Dallas 21-yard line, which led to a San Francisco 49ers field goal and 3-0 lead.
Remember, Prescott tied for the NFL regular-season lead in interceptions with 15, despite starting just 12 games.
But Prescott came off that poor pass to Michael Gallup and completed his next seven, including a 4-yard touchdown toss to tight end Dalton Schultz to give Dallas the lead.
But the Brett Maher curse remained, with the kicker missing his fifth extra point of the postseason when it was blocked, so the Cowboys lead was just 6-3.
He had two against the Buccaneers, and Schultz is now tied for the franchise lead for most touchdown catches in a postseason.

     Dalton Schultz fantasy outlook: Start or sit Cowboys TE in Divisional round?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys will look to knock off the San Francisco 49ers as they meet in the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs on Sunday, January 22.
As the Cowboys eliminated the Buccaneers in last week’s Wild Card round, tight end Dalton Schultz played like Dallas’ premier receiving target in the winning effort.
Fantasy Football analysis: Cowboys TE Dalton Schultz ($4,200)Dallas dominated Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round to the tune of a 31-14 win, and what was most transparent was that the passing game revolved around three targets: CeeDee Lamb, Michael Gallup, and Dalton Schultz.
The Cowboys tight end actually led the team with seven catches on eight targets, for 95 receiving yards and two touchdowns.
As Dallas’ passing game relies on Schultz playing an impactful role, he is a starter with some encouraging upside heading into Sunday night’s game.
