     Cowboys' Brett Maher Converts 25-Yard Field Goal to Tie 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An NFL kicker has made a field goal.
Normally that wouldn't be something to write home about, but Brett Maher has become an exception to the norm in the past week.
His first PAT of the game was blocked, and a replay showed that the kick was headed wide left regardless.
Then in the third quarter, Dallas called upon Maher to attempt a 25-yarder to tie the game at 9-9.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher had a forgetful performance in Monday's wild-card win, and Sunday's divisional round game started in a similar way.
Maher had his extra-point attempt blocked by San Francisco 49ers linebacker Samson Ebukam during the second quarter of the NFC divisional round game.
But in the third quarter, Maher converted a 25-yard field goal to tie the game at 9 apiece.
According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, who cited NFL Research, there have been a total of eight blocked extra point attempts this season and playoffs.
The Cowboys kicker made 50 of 53 extra-point attempts and connected on 29 of 32 field goals in the regular season.

     Summary: Brett Maher lines up for his first extra point and it gets blocked.
(0:16)SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The Dallas Cowboys' decision to stick with Brett Maher as their kicker remained a storyline in their final game of the season.
In last weekend's NFC wild-card win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Maher missed four PAT attempts, the most in one game since 1932.
Maher missed eight extra points this season, including the playoffs.
Eventually, San Francisco kicker Robbie Gould played peacemaker, and Maher was able to continue with his pregame work.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The kicking woes continue for the Dallas Cowboys.
Dallas advanced to the Divisional Round with a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but it was not a perfect performance.
Kicker Brett Maher missed four extra points in the win, and that called into question how the Cowboys would handle the kicking position against the San Francisco 49ers.
It was time for Maher‚Äôs first attempt of the game.
This time, Maher‚Äôs kick attempt was blocked by the 49ers‚Äô kick block unit, but looking at the kick as it came off his foot, it seems like Maher‚Äôs kicking woes might continue.

     Summary: Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher had himself an awful game last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,On each of the Cowboys' first four touchdowns, Maher missed the extra point.
He pushed the first two kicks wide to the right, then pulled the third one wide to the left.
Maher had gone 50 of 53 on extra points during the regular season, as well as 29 of 32 on field goals.
Things apparently went so badly (he missed two more kicks) that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones walked onto the field during warmups to give Maher a pep talk.
After Dalton Schultz hauled in the game's first touchdown in the second quarter, Maher had his first extra point attempt of the afternoon blocked.

     Summary: Brett Maher's first kick on Sunday was blocked, and it might not have been good even if it wasn't.
Maher's first extra point attempt against the San Francisco 49ers, which had as much attention as any first-half extra point in recent memory, was blocked.
The Cowboys didn't replace Maher as their primary kicker, and publicly supported him all week.
With all eyes watching, Maher's kick never got to the uprights.
Late in the second quarter the Cowboys had a decision: Go for it on fourth-and-four or try a 53-yard field goal.
