     Cowboys' Brett Maher misses another PAT after 49ers' defense blocks kick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys rolled with Brett Maher in Sunday's NFC Divisional Playoff against the 49ers, despite the kicker missing an NFL-record four PAT attempts in his team's wild-card win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Monday night.
And when Maher had a chance to redeem himself in the second quarter Sunday at Levi's Stadium, it didn't go as planned.
The Cowboys kicker now has missed six of his last seven PAT attempts.
San Francisco's kicker, Robbie Gould, has yet to miss a kick in his playoff career after making three field goals in the game's first half.
As the 49ers' offense looks to put things together against the Cowboys' high-powered defense, they might need more of that perfection moving forward with just a 9-6 lead at the half.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maher made 14-of-18 attempts in pregame warmups, according to Todd Archer of ESPN, with the kicker’s misses coming from 53 (right), 58 (left), 39 (right) and 54 yards (short).
A brouhaha broke out between the teams as Maher was going through his pregame work.
In some obvious gamesmanship, trying to get into Maher’s head, some 49ers players wouldn’t move out of the way as Maher was attempting to kick.
Owner Jerry Jones gave Maher an unusual — if not unprecedented — pep talk on the field.
Maher went 50-of-53 on extra points in the regular season, with two of those blocks.

     Cowboys' Brett Maher settles down after blocked extra point vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher had a forgetful performance in Monday's wild-card win, and Sunday's divisional round game started in a similar way.
Maher had his extra-point attempt blocked by San Francisco 49ers linebacker Samson Ebukam during the second quarter of the NFC divisional round game.
But in the third quarter, Maher converted a 25-yard field goal to tie the game at 9 apiece.
According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, who cited NFL Research, there have been a total of eight blocked extra point attempts this season and playoffs.
The Cowboys kicker made 50 of 53 extra-point attempts and connected on 29 of 32 field goals in the regular season.

     Summary: The kicking woes continue for the Dallas Cowboys.
Dallas advanced to the Divisional Round with a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but it was not a perfect performance.
Kicker Brett Maher missed four extra points in the win, and that called into question how the Cowboys would handle the kicking position against the San Francisco 49ers.
It was time for Maher’s first attempt of the game.
This time, Maher’s kick attempt was blocked by the 49ers’ kick block unit, but looking at the kick as it came off his foot, it seems like Maher’s kicking woes might continue.

He pushed the first two kicks wide to the right, then pulled the third one wide to the left.
Maher had gone 50 of 53 on extra points during the regular season, as well as 29 of 32 on field goals.
Things apparently went so badly (he missed two more kicks) that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones walked onto the field during warmups to give Maher a pep talk.

     Summary: 49ers disrupt Cowboys kicker Brett Maher's pregame warmups as he tries to recover from brutal wild-card gameDallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher needs to get back on track Sunday in order for the Cowboys to pull off the upset over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC's divisional round.
Maher is coming off a brutal wild-card game in which he missed an NFL-record four extra points.
The Cowboys won the game despite Maher's struggles, and then immediately signed another kicker to their practice squad ahead of Sunday's road game against the 49ers.
During Maher's pregame warmups, some members of the 49ers attempted to disrupt his kicking drills.
If pregame warmups are any indication, the 49ers are going to do whatever they can to throw Maher off his game as he tries to recover from last week's disastrous performance.

     Summary: Brett Maher's first kick on Sunday was blocked, and it might not have been good even if it wasn't.
Maher's first extra point attempt against the San Francisco 49ers, which had as much attention as any first-half extra point in recent memory, was blocked.
The Cowboys didn't replace Maher as their primary kicker, and publicly supported him all week.
With all eyes watching, Maher's kick never got to the uprights.
Late in the second quarter the Cowboys had a decision: Go for it on fourth-and-four or try a 53-yard field goal.
