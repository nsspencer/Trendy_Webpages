     Summary: Jeff Zients, the White House's Covid-19 response czar, speaks during a press briefing at the White House where they spoke about a pause in issuing the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen Covid-19 vaccine on April 13, 2021, in Washington, DC.
Jeff Zients will serve as President Joe Biden's next chief of staff, according to media reports on Sunday.
After the midterm elections in November and an action-packed two years in the White House, Klain has told colleagues that he is ready for something different, a Washington Post report said.
Klain previously acted as Biden's chief of staff during former President Barack Obama's first term, and he's worked with Biden since he ran for president back in 1987.
A White House representative did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.

     Biden to name Jeff Zients as next chief of staff, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will name former COVID policy coordinator Jeff Zients as his next chief of staff, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday, refreshing a key role as Biden readies a likely re-election bid and faces a probe of his handling of classified documents.
Ron Klain, Biden's current chief of staff, plans to leave his post in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
The White House had no immediate comment.
Zients also served as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama's administration, in which Biden served as vice president.
The chief of staff position, considered one of the most important at the White House, is the senior political appointee responsible for driving the president's policy agenda and ensuring appropriate staff members are hired.

     Who is Jeff Zients?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —President Joe Biden is expected to tap Jeff Zients, ​​who ran the administration’s Covid-19 response effort and served in high-ranking roles in the Obama administration, to succeed Ron Klain as the next White House chief of staff.
In replacing Klain with Zients, Biden is turning to a consultant with more business experience than political background as he enters the third year of his presidency.
The decision to pick Zients surprised some internally given that there were differences in Biden’s and Zients’ management styles early on in the administration.
Zients also served as the director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy under Obama.
Zients divested his shares in Facebook and Call Your Mother before gaining coronavirus czar status in the White House.

     Summary: In recent months, Klain had tasked Zients with overseeing a project to prepare for the expected staff transition that typically occurs following the midterms.
The move underscored Zients’ status as an administration insider and broadened his familiarity with the staff he’ll soon lead.
The president, a person familiar with the decision said, views Zients as a “master implementer.”But what Zients has in organization acumen he lacks in extensive political experience.
Those are the practices that have made Zients rich,” the organization’s founder and director, Jeff Hauser, said in the statement.
“Whomever the next chief of staff is, that will be the continued hope and expectation.
