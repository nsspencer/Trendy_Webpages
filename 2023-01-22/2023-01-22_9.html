     Jeff Zients to be named Biden's next chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will name Jeff Zients to serve as his next chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain, who is expected to leave in the coming weeks, an administration official and a person familiar with the decision told NBC News.
Zients, who previously led the Biden administration’s Covid-19 response, left the administration briefly last April but returned in the fall right before the midterm elections.
Zients’ selection comes as Biden has come under fire over his handling of classified documents that were found at his Delaware residence and a Washington office he used.
Zients has been a longtime figure in the president's inner circle, even before he took office.
He served as an adviser to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign and led transition efforts as co-chair before his work as Covid-19 response coordinator.

     Jeff Zients to replace Ron Klain as White House chief of staff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Jeff Zients, who ran President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response effort and served in high-ranking roles in the Obama administration, is expected to replace Ron Klain as the next White House chief of staff, according to three people briefed on the matter.
Biden decided on Zients after an internal search when it became clear that Klain favored Zients as his successor, a factor that played a big role in the president’s decision.
Klain had tapped Zients to lead a talent search for expected staff turnover following the midterm elections, but that didn’t ultimately materialize after Democrats performed better than expected.
Deep experienceIn replacing Klain with Zients, Biden is turning to a consultant with more business experience than political background as he enters the third year of his presidency.
The decision to pick Zients surprised some internally given that there were differences in Biden’s and Zients’ management styles early on in the administration.

     Summary: Photo: Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesFormer Biden administration COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zients will replace Ron Klain as White House chief of staff, according to multiple reports out Sunday.
Zients departed the White House in April after steering the administration’s COVID response, then came back in the fall to work with Klain on staff issues.
Klain, 61, is seen as a critical force behind the Biden administration’s legislative victories and several other major initiatives, including its pandemic response.
He eventually joined the Biden campaign, served as co-chair of his transition team, and then took over the U.S. COVID response and ran the country’s vaccine rollout.
This post has been updated to include the news that Zients will replace Klain.
