     Summary: Instead, it will be Rybakina taking on 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, a 7-5, 6-3 winner against Gauff, with a semifinal berth at stake.
In men's results, 22-year-old American Sebastian Korda — whose father, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open — reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal by edging No.
Until Sunday, both Swiatek and Gauff looked fairly dominant for a week, winning every set they contested.
But her game is worthy of much more attention, as she displayed in knocking out Swiatek, one match after defeating 2022 Australian Open runner-up Danielle Collins.
In the second set, Swiatek appeared to have gotten herself back on track, going up 3-0.

Yeah, just to step on the court and play my game.
It’s an opportunity missed for Gauff that will sting for reasons beyond the chance to face an opponent other than Swiatek in a Grand Slam quarterfinal.
