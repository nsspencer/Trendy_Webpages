    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Pollard suffered the injury with 1:24 left in the first half of the Cowboys' 19-12 divisional round loss to the San Francisco 49ers when he was rolled up after an 8-yard catch.
Pollard needed help to the sideline and was wearing an Aircast on his left leg as he was carted to the X-ray room inside Levi's Stadium.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While quarterback Dak Prescott is clearly the Dallas Cowboys' most valuable player, no player is more valuable to their offense than running back Tony Pollard.
