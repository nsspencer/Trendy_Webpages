     Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb: Leading receiver in losing effort
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lamb corralled 10 of 13 targets for 117 yards and rushed twice for six yards in Sunday's 19-12 divisional-round loss to the 49ers.
Lamb took advantage of the 49ers' Achilles heel -- its cornerbacks -- and produced the first 100-yard receiving game of his young postseason career.
The rest of Dallas' offense sputtered in the loss, bringing the star wideout's 2022 season to a close.
Lamb finished with career highs across the board during the regular season, finishing with 107 receptions for 1,359 yards and nine touchdowns across 17 games.
The 23-year-old will enter the fourth year of his rookie contract in 2023, and he will likely command a huge contract extension if he continues to make strides as the Cowboys' top wideout.

     Social Media reacts to CeeDee Lamb's incredible catch against San Francisco
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Locked in a battle with the San Francisco 49ers, CeeDee Lamb made a huge play to get the Dallas Cowboys out of the shadow of their own endzone.
The Dallas Cowboys were backed up inside the 10-yard line and they came out in what looked like a run formation.
On the snap, Dallas ran play action and Lamb had one-on-one coverage down the left sideline.
The ball from Dak Prescott was a bit underthrown and Lamb had to come back to the ball.
As he did, the defensive back interfered with him and Lamb still made an incredible over the shoulder catch.
