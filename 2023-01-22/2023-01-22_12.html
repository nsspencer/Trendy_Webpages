    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- If the Dallas Cowboys are to win their divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, they will have to do it without Pro Bowl running back Tony Pollard.
Pollard suffered a left ankle injury with 1:24 left in the first half when he was rolled up after an 8-yard catch.
Without Pollard, the Cowboys will have to rely on Ezekiel Elliott and rookie Malik Davis.
Pollard's injury could not come at a worse time for the Cowboys or for him.
The Cowboys were banking on Pollard's speed against a San Francisco run defense that finished second against the run (77.2 yards per game).

     Cowboys Rumors: Tony Pollard Could Get Franchise Tag from DAL in NFL Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julio Aguilar/Getty ImagesIf it means retaining Tony Pollard, the Dallas Cowboys might be willing to invest a lot of money in their backfield for the 2023 NFL season.
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday the Cowboys would consider applying the franchise tag to Pollard in order to prevent him from leaving in free agency.
The franchise tag would set Pollard's salary at a projected $10.1 million for next year.
As good as Pollard and Elliott have been together, the Cowboys might have to choose one or the other.
If the franchise tag is the outcome for Pollard, then it could force Dallas to make some difficult decisions with an eye toward the salary cap.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whenever we do eventually reach that point there are going to be a lot of questions for the team to answer and one of them is about the status of running back Tony Pollard.
While Pollard is scheduled to hit the open market, there is one tool available at the team’s disposal and that is the franchise tag.
Early on Sunday afternoon NFL Network reported that the Cowboys want to find a way to retain Tony Pollard this offseason and that the tag is obviously one of the options.
From @NFLGameDay: The #Cowboys want to keep RB Tony Pollard and the franchise tag is considered an option; As for the #49ers, a massive Nick Bosa extension is a priority for this offseason.
Elliott is a wonderful player for the Cowboys but the merits of giving the running back position that much money are what many have taken issue with.

     Cowboys To Consider Franchise Tag For RB Tony Pollard?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cowboys are one of three remaining teams in the NFC in no small part due to the success of their rushing attack.
Pollard totaled 890 yards on 187 carries during his first two campaigns, good for an average of 4.75 yards per rush.
That production made Pollard a Pro Bowler this year, and sets him up well to hit the open market.
The 2023 tag is projected to cost just over $10MM for running backs, which would represent a considerable bump in compensation for Pollard.
Given the presence of Elliott, however, that would also make the RB position a highly expensive one for the Cowboys.
