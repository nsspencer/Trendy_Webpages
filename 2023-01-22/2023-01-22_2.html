     Summary: The Bengals have gone down the field efficiently on each of their first two drives, with quarterback Joe Burrow hitting tight end Hayden Hurst for a 15-yard touchdown to cap the second.
The Bengals have faced only a pair of third downs, though technically only one counted.
And then on the next set of downs, Burrow hit Hurst on third-and-7 for the 15-yard touchdown.
Burrow has started the game 9-of-9 passing for 105 yards with a pair of touchdowns.
On the other side, Buffalo has gone three-and-out twice for what’s been a nightmare start for the home team.

     Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow compared to Tom Brady as "true quarterback" praised
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bengals took a two score lead into heading into the second half after Burrow two touchdowns - with scores to Jamarr Chase and Hayden Hurst.
Like Brady, Burrow isn't exactly a running quarterback, as he likes to remain in the pocket, diagnose what he sees and make the right pass time and time again.
NFL reporter Ryan Spagnoli has tweeted: "After watching Tom Brady for two decades, I can honestly say Joe Burrow is the closest I’ve seen to him from a mindset perspective.
Fellow NFL writer Mike Speer wrote: "Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes are going to be this generations Tom Brady and Manning.
Burrow and the Bengals were defeated in last year's Super Bowl against the Los Angeles Rams, with Burrow making it in just in second year.

     Bengals preparing for Joe Burrow extension as off-field business thrives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources say the Bengals are targeting this offseason for a Burrow mega-contract extension, as their standout has finished the third year of his rookie contract.
An extension will be expensive, with Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's $46.1 million per year average serving as the floor for negotiations.
Prior to the 2022 regular season, the Bengals sold the naming rights to Paul Brown Stadium for the first time ever.
It's now Paycor Stadium, which brings in a figure that the Cincinnati Business Courier estimated at $8-9 million per year.
As another person involved noted, it's not like they would turn down the deals if Burrow wasn't up for an extension.
