     Jeff Zients to be named Biden's next chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will name Jeff Zients to serve as his next chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain, who is expected to leave in the coming weeks, an administration official and a person familiar with the decision told NBC News.
Zients, who previously led the Biden administration’s Covid-19 response, left the administration briefly last April but returned in the fall right before the midterm elections.
Zients’ selection comes as Biden has come under fire over his handling of classified documents that were found at his Delaware residence and a Washington office he used.
Zients has been a longtime figure in the president's inner circle, even before he took office.
He served as an adviser to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign and led transition efforts as co-chair before his work as Covid-19 response coordinator.

     Biden chief Ron Klain to leave White House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) — White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has spent more than two years as President Joe Biden’s top aide, is preparing to leave his job in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with Klain’s plans.
Klain sent an email to White House staff on Friday, which was the second anniversary of Biden’s inauguration.
Former White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients is expected to be named new White House chief of staff.
At the time, the White House said Klain “got it wrong this time” and he promised to be more careful with his Twitter account.
Klain also worked on judicial picks in the Clinton White House, helping with the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsberg for the Supreme Court.

     Jeff Zients to replace Ron Klain as White House chief of staff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Jeff Zients, who ran President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response effort and served in high-ranking roles in the Obama administration, is expected to replace Ron Klain as the next White House chief of staff, according to three people briefed on the matter.
Biden decided on Zients after an internal search when it became clear that Klain favored Zients as his successor, a factor that played a big role in the president’s decision.
Klain had tapped Zients to lead a talent search for expected staff turnover following the midterm elections, but that didn’t ultimately materialize after Democrats performed better than expected.
Deep experienceIn replacing Klain with Zients, Biden is turning to a consultant with more business experience than political background as he enters the third year of his presidency.
The decision to pick Zients surprised some internally given that there were differences in Biden’s and Zients’ management styles early on in the administration.
