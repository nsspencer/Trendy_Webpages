     Summary: The fight world swiftly reacted after UFC fighter Jamahal Hill defeated Glover Teixeira in Rio de Janeiro at UFC 283 Saturday night, capturing the light heavyweight championship and cementing his place at the top of the division.
"Glover has had a stellar career and has nothing else to prove," UFC #5 ranked middleweight Derek Brunson tweeted.
"Thank you @gloverteixeira," former UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping tweeted.
He’s gonna keep his belt for a while and go up to light heavyweight.
Maurício "Shogun" Rua, also a Brazilian veteran and former light heavyweight champion, retired earlier in the night following his loss to Ihor Potieria.

     UFC 283 post-event facts: Jamahal Hill sets striking record in bloody title win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first numbered UFC event of 2023 proved to be a good one.
Two new champions were crowned Saturday at UFC 283 at Jeunesse Arena in Rio de Janeiro.
The main event of the organization’s return to Brazil after nearly three years saw Jamahal Hill (12-1 MMA, 6-1 UFC) deliver a lopsided beatdown of Glover Teixeira (33-9 MMA, 16-7 UFC) to win a unanimous decision and claim the vacant light heavyweight champion.
In the co-headliner, Brandon Moreno (21-5-2 MMA, 9-2-2 UFC) proved to be the better man to Deiveson Figueiredo (21-3-1 MMA, 10-3-1 UFC) when he produced a sensational showing for the third-round doctor’s stoppage TKO to become undisputed flyweight champ and win their rivalry 2-1-1.

There are many worthwhile fights to consider in the aftermath of UFC 283, including Hill vs. Prochazka.
Light heavyweight divisionUFC light heavyweight championship -- Jamahal Hill (c) vs. Jiri Prochazka: Hill showed a lot of growth in an absolutely dominant performance against Teixeira.
The UFC may decide to book Hill in a title fight before Prochazka is healed, but the division is short on contenders.

     With tetralogy delays over, Brandon Moreno lays out contender order after UFC 283
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIO DE JANEIRO – Brandon Moreno recognizes the UFC flyweight division largely has been held up by his near three-year-long tetralogy with Deiveson Figueiredo.
Saturday at UFC 283, the string of constant rematches seemingly came to an end when Moreno (21-6-2 MMA, 9-3-2 UFC) broke a 1-1-1 tie with Figueiredo (21-3-1 MMA, 10-3-1 UFC) and defeated his four-time foe by third-round TKO due to doctor stoppage.
Moments after he escaped incoming concessions hurled his way by Brazilian fans during his exit, Moreno was approached by top flyweight contender Alexandre Pantoja (25-5 MMA, 9-3 UFC).
“I think right now, he’s very excited and he’s a little bit desperate to get the fight for the title.
Hopefully nothing happened with my knee.”For more on the card, visit MMA Junkie’s event hub for UFC 283.

     Summary: Instead, I’ll say Hill vs. Ankalaev is the fight to make.
If Colby Covington is coming back any time soon, then Burns vs. Covington is a great fight.
If he’s not, then Burns vs. Muhammad would be a great title eliminator.
Not sure if it’s the fight the UFC will book, but Andrade vs. Weili 2 is the best strawweight title fight the UFC can make right now.

     Summary: No matter the mixed results late in his career, Rua’s (27-14-1 MMA, 11-12-1 UFC) legacy remains unblemished.
The cuts down to flyweight have been a well-documented struggle for Figueiredo (21-3-1 MMA, 10-3-1 UFC).
There’s a lot of fun fights for Figueiredo on paper in his new weight class, but he’s going to have to prove himself all over again to reach the top.
It’s crazy that about six weeks ago, Hill (12-1 MMA, 6-1 UFC) was nowhere in the title conversation.
