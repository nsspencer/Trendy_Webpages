Mbappe became the first PSG player to score five goals in a competitive match.

He almost got a double hat trick but a late shot was blocked.

     Summary: Kylian Mbappe scored five times in PSG's 7-0 win over sixth-tier Pays de Cassel in the French CupParis (AFP) – Kylian Mbappe became the first Paris Saint-Germain player to score five times in one match as the Ligue 1 giants crushed sixth-tier amateur minnows Pays de Cassel 7-0 in the French Cup on Monday.
He struck twice more after the restart, with Neymar and Carlos Soler scoring PSG's other goals in the last-32 tie.
The Qatar-owned club, who have won the French Cup 14 times, more than any other team, will now play away to bitter rivals Marseille in the last 16 early next month.
Neymar set up Soler to backheel in for 6-0 before Mbappe completed the rout, his fifth of the game allowing him to equal the all-time record for most French Cup goals.
He has now scored 29 times in the competition, as many as former Marseille great Jean-Pierre Papin.

What’s more, is that the partnership between the duo has stretched much further than football jerseys — take a look at the collaborative Air Jordan 1 Zoom CMFT and Air Jordan 7 sneakers for proof of that.
Designed with Nike’s latest Dri-FIT template, the jersey is predominantly black, with yellow diagonal lines across the front, back, and sleeves.
