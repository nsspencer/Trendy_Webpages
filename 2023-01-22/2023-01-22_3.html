     Summary: Balloon tribute for Ron team-mate OspinaAl Nassr fans released balloons in support of their former Arsenal keeper David Opsina during Cristiano Ronaldo's debut.
Ronaldo, 37, played his first competitive game for the Saudi Arabian outfit against Ettifaq on Sunday following his £175million-a-year move to the Middle East.
But Ronaldo was not the only ex-Premier League player who was shown some love by the Al Nassr supporters.
The 34-year-old, who joined Al Nassr on a free transfer last summer, could be out for up to six months with an elbow problem.
And the Al Nassr fans present for Ronaldo's highly-anticipated debut decided to honour Ospina with a gesture midway through the first half.

     Al Nassr - Ettifaq live online: Cristiano Ronaldo starts, score, stats and updates | Saudi Pro League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Nassr-Ettifaq: match reportCristiano Ronaldo was handed a debut for Al Nassr against Ettifaq on Sunday as the veteran striker made his first Saudi Pro League appearance.
His debut for Al Nassr was delayed as 37-year-old Ronaldo served a two-match ban imposed by the English Football Association for an incident that saw him slap a phone from the hand of a young Everton supporter in a game at Goodison Park last season.
Ronaldo was handed the captain's armband, having already featured for a Riyadh All-Stars team – scoring twice – against Lionel Messi's Paris Saint-Germain this week.
The striker from Madeira enjoyed a winning start as his Al Nassr side overcame a gritty Ettifaq in a game which started brightly but lost its spark as the contest unfolded.
Cristiano showed flashes but was well marshalled by the 'Commandos' from Dammam.
