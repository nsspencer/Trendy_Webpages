     HBO's 'The Last of Us' Episode 2 Makes Major Changes to the Game's Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us episode 2 landed on HBO Max on Sunday, and it saw Ellie, Tess and Joel taking the first steps of their dark journey across the US.
In contrast, episode 2's opening flashback reveals how the Cordyceps fungus brought the world to ruin in 2003.
In the game, Cordyceps spreads via spores -- Mazin told ComicBook.com that they changed it for the show to avoid having characters wearing gas masks all the time.
The show, however, sees a horde of infected descend on the Capitol Building, and Tess stays behind to cover Joel and Ellie's escape.
Ellie and Joel witness the blast from outside, and a quietly devastated Joel walks away.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a very promising debut episode, The Last of Us is shaping up to be the best video game adaptation we've ever seen.
When we left off last week, Joel, Ellie, and his smuggling partner, Tess (Anna Torv), are now off the grid.
They escaped the QZ, a quarantine zone run by Fedra (the Federal Disaster Response Agency), where uninfected survivors are kept as prisoners.
A cool rebel group exists there, named the Fireflies, but we're now long gone from that place.
As we saw in the debut episode, he has some daughter issues to deal with, too.

Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Jeffery Pierce, the video game voice actors for Joel, Ellie, and Tommy, respectively, are also set to appear.
While there isn’t a trailer specifically for Episode 2, HBO did release a teaser for the upcoming weeks.
The clip also teases the treacherous trek Joel, Tess, and Ellie take through abandoned Boston in the next episode, with some Infected crossing their paths.
We also learn that his brother, Tommy, is missing somewhere outside of Boston and hasn’t been heard from in weeks.

     The Last of Us episode 2: Tess's death and the zombie kiss, explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here’s how showrunner Craig Mazin explained the change to Elise Favis, my former colleague, who recently interviewed him for The Washington Post.
If the open city is really, really dangerous, it seems like they’re really going way, way out of their way to find Tess and Joel.
There’s the kiss of Judas, the kiss of death, “Kiss from a Rose.” Remember “Cat Person?” Kisses can be tender, wet, bad, sloppy, bored.
The zombie kiss is a grotesque inversion of what Tess seemed to want very badly from Joel: intimacy, closeness, oneness.
The whole episode is about their dynamic, and how Tess and Joel differ in their relation to Ellie.

We learn through conversation between Joel, Tess and Ellie that bombing is exactly what happened across the globe to slow the spread.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Review: Episode 2 ‘Infected’ Is a Tutorial Level for a World with Little Hope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's another episode of saying hello and farewell, this time showing Ellie and the audience how to move through this world.
Later scenes in “Infected” show how even 20 years of experience still leave some grey area around the enemy that everyone is fighting.
Ellie becomes the simplest test case for that – she’s seeing how her notions of the world beyond the wall match with reality.
Seeing this new world through Ellie’s eyes makes “Infected” something like a second half of a massive pilot.
Now Joel and Ellie carry on silently, trying to grow that last tiny sliver of hope.

     Summary: The following story contains spoilers for The Last of Us Season 1 Episode 2.
The majority of this episode takes place in the present 2023 timeline, and it seems like most of the series going forward will do so.
Putting this sequence at the start of the episode really hammers home the fact that we're not losing monsters, but people.
The long way is now also the impossible way.
Joel and Ellie have to go; Ellie doesn't want to leave her, but Joel knows what he has to do.

     Summary: This post contains spoilers for “Infected,” the second episode of HBO’s The Last of Us.
The zombie apocalypse is days away, and the government of Jakarta is finding this out before anyone else.
As with the John Hannah prologue in the premiere, there’s some value to offering context to all the gory, scary things we witness Joel, Ellie and Tess experience in 2023.
But perhaps the most important thing the episode does is to make sure we see Ellie as a person first, rather than a walking vaccine incubator.
But it also means that when Tess kills herself to protect them, it shakes her in a way it doesn’t Joel.
