     Summary: In Episode 1’s heartrending 30-minute prologue, we’re introduced to Sarah Miller, Joel’s daughter and the love of his life.
The plan almost went off the rails when Tess discovered Ellie was infected, but eventually this only proved that Ellie really is immune to the virus.
After Joel shoots a straggling Infected survivor, he awakes the horde the gang saw earlier in the episode.
HBOJoel’s survival supersedes his sentimentality, and he takes Ellie far from the State House.
At the last second, the lighter finally catches, and she blows the State House up.

     HBO's 'The Last of Us' Episode 2 Makes Major Changes to the Game's Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us episode 2 landed on HBO Max on Sunday, and it saw Ellie, Tess and Joel taking the first steps of their dark journey across the US.
In contrast, episode 2's opening flashback reveals how the Cordyceps fungus brought the world to ruin in 2003.
In the game, Cordyceps spreads via spores -- Mazin told ComicBook.com that they changed it for the show to avoid having characters wearing gas masks all the time.
The show, however, sees a horde of infected descend on the Capitol Building, and Tess stays behind to cover Joel and Ellie's escape.
Ellie and Joel witness the blast from outside, and a quietly devastated Joel walks away.

     Summary: This review contains full spoilers for episode two of The Last of Us, now available to view on HBO Max.
To stay spoiler-free, check out our The Last of Us Season 1 Review.
Episode 2 of The Last of Us greets us with yet another cold open that further displays Neil Druckmann’s desire to expand this world beyond that of his original game.
A scene filled with quiet dread, it ends with the loudest of suggestions - the bombing of an entire city.
Sound is also used brilliantly throughout the episode.

     The Last of Us episode 2: Tess's death and the zombie kiss, explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here’s how showrunner Craig Mazin explained the change to Elise Favis, my former colleague, who recently interviewed him for The Washington Post.
If the open city is really, really dangerous, it seems like they’re really going way, way out of their way to find Tess and Joel.
There’s the kiss of Judas, the kiss of death, “Kiss from a Rose.” Remember “Cat Person?” Kisses can be tender, wet, bad, sloppy, bored.
The zombie kiss is a grotesque inversion of what Tess seemed to want very badly from Joel: intimacy, closeness, oneness.
The whole episode is about their dynamic, and how Tess and Joel differ in their relation to Ellie.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Episode 2 Recap: A Death in the Family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This post contains spoilers for “Infected,” the second episode of HBO’s The Last of Us.
As with the John Hannah prologue in the premiere, there’s some value to offering context to all the gory, scary things we witness Joel, Ellie and Tess experience in 2023.
But perhaps the most important thing the episode does is to make sure we see Ellie as a person first, rather than a walking vaccine incubator.
But it also means that when Tess kills herself to protect them, it shakes her in a way it doesn’t Joel.
