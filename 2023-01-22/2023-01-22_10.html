President Biden has chosen Jeff Zients to replace Ron Klain as his chief of staff when Klain steps down sometime in the coming weeks, people familiar with the decision told the Washington Post and Politico.
Zients will help the president manage his work with a divided Congress, while other members of his staff prepare him for a likely reelection campaign.
People familiar with the decision said that other senior advisers will likely take on more prominent roles in Biden’s White House.
Still, in an interview with the Post, Biden’s former chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci had nothing but praise for Zients.

     Biden chief Ron Klain to leave White House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) — White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has spent more than two years as President Joe Biden’s top aide, is preparing to leave his job in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with Klain’s plans.
Klain sent an email to White House staff on Friday, which was the second anniversary of Biden’s inauguration.
Former White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients is expected to be named new White House chief of staff.
At the time, the White House said Klain “got it wrong this time” and he promised to be more careful with his Twitter account.
Klain also worked on judicial picks in the Clinton White House, helping with the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsberg for the Supreme Court.

     Jeff Zients to replace Ron Klain as White House chief of staff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Jeff Zients, who ran President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response effort and served in high-ranking roles in the Obama administration, is expected to replace Ron Klain as the next White House chief of staff, according to three people briefed on the matter.
Biden decided on Zients after an internal search when it became clear that Klain favored Zients as his successor, a factor that played a big role in the president’s decision.
Klain had tapped Zients to lead a talent search for expected staff turnover following the midterm elections, but that didn’t ultimately materialize after Democrats performed better than expected.
Deep experienceIn replacing Klain with Zients, Biden is turning to a consultant with more business experience than political background as he enters the third year of his presidency.
The decision to pick Zients surprised some internally given that there were differences in Biden’s and Zients’ management styles early on in the administration.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesFormer Biden administration COVID coordinator Jeffrey Zients will replace Ron Klain as White House chief of staff, according to multiple reports out Sunday.
Zients departed the White House in April after steering the administration’s COVID response, then came back in the fall to work with Klain on staff issues.
Klain, 61, is seen as a critical force behind the Biden administration’s legislative victories and several other major initiatives, including its pandemic response.
He eventually joined the Biden campaign, served as co-chair of his transition team, and then took over the U.S. COVID response and ran the country’s vaccine rollout.
This post has been updated to include the news that Zients will replace Klain.
