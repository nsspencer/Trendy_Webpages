However, unlike the Chiefs quarterback, he did not return to the game in the second half.
Following more examination, Pollard suffered a fractured left fibula that will require surgery, according to ESPN.

     Summary: ESPN's Todd Archer reported after the game that Pollard suffered a fractured left fibula and will need to have surgery.
He was slow to get up and was helped off the field and into the medical tent before being carted off.
Pollard rushed for 22 yards on six carries before exiting.
He rushed for 182 yards and one touchdown in 12 regular-season games, and rushed for 24 yards and one score against Tampa Bay.
Had the Cowboys advanced to the NFC Championship Game next weekend, the loss of Pollard would have proved to be a significant challenge for Dallas to overcome.
