     Beyoncé makes controversial live return at exclusive Dubai concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beyoncé has given her first full concert in more than four years, at a luxury resort in Dubai, for an audience of invited influencers and journalists.
While the performance included similar live debuts for songs from that album, Stereogum reported, it did not contain any material from Beyoncé’s highly acclaimed 2022 album Renaissance.
Fans have long lobbied artists to cancel concerts in the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the countries’ respective serious human rights violations.
People at the concert were asked to put their phones in locked pouches to prevent footage from the event circulating.
General access live dates for Renaissance are yet to be announced.

     The Story Behind Beyoncé’s 3 Epic Dubai Performance Looks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That Beyoncé chose to open the concert—her first in four years—wearing a Middle Eastern designer is no accident.
The superstar is known to make her most meaningful fashion statements center stage, and last night she took the opportunity to shine the spotlight on regional talent.
“Give it up for my baby, my brown skin girl, Miss Blue Ivy Carter,” Beyoncé said, introducing her 11 year old to the audience.
Beyoncé changed tack for the finale by tapping the Ukrainian designer Ivan Frolov.
“It just goes to show that no matter what, Ukrainian brands continue to showcase the world their resistance and culture.”
