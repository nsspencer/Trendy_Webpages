     The Story Behind Beyoncé’s 3 Epic Dubai Performance Looks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That Beyoncé chose to open the concert—her first in four years—wearing a Middle Eastern designer is no accident.
The superstar is known to make her most meaningful fashion statements center stage, and last night she took the opportunity to shine the spotlight on regional talent.
“Give it up for my baby, my brown skin girl, Miss Blue Ivy Carter,” Beyoncé said, introducing her 11 year old to the audience.
Beyoncé changed tack for the finale by tapping the Ukrainian designer Ivan Frolov.
“It just goes to show that no matter what, Ukrainian brands continue to showcase the world their resistance and culture.”
