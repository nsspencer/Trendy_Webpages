     Imagineers testing Tiana's Bayou Adventure at Splash Mountain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We believe this ride-through was to listen to new attraction audio as a group.
As we know, the upcoming Tiana’s Bayou Adventure ride will have the same ride path layout as the current Splash Mountain.
So we assumed the Imagineers were listening to the upcoming attraction audio in real time.
That doesn’t necessarily mean the ride audio is final and the music is ready to go though.
But we can confirm this group of Disney Executives and Imagineers were continually pointing at specific ride scenes, animatronics, and props.

RELATED: Disgusting, Unforgivably Insensitive: Disney World is Reimagining the WRONG ATTRACTIONThe outcry left a majority of Disney fans scratching their heads.
And on Sunday, the last ever day of operation of Splash Mountain, some fans began to cope with their disappointment in other, um, money-making ways.
On Sunday, an eBay user listed a twig from the Splash Mountain attraction on the popular online marketplace.
And even bigger kudos if a diehard Splash Mountain fan comes forward to “buy it now” on this, um, nostalgic item.

     Summary: ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — After 30 years, it's time to say so long to Splash Mountain at Disney World.
Disneyland's Splash Mountain will also be transformed into Tiana's Bayou Adventure, but a closing date for that attraction has not yet been announced.
Splash Mountain opened at Magic Kingdom in October 1992.
For Tiana's Bayou Adventure, Walt Disney Imagineers will transform the Old South of Splash Mountain into 1920s New Orleans.
Tiana's Bayou Adventure is set to open at both Disney World and Disneyland in 2024.

     ‘Save Splash Mountain’ Trended As The Longtime Disney World Ride Prepares To Close To Long Lines And Nostalgia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While some fans have been vocal for months about the ride’s end, as the ride prepares to say goodbye at Disney World on January 23, fans have actually helped “Save Splash Mountain” to trend.
As of the time of this article being written on Sunday, Splash Mountain was at a whopping 200-minute wait time.
In fact, Splash Mountain doesn't crack the Top 10 of longest Disney World wait times.
Though we have some questions about the Splash Mountain redo, given the nature of the drop ride, it will seemingly have all of the major ride facets its previous iteration will have, but that hasn’t stopped this “Save Splash Mountain” trend.
It might also give the ride the opportunity to fix issues like Disney World log flumes frequently sinking, who knows?

     Disney Patrons Flock to Splash Mountain, Last Ride Before Shutdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The days of 'Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah' at Disney parks in the U.S. are about to be long gone -- which is why folks are forming massive lines this weekend for a final go-around.
Tons of Disneyland &amp; Disney World patrons posted photos/videos Saturday and Sunday that show them waiting for their chance to hop on a log and cruise through Splash Mountain one final time before it officially closes down for a re-imagining starting Monday.
That version is expected to reopen sometime in 2024 ... so SM will go dark until at least then.
The riders don't seem to care though -- frankly, this is the last opportunity anyone is going to have to enjoy Splash Mountain as it originally was ... and it seems Disney fiends want their fill.
Splash Mountain has been around since the late '80s, and it's become a staple for many in any Disney park visit.
