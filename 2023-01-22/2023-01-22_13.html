     Canucks fire head coach Bruce Boudreau; Rick Tocchet hired as replacement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Vancouver Canucks announced Sunday that they have fired head coach Bruce Boudreau after a tenure that lasted just over a year and culminated in the Canucks losing 28 out of their last 46 games.
The Canucks have replaced Boudreau with former Arizona Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet, who has been named the 21st head coach in the history of the Canucks franchise.
Adam Foote has been named assistant coach, while Sergei Gonchar has been hired as a defensive development coach.
Tocchet, Foote, and Gonchar all bring a championship pedigree to the organization and we look forward to welcoming them to Vancouver."
Tocchet brings a degree of experience to the Canucks head coaching position, as he posted a 178-200-60 record as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Coyotes.

     Summary: Bruce Boudreau gets choked up as he's serenaded with "Bruce, there is" chants in his final game as head coach of the Canucks.
(0:37)Bruce Boudreau has been fired as coach of the Vancouver Canucks, who are again on track to miss the playoffs with another underachieving season.
Rick Tocchet was hired as Boudreau's replacement for a Vancouver team that has lost 28 of 46 games this season.
Boudreau had waved to the crowd after the Canucks' latest defeat Saturday night, their third in the past four games.
But a Canucks team in disarray did not give him much of a chance to keep that success going.

     Summary: Bruce Boudreau’s time behind the Vancouver Canucks bench has finally come to an end.
The Canucks announced Boudreau and assistant head coach Trent Cull were terminated and replaced by Rick Tocchet.
The Canucks finished five points out of the playoffs, despite ranking among the worst teams in the league before Boudreau arrived.
Tocchet has spent parts of six seasons as a head coach, finishing above .500 just twice.
The Canucks face long odds on the Stanley Cup futures board at FanDuel Sportsbook, currently priced as +15000 long shots.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the past few weeks, Canucks coach Bruce Boudreau had been stuck in limbo as the team mulled his future.
On Sunday, Vancouver officially fired Boudreau and hired Tocchet as his replacement.
The Canucks kept Boudreau as head coach while rumors swirled that he would be fired for weeks.
On Saturday night, Boudreau coached his final game with the team, but Vancouver fans made sure he got a proper send off with multiple “Bruce, there it is” chants.
Boudreau finally acknowledged the situation, as the 68-year-old veteran coach might not get another chance to lead a team in the NHL.

Along with Tocchet, Adam Foote was named assistant coach and Sergei Gonchar defensive development coach.
"Regardless of how [Boudreau] went down, you have to have those relationships (with players)," Tocchet said.

(Photo by Jeff Vinnick/NHLI via Getty Images)Following the Vancouver Canucks’ disastrous handling of Bruce Boudreau’s firing and Rick Tocchet’s hiring, team president Jim Rutherford now realizes something: He should probably stop talking.
I'm going to let Patrik and Rick talk about the team and just stay away from those things."
Canucks fans can tie themselves in knots trying to get to the roots of the problems with their team.
Perhaps the Canucks really just need to stop talking and start doing what must be done to turn this mess around.
