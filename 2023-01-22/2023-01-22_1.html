    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thearon W. Henderson/Getty ImagesThe Cowboys didn’t hand the 49ers that game.
But no Cowboys playoff loss would be complete without Mike McCarthy committing crimes against the clock.
Even if this one wasn’t quite a felony, McCarthy’s punt late in the fourth quarter was at least a misdemeanor.
The logic of going for it would be easy to understand: After a stout first half, the Cowboys’ defense looked completely shot on the previous two drives.
The 49ers ate up huge chunks of the clock, racking up 155 yards and running out nearly a quarter of the game.

     Brock Purdy, George Kittle lead San Francisco 49ers to NFC Championship game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Purdy, a San Francisco 49ers rookie quarterback, completed 19 of 29 passes for 214 yards as the 49ers beat the Dallas Cowboys 19-12 in Sunday's NFC divisional playoff game.
Purdy and the 49ers will travel to Philadelphia next Sunday at p.m. for the NFC Championship game.
"He's playing at a high level," Kittle said of Purdy after the game.
San Francisco advanced to play the Eagles in the NFC title game next Sunday in Philadelphia after losing in that round to the Rams a year ago.
Purdy started the next drive with a 16-yard completion to Kittle and San Francisco didn’t give the ball back to Dallas until there were 45 seconds left at the 6.

     Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy declines to elaborate on bizarre final play in loss to 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones appeared to understand the significance of Dallas' failures in the penultimate drive.
On the first play of their final series, Prescott rolled out on a slow-developing pass play well into his own end zone -- and he nearly was taken down for a game-ending safety.
Prescott managed to duck a pass rusher in the end zone, but he threw incomplete to Schultz, setting a tone for the drive.
Even though Schultz went out of bounds, he was knocked backward when he crossed the line.
That's when the final play served as a culmination of the Cowboys' poor execution down the stretch.

     Spadaro: Bring on the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are other news and notes as the preview of the NFC Championship Game showdown commences:1.
The 268 rushing yards were the second-most in team playoff history, trailing only a 274-yard performance in the 1949 NFL Championship Game (December 18, 1949 at Los Angeles Rams).
It also marked the most rushing yards by any NFL team in a postseason game since San Francisco had 285 yards vs. Green Bay in the 2019 NFC Championship Game.
We have a great offensive line, great backs.
And that is what has made them special in this journey to the NFC Championship Game.

     Summary: San Francisco 49ersAfter a few below-standard showings over the past month, the 49ers' defense heard all the whispers.
Fred Warner and the 49ers' defense held the Cowboys to 12 points to advance to the NFC Championship Game.
Thearon W. Henderson/Getty ImagesThe Cowboys' season ends where it always ends, it seems: in the divisional round of the playoffs.
He became the first Cowboys quarterback with two interceptions in a playoff game since Troy Aikman in the 1998 wild-card round.
In the first six drives of the game, the Cowboys did not allow more than 46 yards while giving up three field goals.

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers are heading back to a familiar place after taking the most unorthodox of paths to get there.
“You work so hard to get to these points, these situations, and all we could think about was winning that game,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.
San Francisco lost a fumble deep in its territory on a punt return but limited the Cowboys to a field goal on that mistake.
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy (13) scrambles p[ast Dallas Cowboys defensive end Dorance Armstrong (92).
San Francisco has had a lot of convincing victories this season, but defensive end Nick Bosa said Sunday was good preparation for what’s to come.

     Summary: The 49ers need a big game from the All-Pro safety.
San Francisco needs their pass rush to get home.
– San Francisco started to figure it out a little bit on offense, but they still settled for a 47-yard field goal on their third possession.
More concerning for San Francisco though is why Elliott was so wide open.
Purdy just throws the ball away in time to leave San Francisco one second for a field goal to end the half.
