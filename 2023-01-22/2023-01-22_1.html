     Summary: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty ImagesErling Haaland silenced his critics by netting a hat trick as Manchester City claimed a comfortable 3-0 win over Wolves on Sunday at the Etihad.
"He [Haaland] has to get the balls delivered, he has fantastic players around him," City boss Pep Guardiola said.
Haaland also broke former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of being the fastest player to four Premier League hat-tricks.
Dixie Dean's record of 60 goals scored in a single league season, set in 1928, remains in sight.
The win keeps City second in the table knocking on the heels of leaders Arsenal, with the London club set to play Manchester United later on Sunday.
