     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys have a noisy fanbase; they are, after all, "America's Team."
However, there might not be a louder fan than FS1's Skip Bayless.

— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) January 23, 2023The reactions didn't stop there from Bayless as he floated out the idea of not showing up for Monday's episode of "Undisputed."
— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) January 23, 2023The 49ers can put the Cowboys and Bayless in the rearview mirror and now focus on the No.

     Summary: The 49ers (15-4) used back-to-back long scoring drives in the second half to wear down the Cowboys (13-6) and win their 12th straight game.
San Francisco advanced to play the Eagles in the NFC title game next Sunday in Philadelphia after losing in that round to the Rams a year ago.
“Man, we’re just excited that we won,” rookie 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy said.

     Spadaro: Bring on the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are other news and notes as the preview of the NFC Championship Game showdown commences:1.
The 268 rushing yards were the second-most in team playoff history, trailing only a 274-yard performance in the 1949 NFL Championship Game (December 18, 1949 at Los Angeles Rams).
It also marked the most rushing yards by any NFL team in a postseason game since San Francisco had 285 yards vs. Green Bay in the 2019 NFC Championship Game.
We have a great offensive line, great backs.
And that is what has made them special in this journey to the NFC Championship Game.

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers are heading back to a familiar place after taking the most unorthodox of paths to get there.
“You work so hard to get to these points, these situations, and all we could think about was winning that game,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.
San Francisco lost a fumble deep in its territory on a punt return but limited the Cowboys to a field goal on that mistake.
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy (13) scrambles p[ast Dallas Cowboys defensive end Dorance Armstrong (92).
San Francisco has had a lot of convincing victories this season, but defensive end Nick Bosa said Sunday was good preparation for what’s to come.

Fred Warner and the 49ers' defense held the Cowboys to 12 points to advance to the NFC Championship Game.
Thearon W. Henderson/Getty ImagesThe Cowboys' season ends where it always ends, it seems: in the divisional round of the playoffs.
He became the first Cowboys quarterback with two interceptions in a playoff game since Troy Aikman in the 1998 wild-card round.
In the first six drives of the game, the Cowboys did not allow more than 46 yards while giving up three field goals.

     NFL Twitter Reacts to Cowboys’ Bizarre Last Play vs. 49ers (Video)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dak Prescott and the Cowboys left their fans with a final play to remember Sunday night as their season came to an end in the divisional round in a 19–12 road loss to the 49ers.
Prescott lined up in a shotgun formation ready to receive the snap from running back Ezekiel Elliott, who lined up as the center … yes, you read that correctly.
While the play clearly didn’t work out in Dallas’s favor, the poor execution likely was far worse than anyone on the team would’ve ever imagined.
But, on the plus side for the Cowboys and their fans, the finish was, at the very least, much less controversial than last year’s postseason exit.
The bizarre game-ending sequence ignited a wave of reaction on Twitter as the NFL world weighed in on the questionable play call by Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.
