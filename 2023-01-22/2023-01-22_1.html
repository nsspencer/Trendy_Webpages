     Coco Gauff in tears after defeat at Australian Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A frustrated Coco Gauff broke down in tears after her 7-5 6-3 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko at the Australian Open on Sunday, with the 18-year-old American saying she just could not come up with the answers to the Latvian’s game.
“I think every loss is somewhat in my control because I do feel like I’m a good player, but today she just played better,” Gauff, seeded seventh, told reporters.
“There were balls I was hitting deep and she was hitting them on the line and hitting them back deep, like, over and over again.
“I think it’s because I worked really hard and I felt really good coming into the tournament and I still feel good,” Gauff said.
“But when you play a player like her and she plays really well, it’s like there’s nothing you can do.

     Summary: Coco Gauff emotional and frustrated after exit, hopes Jessica Pegula goes on to ‘win it’Coco Gauff was overcome by emotion following her fourth-round defeat to Jelena Ostapenko at the Australian Open, but now that she is out she hopes her doubles partner Jessica Pegula goes all the way.
Gauff, who became emotional during the post-match press conference, said: “I worked really hard, and I felt really good coming into the tournament, and I still feel good.
However, third seed Jessica Pegula is still going strong as the American beat former French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova to reach the quarter-finals.
“I’m excited to play doubles.
“I think doubles has taught me how to play, after losing, how to play with frustration, and that’s what I felt like today.

     Summary: Gauff had shown impressive form as she beat Emma Raducanu in straight sets during the second round.
However, the world No.7 came unstuck against 17th seed Jelena Ostapenko who ran out 7-5, 6-3 victor to book her quarter-final place.
But when you play a player like her (Ostapenko) and she plays really well, there’s nothing you can do.
The partners were beaten in the French Open final last year and both players will be hoping for their first Grand Slam success at Melbourne Park.
Bouncing back from a loss is difficult in a grand slam, but I’m looking forward to tomorrow."

     Dialed-in Jelena Ostapenko hits Coco Gauff off the court in Australian Open round of 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the Australian Open women’s draw was released, a French Open rematch between Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff was the projected top quarterfinal.
Could this be the time Gauff finally solved the Swiatek riddle?
After Swiatek was sent packing by reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, 2017 Roland Garros titlist Jelena Ostapenko continued the power player narrative by eliminating Gauff, 7-5, 6-3.
Yeah, just to step on the court and play my game.
It’s an opportunity missed for Gauff that will sting for reasons beyond the chance to face an opponent other than Swiatek in a Grand Slam quarterfinal.
