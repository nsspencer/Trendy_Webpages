Burrow was sacked four times during the Bengals' win over the Ravens last week and 41 times this season.
Bengals weapons vs. Bills secondarySpeaking of those Bengals weapons, receivers Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd will be instrumental to Cincinnati advancing.
Both had several crucial pass breakups, while Elam secured a game-changing interception in his first playoff game.
