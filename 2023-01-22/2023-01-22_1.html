    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIO DE JANEIRO – Brandon Moreno recognizes the UFC flyweight division largely has been held up by his near three-year-long tetralogy with Deiveson Figueiredo.
Saturday at UFC 283, the string of constant rematches seemingly came to an end when Moreno (21-6-2 MMA, 9-3-2 UFC) broke a 1-1-1 tie with Figueiredo (21-3-1 MMA, 10-3-1 UFC) and defeated his four-time foe by third-round TKO due to doctor stoppage.
Moments after he escaped incoming concessions hurled his way by Brazilian fans during his exit, Moreno was approached by top flyweight contender Alexandre Pantoja (25-5 MMA, 9-3 UFC).
“I think right now, he’s very excited and he’s a little bit desperate to get the fight for the title.
Hopefully nothing happened with my knee.”For more on the card, visit MMA Junkie’s event hub for UFC 283.

If Colby Covington is coming back any time soon, then Burns vs. Covington is a great fight.
If he’s not, then Burns vs. Muhammad would be a great title eliminator.
