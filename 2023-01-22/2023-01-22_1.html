     Hill beats Teixeira to claim UFC light heavyweight crown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - American Jamahal Hill put on a superb display of striking en route to a unanimous decision win over Brazil's Glover Teixeira to claim the vacant UFC light heavyweight title at UFC 283, which took place at the Jeunesse Arena on Saturday.
Hill dominated the main event of the card, mixing up a wide variety of strikes and mostly avoiding grappling exchanges where the 43-year-old Teixeira would have had an advantage.
"Where I came from, to get to this, it's unreal," the 31-year-old Hill said in a post-fight interview.
The 43-year-old Teixeira, who beat Jan Blachowicz to win the title in October 2021 only to lose it in his first defence against Jiri Prochazka in May 2022, announced his retirement after the fight.
"In reality, I think I'm too tough for my own good, too tough for my own health.

     Summary: RIO DE JANEIRO – Brandon Moreno recognizes the UFC flyweight division largely has been held up by his near three-year-long tetralogy with Deiveson Figueiredo.
Saturday at UFC 283, the string of constant rematches seemingly came to an end when Moreno (21-6-2 MMA, 9-3-2 UFC) broke a 1-1-1 tie with Figueiredo (21-3-1 MMA, 10-3-1 UFC) and defeated his four-time foe by third-round TKO due to doctor stoppage.
Moments after he escaped incoming concessions hurled his way by Brazilian fans during his exit, Moreno was approached by top flyweight contender Alexandre Pantoja (25-5 MMA, 9-3 UFC).
“I think right now, he’s very excited and he’s a little bit desperate to get the fight for the title.
Hopefully nothing happened with my knee.”For more on the card, visit MMA Junkie’s event hub for UFC 283.
