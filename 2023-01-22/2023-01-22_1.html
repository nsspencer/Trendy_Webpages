     Hill beats Teixeira to claim UFC light heavyweight crown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - American Jamahal Hill put on a superb display of striking en route to a unanimous decision win over Brazil's Glover Teixeira to claim the vacant UFC light heavyweight title at UFC 283, which took place at the Jeunesse Arena on Saturday.
Hill dominated the main event of the card, mixing up a wide variety of strikes and mostly avoiding grappling exchanges where the 43-year-old Teixeira would have had an advantage.
"Where I came from, to get to this, it's unreal," the 31-year-old Hill said in a post-fight interview.
The 43-year-old Teixeira, who beat Jan Blachowicz to win the title in October 2021 only to lose it in his first defence against Jiri Prochazka in May 2022, announced his retirement after the fight.
"In reality, I think I'm too tough for my own good, too tough for my own health.

     Summary: After reclaiming the flyweight title in the UFC 283 co-main event, Moreno headed backstage where he ran into Alexandre Pantoja, who served as the backup for Saturday’s title fight with hopes that he would eventually get the chance to face the winner.
“He came [at] me and he was very friendly with me, to be honest,” Moreno revealed at the UFC 283 post-fight press conference.
With Moreno’s win on Saturday and Figueiredo already declaring his intention to move to bantamweight, it appears Pantoja finally gets his chance.
“Right now, he’s very excited and he’s a little bit desperate to get the fight for the title,” Moreno said about Pantoja.
“I want to say I’m not impressed,” Pantoja said on the UFC 283 post-fight show.

Moments after he escaped incoming concessions hurled his way by Brazilian fans during his exit, Moreno was approached by top flyweight contender Alexandre Pantoja (25-5 MMA, 9-3 UFC).
