     Written in the stars: What the year of the Rabbit means for your Chinese zodiac
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This column has only focused on Western astrology so far, but I decided to dive into the Chinese zodiac this time.
Sunday marked the beginning of the Year of the Rabbit, specifically the Yin Water Rabbit.
While last year’s Yang Water energy represents vast, rapid-flowing bodies of water, Yin Water represents slow-moving, smaller bodies of water and rain.
Similarly to Western astrology, there’s twelve Chinese zodiac signs: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig.
Thus, the next time it will be the year of the Yin Water Rabbit is 2083.
