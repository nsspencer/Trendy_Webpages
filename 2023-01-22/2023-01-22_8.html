     Cowboys' Brett Maher misses another PAT after 49ers' defense blocks kick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys rolled with Brett Maher in Sunday's NFC Divisional Playoff against the 49ers, despite the kicker missing an NFL-record four PAT attempts in his team's wild-card win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Monday night.
And when Maher had a chance to redeem himself in the second quarter Sunday at Levi's Stadium, it didn't go as planned.
The Cowboys kicker now has missed six of his last seven PAT attempts.
San Francisco's kicker, Robbie Gould, has yet to miss a kick in his playoff career after making three field goals in the game's first half.
As the 49ers' offense looks to put things together against the Cowboys' high-powered defense, they might need more of that perfection moving forward with just a 9-6 lead at the half.

     Summary: Sunday before the San Francisco 49ers played host to the Dallas Cowboys Brett Maher was warming up his kicking leg.
If that didn’t upset the Cowboys kicker enough, how about when team owner Jerry Jones came over to give Maher a pep talk?
Minutes later, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones met with kicker Brett Maher and holder Bryan Anger before the field-goal warmup again resumed.
Jones then chatted with 49ers kicker Robbie Gould.

     Cowboys’ Brett Maher misses again as disastrous postseason continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears that Jerry Jones’ pregame conversation with Brett Maher didn’t help.
The Cowboys kicker couldn’t convert his first extra point in the second quarter of the NFC divisional round, as the 49ers blocked it.
Maher missed four extra points in Dallas’ wild-card win over the Buccaneers, though the team stuck with him for its next postseason game despite the historically poor performance.
Jones, the Cowboys owner, even consulted with Maher and punter Bryan Anger, with multiple misses from Maher — from both directions at Levi’s Stadium — prompting their discussion.

     Summary: The game between the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys didn’t even kick off yet and things were already getting chippy during warm-ups.
Cowboys kicker Brett Maher, who had a rough wild-card round game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, missing four straight extra points, was getting in some pre-game work.
The 49ers clearly weren’t pleased as they walked in front of Maher’s pre-game ritual, which sparked the argument.

The Cowboys opted to stay with Maher this week despite his shortcomings against the Bucs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The postseason blues continue to plague Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher.
A replay of the attempt showed that Maher's kick looked to be going wide left regardless of the block.
His four missed PATs last weekend was the most by any player in a regular or postseason game since 1932.
His five misses over two games is also the second-most postseason misses by any player in NFL history.
Brett Maher has now missed 5 extra points over the last 2 playoff games, 2nd-most in a postseason career in NFL history...

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The kicking woes continue for the Dallas Cowboys.
Dallas advanced to the Divisional Round with a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but it was not a perfect performance.
Kicker Brett Maher missed four extra points in the win, and that called into question how the Cowboys would handle the kicking position against the San Francisco 49ers.
It was time for Maher’s first attempt of the game.
This time, Maher’s kick attempt was blocked by the 49ers’ kick block unit, but looking at the kick as it came off his foot, it seems like Maher’s kicking woes might continue.

     Summary: Brett Maher's first kick on Sunday was blocked, and it might not have been good even if it wasn't.
Maher's first extra point attempt against the San Francisco 49ers, which had as much attention as any first-half extra point in recent memory, was blocked.
The Cowboys didn't replace Maher as their primary kicker, and publicly supported him all week.
With all eyes watching, Maher's kick never got to the uprights.
Late in the second quarter the Cowboys had a decision: Go for it on fourth-and-four or try a 53-yard field goal.
