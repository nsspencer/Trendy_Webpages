     Cowboys RB Tony Pollard suffers ankle injury, out vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- If the Dallas Cowboys are to win their divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, they will have to do it without Pro Bowl running back Tony Pollard.
Pollard suffered a left ankle injury with 1:24 left in the first half when he was rolled up after an 8-yard catch.
Without Pollard, the Cowboys will have to rely on Ezekiel Elliott and rookie Malik Davis.
Pollard's injury could not come at a worse time for the Cowboys or for him.
The Cowboys were banking on Pollard's speed against a San Francisco run defense that finished second against the run (77.2 yards per game).

     Cowboys’ Tony Pollard exits playoff game vs. 49ers with ankle injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the NFL’s top rushing attacks will have to operate without Tony Pollard for the rest of the night.
The Cowboys’ star running back was carted off the field late in the first half of Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against the 49ers with a high-ankle sprain, the team announced.
Pollard’s injury occurred when he had the ball on a second-and-2, with a 49ers defender appearing to fall on his left ankle.
Before his injury, Pollard totaled 22 yards on six carries.
Lachlan Cunningham/Getty ImagesThough the Cowboys and 49ers were tied at 9-9 in the third quarter, San Francisco currently leads Dallas, 16-12, in the fourth.

     Cowboys' Tony Pollard out vs. 49ers with high-ankle sprain after getting carted off the field before halftime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While quarterback Dak Prescott is clearly the Dallas Cowboys' most valuable player, no player is more valuable to their offense than running back Tony Pollard.
Mahomes was diagnosed with a high-ankle sprain earlier Sunday, and like Mahomes, it was officially confirmed that Pollard also suffered a high-ankle sprain.
The fourth-year running back totaled 33 yards from scrimmage on eight first-half touches (six carries and two catches).
A week ago, there was a significant discrepancy in the Cowboys' offensive efficiency when Ezekiel Elliott was on the field instead of Pollard.
The injury couldn't have come at a worse time for Pollard personally, as the 25-year-old is set to hit free agency this upcoming offseason.
