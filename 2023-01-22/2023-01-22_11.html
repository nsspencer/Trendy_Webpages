     Look: NFL World Feels Awful For Ezekiel Elliott
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARLINGTON, TEXAS - OCTOBER 23: Ezekiel Elliott #21 of the Dallas Cowboys runs with the ball against the Detroit Lions during the first half at AT&amp;T Stadium on October 23, 2022 in Arlington, Texas.
(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images) Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesWell, that was ugly.
The Cowboys fell to the 49ers, 19-12, in the Divisional Round of the NFC Playoffs on Sunday.
The Divisional Round playoff game ended in pretty embarrassing fashion for Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.
Elliott, typically a pretty good blocker - for a running back, at least - got absolutely blown up.

     The Cowboys Last Play Had Ezekiel Elliott Snapping The Ball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The final Cowboys drive served as a microcosm of their game, as poor decision-making and execution collided to send them out of the playoffs with a whimper.
I have watched this a number of times and I have yet to figure out what the plan was on this.
When Kavontae Turpin catches the ball, there is no one for him to pitch it to immediately.
There isn‚Äôt a good play to run needing a touchdown from your own 24, but I am confident in saying this is a bad play call for that situation.
At least the Cowboys gave us a laugh on their way out, although the Dallas faithful probably won‚Äôt see the humor in it all just yet.

     Mike McCarthy ends Cowboys season lining up Ezekiel Elliott at center
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So we kind of see what Mike McCarthy was going for with five seconds remaining in the Dallas Cowboys-San Francisco 49ers NFC Divisional Playoff game on Sunday evening.
And it appears they wisely chose ‚Äúblow up Zeke Elliott ASAP, then kill the man with the ball.‚ÄùSomeone will have to ask McCarthy what exactly he was going for here.
And there are no good options to get more than 70 yards in one play when the defense only has to keep that exact thing from happening.
But it makes for one heckuva of a capper on the Cowboys 2022 season, and yet another playoff failure for America‚Äôs Team.
The Philadelphia Eagles open as 2.5-point favorites over the 49ers in the NFC Championship game at DraftKings Sportsbook.

     NFL fans couldn't stop laughing at the Cowboys' hilariously bad final play in loss to 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys had their season come to an end Sunday night with a 19-12 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in what was a really good game for pretty much all 60 minutes.
But there was one weird play that stood out and not in a good way for Dallas.
I‚Äôm talking, of course, about the final play of the game that saw the Cowboys try some wild formation that didn‚Äôt work out for them at all.
Dak Prescott and the offense needed a miracle and they tried to make that miracle happen by running one of the silliest plays you‚Äôll ever see.
Ezekiel Elliott got absolutely lit up on this final playü§£ pic.twitter.com/KLwZ4j4rsY ‚Äî Arye Pulli (@AryePulliTSP) January 23, 2023I mean, that play was so hilariously bad and was just a perfect way to end another disappointing season for the Cowboys.

     The last play in the Cowboys‚Äô Divisional Round loss to the 49ers was an absolute disasterclass
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In these turbulent times, however, we have the Dallas Cowboys, a bucket of laughs at all times.
No matter how good or bad Dallas is, they are always funny and their last play against the San Francisco 49ers is a perfect example.
Let‚Äôs set the stage: Dallas is down 19-12 in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs, and they‚Äôre in their own territory.
Dallas lines up with RB Ezekiel Elliott at center (note: he‚Äôs never played center in his NFL career).
It‚Äôs impressive how the Cowboys can seemingly one up their disasterclass last year against the Niners with one even more impressive.
