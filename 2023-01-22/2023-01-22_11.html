     Biden makes surprise video appearance on 'SNL,' joining host Aubrey Plaza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 15, 2022.
President Joe Biden made a surprise video appearance on "Saturday Night Live" during first-time host Aubrey Plaza's monologue.
The "White Lotus" star, who, like Biden, is from Delaware, joked that she was voted the most famous person from the state, beating out the president.
Biden then appeared via video and said, "Aubrey, you're the most famous person out of Delaware and there's no question about that.
Many viewers took to Twitter to question whether the president's appearance was real, or if the video was generated by AI, but Biden shared the clip on his Twitter account Sunday afternoon.

     Aubrey Plaza Gave SNL Permission to Get Weird
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aubrey Plaza’s mischief as an intern began long before she played the sardonic April Ludgate on Parks and Recreation.
When Plaza took the stage last night to host SNL for the first time, she wasn’t lurking anymore.
During her opening monologue, she gave a fabricated tour of SNL Studio 8H, then joined three of the set designers she’d interned with all those years ago.
Read: Parks and Recreation’s Pawnee is the happiest place on televisionAnd pay homage SNL did.
The show leaned into it from the jump, delivering several sketches about weird characters prone to weirder behaviors that gave Plaza an opportunity to play with her talents.

     Summary: The “White Lotus” star was joined by her “Parks and Recreation” costar Amy Poehler during the live broadcast, who appeared during Plaza’s opening monologue and again for a spot during the Weekend Update segment.
Poehler played well-meaning boss Leslie Knope on the hit NBC comedy series that ran from 2009 until 2015.
Plaza played April Ludgate, an apathetic assistant to Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman).
During the Weekend Update skit, Plaza and Poehler came on to urge young people to get government jobs.
Other surprise guests included President Joe Biden, who chimed in during Plaza’s opening monologue as a fellow former resident of Delaware, and Sharon Stone.

On Update, Plaza reprised one of her most beloved roles: Here to comment on local government, Parks and Recreation's April Ludgate!
“Just ask my old boss, Leslie Knope.” As the 8H nation held its breath, Amy Poehler rolled up, complete with Knope’s signature crisp blazer and can-do attitude.
Like, could he comment on why Seth Meyers used to do Weekend Update alone and make it look so easy?
Did it seem like her longtime crush Joe Biden was looking directly at her during his earlier address?

     ‘SNL’: Sam Smith Recruits Kim Petras and Sharon Stone for Dramatic Performances of ‘Unholy’ and ‘Gloria’

     Summary: Sam Smith’s third stint as Saturday Night Live’s musical guest saw the singer perform “Unholy” and the title track off of Gloria, their upcoming fourth studio album, which is set to be released on Jan. 27.
For “Unholy,” Kim Petras, who features on the track, was on hand to sing her part of the hit song, emerging from beneath Smith’s extravagant pink skirt when her first verse arrived.
But Petras wasn’t the only surprise guest during Smith’s performance.
When it came time for them to perform “Gloria,” Sharon Stone made an unexpected appearance to help the singer debut the single.
The Oscar-nominated actress and the star of the Sidney Lumet-directed 1999 movie, Gloria, laid on a bed for most of the song while surrounded by a large choir.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: M3GAN SNLEarly this year we witnessed the birth of a new horror icon in the form of M3GAN, the killer android with killer dance moves that wowed both critics and audiences and seems destined to headline a franchise with multiple installments.
Well, SNL ran with that concept, dressing up a few of its cast members and host Aubrey Plaza as M3GANs for a 2.0 update of the concept, leaning into the fact that M3GAN has not just become a new horror icon, but a new gay horror icon.
I’m never quite sure how this happens (The Babadook is also a gay horror icon), but the idea is that this new theoretical M3GAN movie would embrace that honorific.
There are more M3GAN dances, and Aubrey Plaza’s M3GAN offers clubgoers poppers at one point.
You catch watch that below:Aubrey Plaza actually auditioned for and was rejected by SNL in the past, but my, my, how the turntables.

     Saturday Night Live Recap: Aubrey Plaza Is the Moment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many years, in viewers’ eyes, Aubrey Plaza was her Parks and Recreation character, April Ludgate.
Plaza has worked so steadily and accrued so much goodwill that her hosting SNL for the first time in 2023 feels bizarrely belated.
Unfortunately for him, that story did not involve having once worked as a page at Saturday Night Live, so Aubrey Plaza wins.
Now, Bowen Yang has joined their ranks since there was no way SNL could have possibly let the goofiest political story in recent months slip by unremarked upon.
Stray Observations• Turns out Aubrey Plaza was indeed voted the most famous person from Delaware back in 2018.
