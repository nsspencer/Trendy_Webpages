     The Cowboys Last Play Had Ezekiel Elliott Snapping The Ball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The final Cowboys drive served as a microcosm of their game, as poor decision-making and execution collided to send them out of the playoffs with a whimper.
I have watched this a number of times and I have yet to figure out what the plan was on this.
When Kavontae Turpin catches the ball, there is no one for him to pitch it to immediately.
There isn’t a good play to run needing a touchdown from your own 24, but I am confident in saying this is a bad play call for that situation.
At least the Cowboys gave us a laugh on their way out, although the Dallas faithful probably won’t see the humor in it all just yet.

     Cowboys’ Ezekiel Elliott Gets Obliterated On Ridiculous Final Play
    </h2>

     Summary: The Cowboys were running out of options by the time they called their final offensive play to potentially save their season.
As soon as the ball was snapped, Zeke got blasted by San Francisco 49ers linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair.
Unfortunately for Dallas, Pollard left Sunday’s loss against the Niners late in the second quarter with a fractured fibula.
Pollard left with a fractured foot, while Zeke left with a broken spirit.
I don’t have a crystal ball, but I want to be here,” Elliott said in a postgame interview.

49ers linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair shoved Elliott to the ground after the snap, rushing toward Prescott and forcing a quick throw.

     Mike McCarthy ends Cowboys season lining up Ezekiel Elliott at center
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So we kind of see what Mike McCarthy was going for with five seconds remaining in the Dallas Cowboys-San Francisco 49ers NFC Divisional Playoff game on Sunday evening.
And it appears they wisely chose “blow up Zeke Elliott ASAP, then kill the man with the ball.”Someone will have to ask McCarthy what exactly he was going for here.
And there are no good options to get more than 70 yards in one play when the defense only has to keep that exact thing from happening.
But it makes for one heckuva of a capper on the Cowboys 2022 season, and yet another playoff failure for America’s Team.
The Philadelphia Eagles open as 2.5-point favorites over the 49ers in the NFC Championship game at DraftKings Sportsbook.

     Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy declines to elaborate on bizarre final play in loss to 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones appeared to understand the significance of Dallas' failures in the penultimate drive.
On the first play of their final series, Prescott rolled out on a slow-developing pass play well into his own end zone -- and he nearly was taken down for a game-ending safety.
Prescott managed to duck a pass rusher in the end zone, but he threw incomplete to Schultz, setting a tone for the drive.
Even though Schultz went out of bounds, he was knocked backward when he crossed the line.
That's when the final play served as a culmination of the Cowboys' poor execution down the stretch.

     Summary: Bizarre final Cowboys play gets Ezekiel Elliott trucked: Was it his last with Dallas?
The Dallas Cowboys were forced to desperate measures at the end of Sunday's 19-12 playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers.
And they spelled an unceremonious end to Ezekiel Elliott's season in what could be his final game in a Cowboys uniform.
Was the play also the end of Elliott's Cowboys career?
If that's the case, his final play with the Cowboys is one to forget.
