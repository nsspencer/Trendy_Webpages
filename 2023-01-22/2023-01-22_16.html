These days of leftover, light, scattered snow showers will not have the same impact hazard-wise as the winter storm.

     Summary: ST. LOUIS – A Winter Storm Watch now covers metro St. Louis for Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, with the possibility of heavy snow of 4 or more inches.
In St. Louis, for forecasting heavy snow, we have what is called the “Memphis Low” benchmark.
Simply put, most of our heavy snow events feature a surface low pressure center that passes over or very near Memphis, Tennessee.
The current forecast shows a nearly ideal Memphis Low track, taking the surface low pressure from southeast Arkansas up over the Memphis metro area, and then up to the southwest tip of Indiana.
The 5,000-foot reflection (850 mb low) of the surface low pressure is forecast to pass very near Cape Girardeau.
