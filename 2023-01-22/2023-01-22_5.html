    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo Officially Confirmed As Al Nassr Captain Ahead Of Saudi Pro League DebutCristiano Ronaldo will begin his Saudi Pro League career wearing the Al Nassr captain's armband.
Al Nassr had previously been captained by 29-year-old defender Abdullah Madu.
Mecca-born Madu has been an Al Nassr player since 2012.
Madu and Ronaldo were both named in the Al Nassr starting XI for Sunday's league game against Ettifaq.
That game came just three days after Ronaldo had captained a Riyadh all-star XI in a 5-4 loss to Paris Saint-Germain.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Nassr-Ettifaq: match reportCristiano Ronaldo was handed a debut for Al Nassr against Ettifaq on Sunday as the veteran striker made his first Saudi Pro League appearance.
His debut for Al Nassr was delayed as 37-year-old Ronaldo served a two-match ban imposed by the English Football Association for an incident that saw him slap a phone from the hand of a young Everton supporter in a game at Goodison Park last season.
Ronaldo was handed the captain's armband, having already featured for a Riyadh All-Stars team – scoring twice – against Lionel Messi's Paris Saint-Germain this week.
The striker from Madeira enjoyed a winning start as his Al Nassr side overcame a gritty Ettifaq in a game which started brightly but lost its spark as the contest unfolded.
Cristiano showed flashes but was well marshalled by the 'Commandos' from Dammam.

     Al Nassr vs. Al Ittifaq
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo's first game for Al Nassr ends in a 1-0 win over Al Ittifaq in the Saudi Pro League.
Al Nassr moved back to the top of the Saudi Pro League, a point above of Riyadh rivals Al Hilal, thanks to Anderson Talisca's first-half header.
The 37-year-old's debut for Al Nassr was delayed after serving a two-match suspension handed down by the English FA for an incident during his spell at Manchester United.
His contract at Old Trafford was terminated in December after giving a controversial interview to Piers Morgan before signing a two-and-a-half-year deal with Al Nassr worth $200 million per year.
Al Nassr are next in action in the Saudi Super Cup against Al Ittihad on Thursday.

     Ronaldo makes Saudi league debut for Al Nassr, doesn't score

     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareRIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score in his Saudi Pro League debut for Al Nassr, but his presence electrified fans at King Saud University Stadium as the team beat Ettifaq 1-0 to retake first place on Sunday.
Al Nassr, which has played 14 games, moved a point ahead of defending champion Al Hilal, which has played a game more.
On Thursday, Ronaldo played for a combined XI from Al Nassr and Al Hilal in an exhibition game against a Paris Saint-Germain team featuring old foe Lionel Messi.
Al Nassr president Musalli Almuammar would not confirm the figures in Ronaldo’s two-and-a-half-year contract but said the 37-year-old deserves to be the highest paid player on the planet.
Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund owns Premier League team Newcastle, and the country is considering a bid to host the 2030 World Cup.
