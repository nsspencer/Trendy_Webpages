     HBO's 'The Last of Us' Episode 2 Makes Major Changes to the Game's Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us episode 2 landed on HBO Max on Sunday, and it saw Ellie, Tess and Joel taking the first steps of their dark journey across the US.
In contrast, episode 2's opening flashback reveals how the Cordyceps fungus brought the world to ruin in 2003.
In the game, Cordyceps spreads via spores -- Mazin told ComicBook.com that they changed it for the show to avoid having characters wearing gas masks all the time.
The show, however, sees a horde of infected descend on the Capitol Building, and Tess stays behind to cover Joel and Ellie's escape.
Ellie and Joel witness the blast from outside, and a quietly devastated Joel walks away.

     The Last of Us | Episode 2 review: The Infected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In episode 2, Joel, Tess and Ellie continue their journey and face off against the deadly Clickers.
Spoiler alert: These reviews will include spoilers for each episode, so if you’d rather go in cold, we recommend you return to this review after watching the latest episode.
Even scarier is that the police are unable to tell who was the first person infected or what infected them.
The second episode, titled ‘Infected’ does give us a lot more action involving the infected.
Here, Tess is killed by the infected rather than soldiers like in the original game and we believe episode 3 will bring the biggest changes of all.

     The Last of Us Episode 2 is a Thrilling, Nightmarish Glimpse at How a Pandemic Starts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a very promising debut episode, The Last of Us is shaping up to be the best video game adaptation we've ever seen.
When we left off last week, Joel, Ellie, and his smuggling partner, Tess (Anna Torv), are now off the grid.
They escaped the QZ, a quarantine zone run by Fedra (the Federal Disaster Response Agency), where uninfected survivors are kept as prisoners.
A cool rebel group exists there, named the Fireflies, but we're now long gone from that place.
As we saw in the debut episode, he has some daughter issues to deal with, too.

     The Last of Us episode 2: Tess's death and the zombie kiss, explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here’s how showrunner Craig Mazin explained the change to Elise Favis, my former colleague, who recently interviewed him for The Washington Post.
If the open city is really, really dangerous, it seems like they’re really going way, way out of their way to find Tess and Joel.
There’s the kiss of Judas, the kiss of death, “Kiss from a Rose.” Remember “Cat Person?” Kisses can be tender, wet, bad, sloppy, bored.
The zombie kiss is a grotesque inversion of what Tess seemed to want very badly from Joel: intimacy, closeness, oneness.
The whole episode is about their dynamic, and how Tess and Joel differ in their relation to Ellie.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Episode 2 Recap: A Death in the Family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This post contains spoilers for “Infected,” the second episode of HBO’s The Last of Us.
As with the John Hannah prologue in the premiere, there’s some value to offering context to all the gory, scary things we witness Joel, Ellie and Tess experience in 2023.
But perhaps the most important thing the episode does is to make sure we see Ellie as a person first, rather than a walking vaccine incubator.
But it also means that when Tess kills herself to protect them, it shakes her in a way it doesn’t Joel.
