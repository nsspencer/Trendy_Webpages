     Summary: Of course, Tess went out with a bang.
And, of course, her final words changed the destiny of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey).
Though the words remain unspoken, her meaning is clear: she would like to die surrounded by her loved ones.
“Please say yes, Joel.” Those five all-important words Of course this emotional goodbye is going to be cut short by a hoard of Infected rushing hungrily towards them all, eh?
With those five little words, she’s advising Joel to do as much good as he can with the hand he’s been dealt – and, perhaps, to be a little bit selfish sometimes.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The following story contains spoilers for The Last of Us Season 1 Episode 2.
The majority of this episode takes place in the present 2023 timeline, and it seems like most of the series going forward will do so.
Putting this sequence at the start of the episode really hammers home the fact that we're not losing monsters, but people.
The long way is now also the impossible way.
Joel and Ellie have to go; Ellie doesn't want to leave her, but Joel knows what he has to do.
