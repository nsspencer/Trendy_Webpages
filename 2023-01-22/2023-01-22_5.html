     George Kittle Just Made an INCREDIBLE One-Handed Catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a defensive battle like this, it takes one play to change the trajectory of things.
This incredible scramble drill catch by George Kittle could be that play.
That‚Äôs a scramble drill play, and Kittle was barely ready for it!
Despite clearly being caught off guard, Kittle made a fantastic catch, and the 49ers are humming along with the ball in the red zone at the end of the third quarter.
If San Francisco wins, I‚Äôm willing to bet this is one of those plays we look back on as a game-changer.

     George Kittle gave touchdown ball to 49ers legend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George Kittle gave touchdown ball to 49ers legendGeorge Kittle hooked up a 49ers legend with a touchdown ball on Sunday.
Christian McCaffrey rushed for a 2-yard touchdown on a 2nd-and-goal play to start the fourth quarter of the San Francisco 49ers‚Äô NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys.
McCaffrey spiked the ball after his touchdown, and Kittle caught the ball after it bounced off the ground.
Not only did Kittle joke around by pretending to call for a fair catch, but he also flipped the touchdown ball to Jerry Rice, who was behind the end zone.
In addition to getting the touchdown ball, Rice also drew attention for the great pendant he had hanging from the chain around his neck.
