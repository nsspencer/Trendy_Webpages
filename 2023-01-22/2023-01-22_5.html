     Biden makes surprise video appearance on 'SNL,' joining host Aubrey Plaza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 15, 2022.
President Joe Biden made a surprise video appearance on "Saturday Night Live" during first-time host Aubrey Plaza's monologue.
The "White Lotus" star, who, like Biden, is from Delaware, joked that she was voted the most famous person from the state, beating out the president.
Biden then appeared via video and said, "Aubrey, you're the most famous person out of Delaware and there's no question about that.
Many viewers took to Twitter to question whether the president's appearance was real, or if the video was generated by AI, but Biden shared the clip on his Twitter account Sunday afternoon.

     ‘Saturday Night Live’ targets George Santos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Saturday Night Live” targeted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) in its opening sketch this weekend, roasting the embattled lawmaker over his embellished résumé and recent controversies.
The skit featured Santos, played by Bowen Yang, as an NFL sideline reporter covering Saturday’s Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants playoff game for Fox.
The hosts joked that Santos was the first player in NFL history to lead the league in passing and rushing yards at the same time.
“I am proud to be the first African American quarterback to ever dunk a football,” the fake Santos said.
Sue me for having a life,” Santos said to reporters at an airport when asked about the claim on Saturday.

     Summary: The Weekend Update segment alone would’ve rendered the episode the best of the season even if the rest of the show had stuck to pat Joe Biden impressions.
On Update, Plaza reprised one of her most beloved roles: Here to comment on local government, Parks and Recreation's April Ludgate!
“Just ask my old boss, Leslie Knope.” As the 8H nation held its breath, Amy Poehler rolled up, complete with Knope’s signature crisp blazer and can-do attitude.
Like, could he comment on why Seth Meyers used to do Weekend Update alone and make it look so easy?
Did it seem like her longtime crush Joe Biden was looking directly at her during his earlier address?

     Summary: The “White Lotus” star was joined by her “Parks and Recreation” costar Amy Poehler during the live broadcast, who appeared during Plaza’s opening monologue and again for a spot during the Weekend Update segment.

     Summary: Aubrey Plaza’s mischief as an intern began long before she played the sardonic April Ludgate on Parks and Recreation.
When Plaza took the stage last night to host SNL for the first time, she wasn’t lurking anymore.
During her opening monologue, she gave a fabricated tour of SNL Studio 8H, then joined three of the set designers she’d interned with all those years ago.

The show leaned into it from the jump, delivering several sketches about weird characters prone to weirder behaviors that gave Plaza an opportunity to play with her talents.

     SNL roasts the Fox NFL Sunday team with a hilarious satirical broadcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the NFL playoffs in full swing, everyone’s talking football the past few weeks – including Saturday Night Live.
In this week’s episode, the show opened with a satirical broadcast recapping this weekend’s Division Round playoff game between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles with members of the SNL cast each portraying a different member of the Fox NFL Sunday team.
SNL even satirized Fox’s iconic Cleatus the Football Robot mascot, making him speak with “AI technology” to question the sport’s safety.
1 overall pick, and “the first African American quarterback to ever dunk a football.”The Saturday Night Live team then returned to the studio to revisit their “pregame predictions” that went hilariously awry.
All in all, it was an excellent satirization of a program and characters football fans know all too well.

     Saturday Night Live Recap: Aubrey Plaza is The Moment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many years, in viewers’ eyes, Aubrey Plaza was her Parks and Recreation character, April Ludgate.
Unfortunately for him, that story did not involve having once worked as a page at Saturday Night Live, so Aubrey Plaza wins.
Now, Bowen Yang has joined their ranks since there was no way SNL could have possibly let the goofiest political story in recent months slip by unremarked upon.
Stray Observations• Turns out Aubrey Plaza was indeed voted the most famous person from Delaware back in 2018.
• Meet-cutes seldom involve being on ketamine, parole and fire, so congratulations to the game night newbie couple played by Plaza and Mikey Day for breaking new ground.
