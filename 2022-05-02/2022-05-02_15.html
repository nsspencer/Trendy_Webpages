     How exactly did Dwayne Johnson become the highest-paid actor in Hollywood?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When you really consider and break down the modern legacy of Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson, it‚Äôs difficult to comprehend just how he became such an industry icon.
Astute and intelligent, Johnson had a rounded view of his career from his 20s, further explaining, ‚ÄúI wanted to have a real, long-lasting career that had weight and had value.
Even still, Johnson recognised that to be the best, he must integrate himself with modern media through more ways than just cinema, with his modern career littered with countless cameos and TV appearances.
Through such steely determination and effort, Johnson eventually achieved his adolescent dream in 2020, becoming the highest-paid Hollywood actor for two years in a row, thanks to his newfound success in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise among other successes.
If the career of this towering Hollywood superstar tells us anything it‚Äôs that Johnson was never trying to become a traditional industry actor, he was trying to become an internationally-recognised brand.
