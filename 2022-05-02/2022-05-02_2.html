     Summary: Hence them dropping the full trailer for the film on this Monday morning, which is about a Manhattan Project-like company town and the strange things that happen in there.

The 1950’s societal optimism espoused by their CEO, Frank (Pine) — equal partscorporate visionary and motivational life coach — anchors every aspect of daily life in the tight-knit desert utopia.
Life is perfect, with every resident’s needs met by the company.
All they ask in returnis discretion and unquestioning commitment to the Victory cause.
