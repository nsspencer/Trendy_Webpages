     Report: Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign with Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, safety Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign with the Saints and the deal should be finalized in the coming days.
When the Saints did not address safety during the draft, it left a void for Mathieu to fill.
It’s also a better time for the Saints to sign Mathieu because as of 4 p.m.
He started 16 games in 2021, recording 76 total tackles, three interceptions, six passes defensed, and three fumble recoveries.
A third-round pick in the 2013 draft, Mathieu has 26 career interceptions and 76 passes defensed.

     Saints Expected to Sign Tyrann Mathieu, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Veteran safety Tyrann Mathieu will sign with the Saints in the coming days, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
The momentum for a deal between New Orleans and the two-time All-Pro safety gained steam prior to the NFL draft, and the contract was reached as anticipated on Monday.
Mathieu initially visited New Orleans in April and also had a visit with Philadelphia.
However, once a deal was not reached with either of the two clubs, it remained a mystery where Mathieu would play in 2022.

     KC Chiefs unofficially close door on any Tyrann Mathieu reunion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - SEPTEMBER 19: Tyrann Mathieu #32 of the Kansas City Chiefs runs off the field at halftime against the Baltimore Ravens at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on September 19, 2021 in Baltimore, Maryland.
(Photo by Todd Olszewski/Getty Images)They say “never say never”, but at this point, the idea of any sort of reunion between the Kansas City Chiefs and star safety Tyrann Mathieu is off the table.
The Chiefs just came through draft weekend with a startling investment into the team’s secondary, including two new safeties in the rookie class of 10 picks.
With a draft class that includes heavy investment at safety, the door is now unofficially closed on any Tyrann Mathieu reunion in Kansas City.
The Chiefs already replaced Mathieu with a swift move in free agency by signing former Houston Texans safety Justin Reid to a three-year contract.

     Saints expected to sign Tyrann Mathieu, filling hole in secondary with Pro Bowl safety, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pro Bowl safety is expected to sign with the New Orleans Saints in the coming days, according to the NFL Network.
The reason Mathieu may not immediately be signing with the Saints is due to the compensatory pick formula, which is set to expire at 4 p.m.
Mathieu has spent the last three seasons in the NFL as a cornerstone piece to the Kansas City Chiefs defense.
This offseason, the Chiefs elected to move on from Mathieu and sign fellow safety Justin Reid to a three-year, $31.5 million contract.
So, with this move back home to New Orleans, Mathieu's football career is set to come full circle.

     Saints expected to sign All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three-time All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign with the New Orleans Saints, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday, per a source.
A New Orleans native, Mathieu also played his college ball at LSU.
The sixth-ranked free agent on NFL.com's top 101 list, Mathieu bided his time before settling in with the Saints days after the team bypassed the safety position in the draft.
Rapoport adds that the Saints were always the favorite to land Mathieu, who also met virtually with the Eagles.
Heading into his 10th NFL season, Mathieu adds even more leadership to a veteran-heavy Saints defense.
