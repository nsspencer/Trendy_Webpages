     Interim manager Ralf Rangnick writes positively about the future of Man Utd

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “This season has clearly been a very difficult one for everyone at the club, and from the short time I have been here I can see how much everyone is hurting,” says Rangnick in his notes.
“There have been some good moments, but we never built enough positive momentum to allow our confidence to increase and ultimately we were unable to rescue the season.
“I want to be clear, though: this is not the fall of Manchester United; this is a stumble along the way and, when you stumble, you have to think quickly and clearly to regain your balance so you can carry on moving forward.
“That is the position we are in as a club and if we have clarity in our actions from now on, we can make some big steps in the right direction.

     How Manchester United beat Brentford in the Premier League tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo starred as Manchester United ended a disappointing home season with a comfortable 3-0 win over Brentford in their final game at Old Trafford.
Bruno Fernandes volleyed United ahead in the ninth minute after excellent work from Diogo Dalot and Anthony Elanga, and for the first time in a while the United players looked like they were enjoying themselves.
Ronaldo produced a number of extravagant flicks before having a goal disallowed for offside on the stroke of half-time.
He got his 18th league goal of the season in the 61st minute, smashing home a penalty after he was clumsily fouled by Rico Henry.
The French defender Raphael Varane then volleyed his first goal for the club to make it 3-0.

     Summary: Shaka Hislop discusses if Monday's win over Brentford was Cristiano Ronaldo's last game at Old Trafford with Manchester United.
(1:06)Manchester United beat Brentford 3-0 on a rainy Monday night at Old Trafford with Portugal internationals Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo scoring to keep their team in sixth place in the Premier League.
"The last game of the season at home, we wanted a good result and a good performance," United captain Fernandes said after scoring his 50th goal for the club.

Brentford have 40 points from 35 games and may need one more win to ensure they not dragged into a relegation fight.

     Manchester United vs. Brentford score: United get three points, but issues linger for Red Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a two-minute span, Manchester United fullback Diogo Dalot perfectly encapsulated what the 2021-22 campaign has been like for the Red Devils -- full of miscues.
Had it been a game of darts, he would have missed the board … and the wall from which it hangs.
This is Manchester United, a giant in world soccer, reduced to an average team and a fan base holding onto past memories of dominance.
When the 74th minute came, those holding the sign were still there, failing to even do what they set out to.
Throughout this season, the team has not managed to gel, and Monday was no different.

     Summary: OLD TRAFFORD, MANCHESTER — Cristiano Ronaldo dispatched his 18th Premier League goal of the season from the penalty spot as Manchester United lifted some of the gloom around Old Trafford with a 3-0 win over Brentford.
Manchester United vs. Brentford highlights and commentaryFulltime: A satisfactory goodbye to Old Trafford for Matic, Mata, Rangnick and, who knows, maybe a few others.
64th minute: Ronaldo really is revelling in this now and ducks in from the left wing, just like the old days.
36th minute: United have another free-kick in a dangerous position, with Christian Norgaard the offender on Fernandes this time.
