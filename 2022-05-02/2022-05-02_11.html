     How the Rangers Got Back to the N.H.L. Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark Reiss has been a Rangers season-ticket holder since 2001, perched high in the blue seats with his two sons, who grew from toddlers to adults under the iconic Madison Square Garden ceiling.
For two decades, they watched their team fail to make the N.H.L.
playoffs almost as often as it qualified, and then, on Feb. 8, 2018, they received the famous email from Rangers management.
Their team, rooted in the heart of Manhattan and able to deploy more financial muscle than any other team in hockey, was rebuilding for the future.
After four years with no playoff games to attend, Reiss, his younger son, Matteo, and thousands more loyal Rangers fans like them will fill the Garden on Tuesday for the first home playoff game there since the Letter.

They pumped 14 pucks on Antti Raanta, who was making his first career postseason start.
They had their chances, from Craig Smith off the rush to Derek Forbort in the high slot to four shots on an opening power play.
“It is a team that, if you have the lead on, it’s an easier game for us,” coach Bruce Cassidy said.
“If they get the lead, they play better when they have it.

(For what it’s worth, only 22 percent of goals in last year’s playoffs were scored by teams with a man advantage.)
Goaltending is notoriously fickle in the NHL: Since 2005-06, the correlation between a team’s regular-season and playoff save percentage is just 0.26.
It’s another reminder of just how chaotic the NHL playoffs are — and how entertaining the next two months promise to be.
