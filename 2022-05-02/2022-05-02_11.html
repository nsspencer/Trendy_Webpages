     Summary: A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S., November 26, 2021.
The Supreme Court and the White House declined to comment.
read moreThe Roe v. Wade decision recognized that the right to personal privacy under the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy.
The Supreme Court in a 1992 ruling called Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed abortion rights and prohibited laws imposing an "undue burden" on abortion access.
Republicans could try to enact a nationwide abortion ban, while Democrats could also seek to protect abortion rights at the national level.

     Supreme Court Draft Decision Would Strike Down Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An initial draft opinion obtained by Politico shows that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court is moving toward striking down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the right to an abortion.
The draft decision itself goes far beyond just upholding the Mississippi law; it would completely overturn the most essential abortion rights established in Roe and later affirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
The draft decision rails against abortion in no uncertain terms.
But one thing seemed clear Monday night: Whoever leaked the draft decision intended to influence the private deliberations.
A number of GOP lawmakers who claim to support abortion rights voted for Trump’s Supreme Court picks seemingly under the assumption that those justices would not strike down abortion.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment or make another representative of the court available to answer questions about the draft document.
POLITICO received a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court’s proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document.
The draft opinion runs 98 pages, including a 31-page appendix of historical state abortion laws.
At times, Alito’s draft opinion takes an almost mocking tone as it skewers the majority opinion in Roe, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, a Richard Nixon appointee who died in 1999.
Alito’s draft opinion ventures even further into this racially sensitive territory by observing in a footnote that some early proponents of abortion rights also had unsavory views in favor of eugenics.

     Supreme Court Live Updates: Leaked Draft Would Overturn Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision along the lines of the one in the leaked Supreme Court draft could open new political battles over abortion.
In the draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a majority of the court voted to overturn Roe, according to Politico.
If the court embraces Justice Alito’s draft opinion as its final position, it would clear the way for those bills to quickly become law.
If the draft opinion or something like it is ultimately issued, it will produce rifts at the court that could test its legitimacy.
“How will the court survive?”The leak of the draft opinion sent a jolt through Washington Monday night.

     Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .
According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.
After that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion.
Former President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe "automatically."
