    </h2>

     Summary: The Wild traded for goalie Marc-Andre Fleury at the NHL Trade Deadline in March for a reason.
That reason is here with Monday night’s Game 1 vs. St. Louis in St. Paul.
Post-practice, head coach Dean Evason evaded confirming that Fleury is his starter, but also didn’t deny.
Fleury has 90 career playoff wins, and has won three Stanley Cups.
The Wild set a franchise record with 53 wins and 113 points, while finishing third in the NHL with a 31-8-2 home record.

     St. Louis Smothers Wild In Playoff Opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. PAUL, MN (AP) — David Perron was quarantined in his basement last year, listening to his kids run around upstairs and watching the St. Louis Blues get swept out of the first round.
“It’s been a long way coming,” said Perron, who’s on his third stint with St. Louis and posted the 14th three-goal game in franchise history.
Particularly on the power play, having led the league with a 29.4% scoring rate in 41 road games this season.
That’ll give us a lot of positivity going forward.”Game 2 is here Wednesday night before the series shifts south to St. Louis.
For the first game, at least, the inexperience once again didn’t matter in the St. Louis net.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We had great opportunities 5-on-5 and on the power play as well.
Perron scored twice on the power play, once mere moments after a power play expired and also assisted on O'Reilly's even-strength marker in the first period, accounting for more than enough offensive support for Husso in this one.
"It seems like every puck on the power play just ended up on his stick, back door there.
St. Louis' were ranked at the top, including a power play that finished the year second-best in the NHL and a road power play that was best on the circuit.
Minnesota, meanwhile, went 0-for-3 on the power play in the first period, which set a bad precedent for the evening.
