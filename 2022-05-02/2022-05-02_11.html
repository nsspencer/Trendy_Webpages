     Jordan Poole Has Already Earned His Warriors Extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one season, Jordan Poole has gone from role player to a present and future core piece of the Warriors’ bid to reestablish their dynasty status.
Golden State ($179M) has the highest payroll in the NBA and a league-high $170.3 million luxury tax bill.
The Warriors can delay the extension and make him a restricted free agent during the summer of 2023, but that would put them in risky territory.
Other teams with more cap space would be able to put down an offer sheet that Golden State might not be able to match.
The Warriors will have roughly $11 million in cap space if they pass on an extension this summer — which will give them more flexibility to sign Poole for the right price and duration.

     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Joe Rondone-USA TODAY SportsThe Golden State Warriors came out on top in Game 1 117-116, and it was partially on the back of Gary Payton II.
No, Payton II didn’t lead the team in scoring, that was third-year guard Jordan Poole.
The Golden State Warriors put shooting guard Gary Payton II in the starting lineup, and his performance did not disappoint.
It felt like every key play that changed the potential outcome of the game Payton II had an impact on.
Expect to see Payton II, who typically is given the Morant assignment, back in the starting lineup for Game 2!

     Warriors news: Jordan Poole can't contain excitement over making doubters 'eat their words'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors took Game 1 against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday in thrilling fashion, winning 117-116 despite Draymond Green getting ejected in the first half.
Once again, youngster Jordan Poole proved to be a huge factor in the outcome as he continues to show out in these playoffs.
The guard went off for a team-high 31 points off the bench while going 5 for 10 from downtown.
Many believed he wasn’t the right fit for the Warriors because of his poor shot selection, sub-par passing, and lack of handles.
His name is Jordan Poole.

     Damian Lillard Says Jordan Poole Is Max-Level Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY SportsIn his third season in the league, Jordan Poole earned a little over $2 million in 76 games played.
Poole wasn't a part of the original Golden State core that won those titles a few years back.
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Jordan Poole are the best offensive trio in the NBA," tweeted Kevin O'Connor.
In Round 1, Golden State handled Denver pretty easily, and Poole had a couple of excellent games.
Regardless, Jordan Poole has emerged as a high-impact player in this league, and when it's time to negotiate a new contract, there is no doubt he will net some serious earnings.

     Summary: National Basketball Association How Warriors' Jordan Poole became key complement to Splash Brothers 20 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkBy Ric BucherFOX Sports NBA WriterThis time, Jordan Poole didn’t need to shoot with the lights off to shoot the lights out.
What makes Jordan Poole and Warriors stand out NBA writer Ethan Strauss joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Jordan Poole's impact and what makes the Golden State Warriors unique across the league.
The Nuggets paid Poole the ultimate compliment by shifting their attention to him in Games 4 and 5.
Head coach Steve Kerr's giving him the same green light afforded Curry and Thompson, Poole said, inspired him not to abuse it.
At one point as he warmed up to face the Nuggets, Poole startled Mullin by bouncing the ball to him as he sat in his courtside seat.
