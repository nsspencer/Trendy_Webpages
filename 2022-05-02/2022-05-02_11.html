     Summary: Amazon’s (NYSE: AMZN) stock has plummeted 26% since the beginning of 2022 after the company’s retailing and advertising revenues fell short of expectations.
On Monday, May 2, Wedbush removed Amazon from its best ideas list due to investment price discipline.
AMZN charts and analysisAfter Wedbush removed the stock from their list, the shares fell by roughly 1.5% in premarket trading.
Only recently did an analyst give Amazon shares a sell rating.

It was expected that Amazon would be able to leverage its titanic size and Prime benefits to mitigate this issue.
Well, only the future can tell whether Amazon bulls were brave or ignorant, and whether bears were cowards or correct.

     Why Amazon Stock Is Falling Again Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Investors were dumping Amazon's stock this morning for several reasons, including fears of an upcoming interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, negative sentiment toward the stock following the company's recent quarterly financial results, and the fact Wedbush analysts removed the stock from their "Best Ideas List."
The stock was down by as much as 4.8% this morning and had fallen 1.9% as of 10:40 a.m.
So whatInvestors were already in a sour mood over the past couple of trading days after Amazon reported decelerating revenue growth in its first quarter.
The broader stock market has been unstable lately as investors worry about rising inflation and the U.S. economy.
Amazon will likely still be a good long-term investment, but with the Fed focused on taming inflation and the company dealing with rising costs and slowing sales, Amazon investors will need to be patient during this turbulent time.

     Why Amazon Stock Plummeted 24% Last Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon published Q1 results after the market closed on April 28, delivering results that came in significantly worse than expected.
The company posted a loss per share of $7.56 on revenue of $116.4 billion.
Sales for the period fell just short of the average analyst estimate, but the average analyst estimate had actually targeted per-share earnings of $8.36 for the period.
This target came in significantly below the $125.17 billion in revenue called for by the previous average analyst estimate.
With shares down roughly 35% from the high they hit last year, Amazon stock looks like a strong buy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite a firm Wall Street defense, Amazon (AMZN)'s stock is still under a good deal of pressure following a disappointing first-quarter performance and outlook for the second quarter.
That Friday sell-off in Amazon erased a startling $20.5 billion in net worth for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to Bloomberg data.
Amid the pressure on Amazon's stock, Bezos has been his seen his net worth decline by $44 billion to $148 billion.
In many respects, the pullback in Amazon's stock is unsurprising given the earnings day commentary from management after the company's Q1 report missed analyst profit forecasts.
REUTERS/Pascal RossignolWall Street stayed bullish on Amazon's stock, but acknowledged the weak quarter by pulling down their financial estimates and price targets on shares.
