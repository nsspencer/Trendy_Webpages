     Summary: PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — One in five U.S. adults experience mental illness each year, and an estimated 178,000 Rhode Island adults have a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
“Very oftentimes, people don’t report or speak about the mental health struggles that they are experiencing, due to stigma.
Lamarre said the newest fact sheet with data on mental health in Rhode Island will be available in the coming weeks.
The groups are peer-led and for people or family experiencing mental health conditions themselves, or supporting someone with a mental health condition.
When celebrities or well-known figures in the community open up about mental health, Lamarre said it can encourage others to do the same and seek help.
