    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “This season has clearly been a very difficult one for everyone at the club, and from the short time I have been here I can see how much everyone is hurting,” says Rangnick in his notes.
“There have been some good moments, but we never built enough positive momentum to allow our confidence to increase and ultimately we were unable to rescue the season.
“I want to be clear, though: this is not the fall of Manchester United; this is a stumble along the way and, when you stumble, you have to think quickly and clearly to regain your balance so you can carry on moving forward.
“That is the position we are in as a club and if we have clarity in our actions from now on, we can make some big steps in the right direction.

     Report: Manchester United Could Resign Memphis Depay Due to Erik Ten Hag Demand
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United could potentially resign former player Memphis Depay this summer due to a demand apparently made by new manager Erik Ten Hag according to a report.
Depay didn't hit the ground running for United and had a reasonably disappointing time at United before departing to French side Lyon in 2017.
The Dutch attacker can play in a range of positions in the frontline and that is the reason that Ten Hag supposedly wants to sign the player.
IMAGO / NurPhotoAccording to football outlet Futbol Total on Twitter, "In the last meeting with United, Ten Hag asked for the signing of Memphis.

     How Manchester United beat Brentford in the Premier League tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo starred as Manchester United ended a disappointing home season with a comfortable 3-0 win over Brentford in their final game at Old Trafford.
Bruno Fernandes volleyed United ahead in the ninth minute after excellent work from Diogo Dalot and Anthony Elanga, and for the first time in a while the United players looked like they were enjoying themselves.
Ronaldo produced a number of extravagant flicks before having a goal disallowed for offside on the stroke of half-time.
He got his 18th league goal of the season in the 61st minute, smashing home a penalty after he was clumsily fouled by Rico Henry.
The French defender Raphael Varane then volleyed his first goal for the club to make it 3-0.

     Summary: Diogo Dalot has revealed his Manchester United team-mates are looking forward to working under incoming manager Erik ten Hag.
Ten Hag will take up the reins at Old Trafford on a permanent basis in the summer after Manchester United decided to appoint the Dutchman ahead of Mauricio Pochettino.
Ralf Rangnick has managed United on a temporary basis since the start of December following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking in the winter.
Speaking to Sky Sports, Dalot said: “I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he's a great manager.
“He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well.

     Summary: Alex TellesWith Luke Shaw seemingly out for the rest of the season, Telles will likely start again in his place.
Victor LindelofOne of United's most consistent players this season, the Swede should start in place of Maguire, assuming the captain is still injured.
Diogo DalotThe Portuguese international has enjoyed his first season as United's first choice right-back, at least since the arrival of the current boss.
If he doesn't start due to fitness precautions, the team could use his energy off the bench in most situations.
Anthony ElangaThe 19 year-old has had a breakout season this year, and with the absence of Jadon Sancho, should start again.
