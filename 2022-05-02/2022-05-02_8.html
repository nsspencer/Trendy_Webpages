     Amazon shares down 1.5% premarket after Wedbush removes stock from Best Ideas List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com Inc. shares AMZN, +0.18% fell 1.5% in premarket trade Monday, after the stock was removed from Wedbush's Best Ideas List.
"We are removing Amazon from the BIL due to our investment price discipline," the firm said in a short statement.
The move comes after Amazon shares suffered their worst day in more than 15 years Friday, after the e-commerce and tech giant reported its first quarterly loss in seven years.
After the surprising loss and forecast reduction, Wall Street analysts were downbeat in their assessment, including multiple price-target cuts.
Amazon shares are down 25% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX, +0.57% has fallen 13.3%.

     Amazon.com Stock Extends Losses After Wedbush Bear Note
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wedbush removed Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its Best Ideas List earlier, with the brokerage firm citing its "investment price discipline."
The e-tail stock saw its worst day since November 2008 on Friday, losing $206.41 billion in market cap following its first-quarter earnings report.
This market cap loss was the second-largest total for a single-day, behind Meta Platform's (FB) post-earnings drop.
In turn, Amazon.com stock was last seen down 2.9% to trade at $2,414.08, and is now set to close at roughly two-year lows.
This indicates options traders are operating with an unusual call-bias.

     Why Amazon Stock Is Falling Again Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Investors were dumping Amazon's stock this morning for several reasons, including fears of an upcoming interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, negative sentiment toward the stock following the company's recent quarterly financial results, and the fact Wedbush analysts removed the stock from their "Best Ideas List."
The stock was down by as much as 4.8% this morning and had fallen 1.9% as of 10:40 a.m.
So whatInvestors were already in a sour mood over the past couple of trading days after Amazon reported decelerating revenue growth in its first quarter.
The broader stock market has been unstable lately as investors worry about rising inflation and the U.S. economy.
Amazon will likely still be a good long-term investment, but with the Fed focused on taming inflation and the company dealing with rising costs and slowing sales, Amazon investors will need to be patient during this turbulent time.

     Amazon Stock: +34% to +55% Upside Potential Following Friday's Collapse?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By David WagnerInvesting.com -- Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ: ) quarterly results released after the close of trading on Thursday shocked investors, resulting in a nearly 15% plunge in the stock during Friday's session.
At $2,485 at last week's close, Amazon's share price reached a level not seen for almost a year.
This was the first time in 4 years that Amazon made a quarterly loss.
This means that last week's results do not reflect a sharp fall in profitability, but rather factors that should no longer influence results in the coming quarters.
In addition, the average 12-month target for these analysts, at $3761, represents a potential upside of over 50% from Friday's closing price.
