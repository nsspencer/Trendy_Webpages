Unlike the two previous series, the Hurricanes have the home ice advantage.
This first-round matchup begins Monday night at PNC Arena, where the Hurricanes lost twice during the Bruins' 2019 Eastern Conference Final sweep.
The Bruins will have a full lineup after missing right winger David Pastrnak and defenseman Hampus Lindholm for a few weeks in April due to injuries.

     Boston Bruins 'not going to put anything' on goaltender Linus Ullmark after shaky playoff debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins were routed in Game 1 of their first-round series against the Carolina Hurricanes, 5-1, but coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't about to pin that on Linus Ullmark.
"I am not faulting our goaltender for this," Cassidy said Monday night.
The last goal ... he's going to tell you, it's not a great goal to give up, but by then it's 4-1.
Boston went 0-for-3 on the power play and could only generate one goal on 36 shots.
The Bruins lost all three meetings against the Hurricanes in the regular season and were outscored 16-1.

     Five Takeaways From Game 1 of Boston Bruins vs Carolina Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA - MAY 02: Trent Frederic #11 of the Boston Bruins battles Vincent Trocheck #16 of the Carolina Hurricanes for the puck during the first period of Game One of the First Round of the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs at PNC Arena on May 02, 2022 in Raleigh, North Carolina.
(Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images)The Boston Bruins fell 5-1 in the series opener against the Carolina Hurricanes.
The “what-aboutism” game is not one I like to play but the stakes are a lot higher during the postseason.
Going into Game 2, the Bruins need to focus on picking up the slack from game 1.
The post was probably enemy number one tonight for Boston as they rang the doorbell quite a few times.

     Recap: Close game gets away late as Bruins drop Game 1, 5-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins didn’t have much push-back left after that, other than one of the feeblest power play attempts of all time a few minutes later.
Game notesIt sounds pie-in-the-sky optimist to say this, but the game felt, for long stretches, closer than the final score indicates.
The power play the Bruins had in the third period was the perfect summary of their last 30-odd attempts.
It was an act of mercy to see that power play end.
Different power play units, different lines, a sub...something.
