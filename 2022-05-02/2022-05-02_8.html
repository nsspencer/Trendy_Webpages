     Bruins lines vs. Carolina: Ready to go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Bruins had some funky game-day rosters down the stretch, it appears that they’re heading into the postseason just as we’d all hoped: healthy.
Barring any last-minute surprises, the Bruins should be at full strength when Game 1 begins tonight, with Hampus Lindholm and David Pastrnak, among others, recovered enough from their late-season maladies to take the ice.
True, both of those guys made appearances in the last couple games, but it’s good to get confirmation with Game 1 looming.
The only real decisions for the B’s prior to the game are in goal and on defense, and Bruce Cassidy already made those decisions by naming Linus Ullmark the starter and noting that he’d be keeping Mike Reilly on the bench.
With a full complement of players available, here’s what to expect tonight:Brad Marchand - Patrice Bergeron - Jake DeBruskTaylor Hall - Erik Haula - David PastrnakTrent Frederic - Charlie Coyle - Craig SmithNick Foligno - Tomas Nosek - Curtis LazarHampus Lindholm - Charlie McAvoyMatt Grzelcyk - Brandon CarloDerek Forbort - Connor CliftonUllmark

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins were routed in Game 1 of their first-round series against the Carolina Hurricanes, 5-1, but coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't about to pin that on Linus Ullmark.
"I am not faulting our goaltender for this," Cassidy said Monday night.
The last goal ... he's going to tell you, it's not a great goal to give up, but by then it's 4-1.
Boston went 0-for-3 on the power play and could only generate one goal on 36 shots.
The Bruins lost all three meetings against the Hurricanes in the regular season and were outscored 16-1.

     Summary: The Bruins didn’t have much push-back left after that, other than one of the feeblest power play attempts of all time a few minutes later.
Game notesIt sounds pie-in-the-sky optimist to say this, but the game felt, for long stretches, closer than the final score indicates.
The power play the Bruins had in the third period was the perfect summary of their last 30-odd attempts.
It was an act of mercy to see that power play end.
Different power play units, different lines, a sub...something.
