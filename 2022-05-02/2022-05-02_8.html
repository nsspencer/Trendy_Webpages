     Boston Bruins 'not going to put anything' on goaltender Linus Ullmark after shaky playoff debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins were routed in Game 1 of their first-round series against the Carolina Hurricanes, 5-1, but coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't about to pin that on Linus Ullmark.
"I am not faulting our goaltender for this," Cassidy said Monday night.
The last goal ... he's going to tell you, it's not a great goal to give up, but by then it's 4-1.
Boston went 0-for-3 on the power play and could only generate one goal on 36 shots.
The Bruins lost all three meetings against the Hurricanes in the regular season and were outscored 16-1.

For the third time in the last four years, the Stanley Cup Playoffs will feature a series between the Boston Bruins and Carolina Hurricanes.

This first-round matchup begins Monday night at PNC Arena, where the Hurricanes lost twice during the Bruins' 2019 Eastern Conference Final sweep.
The Bruins will have a full lineup after missing right winger David Pastrnak and defenseman Hampus Lindholm for a few weeks in April due to injuries.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins didn’t have much push-back left after that, other than one of the feeblest power play attempts of all time a few minutes later.
Game notesIt sounds pie-in-the-sky optimist to say this, but the game felt, for long stretches, closer than the final score indicates.
The power play the Bruins had in the third period was the perfect summary of their last 30-odd attempts.
It was an act of mercy to see that power play end.
Different power play units, different lines, a sub...something.

     Summary: BOSTON, MA — The long grueling months of October to April, that is the National Hockey League season have concluded and the Stanley Cup playoffs have arrived.
In this year’s best-of-seven Stanley Cup playoff first-round, the Black and Gold will face off against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Carolina comes into the postseason with an expectation of their own and that is to win the Stanley Cup after posting a 54-20-8 record, good for 116 points.
On the surface, you might think Boston does not have a prayer of winning the series.
I think that’s the biggest thing and enjoy the ride.
