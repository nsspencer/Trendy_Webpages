     Recap: Close game gets away late as Bruins drop Game 1, 5-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins didn’t have much push-back left after that, other than one of the feeblest power play attempts of all time a few minutes later.
Game notesIt sounds pie-in-the-sky optimist to say this, but the game felt, for long stretches, closer than the final score indicates.
The power play the Bruins had in the third period was the perfect summary of their last 30-odd attempts.
It was an act of mercy to see that power play end.
Different power play units, different lines, a sub...something.

But the speedy Canes did not allow the Bruins another shot the remainder of the first.
Carolina's Seth Jarvis celebrates after scoring a second-period goal Monday night against the Bruins.
“If you’re standing in front, and the puck’s not arriving there, it’s pretty easy for them to push you out of the way,” said Taylor Hall, who had the lone Bruins goal.
But above all, it’s scoring, scoring, scoring.

     Summary: RALEIGH, N.C. -- Antti Raanta made 35 saves in his first Stanley Cup Playoff start, and the Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Boston Bruins 5-1 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference First Round at PNC Arena on Monday.
Raanta entered the game with five career relief appearances in the postseason, two with the Arizona Coyotes in 2020 and three with the New York Rangers in 2016.
"Then we got our game going a little bit in the second."
"[Raanta] is paid to play, too, and he did a good job and he held them in the game early on.
Boston swept Carolina in the 2018-19 Eastern Conference Final and won in five games in the first round in 2019-20.
