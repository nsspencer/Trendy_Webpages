     Rapoport: Saints Signing S Tyrann Mathieu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We have one final update on Tyrann Mathieu.
Though Pittsburgh Steelers’ fans knew once the team signed Terrell Edmunds, Mathieu wasn’t coming to Pittsburgh.
According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Mathieu is heading home and signing with the New Orleans Saints.
The #Saints are making a key post-draft addition, as they’re expected to sign All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu, sources say.
In addition to New Orleans and Pittsburgh, Mathieu also had a Zoom meeting with the Philadelphia Eagles.

     Saints Expected to Sign Tyrann Mathieu, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Veteran safety Tyrann Mathieu will sign with the Saints in the coming days, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
The momentum for a deal between New Orleans and the two-time All-Pro safety gained steam prior to the NFL draft, and the contract was reached as anticipated on Monday.
Mathieu initially visited New Orleans in April and also had a visit with Philadelphia.
However, once a deal was not reached with either of the two clubs, it remained a mystery where Mathieu would play in 2022.

     New Orleans Saints fill biggest need by bringing safety Tyrann Mathieu home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dan Graziano shares his thoughts on reports that Tyrann Mathieu and the New Orleans Saints have agreed to a deal.
But that’s exactly what the New Orleans Saints did by agreeing to a deal with free-agent safety, and local icon, Tyrann Mathieu.
Safety Tyrann Mathieu has agreed to terms to join his hometown New Orleans Saints.
“From an old-school football perspective, Marcus Maye has the physical profile of a strong safety and Tyrann Mathieu has the physical profile of a slot/free safety.
“Mathieu has different traits than Marcus Williams (who was more of a deep center fielder) but is a more high-level playmaker than Marcus Williams.
