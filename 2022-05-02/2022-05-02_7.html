     Amazon.com Stock Extends Losses After Wedbush Bear Note
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wedbush removed Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its Best Ideas List earlier, with the brokerage firm citing its "investment price discipline."
The e-tail stock saw its worst day since November 2008 on Friday, losing $206.41 billion in market cap following its first-quarter earnings report.
This market cap loss was the second-largest total for a single-day, behind Meta Platform's (FB) post-earnings drop.
In turn, Amazon.com stock was last seen down 2.9% to trade at $2,414.08, and is now set to close at roughly two-year lows.
This indicates options traders are operating with an unusual call-bias.

     Amazon Stock Slides, Extending Historic Slump, As Analysts Pick Through Q1 Loss

     Summary: Amazon shares were back in the red Monday following its biggest single-day decline since 2006 as analysts pared details of its surprise $3.8 billion first quarter loss.
However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business," Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors on Thursday.
"When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter."
"Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2."
Amazon shares were marked 2.75% lower in early trading Monday to change hands at $2,417.50 each.

     Why Amazon Stock Is Falling Again Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Investors were dumping Amazon's stock this morning for several reasons, including fears of an upcoming interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, negative sentiment toward the stock following the company's recent quarterly financial results, and the fact Wedbush analysts removed the stock from their "Best Ideas List."
The stock was down by as much as 4.8% this morning and had fallen 1.9% as of 10:40 a.m.
So whatInvestors were already in a sour mood over the past couple of trading days after Amazon reported decelerating revenue growth in its first quarter.
The broader stock market has been unstable lately as investors worry about rising inflation and the U.S. economy.
Amazon will likely still be a good long-term investment, but with the Fed focused on taming inflation and the company dealing with rising costs and slowing sales, Amazon investors will need to be patient during this turbulent time.
