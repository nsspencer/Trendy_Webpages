     Bruins’ Bruce Cassidy not giving up on struggling Boston power play against Hurricanes’ dominant penalty kill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Bruins trudged through their power play drought at the end of the regular season, the caveat always was that David Pastrnak wasn’t there.
Boston was 0-for-40 from April 2 to April 28, but the hope was that when their sniper returned from an undisclosed injury, the power play would bounce back to average and maybe even good, with all the pieces in place.
“We can’t rely on our power play against the No.
Those are our best guys.
Just because they’re the best PK doesn’t mean we can’t score on it.

     Summary: The Boston Bruins were routed in Game 1 of their first-round series against the Carolina Hurricanes, 5-1, but coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't about to pin that on Linus Ullmark.
"I am not faulting our goaltender for this," Cassidy said Monday night.
The last goal ... he's going to tell you, it's not a great goal to give up, but by then it's 4-1.
Boston went 0-for-3 on the power play and could only generate one goal on 36 shots.
The Bruins lost all three meetings against the Hurricanes in the regular season and were outscored 16-1.

     Five Takeaways From Game 1 of Boston Bruins vs Carolina Hurricanes

(Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images)The Boston Bruins fell 5-1 in the series opener against the Carolina Hurricanes.
The “what-aboutism” game is not one I like to play but the stakes are a lot higher during the postseason.
Going into Game 2, the Bruins need to focus on picking up the slack from game 1.
The post was probably enemy number one tonight for Boston as they rang the doorbell quite a few times.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins didn’t have much push-back left after that, other than one of the feeblest power play attempts of all time a few minutes later.
Game notesIt sounds pie-in-the-sky optimist to say this, but the game felt, for long stretches, closer than the final score indicates.
The power play the Bruins had in the third period was the perfect summary of their last 30-odd attempts.
It was an act of mercy to see that power play end.
Different power play units, different lines, a sub...something.

     Summary: For a guy with 15 years in the NHL, and 1,021 regular-season games, the 34-year-old Foligno has barely dipped his toe into Cup play.
Yet this time of year, when there are 16 games to win over two months, is why the Bruins hired on Foligno last summer as a free agent.
Enter Email Sign UpThe Bruins knew they were not getting Foligno in his prime.
Truth be told, the Bruins thought they were getting more than the 2-11—13 Foligno put up in the regular season.
After all this time, maybe now he can be part of the definition of the Bruins winning another Cup.
