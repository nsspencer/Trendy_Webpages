     Barrel containing human remains discovered in Lake Mead under investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressLAS VEGAS — Authorities say a barrel carrying human remains was discovered in Lake Mead.
The agency said in a statement rangers searched an area near Hemenway Harbor and found the barrel with skeletal remains.
They are working with Las Vegas police.
Shawna Hollister told KLAS-TV in Las Vegas that she and her husband were docking their boat when they heard a woman scream.
The barrel might have been visible due to Lake Mead's low water level from ongoing drought.

     Low water levels reveal body in barrel at Lake Mead, officials say more are likely to be found
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The plunging water level in Lake Mead -- the country's largest reservoir, besieged by drought -- unveiled another disturbing discovery over the weekend, police say: a body in a barrel.
A person who was spending time at the lake Sunday afternoon found the barrel, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Homicide Lieutenant Ray Spencer.
Investigators believe the body to be that of a homicide victim from the 1980s, based on the items recovered from the barrel, Spencer says.
"The lake has drained dramatically over the last 15 years," Spencer said, noting that "it's likely that we will find additional bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead" as the water level drops more.
"The barrel was likely dropped hundreds of yards off the shore back then," Spencer said, "but that area is now considered the shoreline."

     Drought-starved Lake Mead reveals a decades-old barrel with a body inside
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A body inside a barrel was found over the weekend on the the newly exposed bottom of Nevada’s Lake Mead as drought depletes one of the largest US reservoirs – and officials predicted the discovery could be just the first of more grim finds.
The reservoir on the Colorado River behind Hoover Dam has become so depleted that Las Vegas is now pumping water from deeper within Lake Mead.
Personal items found inside the barrel indicated the person died more than 40 years ago in the 1980s, Spencer said.
Police plan to reach out to experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to analyze when the barrel started eroding.
National Park Service rangers searched an area near the lake’s Hemenway Harbor and found the barrel containing skeletal remains.

     Body found in barrel by boaters at drought-starved Lake Mead: authorities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A barrel containing decomposing human remains was discovered by boaters at Lake Mead in Nevada, authorities said Monday.
The macabre find was made by a park-goer Sunday afternoon at Lake Mead National Recreation Area near Hemenway Harbor in Boulder City, the National Park Service told The Post.
“No further information is available at this time,” the park service said in a statement.
Shawna Elizabeth HollisterIt is unclear how long the body had been inside the barrel.
FOX5The drought-starved Lake Mead — created by the construction of the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River — is the country’s largest manmade reservoir and has more than 750 miles of shoreline in Nevada and Arizona, according to the National Park Service.

     Human remains found in barrel as Lake Mead drops to historic low amid drought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A barrel containing human remains was discovered in Nevada’s Lake Mead over the weekend as a historic drought grips the West.
The receding waters at Lake Mead, the country’s largest artificial reservoir, have dropped to historic lows.
He did not give further details about the person’s identity or how the remains ended up in a barrel at the bottom of Lake Mead.
“Most of the body was fully intact, and we have recovered the entire body,” Spencer said.
These conditions have resulted in significant water level declines at major system reservoirs, including Lake Mead and Lake Powell.”The worsening megadrought is causing water districts to restrict usage.

     Las Vegas Water Intake Now Visible at Drought-Stricken Lake Mead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS (AP) — A massive drought-starved reservoir on the Colorado River has become so depleted that Las Vegas now is pumping water from deeper within Lake Mead where other states downstream don’t have access.
The low-level intake allows Las Vegas “to maintain access to its primary water supply in Lake Mead, even if water levels continue to decline due to ongoing drought and climate change conditions,” he said.
Drilling began in 2014, amid projections that the lake level would continue to fall due to drought.
The authority maintains that the Las Vegas water supply is not immediately threatened.
It points to water conservation efforts that it says since 2002 have cut regional consumption of Colorado River water by 26% while the area population has increased 49%.
