     Laine Hardy's American Idol Reunion Appearance Still Aired After Arrest, and Fans Have Thoughts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: American Idol aired a pre-taped special — “The Great Idol Reunion” — in which alumni were welcomed back for some amazing duets and special surprises, like the return of OG judges Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul.
However, the elephant in the theater was Season 17 winner Laine Hardy, who appeared in the special despite his April 29 arrest .
The special was taped prior to knowledge of his legal troubles, and American Idol chose to air the special as-is, confusing fans and eliciting some strong opinions.
This viewer tweeted that American Idol’s inclusion of Hardy was disrespectful to Hardy's ex-girlfriend and others:You ask for privacy yet your taped appearance is on American Idol tonight?
On the show’s official Instagram page, a photo of just Laci Kaye Booth was shared.
