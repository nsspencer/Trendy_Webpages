     Bruins lines vs. Carolina: Ready to go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Bruins had some funky game-day rosters down the stretch, it appears that they’re heading into the postseason just as we’d all hoped: healthy.
Barring any last-minute surprises, the Bruins should be at full strength when Game 1 begins tonight, with Hampus Lindholm and David Pastrnak, among others, recovered enough from their late-season maladies to take the ice.
True, both of those guys made appearances in the last couple games, but it’s good to get confirmation with Game 1 looming.
The only real decisions for the B’s prior to the game are in goal and on defense, and Bruce Cassidy already made those decisions by naming Linus Ullmark the starter and noting that he’d be keeping Mike Reilly on the bench.
With a full complement of players available, here’s what to expect tonight:Brad Marchand - Patrice Bergeron - Jake DeBruskTaylor Hall - Erik Haula - David PastrnakTrent Frederic - Charlie Coyle - Craig SmithNick Foligno - Tomas Nosek - Curtis LazarHampus Lindholm - Charlie McAvoyMatt Grzelcyk - Brandon CarloDerek Forbort - Connor CliftonUllmark

     Summary: Oct 14, 2021; Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; Carolina Hurricanes goaltender Frederik Andersen (31) and goaltender Antti Raanta (32) line up before the game against the New York Islanders at PNC Arena.
Raanta’s first career playoff start comes with Hurricanes starter Frederik Andersen still unavailable to a lower-body injury, and could come as a huge boost to the Bruins given Andersen’s domination over the Bruins this past season.
In net for three starts against the Bruins during the regular season, Andersen went a perfect 3-0-0 and stopped all but one of 99 shots faced.
16, skated on his own and could be available as early as Game 2.

“I think that’s where I’m at right now, still, being ready for Game 1 of the playoffs.
That’s all I should really focus on.”Bruins general manager Don Sweeney was asked Sunday about Bergeron's future.
The question is whether Bergeron wants to keep playing that long.
For now, Bruins fans should just enjoy these playoff games, because it's unknown how many more Bergeron will play.

Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Hurricanes are coming off their best regular season in franchise history along with another division title and the third-best record in the NHL.
The Hurricanes have gone from a nine-year playoff drought to four straight postseason appearances for the first time since the former Hartford Whalers relocated to North Carolina in 1997.
Yet that run ended in a sweep against the Bruins, who ousted the Hurricanes in a five-game first-round series in the Toronto bubble a year later.
At the same time, it’s a new story, new team.”This year’s Hurricanes have franchise records of 54 wins and 116 points.

     Summary: RALEIGH — Going into Monday’s Game 1, a long time had passed since Brad Marchand shot the puck past a goalie.
Marchand did break an 11-game streak without a goal when the Bruins beat the Florida Panthers with he scored an empty-netter.
But that’s how the season goes sometimes, where you can score 10 goals in 10 games or zero goals in 10 games.
“I think Brad will look at this season and there will be some highs and a few lows,” said Cassidy.
“Offensively, it didn’t end as well as he’d have liked it to, but I don’t think that will bother him.
