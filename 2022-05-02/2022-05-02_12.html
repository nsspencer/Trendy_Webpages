    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1/4Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov was condemned for remarks given to an Italian television station in which he claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had Jewish blood.
Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made the remarks in an interview with an Italian news channel when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin's claims that his war in Ukraine is "deNazifying" the country.
Advertisement"In my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn't mean absolutely anything," he said in the interview.
In the interview, Lavrov also compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Hitler.
"Foreign minister Lavrov's remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error," Lapid also said in his tweet.

     Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish origins', claims Russian minister Sergei Lavrov in rant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's foreign minister has been criticised for claiming Adolf Hitler "had Jewish origins" and "some of the worst antisemites are Jews".
Sergei Lavrov hit out at Ukraine's president during an interview with Italian media, saying Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Jewish ancestry "doesn't mean anything" while trying to justify Vladimir Putin's call to "denazify" the nation.
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, President Putin described it as a "special military operation" to remove leaders he claimed were neo-Nazis.

In his bid to legitimise the war to Russian citizens, President Putin has portrayed the battle as a struggle against Nazis in Ukraine, even though the country has a democratically-elected government and a Jewish president whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust.

The Russian ambassador to Israel has been summoned by Israel's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid for "a tough talk".
Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error.

It later became a linchpin of Russia's identity, with Moscow trying to portray itself as a savior against evil forces.
