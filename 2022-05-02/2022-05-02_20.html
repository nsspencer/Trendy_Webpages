     Vin Diesel’s Set Behavior Revealed As Justin Lin Gives Up Beloved Franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lin had apparently decided to step down due to the behavior that Vin Diesel had been exhibiting while on set.
You can see this video below:Justin Lin clearly does not seem like he wants to be on camera or anywhere near Vin Diesel.
Lin had decided to stay on as a producer for the franchise, but he ultimately decided to step away as director.
Justin Lin is a respected director, and it is sad to see him exit a franchise that he is truly passionate about.
Having to leave a film due to the behavior of an actor is never good for anyone involved.

     ‘Fast X’: Louis Leterrier Top Choice To Replace Justin Lin As Director On Next ‘Fast &amp; Furious’ Installment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just days after the news Justin Lin was exiting as director of the next Fast and Furious installment Fast X, sources tell Deadline that Louis Leterrier is the front-runner to step in to helm the Universal film.
Second-unit footage on Fast X is wrapping up, and once a deal closes for Leterrier to replace Lin, the studio should still have no problem making the film’s May 19, 2023, release date.
Production is underway in London with Vin Diesel and the core Fast cast returning alongside franchise newcomers Jason Momoa and Brie Larson.
Lin and Dan Mazeau co-wrote the script; Lin will stay on as a producer along with Diesel, Neal Moritz, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent.
He recently has been directing in TV as serves as director, executive producer and showrunner for Netflix’s Lupin.

     ‘Fast X’: Louis Leterrier to Replace Justin Lin as Director
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Louis Leterrier (“The Incredible Hulk,” the first two “Transporter” films) is set to take over the director’s chair on “Fast X” from Justin Lin, Variety has learned.
The decision comes less than a week after Lin’s surprise departure from the helm of the 10th installment in the main “Fast and Furious” movie franchise.
Leterrier, who beat out numerous candidates for the job, per sources, is Universal picture’s first choice, and schedules are still being hammered out.
Holding the main production in limbo during the director search, meanwhile, has cost Universal upwards of $600,000 to $1 million a day, according to sources from different studios with experience replacing directors midstream.
Then there’s the wrinkle that “Fast X” was originally envisioned as the first of a two-part conclusion to the “Fast &amp; Furious” saga.

     Justin Lin Reportedly Quit Fast X Due to Vin Diesel’s ‘Difficult’ Behavior
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, recently lost its director, Justin Lin.
The news came just weeks after production commenced on Fast X, with "creative differences" cited as the reason behind Lin’s abrupt exit.
However, a new report alleges that Vin Diesel’s troublesome on-set behavior is the real reason Lin quit Fast X.
Fast X is set to be the long-running franchise's two-part finale, and the film intends to go out with a bang.
Fast X will storm into theaters on May 19, 2023.

     Behind Justin Lin’s ‘Fast 10’ Breaking Point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Fast and Furious franchise, which runs on the theme of family, became the latter when, only days into shooting the latest installment, Fast 10, director Justin Lin did the unthinkable: he quit.
He had directed five Fast movies, starting with the third installment, Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Diesel had become his own personality to be reckoned with at this point in the Fast franchise.
“The whole process is a mosaic that never stops moving,” says one insider who has seen up close the making of several Fast movies.
Leterrier had, according to one insider, always been in the contention for directing gigs for the Fast movies due to his experience and interest.

     Louis Leterrier Will Replace Justin Lin And Direct Vin Diesel’s ‘Fast X’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AFP PHOTO/Max Nash (Photo credit should read MAX NASH/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty ImagesAbout one week after Justin Lin shocked us all by stepping down from the Fast X director’s chair, Universal is reportedly bringing in Louis Leterrier to take his place.
Maybe Lin was just exhausted and drained by losing what was supposed to be the gap year between F9 and Fast X (and then Fast 11) to Covid?
I mean, it’s not like Lin and Vin Diesel haven’t worked together on four of these films previously (Lin helmed the most Diesel-free Toyko Drift before Fast &amp; Furious reunited the core cast).
This will mark the second time that a white guy has helmed a Fast and Furious movie since Rob Cohen’s original The Fast and the Furious in 2001, as he was followed by John Singleton (2 Fast 2 Furious), Justin Lin (Toyko Drift, Fast &amp; Furious, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and eventually F9), James Wan (Furious 7) and F. Gary Gray (The Fate of the Furious).
Fast X is going to earn whatever Fast X is going to earn when it opens next May 19, 2023 regardless of who is in the director’s chair.
