     Jared Leto Twins With Alessandro Michele at the Met Gala
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The last time Jared Leto showed up on the Met Gala red carpet, he was carrying an exact replica of his own head.
This year, he showed up with a full-on twin—in the form of Gucci designer Alessandro Michele.
Leto, of course, may be the single biggest celebrity muse associated with Michele’s run at Gucci, and almost exclusively wears the brand’s clothing on the red carpet.
He’s taken this classic brand and really turned it completely around and taken it in a direction that was so unexpected.
[Alessandro and I] met and became friends here in L.A., and then we got to know each other and he asked me to do this.

     Not Jared Leto: Meet Frederik Robertsson the Met Gala 2022 Standout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Iris Van Herpen wearing creative is a name you need to know.
On Monday, May 2, various new outlets reported that Jared Leto walked the 2022 Met Gala red carpet in a eyebrow-raising look.
The person in question, wearing an over-the-top from the couture designer Iris van Herpen, was Fredrik Robertsson.
Robertsson is a self described "creative dictator" and "fashion addict" who had been chronicling his Met Gala makeover all day.

     Summary: One of the us always speaks with an Italian accent, and the other always sounds like Super Mario.
Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty ImagesThis has been something of a confusing evening for Jared Leto fans and/or haters everywhere (and you almost assuredly fall into one of those two camps).
First, through no fault of Leto's own, there was a mishap in which multiple news outlets misidentified Swedish fashion figure Fredrik Robertsson as the actor.
Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesBut then, the real Jared Leto arrived, this time in the form of a puzzle.

     Jared Leto and Alessandro Michele’s Met Gala Looks Take Twinning to the Next Level
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it comes to making a style statement at the Met Gala, the trickiest thing might simply be offering a look we’ve never seen before.
It’s not the first time that Leto and Michele have referenced their (let’s be honest, uncanny) resemblance while walking a red carpet.
For the 2018 Met Gala, the duo showed up wearing coordinating suits, lavishly embroidered in gold thread with swirling baroque patterns to reference that year’s theme of Catholicism.
When asked by red carpet host Hamish Bowles how to define their look, they answered simply: “Double trouble.” Sounds about right.

“Now we have three Jared Leto,” someone else joked, referencing both the identical outfits worn by Leto and Michele, and the case of mistaken identity.
Ahead of the Met Gala, Robertsson shared a behind-the-scenes look at his Met Gala prep.
As of now, neither Robertsson nor Leto have addressed the misidentification, however, the WeCrashed star did post a number of photos of his actual Met Gala outfit on his Instagram Stories.
