     Report: A leaked draft opinion suggests the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade

     Summary: Report: A leaked draft opinion suggests the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. WadeEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/APWASHINGTON — A draft opinion circulated among Supreme Court justices suggests that earlier this year a majority of them had thrown support behind overturning the 1973 case Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a report published Monday night in Politico.
The Supreme Court has yet to issue a ruling in the case, and opinions — and even justices' votes — have been known to change during the drafting process.
The court is expected to rule on the case before its term is up in late June or early July.
"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start," the draft opinion states.
The draft opinion in effect states there is no Constitutional right to abortion services and would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure.

     The original Roe v. Wade decision also was leaked to the press
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe apparent leak to Politico of an initial draft of a Supreme Court opinion overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey has been greeted with astonishment about not only the sweep of the ruling but also the fact that a draft opinion was leaked at all.
Some commentators claimed that this was unprecedented in the history of the Supreme Court.
In fact, the result in Roe v. Wade itself was leaked by a Supreme Court clerk to a Time magazine reporter in January 1973.
Hammond confided in an acquaintance he knew from the University of Texas School of Law that the Roe ruling was forthcoming.
The Supreme Court has always jealously guarded its opinions, and secrecy is critical to maintaining an evenhanded approach to dispensing justice.

     4 things we know, and one big thing we don’t, about the draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And justices do sometimes change their mind after a draft opinion is circulated.
There’s only one more frontier left for abortion opponents to cross: a Supreme Court decision explicitly overruling Roe.
The draft opinion also relies heavily on a traditional conservative argument that overruling Roe promotes democracy by allowing each state to decide how it will regulate abortion.
If you are a liberal, the thinnest silver lining in Alito’s draft opinion is that it wholeheartedly rejects this effort to bring cases like Lochner back from the dead.
It is highly likely, in other words, that the Court’s final opinion will look a whole lot like Alito’s first draft.

     Supreme Court Live Updates: Leaked Draft Would Overturn Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision along the lines of the one in the leaked Supreme Court draft could open new political battles over abortion.
In the draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a majority of the court voted to overturn Roe, according to Politico.
If the draft opinion or something like it is ultimately issued, it will produce rifts at the court that could test its legitimacy.
“How will the court survive?”The leak of the draft opinion sent a jolt through Washington Monday night.
The revelations from the draft opinion once again place the nine justices at the center of one of the most contentious issues in American life.

     Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .
According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.
"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
Former President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe "automatically."
