     Summary: Report: A leaked draft opinion suggests the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. WadeEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/APWASHINGTON — A draft opinion circulated among Supreme Court justices suggests that earlier this year a majority of them had thrown support behind overturning the 1973 case Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a report published Monday night in Politico.
The Supreme Court has yet to issue a ruling in the case, and opinions — and even justices' votes — have been known to change during the drafting process.
The court is expected to rule on the case before its term is up in late June or early July.
"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start," the draft opinion states.
The draft opinion in effect states there is no Constitutional right to abortion services and would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure.

     How the fate of Roe v. Wade could impact Oregonians
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this file photo, barriers to separate activists are set up outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2021, ahead of arguments on abortion.
Andrew Harnik / APEditor’s note: The website Politico broke the news late Monday that the U.S. Supreme Court has drafted a majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, the ruling that has guaranteed people in the country a right to an abortion for nearly 50 years.
Oregon codified its own version of Roe v. Wade protections with the Reproductive Health Equity Act of 2017.
So if Roe v. Wade were overturned, Oregon would still have its own laws allowing abortions.
Idaho cities like Boise or Meridian are currently the closest locations where many eastern Oregonians can access abortion services.

     Leaked Draft Opinion Indicates Supreme Court Has Voted Down Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There's a strong indication that the right to an abortion in America is being struck down after five decades of protection.
According to what appears to be an unprecedented leak from the Supreme Court, the conservative majority has preliminarily voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, 50 years of precedent, and a woman’s right to choose in an expected, but nonetheless shocking blow to reproductive rights in America.
Vanity Fair has not confirmed the authenticity of the draft opinion.
Drafted in February, Alito's proposed opinion would kill the 1973 Roe decision protecting the right to choose in America and the 1992 Casey v. Planned Parenthood decision that mostly confirmed it.
Politico, which first reported on Alito's draft opinion, noted that the document could be subject to change.

     Supreme court voted to overturn Roe v Wade abortion law, leaked draft opinion reportedly shows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US supreme court has provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationwide in America, according to a draft opinion reported on by Politico.
A draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito claims that Roe and Casey have deepened division in the US.
Politico said it received a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court’s proceedings in the Mississippi case.
What an utter disgrace.”Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted the the news showed “Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW”.
In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 69% of voters in the presidential election said the supreme court should leave the Roe v Wade decision as is; just 29% said the court should overturn the decision.

     Summary: A decision along the lines of the one in the leaked Supreme Court draft could open new political battles over abortion.
In the draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a majority of the court voted to overturn Roe, according to Politico.
If the draft opinion or something like it is ultimately issued, it will produce rifts at the court that could test its legitimacy.
“How will the court survive?”The leak of the draft opinion sent a jolt through Washington Monday night.
The revelations from the draft opinion once again place the nine justices at the center of one of the most contentious issues in American life.

     Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .
According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.
"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
Former President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe "automatically."
