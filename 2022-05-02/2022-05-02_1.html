     First Thing: Supreme court reportedly votes to overturn Roe v Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US supreme court has provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationwide in America, according to a draft opinion reported on by Politico.
The opinion strikes down Roe v Wade, the court’s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v Casey – that largely upheld that right.
And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”The justice adds: “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.
Could dismantling Roe v Wade imperil other ‘core, basic human rights’?
As Roe v Wade faces a direct challenge, criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, local judges and police begin to lay out what it would look like to criminalize abortion.

     Leaked Supreme Court Draft Would Overturn Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision along the lines of the one in the leaked Supreme Court draft could open new political battles over abortion.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that has guaranteed the right to abortion for nearly a half-century, according to a leaked draft opinion from February published online Monday night by Politico.
In the draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a majority of the court voted to overturn Roe, according to Politico.
In more than two dozen conservative states, lawmakers have prepared bills that would effectively outlaw abortion if the court overturns Roe v. Wade.
“How will the court survive?”The leak of the draft opinion sent a jolt through Washington Monday night.

     Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .
According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.
"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
Former President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe "automatically."
