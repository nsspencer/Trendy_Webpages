     The original Roe v. Wade decision also was leaked to the press
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe apparent leak to Politico of an initial draft of a Supreme Court opinion overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey has been greeted with astonishment about not only the sweep of the ruling but also the fact that a draft opinion was leaked at all.
Some commentators claimed this was unprecedented in the history of the Supreme Court.
In fact, the result in Roe v. Wade itself was leaked by a Supreme Court clerk to a Time magazine reporter in January 1973.
Hammond confided in an acquaintance he knew from the University of Texas Law School that the Roe ruling was forthcoming.
The Supreme Court has always jealously guarded its opinions, and secrecy is critical to maintaining an evenhanded approach to dispensing justice.

     Leaked Supreme Court Draft Would Overturn Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A decision along the lines of the one in the leaked Supreme Court draft could open new political battles over abortion.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that has guaranteed the right to abortion for nearly a half-century, according to a leaked draft opinion from February published online Monday night by Politico.
In the draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a majority of the court voted to overturn Roe, according to Politico.
In more than two dozen conservative states, lawmakers have prepared bills that would effectively outlaw abortion if the court overturns Roe v. Wade.
“How will the court survive?”The leak of the draft opinion sent a jolt through Washington Monday night.

     Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .
According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.
"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
Former President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe "automatically."
