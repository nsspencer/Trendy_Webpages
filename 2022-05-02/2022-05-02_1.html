     First Thing: Supreme court reportedly votes to overturn Roe v Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US supreme court has provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationwide in America, according to a draft opinion reported on by Politico.
The opinion strikes down Roe v Wade, the court’s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v Casey – that largely upheld that right.
And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”The justice adds: “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.
Could dismantling Roe v Wade imperil other ‘core, basic human rights’?
As Roe v Wade faces a direct challenge, criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, local judges and police begin to lay out what it would look like to criminalize abortion.

     Roe v. Wade: Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn abortion rights published by Politico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RELATED: Breaking down Samuel Alito’s draft opinionAccording to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court’s three liberals.
A largely somber crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building Monday evening, as people came together to console one another and question what to do next.
“This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
After that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion.
