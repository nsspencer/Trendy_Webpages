     Suns starters shine against Mavericks; Heat get a win against Joel Embiid-less Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat secured wins in Game 1 of their respective second round playoff series: Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 106-92 while the Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-114.
"We've just got to get someone to join the party," Mavericks coach Jason Kidd told ESPN.
Doncic scored more points than the rest of the Mavs' starters who managed just 39 points between them.
Despite his individual performance, Phoenix led wire to wire, living up to their billing as series favorites.
Deandre Ayton scored 25 points and Devin Booker marked his return to the squad after three games sidelined by injury with 23 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.

The Mavericks stayed in the game for a while thanks to Doncic and Kleber, who hit his first four 3-pointers.
TIP-INSMavericks: Doncic scored 14 points in the first quarter on 5 of 9 shooting.
Suns: Crowder hit a 3-pointer in the second quarter then turned and started celebrating with former Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald, who was sitting courtside.

The Suns took Game 1 against the Mavs in their second-round series with a 121‚Äì114 win.
I just told coach I ain‚Äôt play much in the second quarter,‚Äù Paul said after the game.
At least in Game 1, Phoenix was blessed with a full rotation that contributed in several ways.
Also, with the way Dallas closed Game 1, it‚Äôs not a given Paul will have the same benefit of rest as the series progresses.

     Summary: Phoenix piled up a whopping 96 points through the first three quarters ‚Äì the Mavs had 79 points at that juncture ‚Äì as the Suns kept scoring almost at will.
Unfortunately, the Suns didn‚Äôt blink as they quickly built their lead to 69-56 at intermission.
And not even a spectacular performance from Doncic could prevent Phoenix from beating the Mavs for the 10th consecutive game.
Doncic was 15-of-30 from the field, 4-of-11 from three-point land and finished with 45 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.
We came back and made the game close.‚ÄùThe Mavs simply didn‚Äôt make the Suns uncomfortable enough, as too many baskets came too easy for Phoenix.

     Summary: So, we‚Äôll get into that and more in our five takeaways from a wire-to-wire Phoenix Suns victory that screamed intensity and physicality from the onset:1.
The Suns destroyed the Mavs on the boards 51-36 and pulled down 13 offensive rebounds.
Devin Booker, meanwhile, produced his 19th game in the postseason with 20 points or more and gave Doncic plenty of problems.
Led by Deandre Ayton‚Äôs (we‚Äôll get to him later) team-high 25 points, Phoenix finished with six double-figures scorers.
In explaining Dallas‚Äô myriad problems with communication in the first half, Doncic pretty much announced what the Mavs are expecting Wednesday for Game 2.

     Summary: PHOENIX ‚Äî Here are five observations from the Suns‚Äô 121-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals.
Paul averaged 36.8 minutes in Phoenix‚Äôs first-round series over New Orleans, which the Suns won in six games.
In nearly 13 first-half minutes, Paul was an absurd plus-24.
‚ÄúYou always try to win the game, but it is on my mind at times,‚Äù the Phoenix coach said.
Midway through the third quarter, Bridges raced to the corner and swatted a Reggie Bullock 3-point attempt out of bounds.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately the Suns just made shot after shot and the game never really felt in play, even with Dallas giving the effort needed.
So while the defense likely needs a larger microscope, there were still some things in Game 1 offensively the Mavericks can improve.
The Mavericks shot fine in Game 1, but only had 16 assists on their 40 made baskets.
When the Suns weren‚Äôt swallowing up the Mavericks, the Mavericks themselves shot themselves in the foot with some poor spacing.
Coincidently, the Mavericks shot much better in the second half as a team compared to the first.

The 23-year-old Doncic remained on the floor for a few moments before walking away wincing in pain ... and nausea, possibly.
Crowder, who was called for a foul immediately, had the violation upgraded to a Flagrant-1 upon review from the officials.
