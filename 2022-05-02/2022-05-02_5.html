     Report: Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign with Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, safety Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign with the Saints and the deal should be finalized in the coming days.
When the Saints did not address safety during the draft, it left a void for Mathieu to fill.
It’s also a better time for the Saints to sign Mathieu because as of 4 p.m.
He started 16 games in 2021, recording 76 total tackles, three interceptions, six passes defensed, and three fumble recoveries.
A third-round pick in the 2013 draft, Mathieu has 26 career interceptions and 76 passes defensed.

     Saints expected to sign Tyrann Mathieu to three-year deal, filling hole with Pro Bowl safety, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pro Bowl safety is expected to sign with the New Orleans Saints in the coming days, according to the NFL Network.
The reason Mathieu may not immediately be signing with the Saints is due to the compensatory pick formula, which is set to expire at 4 p.m.
Once the Saints finalize their deal with Mathieu, he's expected to land a three-year, $33 million deal, per ESPN.
Mathieu has spent the last three seasons in the NFL as a cornerstone piece to the Kansas City Chiefs defense.
This offseason, the Chiefs elected to move on from Mathieu and sign fellow safety Justin Reid to a three-year, $31.5 million contract.

     Summary: Three-time All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu is signing with the New Orleans Saints, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday, per a source.
Rapoport later reported that Mathieu will receive a three-year, $33 million contract from the Saints.
