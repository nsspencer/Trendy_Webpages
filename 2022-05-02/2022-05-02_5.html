     As Rosters Shrink, the Mets Say Goodbye to Robinson Canó
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roster sizes in Major League Baseball shrank Monday, and the Mets made the most notable cut, parting ways with second baseman Robinson Canó, who has struggled in the twilight of his career.
In removing Canó from their 40-man roster, the Mets, who entered Monday with the best record in the National League, are prepared to eat the remaining portion of the $40.5 million they owed him entering this season.
Returning from his second performance-enhancing drug suspension, a yearlong ban that cost him the entire 2021 season, Canó was hitting .195 with a .501 on-base plus slugging percentage in 12 games this year.
He was well liked in the Mets’ clubhouse, but in 43 plate appearances, he had two walks and one extra-base hit.
An eight-time All-Star and a 2009 World Series winner with the Yankees, Canó had the makings of a Hall of Fame résumé before sputtering over the last several seasons with his legacy tainted by the suspensions.

     Mets Show Winning Is the Priority by Cutting Robinson Cano
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The problem with that though, is the Mets would have been removing players who have contributed far more to their 16-7 start than Cano.
Cano started nine of the Mets first 16 games, getting more playing time than Smith, Davis and Guillorme.
Since April 23rd, Cano has started just two of the Mets last seven games.
If the decision wasn’t obvious before last night, it was made even more so after Dom Smith went 4-for-4 with three RBIs in a nationally televised game.
Smith and Cano are each supposed to provide the Mets with a left-handed power bat that can platoon with Davis as the team’s primary DH.

     New York Mets designate struggling Robinson Cano for assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:30)The New York Mets have designated struggling infielder Robinson Cano for assignment.
Relegated to a part-time role this season, Cano was a casualty of the crunch as the first-place Mets chose to keep younger, more versatile bench players instead.
The Mets acquired Cano from the Mariners in 2018, in a trade that also brought closer Edwin Diaz to New York.
In three seasons with the Mets, Cano hit .269 with 24 home runs and 72 RBIs.
Van Wagenen added that Cano has a "great deal of respect" for the Mets and "understands they had a tough decision to make.

     Mets Designate Robinson Cano For Assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets have designated Robinson Cano for assignment, as the club announced on May 2.
Cano, 39, is still owed around $37.6 million between the remainder of this season and 2023.
Cano has been lauded by manager Buck Showalter for his clubhouse presence, veteran leadership and knowledge of the game.
With Cano on the way out, Smith and Davis could regularly platoon at DH in the Mets' lineup.
In addition to Cano, the Mets optioned pitcher Yoan Lopez to Triple-A in order to cut their roster down to 26 players.

     Looking back at the Robinson Cano trade now that he’s been designated for assignment by the Mets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cano, 39, had played in 12 games for the Mets — seven at second base and five at designated hitter — posting a .195/.233/.268 slash line with a homer and three RBI.
Given his age and money remaining on his contract, no team will trade for him or claim him off waivers and take on that commitment.
Seattle still owes $7.5 million on the Cano contract but paid less than the $20 million due to his suspension.
After undergoing surgery to repair a sports hernia after a disappointing 2015 season, Cano put up a monster 2016 season.
The positive test had actually occurred in the offseason, and Cano had appealed the decision but didn’t tell teammates or the Mariners.

     Robinson Canó landing spots: Veteran slugger 'still wants to play' and these 11 teams might be interested
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets designated Canó for assignment on Monday, the day teams must trim their rosters from 28 players to 26.
Now 39, Canó went 8 for 41 (.195) with one home run in 12 games this season prior to being dropped from the roster.
Which teams could have interest in Canó at the league minimum once he hits the open market in a few days?
As a platoon DH, Canó could fit with the Rays.
Toronto has rotated guys through the DH spot for much of the season and Canó would fit as a bottom-of-the-lineup complementary piece.
