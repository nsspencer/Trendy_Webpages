(1:55)MIAMI -- The Miami Heat didn't have their best in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night -- but it was still good enough.
It's really just trying to do whatever you have to do to get to the next game, or the game at hand.
"It's just about trying to go out and putting together your best game plan to win that game.
There also was a collective frustration over the way Miami was able to use its physicality to control the game.

     Summary: With the Kentucky guys (Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro) at the epicenter, the Heat outscored Philadelphia 48-28 over the first 18 minutes of the second half.
Herro unleashed a personal 10-0 run in the first half and hit several big baskets in the second half, including a three that pushed the lead to 96-77.
“The second half, they ran different defenses,” 76ers forward Tobias Harris said.
But the Heat took far better care of the ball in the second half, with 10 assists and one turnover until the game’s final two minutes.
Vincent, who filled in admirably for Lowry in the final two games of the first-round series against Atlanta, overcame a bit of a slow start and played an exceptional second half.
