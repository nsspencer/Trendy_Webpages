     Summary: Tyler Herro drops 25 points with seven assists to lead the Heat to a 106-92 win over the 76ers in Game 1.
(1:55)MIAMI -- The Miami Heat didn't have their best in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night -- but it was still good enough.
It's really just trying to do whatever you have to do to get to the next game, or the game at hand.
"It's just about trying to go out and putting together your best game plan to win that game.
There also was a collective frustration over the way Miami was able to use its physicality to control the game.

     Heat Show Their Ceiling in Game 1 Rout of 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Game 1 of their second-round series, the Heat destroyed the 76ers, 106–92.
Doc Rivers gave the starting nod to a creaky DeAndre Jordan, who was immediately and relentlessly attacked by various Heat pick-and-roll combinations.
The Heat grabbed a whopping 39.6% of their own misses, which kept their head above water despite some inconsistent outside shooting.
Adebayo finished 8-for-10 on the night (every shot came in the paint) while Herro drilled three backbreaking straightaway threes.
When these two play well and score efficiently, it’s a reminder of how high Miami’s ceiling can be.

     Heat vs. 76ers score, takeaways: Miami overpowers Joel Embiid-less Philadelphia in second half, takes 1-0 lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat strike first against the Philadelphia 76ers with a 106-92 Game 1 win.
Tyler Herro finished with a team-high 25 points for Miami, while Bam Adebayo added 24 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in the winning effort.
So, naturally, when the basketball world criticized him for overusing DeAndre Jordan (or, really, using him at all), Rivers was defiant.
"We like DJ," Rivers Rivers said after Monday's loss.
So, in essence, Rivers not only blew Game 1 by starting Jordan, but he's actively laying the groundwork to blow Game 2 as well.
