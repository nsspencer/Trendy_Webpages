Seattle traded Cano to the Mets prior to the 2019 season, bringing him to New York along with closer Edwin Diaz.

     Mets Show Winning Is the Priority by Cutting Robinson Cano
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The problem with that though, is the Mets would have been removing players who have contributed far more to their 16-7 start than Cano.
Cano started nine of the Mets first 16 games, getting more playing time than Smith, Davis and Guillorme.
Since April 23rd, Cano has started just two of the Mets last seven games.
If the decision wasn’t obvious before last night, it was made even more so after Dom Smith went 4-for-4 with three RBIs in a nationally televised game.
Smith and Cano are each supposed to provide the Mets with a left-handed power bat that can platoon with Davis as the team’s primary DH.

The full deal:Mets receive IF Robinson Cano, RP Edwin Diaz;receive IF Robinson Cano, RP Edwin Diaz; Mariners receive OF Jay Bruce, RP Anthony Swarzak, RP Gerson Bautista and prospects Jarred Kelenic and Justin Dunn.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:30)The New York Mets have designated struggling infielder Robinson Cano for assignment.
Relegated to a part-time role this season, Cano was a casualty of the crunch as the first-place Mets chose to keep younger, more versatile bench players instead.
The Mets acquired Cano from the Mariners in 2018, in a trade that also brought closer Edwin Diaz to New York.
In three seasons with the Mets, Cano hit .269 with 24 home runs and 72 RBIs.
Van Wagenen added that Cano has a "great deal of respect" for the Mets and "understands they had a tough decision to make.
