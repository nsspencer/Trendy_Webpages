     Cardinals WR Hopkins Suspended for Violating PED Policy (Report)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cardinals All-Pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins is being suspended for six games for violating the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
He ended the campaign with career-lows in receptions (42) and receiving yards (572) while catching eight touchdowns in 10 games played.
In his two seasons with Arizona since being acquired from the Texans in 2020, Hopkins has hauled in 157 receptions for 1,979 yards and 14 touchdowns.
The Cardinals seemed to anticipate Hopkins’s suspension, adding wide receiver Marquise Brown in a draft-day trade with the Ravens.

     Arizona Cardinals’ DeAndre Hopkins suspended 6 games for PED violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended six games for violating the NFL’s performance enhancing drug policy, the league announced Monday.
The six-game suspension is a result of a positive test result from an anabolic agent, per the league’s updated PED policy.

Hopkins is coming off an injury-riddled season in which he missed seven games with a hamstring injury and torn MCL.
In 10 games played last season, Hopkins recorded 42 catches for 572 yards and a team-leading eight receiving touchdowns.
