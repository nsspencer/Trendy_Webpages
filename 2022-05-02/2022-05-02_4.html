     Arizona Cardinals’ DeAndre Hopkins suspended 6 games for PED violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended six games for violating the NFL’s performance enhancing drug policy, the league announced Monday.
The six-game suspension is a result of a positive test result from an anabolic agent, per the league’s updated PED policy.
Per Spotrac, Hopkins will forfeit $4.05 million in 2022 compensation for the six-game suspension.
Hopkins is coming off an injury-riddled season in which he missed seven games with a hamstring injury and torn MCL.
In 10 games played last season, Hopkins recorded 42 catches for 572 yards and a team-leading eight receiving touchdowns.

     DeAndre Hopkins suspended six games for PED violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeAndre Hopkins, whom the Cardinals gleefully took from the Houston Texans just a couple of seasons ago, has been suspended for six games after testing positive for PEDs.
Cardinals’ Pro-Bowl WR DeAndre Hopkins is being suspended six games for violating the NFL’s Performance Enhancing Drug policy, league sources tell ESPN.
Hopkins made an immediate impact in Arizona’s offense in 2020, catching 115 passes for over 1,400 yards and 6 touchdowns.
He had an injury-riddled 2021, resulting in career lows in catches and yards in just 10 games played.
This is no doubt a major blow to Arizona’s offense and now Hollywood Brown figures to be the WR1 in the short-term.
