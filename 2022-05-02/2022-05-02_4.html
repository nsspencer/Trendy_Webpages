     New York Mets designate struggling Robinson Cano for assignment

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:30)The New York Mets have designated struggling infielder Robinson Cano for assignment.
Relegated to a part-time role this season, Cano was a casualty of the crunch as the first-place Mets chose to keep younger, more versatile bench players instead.
The Mets acquired Cano from the Mariners in 2018, in a trade that also brought closer Edwin Diaz to New York.
In three seasons with the Mets, Cano hit .269 with 24 home runs and 72 RBIs.
An eight-time All-Star, Cano has a career average of .302 with 335 home runs and 1,305 RBIs in 17 seasons.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a decision that, with the Mets owing Canó most of the $40.5 million he is due over this season and next, will be financially painful.
Advertisement“I wouldn’t be happy,” Francisco Lindor told reporters on Sunday (via the New York Post) when asked how he would feel if Canó were targeted.
He helped the Yankees win the World Series in 2009 and signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with Seattle in 2013.
The Mets acquired Canó along with closer Edwin Diaz from the Seattle Mariners in 2018 partly in exchange for outfield prospect Jarred Kelenic.

     Mets' Robinson Canó designated for assignment with nearly two years left on massive contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, MLB clubs must cut their rosters from 28 players down to 26 players, and one big name has lost his roster spot: Robinson Canó.
The New York Mets announced Monday that Canó has been designated for assignment.
I don't want to see that happen," Francisco Lindor told reporters, including Mike Puma of the New York Post, about Canó possibly being released on Sunday.
During the shortened 2020 season Canó authored a .316/.352/.544 batting line with 10 home runs in 49 games.
Once he is released, any team could sign Canó for the pro-rated portion of the $700,000 league minimum.
