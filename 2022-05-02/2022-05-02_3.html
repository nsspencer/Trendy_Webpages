     Don’t Worry Darling Trailer: Florence Pugh and Harry Styles Bring Sexy Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Don’t Worry Darling—Olivia Wilde is here to resurrect the erotic thriller.
Florence Pugh and Harry Styles star as married couple Alice and Jack, whose steamy love scenes are undercut by a sense of domestic dread.
Set to appear alongside Pine, Styles, and Pugh are KiKi Layne, Nick Kroll, Kate Berlant, Sydney Chandler, Asif Ali, Douglas Smith, Timothy Simons, and Ari’el Stachel.
While unveiling the trailer at last week’s CinemaCon presentation, Wilde was suddenly given a manilla folder, labeled “personal and confidential,” while onstage.
Wilde has been romantically involved with Styles since separating from Sudeikis after seven years at the start of 2020.

Don't Worry, Darling Courtesy of Warner Bros. PictureAnyway, Don’t Worry Darling is one of Warner Bros.’ few “not a pure IP flick” arriving in 2022.
At the risk of stating the obvious, if you want Warner Bros.
Discovery to offer up more than just DC superhero movies and New Line horror films, Don’t Worry Darling (which, to be fair, may fall into the New Line horror flick categorization) is a pretty good opportunity to vote with your wallet.
