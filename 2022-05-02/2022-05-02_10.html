     Saints Expected to Sign Tyrann Mathieu, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Veteran safety Tyrann Mathieu will sign with the Saints in the coming days, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
The momentum for a deal between New Orleans and the two-time All-Pro safety gained steam prior to the NFL draft, and the contract was reached as anticipated on Monday.
Mathieu initially visited New Orleans in April and also had a visit with Philadelphia.
However, once a deal was not reached with either of the two clubs, it remained a mystery where Mathieu would play in 2022.

     NFLSU: Tyrann Mathieu Signs with New Orleans Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former LSU legend reportedly signed a three-year, $33 million deal with the New Orleans Saints.
Mathieu was a star at LSU, and in 2011 he won the Chuck Bednarik Award and was a Heisman finalist.
In nine seasons he’s been an All-Pro three times, made three Pro Bowls, won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs and made the NFL’s 2010 All-Decade team.
More importantly he’s been a team captain everywhere he’s been: Arizona, Houston, Kansas City, and he’ll surely be one with the Saints.
Mathieu signing with the hometown Saints is about as big of a slam dunk move New Orleans could possibly make.

     Saints expected to sign Tyrann Mathieu to three-year deal, filling hole with Pro Bowl safety, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pro Bowl safety is expected to sign with the New Orleans Saints in the coming days, according to the NFL Network.
The reason Mathieu may not immediately be signing with the Saints is due to the compensatory pick formula, which is set to expire at 4 p.m.
Once the Saints finalize their deal with Mathieu, he's expected to land a three-year, $33 million deal, per ESPN.
Mathieu has spent the last three seasons in the NFL as a cornerstone piece to the Kansas City Chiefs defense.
This offseason, the Chiefs elected to move on from Mathieu and sign fellow safety Justin Reid to a three-year, $31.5 million contract.

     Saints signing All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu to three-year, $33M contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three-time All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu is signing with the New Orleans Saints, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday, per a source.
Rapoport later reported that Mathieu will receive a three-year, $33 million contract from the Saints.
Rapoport adds that the Saints were always the favorite to land Mathieu, who also met virtually with the Eagles.
Mathieu, 29, heads to NOLA to play alongside Marcus Maye, who was signed to a three-year pact in March amid free agency's first wave.
Heading into his 10th NFL season, Mathieu adds even more leadership to a veteran-heavy Saints defense.

     Summary: Dan Graziano shares his thoughts on reports that Tyrann Mathieu and the New Orleans Saints have agreed to a deal.
But that’s exactly what the New Orleans Saints did by agreeing to a deal with free-agent safety, and local icon, Tyrann Mathieu.
Safety Tyrann Mathieu has agreed to terms to join his hometown New Orleans Saints.
“From an old-school football perspective, Marcus Maye has the physical profile of a strong safety and Tyrann Mathieu has the physical profile of a slot/free safety.
“Mathieu has different traits than Marcus Williams (who was more of a deep center fielder) but is a more high-level playmaker than Marcus Williams.

But apparently it wasn’t because his former team, Kansas City Chiefs, lacked the money or cap space to re-sign their defensive leader.
According to Adam Schefter, Mathieu signed a three-year, $33 million contract.
Reid’s contract has a slightly lower overall total ($31.5 million) over the same duration (three years) but slightly more guaranteed money ($20 million versus Mathieu’s $18 million).
