     Summary: The Florida Panthers, this year’s Presidents’ Trophy winners, are a very good team.
Sergei Bobrovsky can shine, but his season goals-against average (GAA) was a 2.67, putting him behind some of his playoff peers.
And he’s struggled in previous postseasons, posting a 3.24 GAA and just a .899 save percentage over his playoff career.
It feels like now or never for this Leafs team and its management.
The Lightning had a good season, but not a great one.
