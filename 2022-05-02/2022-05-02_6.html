     Cardinals WR DeAndre Hopkins suspended 6 games for violating NFL's PED policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended for six games for violating NFL's performance-enhancing drugs policy, the team announced Monday.
He remains eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games and can return to the active roster after the sixth regular-season game next season.
Hopkins has been one of the NFL's best receivers throughout his career.
The Cardinals will be thin at receiver to start the season as Christian Kirk left to sign with the Jaguars in free agency.
However, Arizona traded for receiver Marquise "Hollywood" Brown on Thursday, which will give quarterback Kyler Murray a big-time target with Hopkins now set to miss the first few weeks of the season.

     Arizona Cardinals’ DeAndre Hopkins suspended 6 games for PED violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended six games for violating the NFL’s performance enhancing drug policy, the league announced Monday.
The six-game suspension is a result of a positive test result from an anabolic agent, per the league’s updated PED policy.
Per Spotrac, Hopkins will forfeit $4.05 million in 2022 compensation for the six-game suspension.
Hopkins is coming off an injury-riddled season in which he missed seven games with a hamstring injury and torn MCL.
In 10 games played last season, Hopkins recorded 42 catches for 572 yards and a team-leading eight receiving touchdowns.
