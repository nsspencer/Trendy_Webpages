     Robinson Cano designated for assignment, bringing Mets' roster down to 26 players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Robinson Cano era in Flushing has likely drawn to a close.
As MLB rosters had to be trimmed to 26 players by Monday, Cano was one of the odd men out as the Mets designated him for assignment and optioned reliever Yoan Lopez to Triple-A Syracuse.
It was a difficult call for the Mets, who still owe the 39-year-old infielder around $40.5 million between the 2021 and 2022 seasons.
In his first season with the Mets in 2019, Cano slashed .256/.307/.428 with 13 home runs, 39 RBI and 46 runs in 107 games.

     Mets Designate Robinson Cano For Assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets designated second baseman Robinson Cano for assignment, according to an announcement from the team.
The Mets owe Cano about $37.6MM through 2023, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post.
The Mets have set Cano’s eventual release in motion, so they’ll be eating the money owed to him.
In a deal brokered by agent Brodie Van Wagenen with involvement from newly-certified agent Jay-Z, Cano left the Yankees for a landmark ten-year, $240MM free agent contract with the Mariners.
At the time, the Mets’ new GM was none other than Van Wagenen.
