     Summary: Hence them dropping the full trailer for the film on this Monday morning, which is about a Manhattan Project-like company town and the strange things that happen in there.
Yeah, this is about as far away from Booksmart as you can get in tone, and hey, at least you get to see Harry Styles be hot or something as well.
The 1950’s societal optimism espoused by their CEO, Frank (Pine) — equal partscorporate visionary and motivational life coach — anchors every aspect of daily life in the tight-knit desert utopia.
Life is perfect, with every resident’s needs met by the company.
All they ask in returnis discretion and unquestioning commitment to the Victory cause.

     Don’t Worry Darling Trailer: Florence Pugh and Harry Styles Bring Sexy Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Don’t Worry Darling—Olivia Wilde is here to resurrect the erotic thriller.
Florence Pugh and Harry Styles star as married couple Alice and Jack, whose steamy love scenes are undercut by a sense of domestic dread.
Set to appear alongside Pine, Styles, and Pugh are KiKi Layne, Nick Kroll, Kate Berlant, Sydney Chandler, Asif Ali, Douglas Smith, Timothy Simons, and Ari’el Stachel.
While unveiling the trailer at last week’s CinemaCon presentation, Wilde was suddenly given a manilla folder, labeled “personal and confidential,” while onstage.
Wilde has been romantically involved with Styles since separating from Sudeikis after seven years at the start of 2020.

Don't Worry, Darling Courtesy of Warner Bros. PictureAnyway, Don’t Worry Darling is one of Warner Bros.’ few “not a pure IP flick” arriving in 2022.
At the risk of stating the obvious, if you want Warner Bros.
Discovery to offer up more than just DC superhero movies and New Line horror films, Don’t Worry Darling (which, to be fair, may fall into the New Line horror flick categorization) is a pretty good opportunity to vote with your wallet.

     Summary: The first full (and unsettling) trailer for director and star Olivia Wilde's Don't Worry Darling is here, and if it's anything to go by, it seems the husband-wife duo played by Harry Styles and Florence Pugh have much to worry about.
Jack (Styles) and Alice (Pugh) are shown in a car, doing donuts and kissing while the vehicle careens around an empty road and later, cuddling up in bed.
That's the world and the questions of Don't Worry Darling."
