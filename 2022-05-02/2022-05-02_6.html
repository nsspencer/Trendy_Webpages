     Jordan Poole Has Already Earned His Warriors Extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one season, Jordan Poole has gone from role player to a present and future core piece of the Warriors’ bid to reestablish their dynasty status.
Golden State ($179M) has the highest payroll in the NBA and a league-high $170.3 million luxury tax bill.
The Warriors can delay the extension and make him a restricted free agent during the summer of 2023, but that would put them in risky territory.
Other teams with more cap space would be able to put down an offer sheet that Golden State might not be able to match.
The Warriors will have roughly $11 million in cap space if they pass on an extension this summer — which will give them more flexibility to sign Poole for the right price and duration.

"If Steph Curry can come off the bench, anyone can come off the bench."

     Warriors news: Jordan Poole can't contain excitement over making doubters 'eat their words'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors took Game 1 against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday in thrilling fashion, winning 117-116 despite Draymond Green getting ejected in the first half.
Once again, youngster Jordan Poole proved to be a huge factor in the outcome as he continues to show out in these playoffs.
The guard went off for a team-high 31 points off the bench while going 5 for 10 from downtown.
Many believed he wasn’t the right fit for the Warriors because of his poor shot selection, sub-par passing, and lack of handles.
His name is Jordan Poole.

     Jordan Poole Can Do Everything For The Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This version of the Warriors, though, feels new in one specific and dangerous way: They have Jordan Poole, and Jordan Poole is unfair.
In Golden State’s 117-116 Game 1 victory over Memphis, Poole was the Warrior who most popped off the screen.
Even when Green is around, giving Golden State yet another creator from the perimeter opens up defenses in a way that is hard to game-plan against.
That Poole can punish teams both on his own with shots like the one above or assists like the one to Wiggins only gives the Warriors more firepower.
If they can put the clamps on him, then Golden State becomes more familiar, and easier—not easy, but easier—to defend.

     Summary: National Basketball Association How Warriors' Jordan Poole became key complement to Splash Brothers 8 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkBy Ric BucherFOX Sports NBA WriterThis time, Jordan Poole didn’t need to shoot with the lights off to shoot the lights out.
What makes Jordan Poole and Warriors stand out NBA writer Ethan Strauss joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Jordan Poole's impact and what makes the Golden State Warriors unique across the league.
The Nuggets paid Poole the ultimate compliment by shifting their attention to him in Games 4 and 5.
Head coach Steve Kerr's giving him the same green light afforded Curry and Thompson, Poole said, inspired him not to abuse it.
At one point as he warmed up to face the Nuggets, Poole startled Mullin by bouncing the ball to him as he sat in his courtside seat.
