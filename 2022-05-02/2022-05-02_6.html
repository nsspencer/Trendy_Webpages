     Arizona Cardinals News: DeAndre Hopkins suspended for six games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In some Arizona Cardinals news not related to the 2022 NFL Draft, the team’s top receiver, DeAndre Hopkins, has been suspended for six games.
It’s certainly not the type of Arizona Cardinals news that fans wanted to hear shortly after the conclusion of the 2022 NFL Draft, but the team will now be without star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins for the first six games of the 2022 regular season.
Arizona Cardinals News: Loss of DeAndre Hopkins is devastatingA big reason for Arizona’s collapse during the second half of the 2021 season was due to the absence of Hopkins, who missed seven games due to injury.
Now, Arizona has to figure out how they’re going to make up for the loss of Hopkins during the first six games of the 2022 season.
Luckily, the Cardinals did just acquire wide receiver Marquise Brown from the Baltimore Ravens.
