     Cardinals WR DeAndre Hopkins suspended 6 games for violating NFL's PED policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals receiver DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended for six games for violating NFL's performance-enhancing drugs policy, the team announced Monday.
He remains eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games and can return to the active roster after the sixth regular-season game next season.
"I apologize to Cardinals fans, my teammates and the entire Cardinals organization," Hopkins said in a statement.
Hopkins has been one of the NFL's best receivers throughout his career.
The Cardinals will be thin at receiver to start the season as Christian Kirk left to sign with the Jaguars in free agency.
