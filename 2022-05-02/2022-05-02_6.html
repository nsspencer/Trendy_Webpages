     Match report: Manchester United v Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was almost a dreadful start for United with Brentford coming close just 10 seconds into the match.
From the Bees’ kick-off, the ball found Christian Eriksen and his brilliant floating pass over our defence fed Bryan Mbeumo.
With the striker ready to pull the trigger, in stepped Alex Telles to block the early goal chance.
Dalot’s early deliveries were impeccable and the right-back sent a well-timed beauty to meet Anthony Elanga’s run behind the Brentford defence.
Two headers, one from Mbeumo and one from Ivan Toney, meant United were not having it completely our own way.

     How Manchester United beat Brentford in the Premier League tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo starred as Manchester United ended a disappointing home season with a comfortable 3-0 win over Brentford in their final game at Old Trafford.
Bruno Fernandes volleyed United ahead in the ninth minute after excellent work from Diogo Dalot and Anthony Elanga, and for the first time in a while the United players looked like they were enjoying themselves.
Ronaldo produced a number of extravagant flicks before having a goal disallowed for offside on the stroke of half-time.
He got his 18th league goal of the season in the 61st minute, smashing home a penalty after he was clumsily fouled by Rico Henry.
The French defender Raphael Varane then volleyed his first goal for the club to make it 3-0.

     Manchester United vs. Brentford score: United get three points, but issues linger for Red Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a two-minute span, Manchester United fullback Diogo Dalot perfectly encapsulated what the 2021-22 campaign has been like for the Red Devils -- full of miscues.
Had it been a game of darts, he would have missed the board … and the wall from which it hangs.
This is Manchester United, a giant in world soccer, reduced to an average team and a fan base holding onto past memories of dominance.
When the 74th minute came, those holding the sign were still there, failing to even do what they set out to.
Throughout this season, the team has not managed to gel, and Monday was no different.

     Cristiano Ronaldo shows staying power as Manchester United see off Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are only two ways Manchester United can ease this miserable season.
“It was also the players on the pitch, three creative central midfielders with Juan Mata, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic.
A throw-in, a corner from the right and one from the left ensued for Brentford, United continuing to scramble to clear.
The Portuguese smashed the penalty in for his 18th league goal of the season and United were cruising.
“I’m not finished,” Ronaldo said to the TV cameras afterwards, perhaps to those who write him off.

     Summary: Shaka Hislop discusses if Monday's win over Brentford was Cristiano Ronaldo's last game at Old Trafford with Manchester United.
(1:06)Manchester United beat Brentford 3-0 on a rainy Monday night at Old Trafford with Portugal internationals Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo scoring to keep their team in sixth place in the Premier League.

Brentford have 40 points from 35 games and may need one more win to ensure they not dragged into a relegation fight.
