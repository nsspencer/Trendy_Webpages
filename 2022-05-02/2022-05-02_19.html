     Low water levels reveal body in barrel at Lake Mead, officials say more are likely to be found
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The plunging water level in Lake Mead -- the country's largest reservoir, besieged by drought -- unveiled another disturbing discovery over the weekend, police say: a body in a barrel.
A person who was spending time at the lake Sunday afternoon found the barrel, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Homicide Lieutenant Ray Spencer.
Investigators believe the body to be that of a homicide victim from the 1980s, based on the items recovered from the barrel, Spencer says.
"The lake has drained dramatically over the last 15 years," Spencer said, noting that "it's likely that we will find additional bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead" as the water level drops more.
"The barrel was likely dropped hundreds of yards off the shore back then," Spencer said, "but that area is now considered the shoreline."

     Body From 1980s Homicide Is Found in Barrel at Lake Mead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A metal barrel containing the remains of a person killed in the 1980s was found on Sunday on the shore of Nevada’s Lake Mead, a discovery that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said was made possible by an ongoing drought.
“It’s really odd in the sense that had the lake never receded, we would never have discovered the body,” Lt. Ray Spencer of the Police Department said by phone on Monday.
He declined to share details about the victim, including a possible age, sex or specific cause of death.
It’s clear that the person “died as a result of a homicide,” he said, but he would not share how that was determined.
Based on items recovered inside the barrel, investigators believe the victim was killed in the 1980s, Lieutenant Spencer said.

     Summary: A barrel containing a body was exposed as the level of Nevada's Lake Mead dropsEnlarge this image toggle caption Southern Nevada Water Authority via AP/AP Southern Nevada Water Authority via AP/APLAS VEGAS — A body inside a barrel was found over the weekend on the the newly exposed bottom of Nevada's Lake Mead as drought depletes one of the largest U.S. reservoirs — and officials predicted the discovery could be just the first of more grim finds.
"I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains," Las Vegas police Lt. Ray Spencer told KLAS-TV on Monday.
The lake's level has dropped so much that the uppermost water intake at drought-stricken Lake Mead became visible last week.
The reservoir on the Colorado River behind Hoover Dam has become so depleted that Las Vegas is now pumping water from deeper within Lake Mead, which also stretches into Arizona.
Police plan to reach out to experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to analyze when the barrel started eroding.

     Las Vegas authorities: Barrel containing human remains discovered in Lake Mead amid drought, more corpses likely to turn up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Authorities in Las Vegas say a barrel containing human remains was discovered in Lake Mead and more could turn up amid a drought that's caused the lake to reach historic lows.
They are working with Las Vegas police.
Las Vegas police told 8 News Now the person was likely killed in the 1980s based on items found in the barrel, though authorities did not elaborate.
The low water levels also recently caused an intake valve to be exposed in Lake Mead, a troubling discovery that threatens water being transported and processed.
Water from Lake Mead drains into valves located toward the bottom of the lake.

     Human remains found in barrel as Lake Mead drops to historic low amid drought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A barrel containing human remains was discovered in Nevada’s Lake Mead over the weekend as a historic drought grips the West.
The receding waters at Lake Mead, the country’s largest artificial reservoir, have dropped to historic lows.
He did not give further details about the person’s identity or how the remains ended up in a barrel at the bottom of Lake Mead.
“Most of the body was fully intact, and we have recovered the entire body,” Spencer said.
These conditions have resulted in significant water level declines at major system reservoirs, including Lake Mead and Lake Powell.”The worsening megadrought is causing water districts to restrict usage.
