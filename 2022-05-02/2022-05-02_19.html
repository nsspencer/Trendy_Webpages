     Authorities issue warrant for Alabama corrections officer who disappeared with inmate: What we know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Authorities on Monday issued an arrest warrant for a missing corrections officer who disappeared with an inmate from a northern Alabama jail last week.
The charges against the officer include permitting or facilitating escape of the inmate, Singleton said.
Marshals Service was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the inmate and the location of the "missing and endangered" corrections officer.
Casey White, 38, was serving a 75-year prison sentence for kidnapping and attempted murder charges when he vanished.
He is believed to be a "serious threat to the corrections officer and the public," according to Marty Keely, the U.S. marshal for northern Alabama.
