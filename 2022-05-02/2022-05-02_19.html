     Blac Chyna awarded no damages in defamation case against Kardashians
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Los Angeles jury on Monday found that Kim Kardashian and her family did not unjustly harm the career of model Blac Chyna.
The civil panel had been deliberating since Thursday and returned verdicts in favor of Kardashian, her mother, Kris Jenner, and her sisters Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.
After the verdict, attorneys for the Kardashian and Jenner family “expressed appreciation” for the jury and said they were “thankful for the steady hand” of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gregory Alarcon.
A second season of “Rob &amp; Chyna” was in production when they broke up in 2017 and the show was scrapped.
Jurors concluded there wasn't enough evidence to find that the defendants lied about Chyna allegedly abusing Rob Kardashian or spread word of the abuse with reckless disregard for the truth.
