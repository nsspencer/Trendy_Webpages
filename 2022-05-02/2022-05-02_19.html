     Summary: MIDDLETOWN – Russian President Vladimir Putin has cancer and will be undergoing surgery during which time he will transfer power to one of his topmilitary leaders.
Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Monday told Mid-Hudson News he is not upset by Putin’s health announcement.
“If there is one person on this earth who I would wish a bad diagnosis on it’s Vladimir Putin.
Vladimir Putin is a war criminal,” he said.
Maloney said Putin will get what’s coming to him either on this earth or in the afterlife.

     Report: Putin faces cancer surgery; his temporary fill in won't 'do anything rash'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin, long rumored to be ill, is set to undergo cancer surgery, the New York Post is reporting.
The paper is basing its scoop on a video off the mysterious Telegram channel “General SVR” that claims the Russian leader is so sick he must designate a temporary fill-in.
That person is Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian federal police’s Security Council, the Post adds.
“It was one of the most amazing meetings I ever had,” Stoffer said of a counter-terrorism mission to Russia.
As for Putin, the anticipated surgery and recovery are expected to incapacitate him for “a short time,” according to the unconfirmed report the Post adds.

     Summary: The Biden administration says it has no information to indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin will temporarily transfer power while receiving cancer treatment.
The Telegram channel posted a video on Saturday that said Putin had been advised by his doctors to have an operation for his cancer, according to the New York Post.
Patrushev is described as being "an outright villian" who is "no better than Vladimir Putin," according to the outlet.
Putin is claimed to have started bathing in the blood of deer antlers, a practice commonly used in the Altai region of Russia.

     Putin To Undergo Cancer Treatment, Hand Over Power, Claims US Media Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A New York Post report claimed Russian President Valdimir Putin may get cancer treatment (File)Russian President Vladimir Putin might undergo cancer surgery while temporarily handing over power to the secretary of the country's Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, an unverified report by US's New York Post has claimed.
The anticipated surgery and recovery are expected to incapacitate Putin for "a short time," the report said.
However, a US official said that the media reports could not be verified with Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby saying on Monday that "I have seen nothing that could help us corroborate that," New York Post reported.
A few days ago, Putin allegedly had a two-hour "heart-to-heart" conversation with Nikolai Patrushev, the New York Post report said citing a Telegram post.
Like Putin, Patrushev is a career Russian intelligence agent, first with the Soviet KGB, then later with the Russian FSB, the report said citing Moscow Times.
