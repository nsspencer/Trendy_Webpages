     Summary: (KNSI) — May is Mental Health Awareness Month, aiming to fight stigma, provide support, educate the public, and advocate for policies that support people with mental illness and their families.
Like outward signs of physical illness, therapists say it’s important to look for signs when someone we know might be struggling with mental illness.
The Mayo Clinic says sometimes mental health disorder symptoms appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.
Mental health professionals also say saving a mental health crisis line in your cell phone contacts is a good idea in case you or someone you know needs that resource.
Mental health crisis resources:Central Minnesota Mental Health Center’s 24/7 crisis line for Sherburne, Benton, Stearns and Wright counties: 1-800-635-8008National crisis text line: Text MN to 741741National talk line: 1-800-273-8255 Veterans can also call that number and press 1.

     Summary: MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - May is Mental Health Awareness Month to recognize and spread the word that mental health is something that affects everyone.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health is raising awareness about the connection between mental health and community support.
This year’s theme for Mental Health Awareness month is “Together for Mental Health,” urging us to use this month to advocate for mental health and access to care.
