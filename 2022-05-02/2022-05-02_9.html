     DeAndre Hopkins suspended six games for violating PED policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per ESPN’s Adam Schefter, DeAndre Hopkins has been suspended six games for violating the league’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.
Hopkins, who was traded to the Cardinals during the 2020 offseason, was on the field for just 10 games in 2021 while dealing with a hamstring injury and a knee injury.
He finished the year with 42 receptions for 572 yards with eight touchdowns.
In 2020, Hopkins had 115 receptions for 1,407 yards with six TDs.
The Cardinals used their first selection of the 2022 draft on a pass catcher, though Colorado State’s Trey McBride is a tight end.

     NFL hands DeAndre Hopkins six-game suspension for PED violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeAndre Hopkins is facing a six-game suspension from the NFL due to a PED violation, Adam Schefter reports.
The news breaks just days after the Cardinals made a move to acquire WR Marquise Brown in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens.
The three-time All-Pro wide receiver has spent the last two seasons with the Cardinals, amassing 1,979 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns in his 26 games active.
However, he spent much of the 2021 season battling a hamstring issue before suffering a torn MCL that ended his season in Week 14.
Hopkins’ suspension will be a huge hit to his fantasy football value, particularly in redraft leagues, where he’ll be taking up space on managers’ rosters for that six-game span to start the season.

     DeAndre Hopkins Suspended Six Games For PED Violation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeAndre Hopkins is being suspended six games for a violation of the league’s Performance Enhancing Drug policy (Twitter link via ESPN’s Adam Schefter).
As Schefter notes, that transaction becomes perhaps less surprising given the news of Hopkins’ suspension.
In years past, four games was the benchmark for suspension lengths regarding PED usage.
Hopkins becomes the second big-name wideout to receive a notable ban this offseason.
Calvin Ridley will be sidelined for at least the entire 2022 campaign after he wagered on NFL games.
