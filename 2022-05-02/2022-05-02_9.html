     New York Mets designate struggling Robinson Cano for assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:30)NEW YORK -- The Mets have designated struggling infielder Robinson Cano for assignment.
Relegated to a part-time role this season, Cano was a casualty of the crunch as the first-place Mets chose to keep younger, more versatile bench players instead.
"He's been around for so long in this game and he's an icon here in New York," Mets utility man J.D.
The Mets acquired Cano from the Mariners in 2018, in a trade that also brought closer Edwin Diaz to New York.
In three seasons with the Mets, Cano hit .269 with 24 home runs and 72 RBIs.

     Mets Designate Robinson Cano For Assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mets designated second baseman Robinson Cano for assignment, according to an announcement from the team.
The Mets owe Cano about $37.6MM through 2023, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post.
The Mets have set Cano’s eventual release in motion, so they’ll be eating the money owed to him.
In a deal brokered by agent Brodie Van Wagenen with involvement from newly-certified agent Jay-Z, Cano left the Yankees for a landmark ten-year, $240MM free agent contract with the Mariners.
At the time, the Mets’ new GM was none other than Van Wagenen.
