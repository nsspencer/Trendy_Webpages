    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Safety Tyrann Mathieu is expected to sign a contract with the New Orleans Saints, according to multiple reports.
He was born in New Orleans and grew up there, and starred for the LSU Tigers in Baton Rouge, La.
ESPN was the first to report the news of the Saints' recent interest in Mathieu, after he visited with them in April.
In 120 career games, Mathieu has totaled 610 tackles, including 41 for a loss, with 26 interceptions and 10 sacks.
He has been appointed to the AP all-pro first team three times and is also a three-time Pro Bowler.

     Saints Expected to Sign Tyrann Mathieu, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Veteran safety Tyrann Mathieu will sign with the Saints in the coming days, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
The momentum for a deal between New Orleans and the two-time All-Pro safety gained steam prior to the NFL draft, and the contract was reached as anticipated on Monday.
Mathieu initially visited New Orleans in April and also had a visit with Philadelphia.
However, once a deal was not reached with either of the two clubs, it remained a mystery where Mathieu would play in 2022.

     Saints expected to sign Tyrann Mathieu to three-year deal, filling hole with Pro Bowl safety, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pro Bowl safety is expected to sign with the New Orleans Saints in the coming days, according to the NFL Network.
The reason Mathieu may not immediately be signing with the Saints is due to the compensatory pick formula, which is set to expire at 4 p.m.
Once the Saints finalize their deal with Mathieu, he's expected to land a three-year, $33 million deal, per ESPN.
Mathieu has spent the last three seasons in the NFL as a cornerstone piece to the Kansas City Chiefs defense.
This offseason, the Chiefs elected to move on from Mathieu and sign fellow safety Justin Reid to a three-year, $31.5 million contract.

     Saints signing All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu to three-year, $33M contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three-time All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu is signing with the New Orleans Saints, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday, per a source.
Rapoport later reported that Mathieu will receive a three-year, $33 million contract from the Saints.
Rapoport adds that the Saints were always the favorite to land Mathieu, who also met virtually with the Eagles.
Mathieu, 29, heads to NOLA to play alongside Marcus Maye, who was signed to a three-year pact in March amid free agency's first wave.
Heading into his 10th NFL season, Mathieu adds even more leadership to a veteran-heavy Saints defense.

     New Orleans Saints fill biggest need by bringing safety Tyrann Mathieu home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dan Graziano shares his thoughts on reports that Tyrann Mathieu and the New Orleans Saints have agreed to a deal.
But that’s exactly what the New Orleans Saints did by agreeing to a deal with free-agent safety, and local icon, Tyrann Mathieu.
Safety Tyrann Mathieu has agreed to terms to join his hometown New Orleans Saints.
“From an old-school football perspective, Marcus Maye has the physical profile of a strong safety and Tyrann Mathieu has the physical profile of a slot/free safety.
“Mathieu has different traits than Marcus Williams (who was more of a deep center fielder) but is a more high-level playmaker than Marcus Williams.
