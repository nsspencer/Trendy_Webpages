     Summary: MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - May is Mental Health Awareness Month to recognize and spread the word that mental health is something that affects everyone.

     Summary: (KNSI) — May is Mental Health Awareness Month, aiming to fight stigma, provide support, educate the public, and advocate for policies that support people with mental illness and their families.
Like outward signs of physical illness, therapists say it’s important to look for signs when someone we know might be struggling with mental illness.
The Mayo Clinic says sometimes mental health disorder symptoms appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.
Mental health professionals also say saving a mental health crisis line in your cell phone contacts is a good idea in case you or someone you know needs that resource.
Mental health crisis resources:Central Minnesota Mental Health Center’s 24/7 crisis line for Sherburne, Benton, Stearns and Wright counties: 1-800-635-8008National crisis text line: Text MN to 741741National talk line: 1-800-273-8255 Veterans can also call that number and press 1.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — One in five U.S. adults experience mental illness each year, and an estimated 178,000 Rhode Island adults have a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
“Very oftentimes, people don’t report or speak about the mental health struggles that they are experiencing, due to stigma.
Lamarre said the newest fact sheet with data on mental health in Rhode Island will be available in the coming weeks.
The groups are peer-led and for people or family experiencing mental health conditions themselves, or supporting someone with a mental health condition.
When celebrities or well-known figures in the community open up about mental health, Lamarre said it can encourage others to do the same and seek help.
