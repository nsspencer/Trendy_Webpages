Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Monday told Mid-Hudson News he is not upset by Putin’s health announcement.

Vladimir Putin is a war criminal,” he said.

     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin, long rumored to be ill, is set to undergo cancer surgery, the New York Post is reporting.
The paper is basing its scoop on a video off the mysterious Telegram channel “General SVR” that claims the Russian leader is so sick he must designate a temporary fill-in.
That person is Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian federal police’s Security Council, the Post adds.
“It was one of the most amazing meetings I ever had,” Stoffer said of a counter-terrorism mission to Russia.
As for Putin, the anticipated surgery and recovery are expected to incapacitate him for “a short time,” according to the unconfirmed report the Post adds.
