     WWE Likely to Sign Cody Rhodes After AEW Departure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     -- Former AEW Executive VP Cody Rhodes announced this morning that he will not be returning to the promotion, departing after a successful two year stint.
As reported earlier today, WWE officials have already been in discussions with Rhodes - whose contract expires late last year - on a possible return to the promotion though it was unclear if that was the likely option or if Rhodes was going to go elsewhere or even retire.
-- The WrestleVotes Twitter account tweeted today that in an even more shocking development, WWE is expected to come to an agreement with Cody Rhodes to bring him back.

     Cody Rhodes Might Be Coming To WWE A Lot Sooner Than We Thought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest on the situation came from Sports Illustrated , which is reporting that while his wife Brandi Rhodes will not join the WWE, Cody Rhodes does appear to be officially heading back to his former employers.
If that's the case, it adds credence to PWTorch ’s report claiming the WWE already has huge plans for Rhodes’ return.
Cody Rhodes is a key player in the real-life feud between AEW and WWE, so his return storyline basically writes itself.
It’s unknown at this time whether or not Cody Rhodes will participate in WrestleMania 38, but for the record, there is potential opening for that to happen.
It’s hard to imagine the WWE would miss an opportunity to showcase Cody Rhodes in as high-stakes a match as possible if he’s willing to do it.

     ✖Cody Rhodes and his wife, Brandi Rhodes, officially departed from AEW this week after being founding members of the company back in 2019.
Sports Illustrated provided a new report on Wednesday shedding some more light on the situation while also giving a WWE update.
SI's Justin Barrasso wrote that "sources close to the situation have confirmed" Rhodes is heading back to WWE, but neither he nor the company itself have confirmed it as of yet.
Rhodes released a statement shortly after Khan confirmed his departure — "I have loved my time at AEW.

Insanity is the best way to describe the kaleidoscope of events that make Cody and Brandi insane, having their blinders on and not quite seeing this now-normalized wrestling landscape.
AdvertisementRegardless of your thoughts on the Rhodes family, they’re no longer tied to AEW in any way.
You can’t fault not giving into whatever Cody and Brandi wanted, regardless of how responsible they are for AEW’s existence.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cody Rhodes has left AEW.
Who knows if all of this is the truth, but one thing is clear - Cody Rhodes leaving AEW is massive, and where he goes will be equally consequential.
It sucks, and I’m surprised that Cody Rhodes is rumoured to return to an environment that he once all but swore to leave behind.
I imagine Vince McMahon is keenly aware of Cody Rhodes’ popularity and the growing relevance of AEW.
Cody Rhodes was a fundamental part of that movement, so returning to the land that once all but forced him out will change how we perceive things forever.

     It’s quite the legacy that Cody Rhodes has made for himself and he did it through sheer force of will.
Is Cody Rhodes going to walk onto Raw on his first night back and challenge Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship?
Will Cody Rhodes be The American Nightmare, the well-dressed heel with his wife on one arm, and the title on the other?
The fact is that it’s far too early to know what will happen with Cody Rhodes.
But Cody Rhodes is different and this time, maybe that will make all the difference.

     Cody Rhodes’s Shocking AEW Departure Sets Up Even More Shocking WWE Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If he ever utters a mention of AEW, McMahon is quick to criticize.
If you need another reminder that AEW is on McMahon’s radar, look no further than WWE’s soon-to-be newest superstar, Cody Rhodes.
WWE controlled the “Cody Rhodes” name despite the fact it was the one his father, Dusty Rhodes, used throughout his legendary career (inside and outside WWE).
For Rhodes, AEW represented another chance to pay homage to his father as a booker while also further cementing his own legacy.
Once Rhodes signs with WWE, which is expected, it will mark the first major free agent defection from AEW to WWE.
