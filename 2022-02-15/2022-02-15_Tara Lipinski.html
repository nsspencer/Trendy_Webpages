    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The former Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, who have for years provided the cheery and chatty soundtrack to NBC’s coverage of Olympic figure skating, took a starkly different tone when Kamila Valieva of Russia was on the ice in the women’s single short program on Tuesday.
“All I feel like I can say is that was the short program of Kamila Valieva at the Olympics,” Weir said after her routine ended.
“We are so sorry it is overshadowing your Olympics,” Weir chimed in.
Despite stumbling on her opening jump, a triple axel, Valieva went on to finish first in the short program.
She leads her Russian teammate, Anna Shcherbakova, and a Japanese skater, Kaori Sakamoto, heading into Thursday’s free skate.

     Typically NBC’s Olympic skating analysts Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir never stop talking.
While Gannon treads a middle ground, Lipinski and Weir did notWhen Valieva was done, she broke down in tears.
“We have to remind ourselves that she is just 15 years old, a minor, and I know more than any what it’s like to compete in an Olympic Games at 15 years old, but a positive test is a positive test.
She cannot skate.”Not only did Valieva skate, she skated well, and is in first placeBut she could, and she did — exceptionally well.
And some thought Lipinski and Weir were abandoning their responsibilities as the high-profile faces of NBC during the highest-profile competition at the Winter Games.
