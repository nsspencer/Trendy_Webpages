     P.J. O’Rourke, Conservative Political Satirist, Dies at 74
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     O’Rourke, the conservative satirist and political commentator who was unafraid to skewer Democrats and Republicans alike in best-selling books like “Parliament of Whores,” in articles for a wide range of magazines and newspapers, and on television and radio talk shows, died on Tuesday at his home in Sharon, N.H.
The cause was complications of lung cancer, said Deb Seager, the director of publicity at Grove/Atlantic, Mr. O’Rourke’s publisher.
Mr. O’Rourke’s political writing was in the caustic tradition of H.L.
O’Rourke” — but he was widely admired by readers of many stripes because of his fearless style and his willingness to mock just about anyone who deserved it, including himself.
In “Republican Party Reptile” he recalled his youthful flirtation with Mao Zedong.

     This euphoric passage from that piece, about overtaking a Porsche, is as good a snippet of O’Rourke’s high style as any:We came by a 930 Turbo Porsche near the Talladega exit.
He was as game as anybody we came across and was hanging right on our tail at 120.
He was a detector of dichotomies, when he wasn’t camped out like Graham Greene in a hotel bar.
“Each American embassy comes with two permanent features,” he wrote: “a giant anti-American demonstration and a giant line for American visas.”O’Rourke’s conservatism wasn’t doctrinaire.
“She’s wrong about absolutely everything,” he said, “but she’s wrong within normal parameters.” About Trump he said, “This man just can’t be president.

     He was the funniest guy, very warm, very generous”When Alex Bass died in July 2017, his sister Kitty Cloud asked O’Rourke to write the obituary.
“Alex attended Dublin School in Dublin, NH and St. Albans School in Washington, DC where his Yankee stubbornness got him in continual trouble with school officials,” O’Rourke wrote.
O’Rourke also bought a lot of books at Toadstool, Williams said, particularly from the store’s used-book section.
In May 2019, O’Rourke spoke for Peterborough Town Library and the 1833 Society during a fundraiser for the library renovation project.
“It was a dignified place where life wasn’t stupid and I wasn’t treated as if I were stupid, even though I was pretty stupid at the time.”Bass said she hadn’t seen O’Rourke much lately because he had been traveling.

     Armed with pithy one-liners and a slashing style, Mr. O’Rourke worked in the tradition of H.L.
He also appeared as a conservative pundit on the “Point/Counterpoint” segment of “60 Minutes.”Far from exempting the right wing from criticism, Mr. O’Rourke often went after conservative politicians and pundits, including Ann Coulter.
His father was a Buick salesman who died when Mr. O’Rourke was 9, and his mother was a school administrator.
Well, God, what a strange person I would be if I hadn’t, you know?”Soon after joining National Lampoon in 1973, he partnered with Douglas Kenney to edit a spinoff project, “National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody,” which sold some 2 million copies.
While Mr. O’Rourke cultivated a persona as a hot-tempered libertine, “he was a deeply kind and generous man who pretended to be a curmudgeon for public consumption,” “Wait Wait” host Peter Sagal wrote on Twitter.

     P. J. O’Rourke, You Will Be Missed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     R.I.P., P. J. O’RourkeBy the standards of the American political culture of 2022, P. J. O’Rourke seems like an impossible figure: a libertarian-conservative writer known first and foremost for being hilarious, who wrote for the biggest and most mainstream publications — Vanity Fair, Playboy, House and Garden, Inquiry, Car and Driver, Men’s Journal, The Atlantic.
Speaking of punching, O’Rourke almost always punched up — unlike some other celebrated satirists of our age.
In a Vanity Fair profile of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, O’Rourke wrote, “Life is not simple, let alone love.
By loudly denouncing all bad things — war and hunger and date rape — liberals testify to their own terrific goodness.
The passage of P. J. O’Rourke is a grim reminder of how much our culture has changed from when he burst upon the scene in the 1970s, and of the cultural waters he thrived in until very recently.
