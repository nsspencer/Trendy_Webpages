     Sports Illustrated’s Duke Covers Under Coach K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Legendary Duke men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski is retiring at the end of the 2021–22 season, and Sports Illustrated has honored his iconic career by putting him on the cover of the magazine’s March issue.
This is not the first time Coach K has appeared on the cover of SI; in 2011 (with Pat Summitt, as SI Sportspersons of the Year) and ’14 (with then Blue Devils freshman Jabari Parker), he did as well.
His Duke teams and players have additionally been featured many times during his tenure, starting with the March 17, 1986, issue.
SI has rounded up every time Duke men’s basketball was prominently featured on the cover under Krzyzewski—including after all five of his national championships, the first of which came in 1991 and most recent of which came in 2015.

     Duke basketball needs last second heroics as Coach K departs early

     Duke basketball class now includes a trio of No.
1 recruits by Matt GilesThe Duke basketball team needed last-second heroics to hang on against Wake Forest.
Tuesday night was a weird night inside Cameron Indoor Stadium as the Duke basketball team battled a Wake Forest (20-7, 10-6 ACC) team that desperately needed a victory to improve its NCAA Tournament resume.
However, head coach Mike Krzyzewski was feeling ill throughout the first half, getting assistance from the trainers throughout the opening 20 minutes, and did not come out of the locker room to coach the second half.
ALSO READ: Reports show controversy picking Coach K successorMoore went on to tell the media in his post-game availability that he thinks the Duke head coach had IVs in the locker room during the second half.

     Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski does not return to the court after halftime as he was not feeling well.
In the locker room at halftime, however, Moore said Krzyzewski experienced dizziness and that the team was informed assistant Jon Scheyer would coach the rest of the way.
Our guys were focused on getting the win for Coach and for our team."
Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes said he noticed early in the second half that Krzyzewski hadn't returned to bench and was concerned about his well-being.
Scheyer said he spoke with Krzyzewski after the game and the coach was feeling better.

     More On Ian O’Connell’s Book About Coach K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Here’s another article about Ian O’Connell’s upcoming book about Mike Krzyzewski, Duke’s iconic coach who is set to retire when Duke’s season ends.
Well, we can’t read the book obviously, as it’s not out yet.
Then there’s a suggestion that Coach K was “jealous” of Quin Snyder and “snapped” at Snyder more than any other player or coach.
Coach K jealous of Quin Snyder?
In the next paragraph the article says that Snyder and former assistant Tim O’Toole helped Coach K overhaul his recruiting philosophy in the mid 1990s to “sign players who didn’t come from traditional Duke backgrounds.“ Why would jealous Coach K let Snyder do something so critical?

     Mark Williams tips in game-winning basket to lift Duke men's basketball over Wake Forest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a slim difference between shot and game clock, Wake Forest's Alondes Williams drove to the rim to get fouled by Duke’s Mark Williams.
Mark Williams was right there to flush it back in with just four-tenths of a second to go.
The second half began as the first half ended, with an even scoring distribution and cool-headed ball control, but the lead wasn’t safe quite yet.
The Blue Devils (22-4, 12-3 in the ACC) kept up the offensive machine with strong interior defense.
The Blue Devils final stat sheet featured five players in double-digits, led by 16 from Moore.

     Duke toppled Wake Forest once again on Tuesday night and, once again, the Blue Devils did it without an ailing Mike Krzyzewski.
9 Blue Devils played the second half without Krzyzewski coaching them after he fell ill during the first half.
After losing ACC home games to Miami (76-74) last month and Virginia (69-68) last week, the Blue Devils finished off a close win this time.
On Tuesday night, the Blue Devils (22-4, 12-3 ACC) maintained their hold on first place in the ACC with a second win over the Demon Deacons (20-7, 10-6 ACC).
When Griffin hit another 3-pointer, Duke led 26-15 with 6:36 to play in the half.

     Duke Baseball: Ready For The Next Step?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chris Pollard is starting his 10th season as head coach of the Duke baseball program.
Once in 2018 and twice in 2019 Duke was one win away from that step and couldn’t get that win.
Pollard says Duke got in on Mooney early and built a relationship that withstood the attractions of the pros.
He’s a great competitor with a really good motor,” a “really good teammate, a really good leader.”Crabtree calls Mooney “an absolute stud,” while Johnson says “there isn’t a play he can’t make.”But one stud doesn’t make a great class.
Johnson was in the bullpen last season (seven saves) but Pollard says Duke has been “building Marcus up as a starter.
