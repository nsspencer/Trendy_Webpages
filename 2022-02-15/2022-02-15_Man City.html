     Report: Man City Offer Made For Brazilian Savio Who Has Also Been Eyed By Arsenal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Report: Man City Offer Made For Brazilian Savio Who Has Also Been Eyed By ArsenalManchester City are reportedly favorites to beat Arsenal to the signing of highly-rated Brazilian winger Savio.
Arsenal and the Red Bull group, owners of RB Leipzig and RB Salzburg, both made contact with Atletico in December regarding their interest in Savio, according to a report by The Guardian.
European clubs cannot formally sign Brazilian players until their 18th birthday and Savio will reach that age in April, so there is nothing to delay a summer transfer.
City already have three senior Brazilians in their first team squad, in goalkeeper Ederson, midfielder Fernandinho and striker Gabriel Jesus.
Kayky, who has made substitute appearances in wins at Swindon and Norwich this year, joined City from Fluminense last summer.

     MANCHESTER CITY have called on Chilean side Santiago City to change their badge due to stark similarities with their own, according to reports.

As a result, Man City unveiled their new badge for the start of the 2016-17 campaign - Pep Guardiola's first season in charge.
But since then Chilean third tier side Santiago City have adopted a strikingly similar badge.
The legal letter sent from City’s lawyers and published in Chile said; “The design you are using cannot co-exist with Manchester City trademarks.

So in a long competition like the Premier League, at the end when you win you are the best.
But in Champions League ... the smallest difference the next game for the result it changes everything.
It's a clear message from Guardiola: Don't judge this team on whether it wins the Champions League.

     Manchester City have issued a cease and desist warning to a Chilean third division club over striking similarities between the clubs’ crests.
Santiago City, who have yet to play a professional game, are accused of confusing the public with marketing that suggests they are part of the City Football Group (CFG).
The Santiago City badge heavily resembles City’s, who alleged an ‘unauthorised use of trademark and characteristic design’.
City insisted in the letter that no Chilean side had been added to their CFG roster, something recognised by Santiago’s lawyer.
Santiago’s lawyer told El Deportivo that the club are seeking an amicable resolution to the dispute.
