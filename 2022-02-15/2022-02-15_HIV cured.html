     A Woman Is Cured of H.I.V. Using a Novel Treatment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A woman of mixed race appears to be the third person ever to be cured of H.I.V., using a new transplant method involving umbilical cord blood that opens up the possibility of curing more people of diverse racial backgrounds than was previously possible, scientists announced on Tuesday.
Most donors in registries are of Caucasian origin, so allowing for only a partial match has the potential to cure dozens of Americans who have both H.I.V.
The woman, who also had leukemia, received cord blood to treat her cancer.
She also received blood from a close relative to give her body temporary immune defenses while the transplant took.
Researchers presented some of the details of the new case on Tuesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver, Colo.

     Researchers announce fourth person possibly cured of HIV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Researchers have announced another case of someone who appears to have been rid of HIV via a stem cell transplant.
WASHINGTON — U.S. researchers say that for the first time, a woman is in remission for HIV and is possibly cured of the virus, using a cutting-edge stem cell transplant method.
According to the NIH, the woman was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and underwent the stem cell treatment in 2017.
HIV attacks and hides within the immune system, so an immune system with HIV-resistant cells means that the virus has nowhere to multiply.
This is the third reported case of a potential cure for HIV using stem cell transplant therapy and the fourth case overall.

     Woman cured of HIV after stem cell transplant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A patient with leukaemia in the United States has become the first woman and the third person to date to be cured of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant, researchers say.
The two prior cases occurred in males, one white and one Latino, who had received adult stem cells more frequently used in bone marrow transplants.
Lewin said that while bone marrow transplants are not a viable strategy to cure most people living with HIV, the report “confirms that a cure for HIV is possible and further strengthens using gene therapy as a viable strategy for an HIV cure”.
Previously, scientists believed that a common stem cell transplant side-effect called graft versus host disease – in which the donor immune system attacks the recipient’s immune system – played a role in a possible cure.
“Taken together, these three cases of a cure post stem cell transplant all help in teasing out the various components of the transplant that were absolutely key to a cure,” Lewin said.

     Third Transplant Patient Cured of HIV Marks Important Firsts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Feb. 16, 2022 -- This week’s news that a third person has been “cured” of HIV through a unique transplant of stem cells has given hope for a larger-scale way to beat back the HIV epidemic that has plagued the world for decades.
Researcher Yvonne Bryson, MD, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA, told those attending a conference on infectious diseases Tuesday that this case is special.
The patient was a woman living with HIV who is multiracial.
The woman in this case was given transplants of stem cells and umbilical cord blood to treat leukemia.
The treatment not only sent her cancer into remission, but her HIV as well.

     Third Person 'Cured' of HIV via Transplant

     "This is the third known case of HIV-1 remission, the first known case in a woman of mixed race, and the first known case with haplo-cord CCR5-∆32∆32 stem cell transplant," she said.
"Broader use of CCR5-∆32∆32 haplo-cord transplantation should be considered to achieve HIV-1 remission and cure for persons living with HIV-1 requiring stem cell transplant for other diseases."
"A bone marrow transplant is not a viable large-scale strategy for curing HIV," she cautioned, "but it does present a proof-of-concept that HIV can be cured.
"This person happened to have an underlying disease that required a stem cell transplant," Fauci explained.

     Scientists have possibly cured HIV in a woman for the first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An American research team reported that it has possibly cured HIV in a woman for the first time.
Their patient stepped into a rarified club that includes three men whom scientists have cured, or very likely cured, of HIV.
The adult stem cells flourish rapidly, but over time they are entirely replaced by cord blood cells.
Multiple ultrasensitive tests can detect no sign in the woman’s immune cells of any HIV capable of replicating, nor can the researchers detect any HIV antibodies or immune cells programmed to go after the virus.
More than three years have passed since these two men have been off of HIV treatment with no viral rebound.
