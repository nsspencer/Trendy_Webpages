     Top CNN exec resigns as WarnerMedia chief accuses her and former network boss Zucker of standards violations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN Business) Nearly two weeks after CNN president Jeff Zucker was forced out of his position, his former lieutenant Allison Gollust has also resigned from the company.
In a memo to staffers Tuesday evening, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said Gollust resigned after an investigation "into issues associated with" former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo and his brother Andrew, the former New York governor.
"Based on interviews of more than 40 individuals and a review of over 100,000 texts and emails, the investigation found violations of Company policies, including CNN's News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker, Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo," Kilar said in the memo.
"We have the highest standards of journalistic integrity at CNN, and those rules must apply to everyone equally," Kilar added.
"Given the information provided to me in the investigation, I strongly believe we have taken the right actions and the right decisions have been made."

     Allison Gollust, the CNN executive in a relationship that triggered the resignation this month of network President Jeff Zucker, has also resigned from the network, according to an email sent to staff members.
“Earlier today, Allison Gollust resigned from CNN following the conclusion of the company’s investigation into issues associated with Chris Cuomo and former Governor Andrew Cuomo,” Kilar said in the email.
“The investigation found violations of Company policies, including CNN’s News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker, Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo,” Kilar wrote.
The decision came after he was asked about a “consensual relationship with my closest colleague” as part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo.
Just a year ago, Gollust, as a top lieutenant to Zucker, was seen as his likely replacement at CNN.

     Former CNN chief Jeff Zucker’s partner Allison Gollust resigns from the network
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer at CNN whose romantic relationship with the network’s former President Jeff Zucker led to his ouster, resigned Tuesday after an internal investigation found that she violated company policies.
Gollust, 49, was expected to exit within the next few months as CNN parent WarnerMedia closed its merger with Discovery.
The email does not disclose any details of the violations by Zucker or Gollust.
Gollust already had a connection to Andrew Cuomo, having briefly served as his communications director before joining CNN.
Kilar took heavy fire from CNN journalists in two staff meetings held after Zucker’s firings, which were widely disseminated in the press.

Before the governor's resignation, Chris Cuomo acknowledged advising his elder brother in how to manage the crisis — a no-go zone for journalists.
Late Tuesday, Chris Cuomo contradicted that.

     Allison Gollust Resigns From CNN Following WarnerMedia Probe of Cuomo, Zucker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer at CNN, has resigned from the network following corporate parent WarnerMedia’s investigation into “issues associated with Chris Cuomo and former Governor Andrew Cuomo,” according to a memo from Jason Kilar, the company’s CEO.
When Zucker stepped down, he cited an investigation into fired anchor Chris Cuomo that revealed the CNN chief had not disclosed a consensual relationship with a colleague.
There have been allegations raised in that process that Zucker and Gollust offered advice to former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, brother of the anchor, in discussions about having him appear on CNN.
Indeed, had CNN never allowed Chris Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo to come together on the former’s program at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, much of the current debacle might never have happened.
Under Zucker, CNN waived rules preventing a journalist from covering family members and featured the former governor on his brother’s program on several nights.
