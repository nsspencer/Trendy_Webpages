     Brenden Aaronson Bursts With Pride After First Champions League Assist Against Bayern MunichBrenden Aaronson produced one of the best performances of his fledgling career in his highest-profile game yet on Wednesday night.
The 21-year-old USMNT playmaker capped a brilliant Champions League display for RB Salzburg with an assist in their 1-1 draw with Bayern Munich.
The assist was perhaps a little lucky as it seemed as though Aaronson miscontrolled Karim Adeyemi's pass perfectly into Adamu's path.
If deliberate, it was one of the most stylish and ingenious passes ever witnessed on the Champions League stage.
Brenden Aaronson had an excellent game as RB Salzburg went toe-to-toe with Bayern Munich IMAGO/David GeiereggerAaronson was singled out for praise by France legend Thierry Henry in the CBS studio.

     Mo Salah strikes to cap Liverpool late show against Inter Milan in Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Amidst all the talk of Liverpool's new age stars, it was two of the club's long-time heroes that delivered a late smash and grab raid in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Inter Milan on Wednesday.
As 18-year-old Harvey Elliot made his European debut and new signing Luis Diaz came on as a second-half substitute, goals from Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah in the final 15 minutes fired Liverpool to a 2-0 victory at the San Siro.
Forced to weather a strong start to the second-half by the reigning Serie A champion, Liverpool scored with their first and only shots on target to take a commanding lead back to Anfield on March 8.
Having already held the title of the Premier League's youngest ever debutant, Elliot became Liverpool's youngest ever player to start a European fixture -- excluding qualifiers -- and at times looked unnerved at the center of a raucous San Siro atmosphere.
Firmino heads Liverpool into the lead with a superb header.

     Champions League: Inter Milan plagued by familiar issue in first-leg loss vs. Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool were dangerous when Inter Milan left space for counter attacks.
Inter Milan were also the better team for portions of the second half but failed to covert any of their multiple chances.
In the first-leg loss, Inter Milan again displayed a worrying trend.
We've played many excellent matches during the season, but we've never come up against a team of the quality of Liverpool before."
Inter Milan will now go to Anfield next month (streaming on Paramount+), needing two goals to have any chance of advancing to the Champions League quarterfinals.

     Virgil van Dijk destroyed Liverpool critics and two masterful Champions League moments prove it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two key moments against Inter proved that Van Dijk is back at something like pre-injury levels for Liverpool.
It was every inch the typical Van Dijk moment, making a one-on-one look positively routine.
This time, it was Edin Džeko who threatened to muddy the waters in terms of Champions League progression for Liverpool.
Again, it all looked so easy, despite the Champions League context — even among Europe’s elite, Van Dijk at his best stands alone.
And therein lies the most encouraging part of this Champions League encounter: Van Dijk at his best.

     Kylian Mbappé is only 23, but his plunge into the world soccer scene keeps growing.
It was déja vu on Tuesday, with PSG beginning knockout-round play of the UEFA Champions League at home against European titans Real Madrid.
7 was the best player at Le Parc des Princes, creating more chances than anyone else, confusing Madrid’s defense with his pace.
Moments like Tuesday’s Champions League magic should continue to happen as it might not be a debate much longer as to whether No.
A run with Mbappé guarantees big moments, like Tuesday’s against 13-time UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid, can keep happening.

     Champions League: Defensive worries remain for Bayern Munich despite 90th-minute equalizer at Salzburg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bayern Munich denied Red Bull Salzburg what would have been an historic victory in their UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg tie on Wednesday with a late equalizer which barely papers over the cracks exhibited by the German giants at present.
Ultimately, Julian Nagelsmann's side denied Matthias Jaissle's men what would have been an impressive victory but in many ways, this feels like another defeat for Bayern after their surprise Bundesliga reverse against VfL Bochum over the weekend.
The Polish superstar was powerless in Austria, though, without a single shot.
In fact, rewind to late 2021 and SL Benfica, FC Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund all scored more than once against Bayern while SC Freiburg, Dynamo Kyiv and Mainz 05 also spoiled clean sheets for the German juggernaut.
Salzburg pulling off this sort of result should come as no surprise given their recent continental development but the fact that Bayern could still be their next victims should be of minimal shock too given their deterioration at the back this campaign.

     Liverpool took a step towards the quarter-finals of the Champions League after beating Inter Milan 2-0 at San Siro.

Liverpool took the lead against the run of play 15 minutes from time.
Liverpool doubled their lead eight minutes later as Mohamed Salah’s deflected shot found the back of the net.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will go into the second leg at Anfield in a fortnight with a healthy advantage as they look to repeat their Champions League triumph in 2019.
