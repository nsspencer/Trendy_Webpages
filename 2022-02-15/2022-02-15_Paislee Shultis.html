     Finding Paislee Shultis: Police Searched Home for Over an Hour Before Spotting 'Little Feet' in Makeshift Room
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But years of searching her parents' home proved unsuccessful — until Monday, when a detective noticed "little feet" sticking out of a makeshift room beneath their staircase.
They searched for Paislee in the home of Kirk Shultis Jr., 32, and Kimberly Cooper Shultis, 33, on "multiple occasions" to no avail, and her parents denied knowing her whereabouts each time.
"At one point they saw little feet, as he put it," Sinagra said, per the outlet.

Kirk and his father, 57-year-old Kirk Shultis Sr., were also arrested and both charged with felony custodial interference and the misdemeanor of endangering the welfare of a child.

     Missing 6-year-old was hidden beneath N.Y. staircase for hours before she was found, police chief says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SAUGERTIES, N.Y. — Paislee Shultis, the 6-year-old girl who was reported missing in 2019, was hidden in a dark and cramped compartment beneath a staircase for hours Monday before police ripped it apart and discovered her.
“It’s quite possible they were under the staircase for four, four-and-a-half hours, almost five hours, before they were discovered,” Saugerties Police Chief Joseph A. Sinagra said Wednesday, referring to the girl and her biological mother, who were found together.
Paislee Shultis was found being held in a hidden location at a residence in Saugerties, N.Y. Saugerties Police Dept.
He said police had been to the same home about a dozen times since the girl was reported missing in July 2019 from Spencer, about three hours away from Saugerties.
“That’s the only way there is going to be a healing process and only way those children will ever have a chance at getting back with their parents,” Sinagra said.
