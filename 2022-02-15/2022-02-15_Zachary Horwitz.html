     Associated PressLOS ANGELES — An aspiring actor was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison Monday for running a massive Ponzi scheme that raised at least $650 million from investors in phony Hollywood film licensing deals.
Zachary Horwitz, 35, of Los Angeles, also was ordered to repay more than $230.3 million.
Instead, Horwitz used some of the money to repay earlier investors in a classic Ponzi scheme and to support a lifestyle that included buying a $6 million home, prosecutors said.

     LA Actor Zachary Horwitz Gets 20-Years In Prison For $650M Ponzi Scheme
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – A 35-year-old actor was sentenced Monday in downtown Los Angeles to 20 years in federal prison for running an elaborate $650 million Ponzi scheme centered around fake film distribution rights.
Instead, the money went to his exorbitant lifestyle, including the purchase of a $6 million Beverlywood home, prosecutors said.
Horwitz was arrested last April and pleaded guilty in October to one federal count of securities fraud.
Horwitz, 35, operated 1inMM Capital as a Ponzi scheme, using victims’ money to repay earlier investors and to fund an “opulent” lifestyle, federal prosecutors said.
Despite Horwitz’s claim of “solid relationships” with online platforms, representatives for Netflix and HBO deny their companies engaged in any business with Horwitz or 1inMM Capital.

     Actor sentenced in $650 million Ponzi scheme involving fake Netflix, HBO deals

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An LA actor who orchestrated an elaborate Ponzi scheme that raised $650 million in bogus licensing deals with HBO and Netflix was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.
Prosecutors said Horwitz would use loans from one group of investors to repay the others, while taking millions of dollars to pay for his opulent lifestyle.
Horwitz used the names of actual HBO and Netflix employees to send fake emails and text messages to reassure investors that their payments would be delivered.

“Horwitz showed investors numerous fictitious documents to substantiate his claimed deals with HBO and Netflix, including numerous fake movie distribution agreements,” according to the criminal complaint.
