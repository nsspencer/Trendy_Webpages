     Prince Andrew Settles Sexual Abuse Lawsuit With Virginia Giuffre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Prince Andrew, the disgraced second son of Queen Elizabeth II, has settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, a woman who had accused him of raping her when she was a teenage victim of Andrew’s friend, the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a new court filing in Manhattan on Tuesday.
The amount that Andrew, 61, will pay Ms. Giuffre is confidential, the parties said in a joint statement attached to the filing.
Andrew also “intends to make a substantial donation” to a charity “in support of victims’ rights,” the statement says.
The deal comes just weeks before Andrew was scheduled to sit for a deposition, in which he would have been questioned under oath by Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers.
Andrew did not admit to any of Ms. Giuffre’s accusations against him in the statement announcing the settlement.

     According to documents filed Tuesday in New York, Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre have reached an out-of-court settlement in her sexual assault lawsuit against him.
Giuffre alleges she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17.
Representatives in the United Kingdom for Prince Andrew had no comment after news of the settlement was made public.
The settlement documents stated: “Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights.
Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.

     Prince Andrew reaches a settlement with Virginia Giuffre in sexual abuse lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Updated February 15, 2022 at 12:14 PM ETVirginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have agreed to a settlement that will end Giuffre's lawsuit, which had accused Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was a minor.
The parties expect to file to dismiss the case within the next 30 days, when Giuffre confirms receipt of the settlement, Boies said.
"Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks," the document states.
Giuffre has said Andrew sexually abused her in London, New York, and Little St. James, Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.

     AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe end of the case may allow Buckingham Palace to move on and away from Andrew’s scandals.
But in the court of public opinion, Andrew is badly damaged.
“I think it’s all over for him, any kind of public life,” said Dickie Arbiter, the queen’s former press secretary and royal commentator.
Andrew, viewed as a “bad uncle,” will be kept away from the upcoming celebrations of the queen’s Platinum Jubilee, Borkowski predicted.
British legal experts said Andrew may just donate to support charities fighting sex trafficking, rather than do any public campaigning.

     Analysis: Where does Prince Andrew go from here?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Britain's Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, has reached a deal with Virginia Giuffre to settle her civil sex abuse lawsuit against him.
A photograph appearing to show Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre and, in the background, Ghislaine Maxwell.
One of the big criticisms of Prince Andrew has been over his lack of empathy for Epstein's victims.
Prince Andrew has kept a low profile since stepping back from public duties as a senior royal.
Street art featuring Prince Andrew is seen in the Shoreditch area of London on July 1, 2020.
