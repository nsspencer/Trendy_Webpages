     Cyberpunk 2077: CD Projekt Investigating 60 FPS Support On Xbox Series S
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Some Xbox Series S owners are unhappy with how Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the console in the wake of yesterday's 1.5 patch, and CD Projekt Red is taking note.
The developer is pledging to look into bringing the experience on Series S closer to the other next-gen versions.
Even after the new next-gen upgrade, the Xbox Series S version of Cyberpunk 2077 only performs at 30 FPS, while the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions can reach 60 FPS with occasional frame drops.
The Xbox Series S version currently supports 1440p.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After months of waiting, current-gen consoles like Xbox Series X|S and PS5 finally enjoy official support for Cyberpunk 2077.
Xbox Series X and PS5 enjoy the bulk of improvements with 4K at 60 FPS support, ray tracing, and more.
The Xbox Series S does not feature ray tracing, and is locked to a "Performance" mode at 1440p resolution and up to 30 FPS.
The Cyberpunk 2077 team is currently investigating the possibility of raising the framerate on Xbox Series S, ideally to 60 FPS.
In our Cyberpunk 2077 review, we praised the game for its immense and intricately detailed world and ambitious RPG experiences.

     Cyberpunk 2077 quietly drops support for older graphics cards and Windows 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Audio player loading…CD Projekt dropped a major Cyberpunk 2077 update yesterday that tweaked almost everything about it, from AI behavior to new world elements, driving updates, rebalanced skills, more apartments to rent, better nail polish (yes, seriously), and a whole lot more.
Something else that changed with the release of the 1.5 update are the Cyberpunk 2077 system requirements: Nvidia 700 series graphics cards, which were previously part of the minimum specification, are no longer supported.
"Due to the end of support for graphics drivers, we've decided to change the minimum system requirements of Nvidia graphics cards to GTX 970," CDPR said in the 1.5 patch notes.
"The game won't necessarily stop functioning on said cards, however, we are no longer testing the game on Nvidia 700 Series graphics cards."
Windows 7 support for Cyberpunk 2077 has also been dropped.
