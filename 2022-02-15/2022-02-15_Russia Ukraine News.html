     Russia's claim that it was pulling troops back from Ukraine is 'false,' official saysEnlarge this image toggle caption Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty ImagesRussia's recent claim that it was beginning to pull back some troops from Ukraine's border is "false," a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing Wednesday.
That echoes a report earlier in the day from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned that the United States should remain skeptical of Russia's claims.
Speaking on Tuesday, President Biden said that Russia had "more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border."
There, she plans to meet with 13 heads of state this weekend, according to senior administration officials.
Biden has spoken directly to Putin and said he made the United States' position clear: If Russia advances an invasion on Ukraine, there will be severe consequences.

     Biden braces Americans for higher energy prices if Russia invades Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "I will not pretend this will be painless," Biden said Tuesday while preparing Americans to be prepared for higher energy prices in the U.S. if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to attack Ukraine and the Biden administration in turn puts its "powerful" sanctions in place.
ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega pressed the White House on what Americans should be ready for.
"Worst case scenario, what should they expect if this happens," Vega asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday.
"If Russia decides to invade, there could be consequences here at home, and that could have an impact on energy prices, which could have an impact on prices at the gas pump," Psaki said.
"We are taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices," said Biden.

     US says Russia has added 7,000 troops along Ukraine border, despite claims of pullback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, the United States alleged Wednesday evening, despite claims from Moscow it was pulling back.
The new estimates would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure President Joe Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week.
Western leaders had already greeted Russia's claims of withdrawal with skepticism.
On Tuesday, Biden said during a speech in the East Room that a withdrawal of Russian troops would be "good," but that he had yet to see any evidence that such a pullback was underway.
"And the fact remains right now Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border."

     Ukraine crisis: U.S., NATO say no signs Russia pulling back troop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — No Russian troops were withdrawn from the border with Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Wednesday night, disputing Moscow’s claim that it was pulling back some forces.
The official said troops were arriving as recently as Wednesday and Moscow could launch a false pretext to invade Ukraine at any moment.
“Russia keeps saying it wants to pursue a diplomatic solution, their actions indicate otherwise,” the official said.
In a joint written statement Wednesday, NATO defense ministers said their strategy involves "additional land forces" as well as "additional maritime and air assets."
While the U.S. is ready to engage in diplomacy, he said, his administration had not verified any partial drawdown of Russian troops.

     Ukraine Live Updates: U.S. and British Officials Dispute Russian Claim of Troop Pullback
    </h2>

     archived recording 1 A top military official says intelligence shows nearly 100,000 Russian troops — archived recording 2 Russian troops have massed on the border of Ukraine.
Ukraine doesn’t have the missile defense and air defense systems that could prevent a huge shock-and-awe campaign at the beginning of Russian military action.
So Anton, the question right now is will President Putin actually carry out an invasion of Ukraine?
Polling doesn’t really bear that out, but Putin really seems to be convinced of that.
Because as we speak, President Putin and President Biden have just wrapped up a very closely watched phone call about all of this.
