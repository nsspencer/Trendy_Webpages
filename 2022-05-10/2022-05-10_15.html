Tuesday managed to be as wild as Monday.
Reid Detmers entered Tuesday with 2 MLB victories.
He’d never thrown more than 97 pitches in a game, but was allowed to reach 108 in this one.
He walked one, and one batter reached when the first baseman couldn’t squeeze a baseball (sound familiar, Guardians fans?).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Angels rookie Reid Detmers pitched a no-hitter in Tuesday's 12-0 win over the Tampa Bay Rays.
Noah Syndergaard congratulated his teammate on social media for the big achievement, but he also took the opportunity to troll his former team -- the New York Mets.
"This is what a 'real' no hitter looks like," the 6'6" right-hand pitcher wrote on his Instagram story.
"This was about Reid, a great teammate, throwing a 1 pitcher No-Hitter, which is a rarity by today's game standards.
Mets have a good team, enjoy that instead of stirring s--t. As do the Angels, so drop the drama and move on."

     Summary: Detmers’ best off-speed pitch is his curve, which he threw 27 times, but he also threw his changeup 24 times.
Of the five times he had 1-and-1 counts, Detmers threw a strike to get to 1-and-2 four times.
“When you get in better counts, hitters become less hitters,” Maddon said.
I’d like to see him continue on that path of assertiveness, aggressiveness and challenge hitters more.”No one, not even Detmers, saw this no-hitter coming.
It was a crazy day.”Maddon said throwing a no-hitter, a complete game and being so pitch-efficient could be “transformative” for a young pitcher.

     Summary: ANAHEIM, Calif. – Reid Detmers was called up to the Los Angeles Angels late last season with high expectations.
Detmers pitched the majors’ second no-hitter this season, cruising after he benefited from a borderline error call in the seventh inning as the Angels beat the Tampa Bay Rays 12-0.
He’d never thrown more than 97 pitches in a big league game, either.
It is the Angels’ first individual no-hitter since Jered Weaver’s on May 2, 2012, against Minnesota.
Angels: RHP Shohei Ohtani (3-2, 3.08 ERA) has won his last three starts and allowed two runs in 18 innings.

     Summary: Detmers became the first pitcher this year to throw a solo no-hitter.
It’s the second no-hitter of the season, following the Mets’ five-pitcher combined effort April 29, and the 12th in Angels franchise history.
He’s the first pitcher since Francisco Liriano in 2011 to have two or fewer strikeouts in a no-hitter.
(Ken Holtzman is the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter without a strikeout, in 1969 for the Cubs.)
While Detmers was working on his no-hitter, the Rays brought in Phillips, an outfielder, to pitch.
