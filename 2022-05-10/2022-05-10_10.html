     Bitcoin investors are panicking as a controversial crypto experiment unravels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UST is important for bitcoin investors as Luna Foundation Guard, an organization supporting the Terra project, is sitting on billions of dollars in bitcoin that could potentially be dumped onto the market at any point.
Investors in bitcoin are in panic mode as the controversial terraUSD stablecoin slips further from its intended $1 peg.
"Very little" of the borrowed bitcoins have been spent, Luna Foundation Guard said, but it is "currently being used to buy" UST.
Several crypto investors are worried that Luna Foundation Guard might have sold, or will sell, a large portion of its bitcoin to prop up UST — analysts pointed out that the group's bitcoin wallet is now completely empty.
Amid all of this uncertainty, UST's decline has sent shock waves throughout the crypto market.

     Binance Suspended LUNA and UST Withdrawals. What's Going On?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Binance causes a stir by halting LUNA and UST withdrawals.
Key pointsDecentralized exchanges offer more freedom for users, while centralized exchanges like Binance are catching flak for holding onto control.
While the crypto market continues to experience difficulties, Binance made an interesting move by restricting LUNA and UST withdrawals within their platform temporarily, citing high transaction volumes as the catalyst.
Will the promise of future restrictions cause Binance users to seek out other exchanges?
While Binance has already reinstated withdrawals for LUNA and UST, it could be too late for some users.

     Summary: As the crypto community still tries to decipher Terra’s ongoing pegging-de-pegging fiasco in relation to its stablecoin offering TerraUSD (UST), major crypto exchange Binance temporarily suspended the withdrawals for LUNA and UST on Tuesday.
Which has caused a massive surge in BTCUST (Not Bitcoin valued in dollars, but valued in the UST stablecoin).
Withdrawals for $LUNA and $UST on the Terra network have now resumed on Binance.
— Binance (@binance) May 10, 2022According to Binance, the high volume of pending UST transactions is due to network slowness and congestion.

     Terra’s UST Rebounds To $0.90 After Depegging by 40%
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Terra’s stablecoin UST, the poster child for decentralized assets tied to the US dollar, rebounded sharply on Tuesday as it climbed as high as $0.92 after plunging 40% below its dollar peg, to $0.60, on Monday.
In Terra’s case, 1 UST can always be redeemed for $1 worth of LUNA.
Conversely, when UST trades above $1, investors can mint 1 UST with $1 worth of LUNA and sell the UST for a profit.
The steady depletion of liquidity from the UST Curve pool as users swapped UST for other stablecoins can be seen in this Dune dashboard.

     Binance Halts Terra Withdrawals Amid UST Meltdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Key Takeaways Binance has halted LUNA and UST withdrawals, citing "high volume of pending withdrawal transactions."
UST spiralled as low as $0.62 on Binance early Tuesday, while LUNA crashed to $23.
“Withdrawals for LUNA and UST tokens on the Terra (LUNA) network were temporarily suspended on 2022-05-10 at 02:20 AM (UTC) due to a high volume of pending withdrawal transactions.
LFG then loaned out $1.5 billion from its reserves “to protect the UST peg,” but that did little to stop the latest catastrophe.
In the past, Terra critics have warned that it could face instability issues similar to the ones other algorithmic stablecoins have suffered from.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyone who counted on UST being valued at $1, for example someone lending UST on a decentralized finance protocol, is in trouble.
The UST is a special type of stablecoin that's called an algorithmic stablecoin.
The mechanisms of supporting UST's price are semi-automated and work well in most scenarios, even when there's lots of volatility.
Called LFG (Luna Foundation Guard), it's a well-funded organization that can add collateral needed to protect the UST's price.
The LFG's coffers are deep, and there may be other large investors willing to jump in and help maintain the UST's price.

     Unstable Stablecoin: How Crypto’s Crash Broke The Buck For TerraUSD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kwon is counting on the oldest cryptocurrency as a backstop for his stablecoin, which some critics liken to a ginormous Ponzi scheme.
TerraUSD (UST), a digital token with a $16 billion market capitalization that is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the dollar, known as a stablecoin, nosedived over the past 24 hours.
UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means that it operates in a different way than most similar assets.
As all of this was happening, over $5 billion worth of UST was being drained out of the Anchor Protocol, a DeFi lending application that runs on Luna.
It is also fair to wonder if or when there will ever be a successful algorithmic stablecoin.

     Summary: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is still calling for stablecoin legislation by the end of the year.
In response to questioning on stablecoins from Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) at a May 10 hearing, Yellen confirmed that "it is important, even urgent" that Congress pass stablecoin legislation.
Yellen specifically highlighted the weekend's drama surrounding TerraUSD (UST), saying:“A stablecoin known as TerraUSD experienced a run and declined in value.
In response to Yellen, he noted an "important distinction" with algorithmic stablecoins like UST.
The hearing focused on the work of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a supervisory regulator that the Treasury Secretary presides over.
