     Watch 13 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay in new trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a long wait, but Warner Bros. Games Montreal has just released the most in-depth look yet at its upcoming open-world game Gotham Knights.
The clip, which is just a shade over 13 minutes long, is essentially a guided look at the gameplay, focusing on the characters Nightwing and Red Hood.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the video is how distinct the two characters appear to be; having multiple playable heroes is a big hook for Gotham Knights, which also stars Robin and Batgirl.
Gotham Knights was first revealed in 2020 with plans to launch the following year, but after some delays, it’s now slated to debut on October 25th.
However, while it was originally due to launch on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC, the developer says Gotham Knights will no longer release on previous-gen consoles.

     Gotham Knights Won't Release on PS4, Xbox One
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pre-orders are now available for three editions of Gotham Knights that confirm its rumored next-gen console exclusivity on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Gotham Knights’ release date is a balm for fans who are excited about another game set in the DC universe.
Gotham Knights is its own IP with a fresh continuity, and its emphasis on Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood as its playable protagonists separates it further from existing franchises.
Because every character has access to the Batcycle in Gotham Knights, it will likely be a cosmetic that players can apply to any character’s bike.
Gotham Knights is currently scheduled to release on October 25, 2022, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

     ‘Gotham Knights’ Will Not Be On PS4 Or Xbox One, Releases New Gameplay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gotham Knights WBWell, it’s finally starting to happen, and major AAA games are beginning to leave the last generation of consoles behind.
To keep things straight, remember that Gotham Knights is not made by Rocksteady, who did the mainline Arkham games, but instead WB Games Montreal, who did Arkham Origins.
Rocksteady is making the upcoming Suicide Squad game instead, which also features four playable characters in a wide city.
Gotham Knights was recently delayed to its new release date of October 25, putting it in the always-crowded holiday window.
Suicide Squad, meanwhile, has been pushed into 2023, so no, these will not be overlapping.
