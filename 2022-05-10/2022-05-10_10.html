     Carvana Tells Employees to Hit the Road as Company Growth Swerves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carvana, the online car retailer, has reportedly laid off over 2,500 employees, some over Zoom, this past Tuesday according to Protocol.
The filing also claims that executive employees will forfeit their salary for the remainder of the calendar year to help fund severance pay.
Advertisement“Recent macroeconomic factors have pushed automotive retail into recession,” a Carvana spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo this morning.
However, a Carvana spokesperson confirmed to Gizmodo that no layoffs were conducted using a pre-recorded message.
Celebrity shoutout service Cameo let go of 25% of it’s employees last week after a pandemic-fueled hiring spree.

     Carvana fires 2,500 workers, some via Zoom: "It was so disrespectful"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carvana, blaming a "recession" in auto sales, said it is cutting 2,500 jobs and informed some workers of the layoffs via Zoom.
Many criticized Carvana for relying on Zoom and email to inform workers that they were losing their jobs.
"Scary experience"Two workers who lost their jobs in the layoffs told CBS MoneyWatch that they have heard nothing directly from managers at Carvana.
But rather than offering an end-of-year message to workers, CEO Vishal Garg informed attendees they were being fired.
Carvana, which sells online and delivers used vehicles to buyers, said the layoffs represent 12% of its workforce.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carvana, an online used car dealer, on Tuesday laid off 2,500 employees, many of them over Zoom, the company confirmed.
Rumors on social media swirled that the Zoom had been pre-recorded, but Carvana told Protocol that was not the case.
"Recent macroeconomic factors have pushed automotive retail into recession," a Carvana spokesperson told Protocol.
A Carvana spokesperson told Protocol that "less than half" of the layoffs were conducted over Zoom and that the company "had as many conversations as we could in person."
This story was updated to reflect that not every laid-off Carvana employee was told via Zoom.
