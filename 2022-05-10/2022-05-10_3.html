     Coinbase warns customers they may lose crypto if company goes bankrupt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coinbase spooked customers with an admission that their crypto holdings could be at risk if the company goes bankrupt – a warning that surfaced alongside a dismal earnings report that crushed the cryptocurrency hub’s stock on Wednesday.
As “unsecured creditors,” Coinbase customers would be left without recourse to recover their cryptocurrency or equivalent cash balances if the company went bankrupt.
Coinbase said it held $256 billion in traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies on behalf of its customers through the end of March.
Last month, the SEC issued new guidance instructing crypto platforms such as Coinbase to begin including customers’ crypto holdings as assets and liabilities on the company’s balance sheet.
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company is not at risk of going bankrupt.

     Coinbase Stock Slides After Revenue Miss But Many Analysts Say ‘Fears Appear Greatly Overblown’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TradingViewSeveral investment firms cut their price target on Coinbase’s stock this morning but maintained their ‘buy’ ratings and expressed confidence in the company’s long-term success.
“While COIN’s weaker-than-expected 1Q22 report reflects a challenging crypto market, fears driving stock price decline appear greatly overblown in light of liquidity and long-term growth prospects,” wrote BTIG Research analysts in today’s note.
According to the earnings report, Coinbase’s first-quarter revenue slumped to $1.17 billion, below Wall Street’s expectations of $1.48 billion.
The exchange’s total trading volume shrank from $547 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $309 billion.
The number of monthly transacting users also fell to 9.2 million, a decrease of 2.2 million from Q4.

Trading volume totaled $309 billion, down from $547 billion in Q4 and from $335 billion in the same period last year.
Yet Coinbase continues to ignore BSV, while keeping its customers in the dark by ‘passing off’ BTC as Bitcoin.
