     Britney Spears Posted The Same Nude Photo Six Times, Says She Always Looks Way 'Younger' On Vacation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Britney Spears is a woman who loves a good vacation.
The “Sometimes” singer also took to Instagram to talk about how she feels she always looks way “younger on vacation.” That’s certainly a problem some of us probably wish we had.
But I digress, and you can see her throwback Mexican vacation photos below.
In fact, Spears has been on a bit of a tear lately with Instagram posts, and not just of this variety.
A few days after she and Sam Asghari shared some photos from their trip, Spears announced she was pregnant with her third child on social media.
