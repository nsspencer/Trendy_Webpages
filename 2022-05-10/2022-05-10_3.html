     Bizarre blood red sky in China city freaks out residents
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The apocalypse seemingly arrived early in China's eastern port city of Zhoushan with the sky appearing blood red over the weekend.
Turns out that the horrific hue was caused by the lights of boats in the area.
From The Independent:According to the experts, the weather in Zhoushan port city was perfect for a refraction phenomenon as the sky was cloudy with drizzle which led to an unusual reddening of the sky, triggering a brief panic.
A member from the meteorological bureau explained that when weather conditions are good, it leads to formation of more water in the atmosphere.
This forms aerosols which then refract and scatter the light of fishing boats and create the red sky seen by the public," the official said, the report added.
