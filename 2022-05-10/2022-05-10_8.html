     Upstart's April Low Gives Way as Plunge Continues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Upstart Holdings ( UPST ) plunged to the downside Tuesday as traders and investors reacted to their earnings numbers late Monday.
UPST has declined lower and lower and trades below the declining 50-day simple moving average line and below the negatively sloped 200-day average.
The weekly OBV line is likely to make a new low for the move down soon and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bearish.
In this daily Point and Figure chart of UPST, below, we can see the price weakness with the price gap filled in.
Bottom line strategy: UPST may have some minor recovery bounce but I would not recommend trying to play it.

     Summary: Furthermore, our price action analysis suggests that UPST stock could also be forming a potential new consolidation at the pre-market levels.
Given the increasing macro headwinds, investors need to know whether Upstart can outperform, given the growth premium embedded in UPST stock.
In addition, there was also no mention of how it deployed its $400M stock repurchase authorization despite the recent battering in UPST stock.

     Summary: Shares of Upstart Holdings Inc. are on track to lose more than half their value in Tuesday’s session after the lending company reduced its full-year forecast in the face of macroeconomic dynamics.
Upstart faces a “perfect storm of headwinds,” he wrote, as well as an increasing “range of outcomes” given the macroeconomic climate.

     Upstart's Stock Just Crashed. Buy the Dip?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Around midday Tuesday, Upstart's stock was down roughly 60% and trading around all-time lows.
Understanding the lower guidanceAfter beating earnings estimates for the first quarter, Upstart trimmed its revenue guidance for 2022 from $1.4 billion to $1.25 billion.
The main culprit, according to management, is rising interest rates, which are wreaking havoc on several parts of the business.
In addition, loans that may have qualified for a certain investor's risk appetite based on their specific risk criteria may no longer qualify.
Higher interest rates could also continue to put a dent in transaction volume, making new revenue guidance hard to achieve as well.
