     Britney Spears sparks concerns over nude photos posted on Instagram
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just when we thought it couldn’t get any weirder for Britney Spears, it just has.
The pop icon is kicking up controversy once more by posting her latest rounds of nude pictures on her Instagram and baring it all once again.
Some have taken it as a symbol of celebrating her freedom while others are second-guessing whether or not her conservatorship should have ended.
Taken prior to getting pregnant, Spears posted 12 nude pictures on Monday where the images featured the artist posing completely naked while covering her breasts with her hands and censoring her privates with a pink heart, Yahoo reported.
She missed the years when we were all terrible at Instagram and used those tacky in-app filters.

    </h2>

     Summary: Rebel Wilson knows firsthand that trying to keep up with Britney Spears’ choreography is really hard work.
During her appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden on Tuesday night, the actress discussed her upcoming Netflix movie Senior Year, which features a re-creation of Spears’ iconic dance moves in the “You Drive Me Crazy” music video that resulted in her falling flat on her face during a take.
“I love Britney and I just wanted to pay homage to her because 20 years earlier in the film in 2022, she was like the biggest star in the world, so we did the ‘Crazy’ video … when I’m dancing, I just really like to give it, just give my all to it,” Wilson explained.
“And then what happens is that I fall over and so in the Britney thing, they actually keep the take where I’m dancing and loving it and then I fall forward out of frame.
