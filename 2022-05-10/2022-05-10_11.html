     Consumer Prices Are Still Climbing Rapidly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Annual inflation moderated for the first time in months in April, but the Consumer Price Index still increased 8.3 percent, an uncomfortably rapid pace.
At the same time, a closely watched measure that subtracts food and fuel costs actually accelerated.
Core inflation — which excludes costs for groceries and gas — picked up 0.6 percent in April from the prior month, faster than its 0.3 percent increase in March.
That measure is particularly important for policymakers, who use it as a gauge to help determine where inflation is headed.
While the letup in annual inflation may have given President Biden and the Fed a dose of comfort, the overall picture remains worrying.

     April CPI report: US inflation slowed last month for the first time since August

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) US inflation took a breather last month for the first time since August.
Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
Stripping out more volatile product categories like food and energy, the CPI stood at 6.2% over the same period, less than the 6.5% reported in March.
For April alone, prices increased by 0.3%, adjusted for seasonal swings, less than the 1.2% jump recorded in March.
Without food and energy prices, core inflation rose 0.6%, more than the 0.3% advance in the prior month.

     Summary: Inflation may be easing — but low-income people are still paying the steepest pricesEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty ImagesFour-dollar gasoline and five-dollar hamburger are putting a squeeze on Tanya Byron's pocketbook.
That's a modest decrease from the March inflation rate of 8.5%, thanks in part to a short-lived drop in gasoline prices last month.
Gas prices have since rebounded to a record high, though unadjusted for inflation.
"What people are paying for similar items at different stores is very important for understanding inflation inequality," Sichel says.
Biden, whose approval ratings have fallen as prices climb, calls fighting inflation his top domestic priority.

     Summary: Food banks across America say those economic conditions are intensifying demand for their support at a time when their labor and distribution costs are climbing and donations are slowing.
For many families like the Nunamakers, food insecurity became a painful surprise.
The pandemic forced roughly 60 million Americans to seek help for food insecurity, according to Feeding America.
At the end of 2021, as hiring boomed, demand for food banks returned to regular levels.
“So we are working extra hard to reach people who have the deepest food insecurity rates.

     US inflation dips from 4-decade high but still causing pain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if it moderates, inflation will likely remain high well into 2023, economists say, leaving many Americans burdened by price increases that have outpaced pay raises.
Especially hurt are lower-income and Black and Hispanic families, who on average spend a greater proportion of their incomes on gas, food and rent.
In April, a fallback in gas prices helped slow overall inflation.
But since then, gas prices have surged to a record $4.40 a gallon.
Food prices rose 1% from March to April and nearly 11% from a year ago.

     The Truth About Inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration calls those increases “Putin’s tax,” and more than half of the energy inflation of the past year happened since January as Russia prepared and carried out its war on Ukraine.
However, the rising oil prices also depend on Saudi Arabia keeping global oil supplies tight, like in the 1970s.
It would be more accurate to call the energy inflation an “authoritarians’ tax.”What about the view, prevalent in some economic circles, that Milton Freidman finally got it right and the current inflation is a case of too much money chasing too few goods?
In that way, the Biden relief may have helped sustain the early 2022 uptick in inflation that, again, was driven much more by energy prices.
And fortunately, the recent jump in oil prices is likely a one-time event that may dog us for another year or so.

     Summary: The inflation rate was little changed from March to April, a potential sign that the rapid growth in the cost of goods and services may soon taper off.
Compared with one year ago, the inflation rate grew by 8.3 percent in April.
The numbers indicate that inflation, which has been sitting at a 40-year high since December, is showing signs of cooling off.
The Fed has indicated that 0.75 percent interest rate hikes are not being actively considered.
"Fed officials will remain cautious, because they know the decline in inflation will slow in the third quarter," Shepherdson said.

     Summary: By contrast, March prices rose 8.5 percent compared with the previous year, and a sharper 1.2 percent compared with the previous month.
Advertisement“While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April, the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high,” President Biden said in a statement Wednesday.
The food index increased 0.9 percent in April compared with March, notching its 17th consecutive monthly increase.
Fed officials often look to core inflation to understand how inflation is behaving across the entire economy.
The shelter serves about 800 men, women and children every day, and its food costs are projected to double this year.
