     Prince Charles delivers Queen's Speech for the first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN) Britain's heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Prince William took center stage at the opening of parliament on Tuesday, replacing the 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth who missed the grand set-piece event for the first time in almost six decades.
With the Queen forced to withdraw on Monday due to a recurrence of mobility issues, 73-year-old Charles arrived at the Palace of Westminster to read out the government's legislative agenda.
When he arrived and sat on the throne there was audible surprise among those watching in person.
The program for the day presented to those who had tickets to sit in the House of Lords had not been updated to reflect the fact that the Queen would not be attending herself, leaving some uncertainty as to exactly how the day's events would unfold.
The program for the event.

     U.K. Parliament opens with pomp but no queen as Prince Charles stands in
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 96-year-old monarch pulled out of reading the Queen’s Speech at the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament because of what Buckingham Palace calls “episodic mobility issues.” Her son and heir, Prince Charles, stood in, rattling through a short speech laying out 38 bills the government plans to pass.
Johnson’s personal popularity has been hurt by months of headlines over parties in his office and other government buildings that breached coronavirus restrictions.
Johnson was fined 50 pounds ($62) by police for attending his own surprise birthday party in June 2020 when lockdown rules barred social gatherings.
The state opening ceremony itself is a spectacular pageant steeped in the two sides of Britain’s constitutional monarchy: royal pomp and political power.
Traditionally the monarch travels from Buckingham Palace to Parliament in a horse-drawn carriage and reads the speech to assembled lawmakers from a golden throne, wearing a crown studded with 3,000 diamonds.

     Summary: Prince Charles and his wife Camilla attended the State Opening of Parliament— and a lip reader claims to have caught the heir to the throne moaning to his wife about something in particular.
Prince Charles emerged from his car, wearing his Admiral of the Fleet uniform, medals, and honour badges, with Camilla by his side to support him at the State Opening of Parliament, as he filled in for the Queen.
Prince Charles filled in for the Queen, who was forced to withdraw from the official State Opening of Parliament due to mobility issues.
The heir to the throne was joined by his wife Camilla, with the future King delivering the Queen’s speech after his mother failed to attend.
As they stepped out of the car, Charles is thought to have told Camilla,”Oh my word that was uncomfortable.”Charles was spotted waving to Camilla shortly after, to tell her which side she should be standing on.

     Expect to see more of Prince Charles. This is a slow-motion abdication | Ed Owens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The sovereign was symbolically (if not physically) present, not only through her kin, but also through the large imperial state crown that was perched on a small table in front of Prince Charles.
Prince Charles did exactly what was required of him.
Indeed, Prince Charles has enjoyed something of a return to popularity over the past five years, not least because of his image as the environmentalist king-in-waiting.
In the meantime, we can expect to see more and more of Prince Charles and less and less of the Queen, as one reign steadily draws to a close and a new reign begins.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles presided over the state opening of Parliament and delivered the Queen’s Speech laying out the government’s legislative program.
The speech is delivered during the formal opening of each session of Parliament and lays out the government’s legislative program.
In the place where the queen’s throne normally is placed, the Imperial State Crown was placed on a velvet cushion.
Charles delivered the speech in the third person, using “Her Majesty’s Government.”Why did Elizabeth decide to skip the speech?
We are nearing the last years of her reign, and during those last years, if she is no longer capable of putting in public appearances, Prince Charles can deputize on her behalf.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as Charles, 73, read out the Queen’s Speech on his mother’s behalf, it was also clear that day is not yet here.
Advertisement“Wonder how Prince Charles felt about reading out a #QueensSpeech with big fat zero in it on environment,” she tweeted.
Queen Elizabeth II, 96, has scaled back her activities and gradually delegated more duties to Charles and other senior royals.
The special powers she put in place to allow Charles to open Parliament were a one-off, not a permanent arrangement.
The queen, Charles and William work very closely together, said royal biographer Robert Lacey.
