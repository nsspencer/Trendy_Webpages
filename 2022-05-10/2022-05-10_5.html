     Paramount+ May Prevent ‘The Lost City’ From Crossing $100 Million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum star in Paramount Pictures' "THE LOST CITY."
However, I’d argue putting The Lost City on streaming and EST so early was a mistake.
The $70 million original is $5 million shy of the $100 million mark.
Sony’s Where the Crawdads Sing (July 15) is the only mainstream female-fronted major studio release between Lost City and both Viola Davis’ The Woman King and Florence Pugh’s Don’t Worry Darling in mid-September.
Lost City earned $2.8 million last weekend, so it’s not like it would have crawled to $150 million domestic if left unmolested.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘The Lost City’ on Paramount+, in Which Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum Amiably Traipse Through Formula Comedy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Loretta Sage (Bullock) has it.
But she eventually succumbs to the pressure of her agent, Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), grinds out The Lost City of D and agrees to the irksome dog-and-pony show that comes with promoting it.
She soon huffs out of it and into the waiting car of not her driver, but her kidnapper, Abigail Fairfax (Radcliffe), a squillionaire who knows that The Lost City of D is based on an actual real ancient lost city, and wants her to lead him to its treasures.
She can make stuff like The Lost City funnier than it should be with minimal effort – and it’s preferable to her last couple of overcooked hyperventilations, Bird Box and The Unforgivable.
(One can also assume with fair certainty that Tatum has wholly given up on the concept of body hair.)
