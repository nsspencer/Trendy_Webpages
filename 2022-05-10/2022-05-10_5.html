     Inflation barreled ahead at 8.3% in April from a year ago, remaining near 40-year highs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inflation rose again in April, continuing a climb that has pushed consumers to the brink and is threatening the economic expansion, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.
The consumer price index, a broad-based measure of prices for goods and services, increased 8.3% from a year ago, higher than the Dow Jones estimate for an 8.1% gain.
That represented a slight ease from March's peak but was still close to the highest level since the summer of 1982.
Real wages adjusted for inflation decreased 0.1% on the month despite a nominal increase of 0.3% in average hourly earnings.
Over the past year, real earnings have dropped 2.6% even though average hourly earnings are up 5.5%.

     Dollar Strengthens After CPI; Sterling Hit by GDP Release
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Peter NurseInvesting.com - The U.S. dollar strengthened in early European trade Thursday to a new two-decade high after U.S. inflation remained stubbornly high, while sterling weakened on disappointing U.K. growth data.
The market is fully priced for at least a half percentage point increase to the policy rate at each of the next two Fed decisions, on June 15 and July 27.
Gross domestic product grew by only 0.8% in seasonally-adjusted terms from the fourth quarter, with preliminary data suggesting that it actually declined in March by 0.1%.
Analysts had expected growth of 1.0% for the quarter, and stagnation in March.
