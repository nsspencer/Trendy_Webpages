     A.I. lender Upstart shares plummet more than 50% after company cuts full-year revenue forecast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Upstart plummeted Tuesday after the artificial intelligence lending platform cut its full-year revenue outlook, citing rising interest rates and an uncertain economy.
The company had reported better-than-expected first-quarter results Monday after the bell, but also slashed its 2022 revenue forecast to $1.25 billion from a prior estimate of $1.4 billion.
Upstart expects second-quarter revenue of $295 million to $305 million, while analysts surveyed by Refinitiv predicted $335 million, on average.
The company, which uses artificial intelligence to gauge creditworthiness, said climbing interest rates are hurting loan volume.
The new price projection implies 75% downside from Upstart's closing price Monday.

     Upstart's Stock Just Crashed. Buy the Dip?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Around midday Tuesday, Upstart's stock was down roughly 60% and trading around all-time lows.
Understanding the lower guidanceAfter beating earnings estimates for the first quarter, Upstart trimmed its revenue guidance for 2022 from $1.4 billion to $1.25 billion.
The main culprit, according to management, is rising interest rates, which are wreaking havoc on several parts of the business.
In addition, loans that may have qualified for a certain investor's risk appetite based on their specific risk criteria may no longer qualify.
Higher interest rates could also continue to put a dent in transaction volume, making new revenue guidance hard to achieve as well.
