     Summary: “I think you have to go through whatever the ordeal is that the character has to go through,” Jeremy told the writer, Michael Schulman.
“If I have any method at all, it is simply this: to clear away anything — anything — that is not the character and the circumstances of the scene … usually that means clearing away almost everything around and inside you, so that you can be a more complete vessel for the work at hand.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

“It’s totally joyous,” Williams told Variety.

     Summary: Michelle Williams will not allow for any Jeremy Strong slander—personally or professionally.

So when he became so celebrated, we all celebrated.”But the bond between Strong and Williams goes beyond professional admiration.

     Michelle Williams talks 'joyous' third pregnancy, Jeremy Strong friendship after Heath Ledger's death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michelle Williams' next blockbuster may be in the delivery room instead of on the silver screen, with the actress revealing she's pregnant with her third child.
The couple shares 1-year-old son Hart, and Williams has an older daughter Matilda, 16, from her relationship with the late actor Heath Ledger.
"As the years go on, you sort of wonder what they might hold for you or not hold for you.
"I grew up a lot in that moment because doing anything in public is very difficult for me," Williams recalled.
The "blowback" Strong received in the wake of the story's publication was difficult for Williams, who met Strong at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2004.
