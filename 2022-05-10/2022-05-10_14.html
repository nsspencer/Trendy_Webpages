"We really want to know what caused this," he said.He identified the victims as a married couple from Tennessee, Michael Phillips, 68, and Robbie Phillips, 65, and a resident of Florida, Vincent Paul Chiarella, 64.
"He noted that all four tourists went to a doctor the night before their bodies were discovered and they had complained of feeling ill.
U.S. authorities determined that methyl bromide, a highly toxic pesticide banned for indoor residential use in 1984, was to blame and had been used at that resort several times.___
