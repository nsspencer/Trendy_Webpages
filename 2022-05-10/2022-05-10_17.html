     Watch 13 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay in new trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a long wait, but Warner Bros. Games Montreal has just released the most in-depth look yet at its upcoming open-world game Gotham Knights.
The clip, which is just a shade over 13 minutes long, is essentially a guided look at the gameplay, focusing on the characters Nightwing and Red Hood.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the video is how distinct the two characters appear to be; having multiple playable heroes is a big hook for Gotham Knights, which also stars Robin and Batgirl.
Gotham Knights was first revealed in 2020 with plans to launch the following year, but after some delays, it’s now slated to debut on October 25th.
However, while it was originally due to launch on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC, the developer says Gotham Knights will no longer release on previous-gen consoles.

     Summary: After seven years of no Batman games, WB Games Montréal has finally released 13-minutes of footage from a new one.
The upcoming Bat-family game, Gotham Knights, will only be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox X/S despite previous announcements.
The team at WB Montréal finally released some serious game-play footage for the first time since 2020.
Instead, the game features Nightwing, Red Hood, Batgirl, and Robin, or three Robins and a Batgirl, to the layperson.
Perfect for [sigh] Red Hood use Mystic Leap powered by his “own soul energy.” You see, Red Hood is Batman’s second Robin, the deceased Jason Todd, who was resurrected by an assassin cult.

     Summary: A brand new gameplay trailer for Gotham Knights was shown off overnight, highlighting both Nightwing and Red Hood as they patrol the streets of Gotham.
The last of the larger enemies is then dispatched by both Nightwing and Red Hood as they unite for a combined attack.
Soon after, we get our first look at Red Hood on the Batcycle, as he chases down a smuggling van filled with gang members.
The difference between the two could prove important in certain situations where multiple nearby enemies could be drawn to your location.
The trailer then ends on a cliff-hanger as Red Hood is captured by the Court of Owls.

     Why Canceling Gotham Knights' Last-Gen Releases Is the Right Call

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gotham Knights is an upcoming superhero action-adventure game by Warner Bros. Games Montréal, set in the Batman universe.
CBR VIDEO OF THE DAYRELATED: Gotham Knights' Pre-Order Skin Celebrates the Batcycle's First DC Comics AppearanceIt's understandable why gamers are disappointed by the cancellation, as it means many will miss out on Gotham Knights.
Avoiding a situation like this is yet another positive to canceling Gotham Knights' last-gen versions.
RELATED: Gotham Knight's Super-Pricey Collector's Edition Includes a Diorama, AR and MoreFinally, this cancelation could also help the studio to avoid crunch.
Both this reduction in crunch and the ability to make the most of the next-gen hardware should ultimately be seen as positive factors for Gotham Knights' release.

     Summary: Developer WB Games Montréal has confirmed that there will be no Gotham Knights microtransactions as stated in a FAQ on the game’s official website.
The page provides additional information on the requirements for the game’s online co-op as well as clarity on where Gotham Knights fits within the overarching Batman universe.
Gotham Knights won’t have local co-op, either﻿ ﻿Without mincing words, the FAQ says that Gotham Knights will not have any microtransactions or in-game purchases.
That said, those who purchase the Gotham Knights Deluxe Edition will get the Visionary Pack DLC that includes gear and cosmetics inspired by the Batman Beyond animated series.
The page reiterates that Gotham Knights features a “two-player, online cooperative (co-op) mode,” coinciding with Sony’s recent correction on the game’s PlayStation Store page that once stated that it had four-player co-op.

Gotham Knights may turn out to be great, but right now it’s just reminding me how ready I am for another normal-ass Batman Arkham game instead.
WB Montreal, like many other studios, has been emphatic that Gotham Knights is not a live-service game.
AdvertisementBefore Gotham Knights, WB Montreal made 2013’s Arkham Origins, an excellent spin-off so underappreciated it didn’t even make it into 2019’s Batman: Arkham Collection.
