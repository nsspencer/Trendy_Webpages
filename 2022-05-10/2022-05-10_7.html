     Bruins reveal Game 6 goalie, give positive update on Hampus Lindholm's status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins aren't making a change in net for their must-win Game 6 against the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday night.
Swayman won Game 3 and Game 4 at TD Garden before giving up four goals in Boston's 5-1 loss to the Hurricanes in Game 5 at PNC Arena on Tuesday night.
The Bruins' lineup in front of Swayman might look a bit different in Game 6.
Grzelcyk had a rough Game 5 and took two penalties, while tallying zero points or shots on net.
The Hurricanes have outscored the Bruins 6-2 during Grzelcyk's 5-on-5 ice time in the series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following their 5-1 loss in Game 5 on Thursday night, the Bruins are now facing elimination.
That means, of course, that the historical data gives the Bruins a 19.3 percent chance to win this series.
In terms of forcing a Game 7, the team in the Bruins’ current position has actually done a decent job of getting there.
But if the Bruins can force that Game 7, history gives them a 40.8 percent chance of winning.
Simplifying things, history gives the Bruins a 47.4 percent chance of winning Game 6, and then a 40.8 percent chance of winning Game 7.

     Bruins Should Stick With Rookie Goalie Jeremy Swayman in Must-Win Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins should stick with rookie goalie Jeremy Swayman in must-win Game 6 originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonThe Boston Bruins will be fighting to save their season Thursday night when they host the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 6 at TD Garden, and the goalie who gives them the best chance to force a Game 7 is Jeremy Swayman.
The rookie netminder got the Bruins back in the series with wins in Game 3 and Game 4 in Boston this past weekend.
“I think the second goal goes off Charlie (Coyle).
Swayman didn't play great in Game 5, but he definitely wasn't one of the top three reasons why the Bruins lost.
There's no way Swayman could've seen the puck with that much traffic in front of him.

John Tlumacki/Globe StaffEntering their first-round series against the Hurricanes, the Bruins needed to win at least one game in Carolina in order to advance.
The start of Game 5 was similar for the Bruins to the starts of Games 1 and 2.
Advertisement:He also shared his frustration with the Bruins’ penalty kill in Game 5, which gave up two goals in five opportunities.
They were the better team on it [in Game 5].”One area Cassidy didn’t share as much disappointment in was with his goalie, Jeremy Swayman.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even Conor Clifton’s goal didn’t make anything better.
Bruins lose 5-1, Carolina takes a 3-2 series leadGame Notes:Charlie McAvoy was the B’s leader in TOI at all situations, and at Even Strength.
Or do you go to Linus Ullmark, knowing he didn’t start the series well at all?
While yes, losing a game this badly falls on everybody, it cannot be overstated that the Bruins need their depth to finally actually come through and in a huge way.
You got some of that in Game 3 and 4, we need more of that in Game 6 and 7.

     The Impact | 50 Years Later
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BostonBruins.com - While some 50 years have passed since the Big, Bad Bruins ruled Boston, the impact that they had on the city and region lives on.
St. Paul's, a private school in Concord, Massachusetts, built the first ice hockey rink in New England and held the first games in the 1870s.
They were proud of their hockey rinks.
"If you were a Hollywood screenwriter you couldn't have sat down and created a better blend of characters representing different values than what we got with that Bruins team.
A team that 50 years later still holds a special place in the hearts of so many New Englanders.
