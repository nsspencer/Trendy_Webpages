     Korean crypto exchanges issue warnings about trading Luna
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: South Korea’s major exchanges have issued warnings about trading of Luna (LUNA) following the crypto’s current price downturn.
Coinone, one of the “big four” crypto exchanges in South Korea, has suspended trading of Luna, citing its abrupt price slump.
For Bithumb and Korbit, these warnings do not necessarily mean that Luna will be suspended.
These designated investment warnings usually last for 72 hours after which the exchanges will decide whether to halt or continue trading.
Bithumb is the ninth-largest exchange for Luna trading volume in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinranking.

     Controversial stablecoin UST — which is meant to be pegged to the dollar — plummets below 30 cents
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TerraUSD, or UST, plunged to as low as 26 cents.
The so-called stablecoin is meant to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the U.S. dollar.
The coin has lost roughly 96% of its value in the past seven days, and now has a smaller market value than its stablecoin counterpart.
Blue-chip tokens bitcoin and ether saw wild swings throughout the day as traders monitored UST's descent as well as hotter-than-expected April inflation data.
UST's price has crumbled under the pressure of a sell-off in cryptocurrencies recently, resulting in further panic in the market.

     South Korean Exchanges Warn LUNA Investors as UST Collapse Mirrors TITAN Saga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a dramatic 90% market crash, LUNA, trading below $5, is now deemed a “cautionary item” by the popular South Korean cryptocurrency exchange UpBit.
Investors are unnerved after the embattled crypto project – Terra’s flagship stablecoin UST – lost its peg with the US Dollar.
Additionally, Bithumb also issued a warning to its investors while dealing with LUNA.
Terra’s debacle mirrors that of TITAN last summer when a token backing up the stablecoin IRON, called TITAN, dropped to zero as uncertainty choked the market.
I do believe LUNA will eventually go even further down as IRON stablecoin was backed by $0.75 USDC while UST is only backed by LUNA.

     Luna Nosedives Under $2, Loses 98% Of Its Value As TerraUSD Struggles To Regain Its Dollar Peg

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UST fell again overnight TradingViewHowever, this performance could be considered downright bullish when compared to LUNA, the token designed to maintain its $1 peg, which has now fallen below $2.
LUNA is down a staggering 98% in the past five days, which has seen its market capitalization lose $25 billion this week.
This morning, Kwon expressed support for a new community-driven plan that will mint additional LUNA in an effort to absorb the excessive UST sell-pressure.
Amidst the tumult surrounding UST and LUNA, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for stablecoin regulation by the year’s end.
Dai is an algorithmic stablecoin like UST, meaning that it utilizes a smart contract system to dynamically try and maintain its price peg.

Before this disaster, Terra (LUNA) was among the top-10 crypto currencies by market capitalisation, and TerraUSD (UST) was the world’s biggest decentralised crypto Stablecoin, according to Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin dropped 8.4 per cent that day, and the overall crypto market cap was also down by 7.46 per cent.
