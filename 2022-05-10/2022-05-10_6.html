     Summary: DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — Being on the ice at home was no advantage for the Dallas Stars Monday night.
"We had a lot of long shifts in their zone and overall a good game, a good 60 minutes," said Andersson, who had only two of Calgary's 54 shots.
"Thought we started well, thought our first period was good," Andersson said.
We got a big power play good there, and then obviously got the second one and the third one.
So overall, it was a good game and you know, it all started with a good start in the first."

     Summary: You have a better chance of scoring if you shoot the puck, but you can’t shoot the puck unless you have it.
From start to finish Monday night, the Stars were dominated by the Flames in puck possession.
That’s something the Stars had done well for the first three games, except the first period of Game 1.
Their expected goals for were nearly six, yet they finished with only three goals on Oettinger before the late empty-netter.
Throughout the regular season and this series, the Stars and Flames have played each other close.
