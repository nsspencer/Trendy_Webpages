     The U.K.'s Parliament opens for the first time in six decades without the queen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 96-year-old monarch pulled out of reading the Queen's Speech at the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament because of what Buckingham Palace calls "episodic mobility issues."
Her son and heir, Prince Charles, stood in, rattling through a short speech laying out 38 bills the government plans to pass.
But it contained few immediate measures to relieve households struggling with soaring prices for domestic energy and food.
This year, Charles travelled to Parliament by car, rather than carriage, and did not wear the crown, which got its own seat.
The ceremony takes place in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament, because the monarch isn't allowed to set foot in the House of Commons.

     Summary: Danica KirkaAssociated PressLONDON — Queen Elizabeth II's long reign entered new territory Tuesday when the 96-year-old monarch for the first time delegated the formal opening of Parliament to her son and heir, Prince Charles the Prince of Wales.
Queen Elizabeth II skips Parliament open for 3rd time in 70-year reign due to mobility issuesTo Charles' left sat his wife, Camilla, 74, Duchess of Cornwall and future queen consort.
The queen has missed the opening of Parliament only twice during her reign, both times for the pregnancies of her two younger children.
Counselors of state are required to act in pairs, so Charles was accompanied by Prince William.
We are nearing the last years of her reign, and during those last years, if she is no longer capable of putting in public appearances, Prince Charles can deputize on her behalf."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as Charles, 73, read out the Queen’s Speech on his mother’s behalf, it was also clear that day is not yet here.
Advertisement“Wonder how Prince Charles felt about reading out a #QueensSpeech with big fat zero in it on environment,” she tweeted.
Queen Elizabeth II, 96, has scaled back her activities and gradually delegated more duties to Charles and other senior royals.
The special powers she put in place to allow Charles to open Parliament were a one-off, not a permanent arrangement.
The queen, Charles and William work very closely together, said royal biographer Robert Lacey.

     Queen Elizabeth 'Remains Totally in Control': 'The Problem Is Physical Mobility,' Says Royal Biographer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday morning saw Prince Charles take on one of the most important duties of his mother Queen Elizabeth.
Prince William also received a taste of what his destiny as the future King will be like as he joined the ceremony for the first time.
By special order of the Queen, Charles stepped in to give the Queen's Speech at the traditional ceremony after the monarch announced that she was unable to attend amid ongoing mobility issues.
Royal historian and biographer Robert Lacey calls Tuesday's ceremony, which also saw Charles' wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, seated beside him, an "enormously significant moment."
The Queen has been experiencing mobility issues in recent months and finds it difficult to stand for long periods.
