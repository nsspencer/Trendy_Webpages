    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are meant to stay pegged one-to-one to the price of an underlying fiat currency such as the dollar.
The deal, currently being negotiated, offers investors the opportunity to purchase LUNA tokens at a 50% discount, although those tokens would be subject to a two-year vesting schedule.
On Monday, LFG announced it had lent $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and UST to third-party trading firms.
UST attempts to keep parity with the dollar through its relationship with the LUNA token.
Anchor has seen its total deposits drop precipitously from a peak of $14 billion to below $10 billion.

     Yellen says run on UST stablecoin illustrates crypto's risk to financial stability
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed to a recent run on the stablecoin TerraUSD as evidence of the potential threat to financial stability posed by unregulated cryptocurrency markets during a Senate Banking Committee hearing Tuesday.
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aim to maintain a stable value relative to government-issued currencies like the U.S. dollar.
If the price of TerraUSD rises above one dollar, the algorithm will increase its supply until the price falls back to $1.
Stablecoins are at risk of a “run” on the funds backing them if investors lose confidence in the mechanism created to ensure its stable value.
“A stablecoin known as TerraUSD experienced a run and declined in value,” Yellen said.

     Bitcoin investors are panicking as a controversial crypto experiment unravels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UST is important for bitcoin investors as Luna Foundation Guard, an organization supporting the Terra project, is sitting on billions of dollars in bitcoin that could potentially be dumped onto the market at any point.
Investors in bitcoin are in panic mode as the controversial terraUSD stablecoin slips further from its intended $1 peg.
"Very little" of the borrowed bitcoins have been spent, Luna Foundation Guard said, but it is "currently being used to buy" UST.
Several crypto investors are worried that Luna Foundation Guard might have sold, or will sell, a large portion of its bitcoin to prop up UST — analysts pointed out that the group's bitcoin wallet is now completely empty.
Amid all of this uncertainty, UST's decline has sent shock waves throughout the crypto market.

     What the heck is UST and why is it causing crypto chaos?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anyone who counted on UST being valued at $1, for example someone lending UST on a decentralized finance protocol, is in trouble.
The UST is a special type of stablecoin that's called an algorithmic stablecoin.
The mechanisms of supporting UST's price are semi-automated and work well in most scenarios, even when there's lots of volatility.
Called LFG (Luna Foundation Guard), it's a well-funded organization that can add collateral needed to protect the UST's price.
The LFG's coffers are deep, and there may be other large investors willing to jump in and help maintain the UST's price.

     Yellen cites UST stablecoin risk after it loses its dollar peg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The analysis looked at the top 100 Facebook posts by interactions from September 2021 to April 2022 that spread climate and energy misinformation.
The concept that "energy independence" is tied to producing more oil and gas is also misinformation.
You wouldn't know any of this from the posts Media Matters identified, though.
"Honest question," Rowe continues, "Why would we allow energy independence to slip through our fingers?” (We're not.)
“This research and content illustrate that the policies that have been in place to address climate misinformation are inadequate,” Fisher said.
