     How Liverpool beat Aston Villa to draw level on points with Manchester City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool went level on points with Premier League leaders Manchester City after coming from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at Villa Park.
Jurgen Klopp's side had a nightmare start to the game and they fell behind after just three minutes.
Liverpool got on level terms just three minutes later as they took advantage of Villa's inability to clear their lines from a free-kick.
The ball fell to Matip following an effort from Virgil van Djik and he bundled the ball home from close range.
The Liverpool comeback was complete in the 65th minute as Luis Diaz's cross was headed in by Sadio Mane for his 15th Premier League goal of the season.
