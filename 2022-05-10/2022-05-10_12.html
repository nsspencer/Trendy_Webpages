    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the iPod Touch hung on.
Unlike its forebears, it was an iOS device, which meant it could connect to Apple's services, like Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV Plus.
Apple has made those services a main focus over the past few years, even replacing its industry-changing music library, iTunes, with its new streaming platforms.

A day after announcing the iPod touch would remain on sale only while stocks last, the 256GB versions of every color model have already sold out.
The venerable iPod touch was discontinued on May 10, 2022, and by May 11, stocks online were running out.

     Apple Officially Discontinues the iPod touch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Share FacebookTwitterRedditEarlier this year, we asked, “Has Apple Abandoned the iPod touch?” (22 February 2022).
In an Apple Newsroom post titled “The music lives on,” Apple emphasized the many ways you can listen to music using the company’s devices and its Apple Music service.
If you didn’t read carefully, you might have missed the death knell in the subtitle and clarified at the end:Customers can purchase iPod touch through apple.com, Apple Store locations, and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last.
The last surviving member of the line, the iPod touch, hasn’t brought much to the party for years.
While it’s sad to see the iPod touch go and the curtain come down on the iPod line, its time had come.

     Apple Discontinues iPod Touch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple today announced that it is officially discontinuing the iPod touch, an out of date accessory that has been replaced by other devices like the iPhone and the iPad.
Apple says that it is eliminating the ‌iPod touch‌ because its capabilities are available across Apple's product lineup.
The ‌iPod touch‌ is the last remaining device in the iPod lineup, and it has not been updated since May 2019, three years ago.
Apple introduced many iterations of the iPod, including the iPod Shuffle, the iPod nano, and the ‌iPod touch‌, but all have since been phased out and discontinued.
The ‌iPod touch‌ will still be available for purchase through Apple's website, Apple retail stores, and through Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last.

Today, the experience of taking one’s music library out into the world has been integrated across Apple’s product line — from iPhone and Apple Watch to iPad and Mac — along with access to more than 90 million songs and over 30,000 playlists available via Apple Music.
“Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry — it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
And Apple Music delivers industry-leading sound quality with support for spatial audio — there’s no better way to enjoy, discover, and experience music.”Among the incredible ways to enjoy music across a range of devices, including a wide variety of models from the new iPhone SE to the latest iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone is the best device for streaming Apple Music or storing an entire music library on the go.
And for the best way to enjoy music at home, HomePod mini is just $99.
