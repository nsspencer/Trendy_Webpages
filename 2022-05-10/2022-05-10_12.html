     When a Warhol for $225 Has More Heft Than One for $195 Million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You could say that in 1964, with the viewer-friendly repeats of his Marilyns, Warhol was embracing the movement’s new popularity, making works that were not just Pop Art but also truly popular art.
Warhol himself was not completely comfortable with the change that Birillo’s commission was helping to bring about.
He and his assistants referred to the 1964 retreads as “Dead Paintings.” (In addition to the Marilyns, Warhol was being paid to repeat the Campbell’s Soup paintings that had first won him attention in 1961.)
But Warhol’s move toward repetition made a kind of sense, artistically: How better to talk about popular culture and its commodification than by letting your art plunge right inside?
As “mere” repetitions of the 1962 works, the retreads invoked the replication that powers consumer culture.

     Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe portrait sells for record $195 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadAn iconic 1964 silk-screen portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol sold for a little more than $195 million in New York on Monday night, the highest price ever paid for an American artwork at auction.
It also became the second-most expensive artwork to ever sell at auction, according to the auction house Christie’s — behind Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” which fetched more than $450 million in 2017.
The Warhol portrait, described by Christie’s art expert Alex Rotter as “one of the greatest paintings of all time,” sold in about four minutes of bidding to dealer Larry Gagosian.
Pre-auction, the portrait had been expected to fetch as much as $400 million.
The works in Monday’s auction were from the estate of the Swiss art dealers Thomas and Doris Ammann.

     Summary: Warhol's 1964 silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe just fetched $195 million at a Christie's auction in New York.
The Marilyn just beat the previous sales record by a mile, and there's a great story behind this.
The record had been held by Brooklyn artist Jean-Michel Basquiat ... his skull painting sold for $110 mil in 2017.
Jean-Michel and Andy were not only friends ... they collaborated on several hundred paintings.
Their relationship is part of a fascinating Netflix documentary that just dropped, called "The Andy Warhol Diaries."
