     'You okay?': Britney Spears sparks concern after she posts NINE completely nude pics on Instagram
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Britney Spears has sparked concerns for her mental health after stripping down and posting a series of completely nude photos AGAIN, just weeks after announcing her pregnancy.
All the full-front naked photos, posted on Instagram on Monday, May 9, were from her recent holiday to Mexico, taken before she got pregnant with her third child.
They even said Asghari should prevent Spears from posting the photos and that her actions could harm her children.
Last month, she revealed the news in a long Instagram post, saying, "Sex is great when you're pregnant.
"Spears went on to claim that since her almost 14-year conservatorship ended in November, she's been rediscovering happiness in "the little things."

     Summary: Get the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletterFans of Britney Spears fans have begged her to stop posting racy snaps online as she shares more pictures of herself on social media.
According to The Mirror, Britney posted the same photo six times in total with the only difference being shading and closeness.
A third penned: "What are you doing stop it," and a fourth added: "Oh no Britney don’t do this things."
While many fans posted their love for the star, others again asked her to stop with the nudeness.
A third questioned whether she was doing okay, writing: "We all love Britney but we are very concern[sic]."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Britney Spears is certainly embracing being a free woman.
Whereas Instagram doesn’t allow posts featuring nudity, and has previously deleted provocative snaps by stars including Madonna, Britney (my new favourite follow) has defied the rules and repeatedly posted a photo of herself naked in Mexico.
We “slut-shame” them, tell them they’re “too old” to look good or assume there must be something terribly wrong.
I’m not quite 45, so I can’t play along – but I am 40, the same age as Britney.
And while I’m not posting nudes on Instagram, I’m in hell-yes full support of anyone who chooses to.

Scroll down for videoOne of the nine naked photographs posted by Britney Spears to her Instagram account this week.
Dr Audrey Tang told FEMAIL: 'The photos might seem like a cry for help but I'm not sure Britney is even thinking in that way.
Dr Tang explains: 'When you've got someone who's grown up with a very scripted lifestyle, you've got someone who's never learned what freedom is actually like.
Leave some mystery…'However, Dr Tang says it's likely to be hard for the 28-year-old Iranian personal trainer to intervene because he fears appearing controlling like her father.
