Britney CAN still find mental health happiness after the shackles of Jamie Spears' conservatorship Fans fearing that Britney Spears, finally in control of her own affairs at the age of 40, might tip into freefall without the strict regime of the conservatorship should be reassured that the star can achieve strong mental health again, although it will take work, says a psychologist.
Dr Tang explains: 'When you've got someone who's grown up with a very scripted lifestyle, you've got someone who's never learned what freedom is actually like.
Leave some mystery…'However, Dr Tang says it's likely to be hard for the 28-year-old Iranian personal trainer to intervene because he fears appearing controlling like her father.
