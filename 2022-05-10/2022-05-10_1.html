     Heat rules out Kyle Lowry for Game 6 because of hamstring injury. And full injury report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat will try to close out the Philadelphia 76ers without starting point guard Kyle Lowry.
Lowry traveled with the team to his hometown of Philadelphia but was ruled out for Game 6 on Thursday night at Wells Fargo Center because of his strained left hamstring.
Lowry originally strained his left hamstring in Game 3 of the Heat’s first-round series against the Atlanta Hawks on April 22.
He missed the next four games before returning for Game 3 of the second round and then re-aggravating the injury in the Heat’s Game 4 loss in Philadelphia on Sunday.
It was a struggle for Lowry after initially returning from the strained hamstring.

Embiid scored 17 points, while Harden and Harris brought in 14 and 12, respectively.
After remaining in the game, Embiid suffered a blow to the face in the second quarter when Heat center Dewayne Dedmon, trying for a rebound, pushed the ball into Embiid’s mask.
Game Six AnticipationAs the series returns to Philadelphia, Spoelstra says Game Six will be a tough challenge for his top-seeded Heat team.

     Miami Heat Playoffs: Scoring Tables Turned In Game 5 But How Much?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat have the advantage once again.
The Miami Heat struggled to do what has made them who they are in Games 3 and 4 against Philly.
The Miami Heat would win the first, third, and last periods of Game 5, though they would tie in the second, leaving them having won three of four quarters.
The Sixers need everything to go right and the Miami Heat to, flat out, suck while doing it.
Game 6 still has to be played and won—in Philadelphia nonetheless, but if the Miami Heat are just average or better, they should win that one before the thing ever gets to a seventh game.

     Summary: With all momentum lost after losing back-to-back road games, we explore whether it’s time for the Miami Heat to start Tyler Herro.
Heading into a pivotal Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, between the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers, there is plenty on the line for both teams.
Among all of them, there is one logical move that could be the most impactful – inserting Tyler Herro into the starting lineup.
Starting Herro will likely be on the table.
It remains to be seen whether they’ll actually break the emergency glass and make the decision.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The only time the 76ers led in this game was after Joel Embiid made the first basket of the game.
Miami had seven different players score at least 10 points in Game 5 and their starting-five combined to score 79 points in this one.
Looking back on what happened in Game 5, here are the three biggest takeaways from this game.

Looking back on Philadelphia's 20 point victory in Game 3, they held the Heat to just 79 total points.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:49)When the definitive history of the Process-Era Philadelphia 76ers is written someday, there will be many moments and decisions to revisit.
While Butler and Embiid bonded and have remained friends, Simmons became disenfranchised by Butler's playing and leadership style.
In this series, Butler has paid off Miami's faith in him with his usual two-way brilliance.
It was exactly the message Embiid needed to hear as he evolved into an MVP candidate in 2021 and again this season.
Even before this series, that's my guy.
