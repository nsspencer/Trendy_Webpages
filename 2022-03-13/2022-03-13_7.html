     Naomi Osaka Brought to Tears by Heckler at Indian Wells
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Williams sisters’ early years as professionals, there was speculation on tour that their father and co-coach, Richard Williams, was prearranging the results of their matches against each other.
At Indian Wells in 2001, the Russian player Elena Dementieva spoke about her suspicion publicly after losing to Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
Dementieva later insisted her comment had been a joke, and the sisters and Richard Williams denied that any of their match results were prearranged.
But two days later, Serena Williams was booed throughout the tournament final, and Richard Williams, who was watching from the stands with Venus, said he was subjected to racial slurs.
Serena Williams won in three sets but has said that the experience was traumatic and “haunted” her and her family for years.

     Heckler makes tennis star Naomi Osaka cry during Indian Wells Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A heckler shouting at Naomi Osaka during a tournament in California made the tennis star cry on Saturday.
Osaka was playing against Veronika Kudermetova at the Indian Wells Masters in Indian Wells, California, when a woman yelled out, “Naomi, you suck!”The crowd jeered the heckler after the comment was shouted.
Shortly after the heckler’s comment, Osaka asked the umpire if she could use their microphone to address the crowd.
“I just want to say, ‘Thank you,’” Osaka said, as her voice quivered and she appeared to wipe her eyes.
The pressures of the tennis world have caused Osaka to consider taking a hiatus from the sport in the past.

     Botic van de Zandschulp Battles Past Felix Auger-Aliassime At Indian Wells
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you lose match points and then drop the set, you are probably going to be in trouble in the decider.
"Of course you're a little bit frustrated if you have match points in the second set.
It's not like I missed any shots, but he played some great points," van de Zandchulp said.
But despite the thin air in the desert, the courts play relatively slow, which allowed van de Zandschulp to win some points Auger-Aliassime had been in control of.
All was going to plan until late in the second set, when Auger-Aliassime played daring tennis to save three match points at 5-6.

     Summary: But the Croat, an Indian Wells quarterfinalist in 2018, was able to fight back from a late break down to topple 19-year-old Raducanu.
Words from the winner: "It was a rollercoaster of emotions, obviously it was a really tough match," Martic said afterwards.
The pair exchanged breaks twice in the second set, but Martic would have the last word in that frame.
At 6-5, Martic drew more errors from Raducanu, and one final long forehand by the Brit gave Martic a key victory.
