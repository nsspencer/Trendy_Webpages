     Saudi Arabia Puts 81 To Death in its Largest Mass Execution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUBAI (AP) -Sunday, March 13, 2022 at 6:09 am |Saudi King Salman.
(Bandar Aljaloud/Saudi Royal Palace via AP)Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed 81 people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups, the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly plans a trip to Saudi Arabia next week over oil prices as well.
The number of death penalty cases being carried out in Saudi Arabia had dropped during the coronavirus pandemic, though the kingdom continued to behead convicts under King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iran-backed Houthis since 2015 in neighboring Yemen in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power.

     Report: Iran Suspends Talks with Saudi Arabia After Mass Execution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iran has decided to temporarily suspend its secret Baghdad-brokered talks aimed at defusing yearslong tensions with regional rival Saudi Arabia, Iranian state-linked media reported Sunday, a day after Saudi Arabia carried out its largest known mass execution in its modern history.
Iraq's foreign minister earlier had said the fifth round of talks between Saudi and Iranian representatives was due to resume on Wednesday.
Iran, the largest Shi’ite Muslim country in the world, and Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia, severed diplomatic ties in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
Angry Iranians protesting the execution stormed two Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran, fueling years of animosity between the nations.
The pause in diplomatic talks between the countries that have long competed for influence across the Middle East comes at a tense time for the region.

Credit: Vahid Salemi/ APThe Baghdad-mediated talks between the regional foes began quietly in Iraq's capital last year as Saudi Arabia sought a way to end its disastrous war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, a conflict that has spawned the world's worst humanitarian disaster and brought rebel drones and missiles raining down on Saudi airport sand oil facilities.

Concurrently, Talks to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers meanwhile broke off last week without an agreement, casting uncertainty over months of negotiations that had nearly reached a breakthrough.

     Saudi Arabia executes record 81 people in one day for terrorism-related offences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia said Saturday it had executed a record 81 people in one day for terrorism-related offences, exceeding the total number killed last year and sparking criticism from rights activists.
Saudi Arabia has been the target of a series of deadly shootings and bombings since late 2014 carried out by IS group extremists.
"There are prisoners of conscience on Saudi death row, and others arrested as children or charged with non-violent crimes.
Up until Saturday, Saudi Arabia in 2022 had executed 11 people convicted of various crimes, according to an AFP tally based on official announcement.
This brings the total executed so far this year to 92.

     Saudi Arabia executes 81 people in 1 day in mass execution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed 81 people, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian convicted on different charges, including terrorism, espionage and murder, in the kingdom's biggest mass execution in decades, the Interior Ministry said.
The mass execution is likely to bring back attention to Saudi Arabia's human rights record at a time when world powers have been focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
'Violation of basic human rights, international law'Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned Saudi Arabia's execution as a "violation of basic human rights principles and international law," Iranian state media reported Sunday.
Iran also decided to temporarily suspend its secret Baghdad-brokered talks aimed at defusing yearslong tensions with regional rival Saudi Arabia a day after Saudi mass execution.
