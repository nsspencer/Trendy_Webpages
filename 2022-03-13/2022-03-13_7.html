     Yankees acquire Josh Donaldson, trade Gary Sanchez in five-player deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donaldson, 36, provides the Yankees with a veteran slugger who has spent his last two seasons with the Twins.
The Gold Glove-winning shortstop could start at shortstop for the Yankees in 2022, though his below-average bat could keep him in more of a utility role.
Headed back to Minnesota in the deal are a pair of players who have spent the majority of their careers in New York.
Although much improved from a dreadful 2020 campaign, the veteran catcher posted just a .204 batting average with 23 home runs and 54 RBI in 2021.
The glove-first Urshela also saw his numbers take a dip last season, hitting .267 with 14 home runs and 49 RBI.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees and Twins make a deal.
Going to the Yankees: Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt.
Donaldson is owed $21.75 million for the next two seasons, with an option for 2024 at $16 million and an $8 million buyout.
Urshela had a rough time with the Blue Jays but had two excellent seasons with the Yankees and then didn’t do well last year, hitting .267/.301/.419.
I don’t see the trade helping either team, but I’ll hate seeing Donaldson in the Yankees jersey.

     New Yankees teammates Josh Donaldson, Gerrit Cole share contentious history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Nine months after putting Gerrit Cole squarely in the crosshairs of MLB’s crackdown on sticky substances, Josh Donaldson is about to share a clubhouse with the Yankees’ ace.
Cole and Donaldson became teammates Sunday night when the Yankees pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela to the Twins for Donaldson, shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and catcher Ben Rortvedt.
“Is it coincidence that Gerrit Cole’s spin rate numbers went down [Thursday] after four minor leaguers got suspended for 10 games?” the third baseman told Minnesota reporters.
At the same time, with this situation, they’ve let guys do it.”Josh Donaldson (right) called out new teammate Gerrit Cole (left) last season over his spin rate.
That night — the game Donaldson referenced — Cole’s spin rates went down noticeably as he got knocked around by the Rays.

     Twins, Yankees complete trade to send Gary Sánchez to Minnesota and Josh Donaldson to New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees have agreed to a significant multi-player trade that involves two All-Stars.
Urshela has been the Yankees' starting third baseman for most of the last three seasons when healthy.
With the trade of Sánchez, Kyle Higashioka moves into the starting catcher role in the Bronx.
Sánchez, 29, hit .204/.307/.423 with 23 homers and 54 RBI in 440 plate appearances last season.
In 2019-20 with the Yankees, Urshela slashed a combined .310/.359/.523 (134 OPS+), so the Twins will be hoping they get that version.

     Summary: Check out some of the best highlights that Yankees fans can come to expect from new third baseman Josh Donaldson.
Less than 24 hours later, he was traded to the New York Yankees alongside former American League MVP Josh Donaldson and catcher Ben Rortvedt in exchange for catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
Earlier in the day, Yankees manager Aaron Boone had announced Urshela as the Yankees' starting shortstop.
On a conference call with Minnesota reporters after the trade, Kiner-Falefa addressed his disappointment in getting dealt, saying Seager's acquisition "definitely hurt."
After the trade to New York was announced, Kiner-Falefa took to Twitter to express his enthusiasm in donning the pinstripes.

     Summary: New York jettisoned Sanchez, a two-time All-Star who's been a defensive liability and slumped at the plate in four straight seasons.
Kiner-Falefa was acquired by the Twins just on Saturday from Texas in a deal for catcher Mitch Garver.
He agreed to a $92 million, four-year contract with the Twins, the richest free-agent deal in franchise history.
Now 36, he hit .247 with 26 homers and 72 RBIs last year in his second season with the Twins.
Urshela, 30, is a smooth fielder who hit 267 with 18 doubles, 14 homers and 49 RBIs last season.

     Summary: Sep 17, 2021; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Minnesota Twins third baseman Josh Donaldson (20) hits a solo home run against Toronto Blue Jays in the third inning at Rogers Centre.
Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports2022-03-14 04:26:13 GMT+00:00 - The New York Yankees acquired veteran third baseman Josh Donaldson from the Minnesota Twins on Sunday night.
He has 251 career homers, 26 of them coming last year in his second season with the Twins.
"Is it coincidence that Gerrit Cole's spin rate numbers went down (Thursday) after four minor leaguers got suspended for 10 games," Donaldson said.
Sanchez has 138 homers and 340 RBIs in 538 career games in six-plus seasons, all with the Yankees.

     Yankees Acquire Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Ben Rortvedt From Twins For Gary Sanchez, Gio Urshela
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bronx Bombers’ quiet offseason has come to an abrupt end, as the Yankees and Twins have combined on a blockbuster of a five-player deal.
Third baseman Josh Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and catcher Ben Rortvedt are all heading to the Yankees, while the Twins will pick up catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
The $50MM still owed on Donaldson’s contract is being entirely absorbed by the Yankees, as per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
Another flip doesn’t appear to be forthcoming, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal says the Twins plan to use Sanchez behind the plate.
Should Sanchez and Urshela return to their 2019 form, that will be more than make up for the loss of Donaldson’s bat.
