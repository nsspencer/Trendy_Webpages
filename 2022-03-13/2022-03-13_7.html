     Josh Donaldson Returns to AL East in Trade to Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2015 MVP will come to town more often this year.
Former Toronto Blue Jays third basemen Josh Donaldson will return to the American League East this season, following a trade from the Minnesota Twins to the New York Yankees.
Donaldson played parts of four seasons with the Blue Jays from 2015 to 2018, leading Toronto to two playoff appearances while receiving MVP votes three times.
After he was flipped at the 2018 waiver trade deadline to Cleveland for reliever Julian Merryweather, Donaldson has since played in Atlanta and Minnesota, before Sunday's trade to the Yankees.
The hot corner received a standing ovation from Blue Jays fans during his latest visit to Toronto during the 2021 season.

     Yankees Trade for Josh Donaldson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees and Twins make a deal.
Going to the Yankees: Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt.
Donaldson is owed $21.75 million for the next two seasons, with an option for 2024 at $16 million and an $8 million buyout.
Urshela had a rough time with the Blue Jays but had two excellent seasons with the Yankees and then didn’t do well last year, hitting .267/.301/.419.
I don’t see the trade helping either team, but I’ll hate seeing Donaldson in the Yankees jersey.

     New Yankees teammates Josh Donaldson, Gerrit Cole share contentious history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — Nine months after putting Gerrit Cole squarely in the crosshairs of MLB’s crackdown on sticky substances, Josh Donaldson is about to share a clubhouse with the Yankees’ ace.
Cole and Donaldson became teammates Sunday night when the Yankees pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela to the Twins for Donaldson, shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and catcher Ben Rortvedt.
“Is it coincidence that Gerrit Cole’s spin rate numbers went down [Thursday] after four minor leaguers got suspended for 10 games?” the third baseman told Minnesota reporters.
At the same time, with this situation, they’ve let guys do it.”Josh Donaldson (right) called out new teammate Gerrit Cole (left) last season over his spin rate.
That night — the game Donaldson referenced — Cole’s spin rates went down noticeably as he got knocked around by the Rays.

     Twins, Yankees complete trade to send Gary Sánchez to Minnesota and Josh Donaldson to New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees have agreed to a significant multi-player trade that involves two All-Stars.
Urshela has been the Yankees' starting third baseman for most of the last three seasons when healthy.
With the trade of Sánchez, Kyle Higashioka moves into the starting catcher role in the Bronx.
Sánchez, 29, hit .204/.307/.423 with 23 homers and 54 RBI in 440 plate appearances last season.
In 2019-20 with the Yankees, Urshela slashed a combined .310/.359/.523 (134 OPS+), so the Twins will be hoping they get that version.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Catcher Gary Sánchez and Gio Urshela will head to Minneapolis, as the Twins sent back former MVP Josh Donaldson, presumptive new shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and 24-year old catching prospect Ben Rortvedt.
Maybe some offensive tweaks have been made in the offseason, maybe not, but I can’t see him catching 130 games.
I can’t really see Ben Rortvedt catching half the games this season either, unless, again, the Yankees think they’ve unlocked something in his game.
For what it’s worth, catching coach Tanner Swanson had a strong connection with him when they worked together in Minnesota, so maybe there’s something there.
Now’s the time to make one more move, maybe trade for Matt Olson with a fully stocked farm or really pursue Freddie Freeman.

     Summary: Check out some of the best highlights that Yankees fans can come to expect from new third baseman Josh Donaldson.
Less than 24 hours later, he was traded to the New York Yankees alongside former American League MVP Josh Donaldson and catcher Ben Rortvedt in exchange for catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
Earlier in the day, Yankees manager Aaron Boone had announced Urshela as the Yankees' starting shortstop.
On a conference call with Minnesota reporters after the trade, Kiner-Falefa addressed his disappointment in getting dealt, saying Seager's acquisition "definitely hurt."
After the trade to New York was announced, Kiner-Falefa took to Twitter to express his enthusiasm in donning the pinstripes.

Where I’m confused is Josh Donaldson.
The Yankees have not spent a lot of money on position players as of late, yet they are taking on the full $50 million over two years to acquire an aging Josh Donaldson.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bronx Bombers’ quiet offseason has come to an abrupt end, as the Yankees and Twins have combined on a blockbuster of a five-player deal.
Third baseman Josh Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and catcher Ben Rortvedt are all heading to the Yankees, while the Twins will pick up catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
The $50MM still owed on Donaldson’s contract is being entirely absorbed by the Yankees, as per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
Another flip doesn’t appear to be forthcoming, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal says the Twins plan to use Sanchez behind the plate.
Should Sanchez and Urshela return to their 2019 form, that will be more than make up for the loss of Donaldson’s bat.
