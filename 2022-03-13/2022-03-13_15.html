    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ray Allen at TD Garden for KG's jersey retirement originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonThe will-he-or-won't-he question has been answered.
Weeks after posing for a photo together at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Cleveland, Ray Allen is indeed at the TD Garden for the jersey retirement ceremony of his former Boston Celtics teammate, Kevin Garnett, along with Paul Pierce and many other members of the 2008 NBA Championship team.

Allen, Garnett and Pierce were teammates together for five seasons before Allen left as a free agent for the rival Miami Heat of LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, where he added a second ring in 2013.
Tensions had been high between Allen and several of his former Celtics teammates since his departure, but a thaw is no longer just in the works -- the tensions may have completely melted away.

    </h2>

“I’m just trying to soak it up, being honest, I’m trying to be very humble,” Garnett said last month of the honor.
