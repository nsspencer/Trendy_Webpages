     Four takeaways as Boston Celtics lose to Dallas Mavericks 95-92 after controversial overturn of three-point foul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luka Doncic had a team-high 26 points for Dallas as the visitors fought back from a 13-point first half deficit to make a seesaw defensive slugfest for much of the second half.
Spencer Dinwiddie capped a 6-0 run for Dallas with a go-ahead 3 to help Dallas to the road win with nine seconds remaining.
The Mavericks went just 1-of-8 from 3-point range besides Doncic while Celtics not named Tatum or Al Horford combined to go just 3-of-12 from the field in the opening frame.
Brown even went for a high-five with Garnett after dunking over Mavericks big man Maxi Kleber midway through the second quarter.
However, it wasn’t enough for the Celtics reserves after they went 6-of-23 from the field, contributing to a tough offensive outing for Boston.
