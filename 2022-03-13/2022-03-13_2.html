     Summary: The last four at-large bids, for teams that would then compete in the first four play-in games, are completely up for grabs.
Now, the women’s college basketball juggernaut poses a challenge to the selection committee.
How do you weigh UConn’s comparatively ugly record, with its losses to three unranked teams, with the fact that the Huskies currently look unstoppable?
Along with Baylor, the Huskies appear to be vying for the top No.
The question now is how the selection committee will weigh their surprise success.

     Summary: Time: 3:00p PTTV: CBSThe Pac-12 will almost certainly have exactly 3 teams in the tournament this year: Arizona, UCLA, and USC.
However, as of this morning it appears that all 4 #1 seeds will come from teams west of the Mississippi (Gonzaga, Arizona, Kansas, and Baylor) which would be the first time that has ever happened.
This comes on the heels of the first Final 4 to feature all teams west of the Mississippi last year (Gonzaga, UCLA, Baylor, Houston).
This year the women’s tournament finally has gotten the rights to be advertised as part of “March Madness”.
The Degree Bracket Gap Challenge is trying to help increase gender equity across college basketball and is encouraging folks to fill out a bracket for the women’s tournament as well.
