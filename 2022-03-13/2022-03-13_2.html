     March Madness 2022: What you need to know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) With both the NCAA men's and women's postseason basketball tournaments starting next week and Selection Sunday just hours away, here's what you need to know about the road to both Final Fours.
Selection Sunday, when college basketball teams find out their March Madness place, features two special programs this Sunday -- CBS airs the men's bracket reveal at 6 p.m.
Thirty-two teams automatically qualify for the men's tournament after winning their respective conference tournaments.
This year's edition of the women's tournament will be the first to field 68 teams.
The selection process is identical to the men's tournament with 32 automatic bids for winning a conference tournament and the remainder being at-large.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Time: 3:00p PTTV: CBSThe Pac-12 will almost certainly have exactly 3 teams in the tournament this year: Arizona, UCLA, and USC.
However, as of this morning it appears that all 4 #1 seeds will come from teams west of the Mississippi (Gonzaga, Arizona, Kansas, and Baylor) which would be the first time that has ever happened.
This comes on the heels of the first Final 4 to feature all teams west of the Mississippi last year (Gonzaga, UCLA, Baylor, Houston).
This year the women’s tournament finally has gotten the rights to be advertised as part of “March Madness”.
The Degree Bracket Gap Challenge is trying to help increase gender equity across college basketball and is encouraging folks to fill out a bracket for the women’s tournament as well.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2021 event was held in a bubble and saw the Baylor Bears win their first NCAA men's basketball championship.
Can the men's tournament lure 20 million viewers?
The NCAA men's tournament returns to Turner Sports this year for the first time since 2018, when Villanova beat the University of Michigan.
The contest attracted an average of 4 million viewers and was the most-watched women's contest since 2014.
The decision came after growing pressure and criticism over the organization's original stance on using the trademark just for the men's tournament.
