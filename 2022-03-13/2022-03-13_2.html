     Naomi Osaka Brought to Tears by Heckler at Indian Wells
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Williams sisters’ early years as professionals, there was speculation on tour that their father and co-coach, Richard Williams, was prearranging the results of their matches against each other.
At Indian Wells in 2001, the Russian player Elena Dementieva spoke about her suspicion publicly after losing to Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
Dementieva later insisted her comment had been joke, and the sisters and Richard Williams denied that any of their match results were prearranged.
But two days later, Serena Williams was booed throughout the tournament final, and Richard Williams, who was watching from the stands with Venus, said he was subjected to racial slurs.
Serena Williams won in three sets but has said that the experience was traumatic and “haunted” her and her family for years.

     Naomi Osaka Cries, Addresses Crowd After Fan Heckles Her During Loss at Indian Wells
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Osaka never recovered from the incident, losing 6-0, 6-4, and addressed the crowd after the match.
"But [being] heckled here, I watched a video of Venus and Serena [Williams] getting heckled here, and if you've never watched it, you should watch it.
The Williams sisters famously boycotted Indian Wells for more than a decade after Venus, Serena and their father Richard were heckled and booed at the 2001 event.
Osaka, who idolized the Williams sisters growing up, has been open about her struggles with mental health.
"I want to feel like every time I step on the court I'm having fun," Osaka told reporters in January.

"I've been heckled before and it didn't really bother me," Osaka said while holding back tears.
I've watched video of Venus and Serena get heckled here and if you've never watched it, you should watch it.
Kudermetova closed out victory over the four-time Grand Slam champion, even when Osaka regrouped in the second set.
