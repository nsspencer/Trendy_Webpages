     Vikings reportedly extend Kirk Cousins, deal includes no-trade clause
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Vikings have reportedly decided to give quarterback Kirk Cousins a one-year extension that will keep him under contract until 2024.
The deal also includes a no-trade clause, meaning Minnesota cannot deal the quarterback to another team before 2024 without his approval.
Minnesota Vikings significantly lower the 2022 cap hit of Kirk Cousins with extensionAny sort of extension Minnesota was going to give Cousins was likely going to lower his cap hit for 2022 and this new deal has certainly done just that.
The Vikings quarterback will now see his cap hit for next season reduced from $45 million to $31.4 million.
The contract also includes two void years on the end of it to help Minnesota reduce Cousins’ cap hit for the 2022 campaign.

     Kirk Cousins signing one-year, $35M extension with Vikings thru 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cousins gets a raise to $40 million in 2022 with $55 million payable by next March and a no-trade clause, Pelissero added.
The new deal also allows Minnesota to save almost $14 million against the salary cap.
Although the Vikings had received trade interest in Cousins in recent weeks, new head coach Kevin O'Connell had been clear about wanting to work with the veteran passer, saying in mid-February that he anticipated Cousins "being a part of what we do."
A three-time Pro Bowler, with two of those selections earned during his four seasons with the Vikings, Cousins is coming off a season in which he threw for 4,221 yards, 33 touchdowns and just seven interceptions.
However, the Vikings went 8-9 last year and failed to make the postseason for the third time in four seasons with Cousins under center.

     Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins agrees to one-year extension worth $35 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I am thrilled for the opportunity to play for Kevin and could not be more excited about the direction of our team," Cousins said in a statement.
Under the terms of his previous contract, Cousins was due to receive $35 million in cash and count for $45 million against the Vikings' 2022 cap.
They entered the weekend needing to clear $17 million in cap space by Wednesday in order to comply with the NFL's $208.2 million cap for 2022.
Cousins' contract made a release untenable, even if that's what the team's new leadership preferred, and it's unclear if there were any serious trade discussions.
By the end of the 2023 season, he will have earned at least $231.7 million in his career.

     Skeptics out in full force as fans react to Kirk Cousins extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not everyone is on board with the Minnesota Vikings offering quarterback Kirk Cousins a contract extension.
There have always been skeptics that believe the contract outweighs the talent as far as Cousins is concerned.
Sure, Cousins being on the field gives the Vikings the chance to win football games right now, but his overpriced contract has limited the team from making other moves.
By agreeing to this deal, the Vikings are hitching themselves to the same wagon as former general manager Rick Spielman and head coach Mike Zimmer.
For now, here’s what fans are saying about the move on social media.

     Vikings Agree in Principle to Contract Extension with QB Kirk Cousins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the team didn't announce the terms, the contract extension presumably lowers his 2022 cap hit.
He and the previous leadership of the team agreed on two-year extension in March 2020.
Cousins will get a chance to work with Vikings Head Coach Kevin O'Connell, an offensive-minded coach who was hired in February.
The two were together in Washington in 2017, when O'Connell was Washington's quarterbacks coach.
Cousins threw for 4,091 yards with 27 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in his lone season with O'Connell.

     Kirk Cousins, Vikings Agree to Reported 1-Year, $35M Contract Extension Through 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesThe Minnesota Vikings are keeping Kirk Cousins under center through at least 2023.
Cousins also reportedly landed a no-trade clause in the extension.
Despite this decision, nobody has better symbolized the Vikings' inability to get over the hump than Cousins.
Only Matt Ryan ($48.7 million) and Aaron Rodgers ($46.7 million) were slated to count for more against the cap.
That means Cousins will be under center once again as the Vikings look to parlay some of that talent into a deep playoff run.
