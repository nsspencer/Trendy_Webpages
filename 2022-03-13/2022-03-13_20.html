     Summary: It has not been easy pickings for Harris since the All-Star break.
He has not been shooting well and he has had a really tough time getting into any rhythm on the offensive end.
He has received a lot of criticism as well so it made Georges Niang feel good when he made the shot.
He is one of the highest-paid players on the team and that is something that gets used against him all the time.
“He deserves all the accolades and praise that come his way after a performance like this.”

     Sixers' Danny Green Ruled Out vs. Magic on Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the Sixers entered their Thursday night primetime matchup against the Brooklyn Nets, they missed one of their key reserves in Danny Green.
Considering the way the 2021-2022 season has gone for the veteran forward, Green’s absence wasn’t a make-or-break situation for the Sixers.
The Sixers took on one of their worst losses of the season against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday.
According to the Sixers’ Sunday morning injury report, Green is ruled out for Sunday night’s game.
Green was ruled out for the remainder of the matchup when the team returned to the court for the second half due to a finger laceration.

1 Sixers pickThough he was out with a designation of “return to competition reconditioning/back soreness,” the Sixers saw their No.
On that same night, Embiid posted a career-best 50.
And Bamba’s unbelievable outside shooting had the Magic up 10 points at halftime of that last meeting in Philadelphia.
Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets are looming on Monday night, but the Sixers will first have to work for a win in Orlando.

     Summary: In addition to the two All-Stars, Rivers revealed that the second-year guard Tyrese Maxey could also see some rest down the stretch as well.
While Maxey's only 21-years-old and is in great shape -- the young guard understands that rest could go a long way in sustaining that.
Then when you need the rest, you got to take the rest.
Unlike last year, Maxey won't enter the playoffs as a reserve that's in and out of the rotation.
Therefore, Maxey has to be well-rested and on his A-game when the Sixers begin the playoffs next month.

     Summary: Tobias Harris is a fantastic person, a true warrior for equality, and a great veteran.
When the Sixers traded for Harris, he was our third option behind Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid.
When the Sixers signed Harris to a five-year $180 million deal, both parties expected him to be the Sixers’ second or third option and that he would perform as such.
The Sixers have failed to unearth the best version of Tobias Harris all season.
When someone mentions Tobias Harris, most people think of a scoring forward who operates in the mid-range and beyond.

     Summary: Here’s a quarter-by-quarter breakdown of my observations from tonight’s 116-114 nail-biter Sixers win over the Orlando Magic.
Q2: Sixers are just getting thoroughly out-hustled by this hungry Magic team on the road and it’s showing on the scoreboard.
Matisse Thybulle picking up three first half fouls against the Magic with Danny Green out is something that just can’t happen.
Terrible Matisse game so far.
Somehow, after sleepwalking in the first half and on really bad shooting nights from the field for Embiid and Harden, the Sixers escape with the win.

The Sixers trailed 113-109 after consecutive Cole Anthony threes in overtime but managed to avoid a disheartening defeat.
Harden and Harris made early threes, Embiid started drawing fouls like he usually does, and the team’s transition defense improved.
Thanks to shotmaking from Harden, Embiid and Niang, the Sixers kept pushing Orlando.
Embiid and Harden combined to shoot 14 for 47 from the floor and 28 of 32 from the foul line.
