     Minnesota Vikings give QB Kirk Cousins one-year extension, no-trade clause
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Staff and wire reportsThe Minnesota Vikings and quarterback Kirk Cousins agreed Sunday to a one-year contract extension, his agent, Mike McCartney, announced.
The quarterback also received a no-trade clause in the agreement, giving him veto power in any proposed swap.
He threw only seven interceptions for the best interception percentage (1.2) of his career.
Cousins is 59-59-2 as a starter in the NFL, plus 1-2 in the playoffs.
He has played the last four years for the Vikings, who went 8-9 in 2021.

     Vikings Sign Kirk Cousins to One-Year, $35 Million Contract Extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Vikings have signed quarterback Kirk Cousins to a one-year, $35 million contract extension, as first announced by his agent Mike McCartney.
For the Vikings, this move saves roughly $14 million on their 2022 salary cap, nearly getting them under the cap.
The Vikings reportedly received calls from teams interested in Cousins this offseason, but decided to keep him in Minnesota.
Cousins will make $40 million this season and $30 million in 2023.
The Vikings are running it back with Cousins in 2022 and 2023.

     Vikings Make Kirk Cousins Decision: NFL World Reacts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In case you thought Tom Brady would be the only quarterback to make news tonight, Kirk Cousins says not so fast.
The new deal contains two voidable years in order to lower Cousins’ massive cap hit for 2022.
Throughout NFL history, there have been plenty of worse quarterbacks than Kirk Cousins.
On Sunday night, the NFL world once again marveled at Cousins’ ability to pad his bank account.
— Jason_OTC (@Jason_OTC) March 13, 2022Presumably some much-needed salary cap space this season for the Vikes and Kirk has some certainty for his future.

     Summary: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesThe Minnesota Vikings are keeping Kirk Cousins under center through at least 2023.
Cousins also reportedly landed a no-trade clause in the extension.
Despite this decision, nobody has better symbolized the Vikings' inability to get over the hump than Cousins.
Only Matt Ryan ($48.7 million) and Aaron Rodgers ($46.7 million) were slated to count for more against the cap.
That means Cousins will be under center once again as the Vikings look to parlay some of that talent into a deep playoff run.

     Vikings sign Kirk Cousins to fully guaranteed $35M extension through 2023 ahead of free agency, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell has said repeatedly he's excited to work with quarterback Kirk Cousins in 2022.
Now, the new front office has ensured he'll get the chance, signing the veteran quarterback on Sunday to a one-year extension, according to NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.
The Vikings were expected to shed salary in order to clear space for free agency, but a Cousins extension was also always a possibility, even though it would commit a new regime to the 33-year-old QB.
Cousins is entering his fifth season with the Vikings, and now his third contract with the team.
He originally signed a fully guaranteed three-year, $84M deal in 2017 free agency, then inked a two-year, $66M extension ahead of the 2020 season.

     Summary: Kirk Cousins is staying put in Minnesota through at least 2023.
The Vikings are signing Cousins to a one-year, $35 million fully guaranteed extension that puts him under contract through 2023, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported.
Minnesota later announced it had agreed in principle to an extension with Cousins.
Cousins gets a raise to $40 million in 2022 with $55 million payable by next March and a no-trade clause, Pelissero added.
However, the Vikings went 8-9 last year and failed to make the postseason for the third time in four seasons with Cousins under center.

     Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins agrees to one-year extension worth $35 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I am thrilled for the opportunity to play for Kevin and could not be more excited about the direction of our team," Cousins said in a statement.
Under the terms of his previous contract, Cousins was due to receive $35 million in cash and count for $45 million against the Vikings' 2022 cap.
They entered the weekend needing to clear $17 million in cap space by Wednesday in order to comply with the NFL's $208.2 million cap for 2022.
Cousins' contract made a release untenable, even if that's what the team's new leadership preferred, and it's unclear if there were any serious trade discussions.
By the end of the 2023 season, he will have earned at least $231.7 million in his career.
