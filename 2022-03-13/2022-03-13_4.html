     WWE Star Scott Hall On Life Support After Hip Surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott Hall -- one of WWE's biggest superstars from the 20th century -- is reportedly on life support ... this after major surgery complications.
The news was reported Sunday by PW Torch, which says Hall is clinging to life at a hospital in Georgia ... following a procedure to work on his broken hip.
PWT reports the heart attacks come on the heels of his hip surgery last week, which they say caused a complication when a blood clot got loose in the midst of operating.
Hall is a multi-time champ -- he's won multiple titles with the WCW, including several tag team championships, and at least four with WWF.
Despite stepping away from WWE in the early 2000s, he continued to wrestle professionally until about 2010, at which point he semi-retired ... but still stayed active within WWE.
