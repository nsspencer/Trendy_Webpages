    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen have appeared to bury the hatchet after years of turmoil following Allen’s departure to the Miami Heat in the summer of 2012.
Allen was in attendance for Garnett’s jersey retirement ceremony at TD Garden on Sunday, surrounded by the majority of Garnett’s 2008 championship teammates including Paul Pierce, Brian Scalabrine, James Posey, Eddie House, Kendrick Perkins and Glen Davis.
Pierce said some words about his close friend and former teammate at the beginning of the ceremony before an entertaining Q-and-A session between Garnett and Scalabrine midway through the ceremony.
“It’s good to say Ray Allen here, man,” Garnett said during the question-and-answer session of his ceremony.
Pierce, Garnett and Allen also posed for pictures after the ceremony concluded, much to the delight of the Garden crowd.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ray Allen downplays tensions with KG, Pierce originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonWhat beef?
According to Ray Allen, it never existed.
Asked by NBC Sports Boston analyst/former teammate Brian Scalabrine if "the beef was squashed," a reference to Allen's reported falling out with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and other members of the 2008 NBA champion Boston Celtics, Allen said there never was any.
"When I left, I was so excited for my journey that I was on, but I loved these guys," Allen said.
While Allen and Pierce had reportedly smoothed things over a few years back, it wasn't until All-Star Weekend in Cleveland last month that Allen and Garnett showed signs of a thaw.
