    </h2>

     Summary: Keith Richards confirmed that the Rolling Stones are working on some new tunes.
I was working with Mick last week, and Steve, and we came up with some, eight or nine new pieces of material.
Other times, [songwriting is] like a desert.”Asked why coming up with new material can be easier or harder at times, Richards shrugged.
“If I could find her address (laughing).”The Stones' last album, Blue &amp; Lonesome, came out in 2015 and was made up of blues cover songs.

     Summary: The Rolling Stones guitarist told CBS Sunday Morning that he quit smoking cigarettes two years ago, after 55 years of the habit.
Joking that he was “probably getting on a bit,” Richards added.
X-Pensive Winos drummer Steve Jordan, who also took over percussion for the Rolling Stones last summer when Charlie Watts fell ill, said Richards is “singing more in the original keys.”Keith Richards, 78, has given up smoking.
Watts, who had been the Rolling Stones’ drummer since 1963, died at age 80 in a London hospital.
But now, Richards finds great joy in pursuing things outside the group he’s come to know so well.
