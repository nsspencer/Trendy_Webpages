She says the change in light can disrupt your circadian rhythm, your body’s internal clock.
“For those dealing with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and more, Glick says the best thing to do as your body adjust is to sleep.
“That sleep loss just results in more feelings of depression and really you know those mood disturbances as well,” she said.
It takes about 5-7 days for your circadian rhythm to adjust, so make sure you go to bed at a decent time, eat healthily, and unwind.

     Growing movement to make daylight saving time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, time in most of the U.S. advanced by one hour to begin daylight saving time, a tradition regulated by the Uniform Time Act of 1966.
Under federal law, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
"There are bills in both houses of Congress that would make daylight saving time permanent year-round," Jim Reed, NCSL’s director of the Environment, Energy &amp; and Transportation program, said.
Before 1966, there were few standards for DST, and states were on their own for its implementation.
RELATED: Tips for checking smoke alarms during daylight saving timeExperts say without substantial movement in congress on the bills, the current method of switching from standard time to DST, and vice versa, will be sticking around for a while.

     New bill could have California voters weigh in on daylight saving time — again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Proposition 7, approved by 59% of voters, gave state lawmakers the authority to move the state to year-round daylight saving time, but only after approval from Congress.
But in the years since, state lawmakers haven’t passed legislation to join the list of states officially waiting for Congress to legalize year-round daylight saving time.
The federal government does not currently permit states to be on year-round daylight saving time.
Assembly member Steven Choi (R-Irvine) wants California to join Arizona and Hawaii in year-round standard time, but he wants voters to weigh in, too.
His new bill, AB2868, in its current form would switch to permanent daylight saving time upon federal approval.

     Summary: CARLSBAD, Calif. – Sleep scientists are once again warning of health repercussions as Daylight Saving Time is in full effect.
Colin Lawlor, CEO of SleepScore Labs headquartered in Carlsbad, says there is a 24% increase in heart attacks on Monday, immediately after Daylight Saving Time.
He said the research is clear: springing the clock ahead an hour increases the risk of stroke and car crashes the first week of the time change.
“One of the key things we have is this constant clock, which is going inside our bodies, it’s our circadian rhythm,” he said.
Lawlor said it doesn’t matter which clock lawmakers choose because it’s all about consistency.

Finally, Russia’s war in Ukraine has also shifted geopolitics to China’s disadvantage.
In all these ways, a quick end to Russia’s war would be very good for China.

     Summary: But, in international law, genocide has nothing explicitly to do with the enormity of criminal acts.
By this standard, Putin’s war of obliteration comes readily into focus as genocidal, if not—to date, anyway—as comprehensive genocide.
But Putin had made himself clear: he viewed Ukraine as a corpse, and would have his way with it.
After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia. . . . Now this problem is gone—Ukraine has returned to Russia. . . . Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over.
By his own account, Putin’s fight is, above all, against humiliation, and that is a fight he’s losing badly.
