     Jason Sudeikis on making "Ted Lasso" and the show's future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Sudeikis on how many seasons "Ted Lasso" might runWhen actor Jason Sudeikis introduced coach Ted Lasso to the world nearly ten years ago, no one could have predicted the character's trajectory.
He began as a silly ad-campaign for NBC Sports to promote soccer's English Premier League in the United States but the Apple TV+ show that bears his name has become a phenomenon.
Sunday on 60 Minutes, correspondent Norah O'Donnell reported from England where she met the show's stars and went for a walk around Richmond.
In newly released videos, O'Donnell asks Sudeikis if Ted Lasso will fall in love and how many seasons he thinks the show will last.
The Emmy Award winning actor and Saturday Night Live alum also showed O'Donnell around the AFC Richmond locker room, explaining the secret history of the club and who some of the Richmond Greyhounds are named for.

     ‘Ted Lasso’ has (still) never lost at Critics Choice Awards: 7 wins from 7 nominations across 2 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The wins just keep coming for “Ted Lasso.” The Apple TV+ comedy series has now claimed seven wins at the Critics Choice Awards from seven nominations across two years.
SEE Critics Choice Awards 2022 full winners listThe only Critics Choice Awards comedy category in which “Ted Lasso” wasn’t eligible was lead actress.
Two weeks ago, “Ted Lasso” prevailed at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for its ensemble cast and for male actor Sudeikis.
The former “SNL” star plays Ted Lasso, an American football coach who travels to England to coach soccer, a sport he knows nothing about.
Season 1 took home a whopping seven Emmys for comedy series, actor (Sudeikis), supporting actress (Waddingham), supporting actor (Goldstein), casting, picture editing and sound mixing.
