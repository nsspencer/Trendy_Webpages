     Summary: Time: 3:00p PTTV: CBSThe Pac-12 will almost certainly have exactly 3 teams in the tournament this year: Arizona, UCLA, and USC.
However, as of this morning it appears that all 4 #1 seeds will come from teams west of the Mississippi (Gonzaga, Arizona, Kansas, and Baylor) which would be the first time that has ever happened.
This comes on the heels of the first Final 4 to feature all teams west of the Mississippi last year (Gonzaga, UCLA, Baylor, Houston).
This year the women’s tournament finally has gotten the rights to be advertised as part of “March Madness”.
The Degree Bracket Gap Challenge is trying to help increase gender equity across college basketball and is encouraging folks to fill out a bracket for the women’s tournament as well.

     New bill could have California voters weigh in on daylight saving time — again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Proposition 7, approved by 59% of voters, gave state lawmakers the authority to move the state to year-round daylight saving time, but only after approval from Congress.
But in the years since, state lawmakers haven’t passed legislation to join the list of states officially waiting for Congress to legalize year-round daylight saving time.
The federal government does not currently permit states to be on year-round daylight saving time.
Assembly member Steven Choi (R-Irvine) wants California to join Arizona and Hawaii in year-round standard time, but he wants voters to weigh in, too.
His new bill, AB2868, in its current form would switch to permanent daylight saving time upon federal approval.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It gives you a chance after work, for those people that still have to work, to have some more sunshine,” Young said.
Daylight Saving Time was introduced in 1918 in the United States, but several states, including Alabama, have made efforts to stop the time change.
“More daylight down here means more sun, means more activity,” said Decatur resident Billy Robbins.
“It keeps people from having wintertime blues.”Alabama is one of eighteen states, including Tennessee, Georgia, California, and Michigan, that has passed legislation to make Daylight Saving Time permanent.
The act would establish permanent Daylight Saving Time on a national level and is still sitting in committee in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

“For those dealing with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and more, Glick says the best thing to do as your body adjust is to sleep.
“That sleep loss just results in more feelings of depression and really you know those mood disturbances as well,” she said.
It takes about 5-7 days for your circadian rhythm to adjust, so make sure you go to bed at a decent time, eat healthily, and unwind.

     N.C.A.A. Men’s Tournament Seedings Set as Spectacle Returns to March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a hint of what lays ahead, and what had been missing, at Madison Square Garden late last week when sellout crowds for the Big East Conference tournament brought the old building to life — particularly Friday’s late-night semifinal when Villanova held off Connecticut in an old-school Big East throwdown that Villanova Coach Jay Wright called “a basketball junkie’s dream.”He was not the only one who looked forward to playing in buildings with juice.
“I’m really going to appreciate it, especially with what we went through last year with limited fans and being in a bubble,” said Creighton senior guard Alex O’Connell, who played in two tournaments at Duke before transferring and reaching the round of 16 last year with the Bluejays, another Big East program.
His team’s run ended not before a raucous crowd in a cavernous arena, but in front of a restricted number of masked fans far from the court in the quaint Hinkle Fieldhouse, Butler’s home arena and where the climactic scenes in the movie “Hoosiers” were filmed.
There were no bands, mascots or cheerleaders, so the most audible sounds were the squeaks of sneakers on the hardwood.

     Summary: Auburn (27-5) will play Jacksonville State (21-10) Friday at 11:40 am CT on Tru TV in the first round of the 2022 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship.
It’s an early game, but the Tigers are getting big game treatment with the network using its top crew to call the game.
Jacksonville State is seeded 15th and will play Auburn for the first time since the Tigers beat Jacksonville State in 2013 by a 78-54 score.
The Gamecocks didn’t win their conference tournament, won the regular-season championship with a 13-3 record that was slightly better than Liberty at 12-4.
Jacksonville State benefitted from a weird situation and is a double-digit underdog against the Tigers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of China offering Russia financial help is one of several concerns for President Joe Biden.
Biden administration officials say Beijing is spreading false Russian claims that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support.
They say China is effectively providing cover if Russia moves ahead with a biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians.
Russia also supports the Assad government in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decadelong civil war.
Sullivan said China and all countries are on notice that they cannot “basically bail Russia out … give Russia a workaround to the sanctions,” with impunity.

     Summary: During a family gathering to celebrate signing with the Lakers, Magic realizes that money changes everything (especially when your salary is front-page national news).
The only thing more disconcerting than the trite Lansing-set melodrama in Winning Time are the scenes where Magic plays basketball (the only time we see basketball played so far).
Back in California, Buss is having a hell of a time figuring out how he will fulfill his promise to Jerry West.
Buss hands the accounting off to his mother, Jessie Buss (played by Sally Field), who gives this episode (and the series) a much-needed spark.
Auerbach laughs in his face and offers to take Buss’s best players so that the Lakers owner can make some real money.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, in international law, genocide has nothing explicitly to do with the enormity of criminal acts.
By this standard, Putin’s war of obliteration comes readily into focus as genocidal, if not—to date, anyway—as comprehensive genocide.
But Putin had made himself clear: he viewed Ukraine as a corpse, and would have his way with it.
After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia. . . . Now this problem is gone—Ukraine has returned to Russia. . . . Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over.
By his own account, Putin’s fight is, above all, against humiliation, and that is a fight he’s losing badly.
