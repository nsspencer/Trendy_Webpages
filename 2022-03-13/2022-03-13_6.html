     Did Karl Urban Just Confirm The Boys Season 4?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview with Variety at SXSW, Urban dropped the critical detail that his schedule will be jam-packed with super scumbags near the end of 2022, when he is scheduled to get back in action for the Amazon show's fourth season.
Keeping it brief, the actor said, "I'm shooting 'The Boys' through the end of the year," confirming that the wheels are in motion for next season, along with the reveal that Butcher thankfully makes it through the third.
As of right now, Amazon has not announced to the public whether or not "The Boys" has been renewed for Season 4, but it seems all but confirmed right now.
Just what will happen for the show's characters between now and Season 4 is up for debate.
We'll see how they take their first dose when "The Boys" returns to Amazon on June 3, 2022 with Season 3.

     Every Clue and Easter Egg in the Season 3 Trailer for 'The Boys'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new trailer for the third season of Amazon Prime's ultraviolent superhero satire The Boys just dropped, and it is teasing even more bloody, bone-crunching antics as well as the introduction of a handful of new characters.
A video on the Emergency Awesome channel breaks down all of the key details in the trailer—including more than one Marvel Easter egg.
We also see Gunpowder, who is The Boys' answer to The Punisher, and a character named Crimson Countess, a clear parallel to Scarlet Witch.

    </h2>

     Summary: Homelander is by far Vought's most popular supe in The Boys, but who was the company's top hero before him?
The Boys' top supe before Vought introduced Homelander probably isn't who you think.
Homelander clearly isn't a newcomer when The Boys begins either - he's lauded over the pack for a decade or so, if not longer.
Related: The Boys Version Of Wolverine Was Worth The WaitThe Boys now reveals Vought's top supe before Homelander was, in fact, Black Noir.
Perhaps The Boys: Diabolical's Black Noir popularity riffs on the real-world DC rivalry between Superman and Batman.

Credits: Amazon Prime VideoSoldier Boy And PaybackJensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy is the newest addition to the “The Boys” series.
A new soldier boy was brought in by Vought for the present while the public was told that he was one and the same.
As for whether “The Boys” Season 3 will have him from the past or present, it seems that the answer is both.
Overall, “The Boys” Season 3 will bring more action, the politics of superheroes, new supes, and a lot of palpable parody.
