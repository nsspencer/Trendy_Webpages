     ‘Succession’ Won Big at the Critics Choice TV Awards, but So Did These Shows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entertainment critics and journalists are never short on opinions, but at the Critics Choice Awards, they really get to have their say.
Emmy-winner Brett Goldstein also joined the fun this year, winning comedy supporting actor for his portrayal of cantankerous soccer veteran Roy Kent.
This is all important because if the CCA Awards are any indication, “Ted Lasso” currently remains the untouchable comedy frontrunner in the long-term awards conversation.
The ceremony saw “Succession” win three categories, again winning drama series, with Kieran Culkin winning supporting actor and Snook winning supporting actress.
Plus, to be blunt, the most valuable aspect of the CCA Awards being a little unpredictable is the ability to make choices that are less conventional than other awards shows but just as deserving.
