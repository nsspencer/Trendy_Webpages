     N.C.A.A. Men’s Tournament Seedings In as Spectacle Returns to March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I’m really going to appreciate it, especially with what we went through last year with limited fans and being in a bubble,” said Creighton senior guard Alex O’Connell, who played in two tournaments at Duke before transferring and reaching the round of 16 last year with the Bluejays, another Big East program.
His team’s run ended not before a raucous crowd in a cavernous arena, but in front of a restricted number of masked fans far from the court in the quaint Hinkle Fieldhouse, Butler’s home arena and where the climactic scenes in the movie “Hoosiers” were filmed.
There were no bands, mascots or cheerleaders, so the most audible sounds were the squeaks of sneakers on the hardwood.
Creighton lost that afternoon to Gonzaga, which the same as now was the top overall seed in the bracket.
The Zags, who were chasing a perfect season last year, will merely be pursuing their first national championship this season when they open in the West region in Portland, Ore.
