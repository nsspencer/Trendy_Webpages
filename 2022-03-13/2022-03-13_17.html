     Rebel Wilson Roasts the Royal Family in Outlandish Debut as BAFTA Awards Host
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rebel Wilson, one of the BAFTA Awards’ most memorable presenters in past years, did not disappoint as its host.

Elsewhere, Wilson highlighted the continued challenges for women in the industry.
