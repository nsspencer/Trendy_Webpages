     Summary: Newcastle supporters feel like they are the coming force in English football.
At some stage Newcastle supporters may have to address the geopolitical realities that come with being owned by the Saudi Investment Fund.
Chelsea remain in dialogue with the government over the terms of the license under which they operate.
Meanwhile Werner was back in the form that has all too often defined his Chelsea career, heavy touches when through on goal.
