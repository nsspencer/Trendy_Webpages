     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers play the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, and if you’re wondering how you can watch the action live, you’ve come to the right place.
The Lakers are coming off a spirited 122-109 pull-away win on Friday against the Washington Wizards in which LeBron James exploded for 50 points.
L.A. is looking to, at the very least, hold on to the ninth spot in the Western Conference and host their first contest of the play-in tournament next month.
Phoenix is treading water with Chris Paul out for several weeks due to a fractured thumb.
L.A. and Phoenix have played each other twice already this season, with Phoenix winning both contests handily.

     Summary: Devin Booker turns defense into offense for the Suns in the first half against the struggling Lakers.
(0:19)PHOENIX -- — Anthony Davis had a few words to say about the Los Angeles Lakers' playoff loss to the Phoenix Suns last season before the teams played Sunday night.
Devin Booker scored 30 points, Deandre Ayton had 23 points and 16 rebounds in just 27 minutes and the NBA-leading Suns routed the Lakers 140-111.
Davis told reporters before the game that the Lakers would have beaten the Suns last year in their postseason series had he not been sidelined with a groin injury.
Phoenix led 48-22 after the first quarter, the Suns' highest output in a quarter this season and the most the Lakers have given up in a quarter in the shot-clock era.
