     Naomi Osaka Brought to Tears by Heckler at Indian Wells
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Williams sisters’ early years as professionals, there was speculation on tour that their father and co-coach, Richard Williams, was prearranging the results of their matches against each other.
At Indian Wells in 2001, the Russian player Elena Dementieva spoke about her suspicion publicly after losing to Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
Dementieva later insisted her comment had been a joke, and the sisters and Richard Williams denied that any of their match results were prearranged.
But two days later, Serena Williams was booed throughout the tournament final, and Richard Williams, who was watching from the stands with Venus, said he was subjected to racial slurs.
Serena Williams won in three sets but has said that the experience was traumatic and “haunted” her and her family for years.

     Heckler makes tennis star Naomi Osaka cry during Indian Wells Masters

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A heckler shouting at Naomi Osaka during a tournament in California made the tennis star cry on Saturday.
Osaka was playing against Veronika Kudermetova at the Indian Wells Masters in Indian Wells, California, when a woman yelled out, "Naomi, you suck!"
Shortly after the heckler's comment, Osaka asked the umpire if she could use their microphone to address the crowd.
"I just want to say, 'Thank you,'" Osaka said, as her voice quivered and she appeared to wipe her eyes.
Osaka went on to say getting heckled at Indian Wells, where she had watched videos of Venus and Serena Williams being heckled, "went into my head and got replayed a lot."
