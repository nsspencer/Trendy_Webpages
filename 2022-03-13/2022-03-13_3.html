     Brent Renaud, Crusading Filmmaker, Is Killed at 50
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Renaud was the first journalist on assignment from an American news organization to be killed while reporting on the war in Ukraine.
It also appeared likely that he was the first foreign journalist killed during the conflict.
Juan Arredondo, a photographer and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, told The Associated Press that he was traveling with Mr. Renaud and that he was injured in the same attack.
Annalisa Camilli, an Italian journalist, posted a video on Twitter of Mr. Arredondo at a hospital in Kyiv.
Oleksandr Bogai, the deputy chief of police in Irpin, said Mr. Renaud was shot in the head when Russian forces fired at his car, which was being driven by a local civilian across a Ukrainian checkpoint near the northern border of Irpin.
