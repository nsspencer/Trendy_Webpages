     Did Karl Urban Just Confirm The Boys Season 4?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview with Variety at SXSW, Urban dropped the critical detail that his schedule will be jam-packed with super scumbags near the end of 2022, when he is scheduled to get back in action for the Amazon show's fourth season.
Keeping it brief, the actor said, "I'm shooting 'The Boys' through the end of the year," confirming that the wheels are in motion for next season, along with the reveal that Butcher thankfully makes it through the third.
As of right now, Amazon has not announced to the public whether or not "The Boys" has been renewed for Season 4, but it seems all but confirmed right now.
Just what will happen for the show's characters between now and Season 4 is up for debate.
We'll see how they take their first dose when "The Boys" returns to Amazon on June 3, 2022 with Season 3.

     Karl Urban says ‘The Boys’ season 4 shoots before the end of 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first teaser trailer for season 3 may have only dropped yesterday, and the smash hit superhero series doesn’t return to our screens until June, but Karl Urban is already teasing what comes next for The Boys.
Animated anthology Diabolical drew strong reviews from critics, and the finale served as official canon, while the college-set spinoff remains in development despite recently losing both lead stars.
By the time the acclaimed effort returns, 21 months will have passed since the season 2 finale, but Urban has hinted that the cast and crew might not be wasting any time in getting the band back together, after revealing to Variety that he’s “shooting The Boys through the end of the year”.
'The Boys' Season 3 Character Poster Teases Superpowered Billy Butcher 1 of 2Click to skipClick to zoomPrincipal photography on season 3 began in February of last year and continued through to September, so it makes sense that The Boys would be looking to get started on the fourth batch of episodes as quickly as possible, given how the pandemic-induced hiatus massively affected the third.
Based on the footage, The Boys is set to live up to the promises made by the key creatives that it’ll be the wildest season yet, so we’re excited to see how on earth they can keep upping the ante.

     Summary: Butcher And “The Boys”The first and perhaps the best thing that we will be getting in “The Boys” Season 3 is Butcher with superpowers.
Credits: Amazon Prime VideoSoldier Boy And PaybackJensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy is the newest addition to the “The Boys” series.
A new soldier boy was brought in by Vought for the present while the public was told that he was one and the same.
As for whether “The Boys” Season 3 will have him from the past or present, it seems that the answer is both.
Overall, “The Boys” Season 3 will bring more action, the politics of superheroes, new supes, and a lot of palpable parody.
