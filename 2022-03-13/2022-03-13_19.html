     ‘The Power of the Dog’ Wins Best Film at Wide-Open BAFTAs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — “The Power of the Dog,” Jane Campion’s tense Western about two clashing brothers on a Montana ranch, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons, was the big winner at the EE British Academy Film Awards in London on Sunday night.
Campion also won best director — the third woman to take the prize in the award’s history — increasing her momentum ahead of this year’s Academy Awards.
She was not present to pick up her award in London.
On Saturday she had been in Los Angeles at the Directors Guild of America Awards, where she also won the highest prize.
At that award ceremony, Campion garnered attention when asked by Variety about disparaging comments that the actor Sam Elliott made about her movie, including questioning the “allusions to homosexuality” in the film.

     Jane Campion rejects Sam Elliott’s ‘Power of the Dog’ complaints: ‘He’s not a cowboy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Power of the Dog” writer and director Jane Campion has responded to actor Sam Elliott’s derogatory comments about her Oscar-nominated western drama.
In a red-carpet interview with Variety at Saturday’s Directors Guild of America Awards, Campion rejected Elliott’s scathing take on the acclaimed Netflix film.
Then she won the top prize at the Beverly Hills ceremony for her work on “The Power of the Dog.”“I think Sam ... he was being a little bit of a b—,” Campion said.
“I’m sorry to say it, but he’s not a cowboy.
Without naming names, Benedict Cumberbatch — who stars as proud rancher Phil Burbank in “The Power of the Dog” — called Elliott’s stance on the film “very odd” during a BAFTA Film Sessions interview last week.

Despite Elliott’s feelings about the film, “The Power of the Dog” has been having a successful awards season run.
After calling out Elliott on the red carpet, Campion made history at the DGA Awards by winning in the theatrical feature film category for her Netflix movie.
