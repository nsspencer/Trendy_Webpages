     Vikings Make Kirk Cousins Decision: NFL World Reacts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In case you thought Tom Brady would be the only quarterback to make news tonight, Kirk Cousins says not so fast.
The new deal contains two voidable years in order to lower Cousins’ massive cap hit for 2022.
Throughout NFL history, there have been plenty of worse quarterbacks than Kirk Cousins.
On Sunday night, the NFL world once again marveled at Cousins’ ability to pad his bank account.
— Jason_OTC (@Jason_OTC) March 13, 2022Presumably some much-needed salary cap space this season for the Vikes and Kirk has some certainty for his future.

     Vikings sign Kirk Cousins to fully guaranteed $35M extension through 2023 ahead of free agency, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell has said repeatedly he's excited to work with quarterback Kirk Cousins in 2022.
Now, the new front office has ensured he'll get the chance, signing the veteran quarterback on Sunday to a one-year extension, according to NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.
The Vikings were expected to shed salary in order to clear space for free agency, but a Cousins extension was also always a possibility, even though it would commit a new regime to the 33-year-old QB.
Cousins is entering his fifth season with the Vikings, and now his third contract with the team.
He originally signed a fully guaranteed three-year, $84M deal in 2017 free agency, then inked a two-year, $66M extension ahead of the 2020 season.

     Minnesota Vikings QB Kirk Cousins agrees to one-year extension worth $35 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I am thrilled for the opportunity to play for Kevin and could not be more excited about the direction of our team," Cousins said in a statement.
Under the terms of his previous contract, Cousins was due to receive $35 million in cash and count for $45 million against the Vikings' 2022 cap.
They entered the weekend needing to clear $17 million in cap space by Wednesday in order to comply with the NFL's $208.2 million cap for 2022.
Cousins' contract made a release untenable, even if that's what the team's new leadership preferred, and it's unclear if there were any serious trade discussions.
By the end of the 2023 season, he will have earned at least $231.7 million in his career.

     Summary: Cousins gets a raise to $40 million in 2022 with $55 million payable by next March and a no-trade clause, Pelissero added.
The new deal also allows Minnesota to save almost $14 million against the salary cap.
Although the Vikings had received trade interest in Cousins in recent weeks, new head coach Kevin O'Connell had been clear about wanting to work with the veteran passer, saying in mid-February that he anticipated Cousins "being a part of what we do."
A three-time Pro Bowler, with two of those selections earned during his four seasons with the Vikings, Cousins is coming off a season in which he threw for 4,221 yards, 33 touchdowns and just seven interceptions.
However, the Vikings went 8-9 last year and failed to make the postseason for the third time in four seasons with Cousins under center.

     Summary: While the team didn't announce the terms, the contract extension presumably lowers his 2022 cap hit.
He and the previous leadership of the team agreed on two-year extension in March 2020.
Cousins will get a chance to work with Vikings Head Coach Kevin O'Connell, an offensive-minded coach who was hired in February.
The two were together in Washington in 2017, when O'Connell was Washington's quarterbacks coach.
Cousins threw for 4,091 yards with 27 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in his lone season with O'Connell.

     Vikings Extend QB Kirk Cousins Through 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell wanted a chance to build an offense around quarterback Kirk Cousins.
Well, according to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, he will get his chance as the Vikings will sign Cousins to a one-year, $35MM extension that will keep him in Minnesota through the 2023 NFL season.
Cousins’ scheduled cap hit for 2022 was set to be the largest in NFL history at $45MM.
The extension reduces his 2022 cap number to $31.42MM, granting Minnesota a little over $13.5MM in cap space.
In addition, Cousins will see a raise, making $40MM this season and $30MM in 2023.
