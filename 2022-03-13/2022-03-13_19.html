     Did Karl Urban Just Confirm The Boys Season 4?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview with Variety at SXSW, Urban dropped the critical detail that his schedule will be jam-packed with super scumbags near the end of 2022, when he is scheduled to get back in action for the Amazon show's fourth season.
Keeping it brief, the actor said, "I'm shooting 'The Boys' through the end of the year," confirming that the wheels are in motion for next season, along with the reveal that Butcher thankfully makes it through the third.
As of right now, Amazon has not announced to the public whether or not "The Boys" has been renewed for Season 4, but it seems all but confirmed right now.
Just what will happen for the show's characters between now and Season 4 is up for debate.
We'll see how they take their first dose when "The Boys" returns to Amazon on June 3, 2022 with Season 3.

     Summary: Photo: Amazon Prime/YouTubeFinally, the first trailer for the highly anticipated third season of the hit Amazon Prime series, The Boys, is here!
Hughie and StarlightThe relationship Hughie developed with Starlight is complicated and it doesn’t look like it’s going to get any easier in Season 3 of The Boys.
Kimiko, Frenchie, and New Characters In Season 3The trailer shows Kimiko doing what she does best in The Boys, fighting what looks like a hard battle and Frenchie looks scared.
He’s going to add a new kind of ferocity to The Boys, and he looks rather intimidating as well.
This first trailer for Season 3 of The Boys is everything we could have hoped for.

     ‘The Boys’ Season 3: Trailer Breakdown – A Supe Butcher, A Soldier Boy, &amp; A Straight-Away Chaos

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Butcher And “The Boys”The first and perhaps the best thing that we will be getting in “The Boys” Season 3 is Butcher with superpowers.
Credits: Amazon Prime VideoSoldier Boy And PaybackJensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy is the newest addition to the “The Boys” series.
A new soldier boy was brought in by Vought for the present while the public was told that he was one and the same.
As for whether “The Boys” Season 3 will have him from the past or present, it seems that the answer is both.
Overall, “The Boys” Season 3 will bring more action, the politics of superheroes, new supes, and a lot of palpable parody.
