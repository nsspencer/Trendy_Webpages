     Game time set for Auburn’s 1st round NCAA game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Auburn (27-5) will play Jacksonville State (21-10) Friday at 11:40 am CT on Tru TV in the first round of the 2022 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship.
It’s an early game, but the Tigers are getting big game treatment with the network using its top crew to call the game.
Jacksonville State is seeded 15th and will play Auburn for the first time since the Tigers beat Jacksonville State in 2013 by a 78-54 score.
The Gamecocks didn’t win their conference tournament, won the regular-season championship with a 13-3 record that was slightly better than Liberty at 12-4.
Jacksonville State benefitted from a weird situation and is a double-digit underdog against the Tigers.

     Summary: Time: 3:00p PTTV: CBSThe Pac-12 will almost certainly have exactly 3 teams in the tournament this year: Arizona, UCLA, and USC.
However, as of this morning it appears that all 4 #1 seeds will come from teams west of the Mississippi (Gonzaga, Arizona, Kansas, and Baylor) which would be the first time that has ever happened.
This comes on the heels of the first Final 4 to feature all teams west of the Mississippi last year (Gonzaga, UCLA, Baylor, Houston).
This year the women’s tournament finally has gotten the rights to be advertised as part of “March Madness”.
The Degree Bracket Gap Challenge is trying to help increase gender equity across college basketball and is encouraging folks to fill out a bracket for the women’s tournament as well.

     New bill could have California voters weigh in on daylight saving time — again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Proposition 7, approved by 59% of voters, gave state lawmakers the authority to move the state to year-round daylight saving time, but only after approval from Congress.
But in the years since, state lawmakers haven’t passed legislation to join the list of states officially waiting for Congress to legalize year-round daylight saving time.
The federal government does not currently permit states to be on year-round daylight saving time.
Assembly member Steven Choi (R-Irvine) wants California to join Arizona and Hawaii in year-round standard time, but he wants voters to weigh in, too.
His new bill, AB2868, in its current form would switch to permanent daylight saving time upon federal approval.

Dr. Koshla adds that heart attacks and strokes are more common on the Monday after daylight saving time begins as well.
Not a fan of daylight saving time?
Since 2015, at least 350 bills and resolutions regarding daylight saving have been introduced in nearly all states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

     Is It Time to Call Putin’s War in Ukraine Genocide?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, in international law, genocide has nothing explicitly to do with the enormity of criminal acts.
By this standard, Putin’s war of obliteration comes readily into focus as genocidal, if not—to date, anyway—as comprehensive genocide.
But Putin had made himself clear: he viewed Ukraine as a corpse, and would have his way with it.
After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia. . . . Now this problem is gone—Ukraine has returned to Russia. . . . Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over.
By his own account, Putin’s fight is, above all, against humiliation, and that is a fight he’s losing badly.

     Growing movement to make daylight saving time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, time in most of the U.S. advanced by one hour to begin daylight saving time, a tradition regulated by the Uniform Time Act of 1966.
Under federal law, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
"There are bills in both houses of Congress that would make daylight saving time permanent year-round," Jim Reed, NCSL’s director of the Environment, Energy &amp; and Transportation program, said.
Before 1966, there were few standards for DST, and states were on their own for its implementation.
RELATED: Tips for checking smoke alarms during daylight saving timeExperts say without substantial movement in congress on the bills, the current method of switching from standard time to DST, and vice versa, will be sticking around for a while.

Is he truly Magic Johnson, the smiling people pleaser who seems comfortable in every room?
Happiness lies ahead for the Lakers, but how deeply will either Magic or Jerry West be able to feel it?

     Summary: During a family gathering to celebrate signing with the Lakers, Magic realizes that money changes everything (especially when your salary is front-page national news).
The only thing more disconcerting than the trite Lansing-set melodrama in Winning Time are the scenes where Magic plays basketball (the only time we see basketball played so far).
Back in California, Buss is having a hell of a time figuring out how he will fulfill his promise to Jerry West.
Buss hands the accounting off to his mother, Jessie Buss (played by Sally Field), who gives this episode (and the series) a much-needed spark.
Auerbach laughs in his face and offers to take Buss’s best players so that the Lakers owner can make some real money.

Finally, Russia’s war in Ukraine has also shifted geopolitics to China’s disadvantage.
In all these ways, a quick end to Russia’s war would be very good for China.
