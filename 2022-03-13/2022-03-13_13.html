     Richmond wins A-10 title, steals NCAA tournament bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jacob Gilyard scored a game-high 26 points and Tyler Burton added 16 of his own as Richmond defeated Davidson 64–62 in Sunday’s Atlantic-10 title game to steal a bid to the NCAA tournament.
Despite the loss, Davidson remains safely in the NCAA tournament, according to Sports Illustrated’s Kevin Sweeney.
After a strong week at the SEC tournament that included victories over Florida, top-seeded Auburn and Arkansas, Texas A&amp;M appeared to be right on the cusp of a tournament berth.
Will the Quadrant I victory over a soon-to-be 1-seed in the NCAA tournament be enough to get the Sooners in the field?
There are questions abound heading into Sunday evening’s selections, but one thing’s for certain, Richmond just made things a lot more uncomfortable for teams sitting on the bubble.

     Summary: 6 seed Richmond beat top-seeded Davidson 64-62 on Sunday to clinch the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament and an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time in 11 years.
Richmond (23-12) was playing in the A-10 championship game - needing two 15-point comebacks in the early rounds - for the first time since winning in 2011.
The Spiders are making their 10th trip to the NCAAs, the first since making the Sweet 16 in that 2011 season.
The Spiders lost a home game to Davidson 87-84 on Jan. 14 when Michael Jones hit a game-winning 3-pointer with three seconds remaining.
Davidson called a timeout at 2.5 and Richmond called another after seeing how the Wildcats set up.
