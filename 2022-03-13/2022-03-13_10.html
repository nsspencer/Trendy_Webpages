     Summary: BOSTON -- Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen have appeared to bury the hatchet after years of turmoil following Allen’s departure to the Miami Heat in the summer of 2012.
Allen was in attendance for Garnett’s jersey retirement ceremony at TD Garden on Sunday, surrounded by the majority of Garnett’s 2008 championship teammates including Paul Pierce, Brian Scalabrine, James Posey, Eddie House, Kendrick Perkins and Glen Davis.
Pierce said some words about his close friend and former teammate at the beginning of the ceremony before an entertaining Q-and-A session between Garnett and Scalabrine midway through the ceremony.
“It’s good to say Ray Allen here, man,” Garnett said during the question-and-answer session of his ceremony.
Pierce, Garnett and Allen also posed for pictures after the ceremony concluded, much to the delight of the Garden crowd.

     No. 5 to the rafters: Kevin Garnett soaks in jersey retirement ceremony with the Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – Following his introductory press conference with the Boston Celtics in 2007, Kevin Garnett took in the renowned history of the organization that resides in the TD Garden rafters.
On Sunday, the Celtics honored Garnett by forever retiring his jersey number as he became the 24th member of the organization to have the honor bestowed upon him.
Garnett made an immediate impact in Boston when the Celtics traded five players and two first-round picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the 6-foot-11 power forward.
Garnett also took time to shout out Allen as it has been rumored for years that there has been animosity between Allen and the rest of his former Celtics teammates, including Garnett.
But Garnett’s big day seemed to heal some of the wounds and Garnett insinuated that the Celtics should retire Allen’s No.
