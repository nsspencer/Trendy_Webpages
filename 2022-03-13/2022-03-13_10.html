    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Isiah Thomas has been a mentor to Kevin Garnett since the start of his NBA career and was a presenter for the Celtics legend as he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.
That made Thomas a logical fit to be in attendance at the TD Garden on Sunday as the Celtics retired Garnett’s No.
He surprised Garnett midway through the Celtics-Mavericks game by appearing behind him in the Garden crowd, much to his delight of Garnett.
During Garnett’s retirement ceremony after the game, Thomas appeared on a lengthy congratulations video with dozens of other Celtics fans, players and coaches.
Celtics play-by-play man and emcee of the ceremony Mike Gorman poked fun at the reaction after the video.
