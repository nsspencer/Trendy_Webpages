     Summary: ROCKFORD, Ill. (WTVO) — Hundreds of lives are saved every year with smoke alarms, and now is the time for residents to check and make sure that theirs are working.
As the country springs forward for daylight saving time, people are also reminded to check both their smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms.
Fire fighters said that the batteries should be changed twice a year.
Smoke alarms older than 10-years-old should be replaced.

     How Daylight Saving Time affects your health
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CARLSBAD, Calif. – Sleep scientists are once again warning of health repercussions as Daylight Saving Time is in full effect.
Colin Lawlor, CEO of SleepScore Labs headquartered in Carlsbad, says there is a 24% increase in heart attacks on Monday, immediately after Daylight Saving Time.
He said the research is clear: springing the clock ahead an hour increases the risk of stroke and car crashes the first week of the time change.
“One of the key things we have is this constant clock, which is going inside our bodies, it’s our circadian rhythm,” he said.
Lawlor said it doesn’t matter which clock lawmakers choose because it’s all about consistency.

     Growing movement to make daylight saving time permanent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, time in most of the U.S. advanced by one hour to begin daylight saving time, a tradition regulated by the Uniform Time Act of 1966.
Under federal law, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
"There are bills in both houses of Congress that would make daylight saving time permanent year-round," Jim Reed, NCSL’s director of the Environment, Energy &amp; and Transportation program, said.
Before 1966, there were few standards for DST, and states were on their own for its implementation.
RELATED: Tips for checking smoke alarms during daylight saving timeExperts say without substantial movement in congress on the bills, the current method of switching from standard time to DST, and vice versa, will be sticking around for a while.

     New bill could have California voters weigh in on daylight saving time — again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Proposition 7, approved by 59% of voters, gave state lawmakers the authority to move the state to year-round daylight saving time, but only after approval from Congress.
But in the years since, state lawmakers haven’t passed legislation to join the list of states officially waiting for Congress to legalize year-round daylight saving time.
The federal government does not currently permit states to be on year-round daylight saving time.
Assembly member Steven Choi (R-Irvine) wants California to join Arizona and Hawaii in year-round standard time, but he wants voters to weigh in, too.
His new bill, AB2868, in its current form would switch to permanent daylight saving time upon federal approval.

Dr. Koshla adds that heart attacks and strokes are more common on the Monday after daylight saving time begins as well.
