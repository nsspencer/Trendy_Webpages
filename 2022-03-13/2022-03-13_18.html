    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This review contains spoilers for Winning Time, for last week’s review click here.
The latest episode of HBO’s new primetime show Winning Time shows us the background of two characters – Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) and Jerry West (Jason Clarke).
This isn’t where the episode starts though, the episode starts with Jerry West dreaming about his past.
As he delivers a fiery speech, Jerry West hands in his resignation as the head coach of the Lakers.
Overall, this is what Winning Time needed, an episode to attract its audience and keep them interested.

     ‘Winning Time’ Fact Check: Was Jerry West Against Drafting Magic Johnson?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the main sources of conflict in the first two episodes is the Lakers’ drafting of Earvin “Magic” Johnson.
That doesn’t sit well with head coach and former Lakers player Jerry West (Jason Clarke).
So, was Jerry West really against Magic Johnson joining the Lakers?
According to “Showtime,” West just “wasn’t fully convinced” that a 6-foot-9 player could thrive as a point guard.
West went as far as try convincing Jack Kent Cooke, the outgoing owner of the Lakers, not to draft Johnson.

     Winning Time Episode 2 True Story Explained: What It Gets Right &amp; Wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO's Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty episode 2 dives deeper into the true story as the Los Angeles Lakers 1979 season nears, and here's what the show gets right and wrong about what happened in real life.
Several major events that take the Los Angeles Lakers back to glory happen during Winning Time episode 2, which is ultimately a faithful recreation of how the true story really unfolded.
The Los Angeles Lakers did not seriously consider trading Kareem Abdul-Jabbar prior to the 1979-1980 season.
The origin of the Los Angeles Lakers' name goes back to the foundation of the franchise.
Winning Time episode 2 shows this surprising change of heart of Jerry West at the end of the episode, which is not well-received by Jerry Buss.

     Summary: Would a slightly more restrained take on Jerry West, for instance, have struck a better balance between absurdity and pathos?
Having now secured the team, Jerry Buss gets to enjoy attending the NBA’s annual owners meetings on his home turf in Beverly Hills.
Jerry Buss proclaims himself to be the future of basketball, and he’s right.
Is he truly Magic Johnson, the smiling people pleaser who seems comfortable in every room?
Happiness lies ahead for the Lakers, but how deeply will either Magic or Jerry West be able to feel it?

     Winning Time Recap: We Are Building Shangri-La
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During a family gathering to celebrate signing with the Lakers, Magic realizes that money changes everything (especially when your salary is front-page national news).
The only thing more disconcerting than the trite Lansing-set melodrama in Winning Time are the scenes where Magic plays basketball (the only time we see basketball played so far).
Back in California, Buss is having a hell of a time figuring out how he will fulfill his promise to Jerry West.
Buss hands the accounting off to his mother, Jessie Buss (played by Sally Field), who gives this episode (and the series) a much-needed spark.
Auerbach laughs in his face and offers to take Buss’s best players so that the Lakers owner can make some real money.
