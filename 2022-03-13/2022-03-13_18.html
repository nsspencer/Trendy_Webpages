     Critics Choice Awards 2022: Fashion—Live From the Red Carpet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight, some of Hollywood’s biggest A-listers will gather at the 27th annual Critics Choice Awards, which will be held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles (parts of the ceremony will also be broadcast from London).
The glitzy, star-studded ceremony—which honors the year’s best film and television performances—will be hosted by Taye Diggs and Nicole Byer.
Before the televised event kicks off, however, leading actors will hit the red carpet in their finest evening wear—an event in itself.
Nominated stars this evening in the best actress category include megawatt talents like Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain, Nicole Kidman, and Kristen Stewart.
The Critics Choice Awards also have a reputation to uphold.

     How to Watch the Critics Choice Awards 2022: Date, Time and Streaming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Oscars just around the corner, on March 27, films will be looking to bolster their cases for best picture — or make them.
“Belfast,” whose cast hasn’t taken home many prizes during awards season so far, could mount a best picture comeback if it wins big at the Critics Choice Awards.
Ariana DeBose, who played Anita in the Steven Spielberg remake of “West Side Story,” is essentially a sure thing for best supporting actress.
In the supporting actor category, it’s a two-man race between Kotsur and Kodi Smit-McPhee of “The Power of the Dog.” And best picture?
It’s probably between “Belfast” and “The Power of the Dog.”Why are the Critics Choice Awards happening the same night as the BAFTAs?
