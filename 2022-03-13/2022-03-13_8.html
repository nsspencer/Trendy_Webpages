     Yankees acquire Josh Donaldson, trade Gary Sanchez in five-player deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donaldson, 36, provides the Yankees with a veteran slugger who has spent his last two seasons with the Twins.
The Gold Glove-winning shortstop could start at shortstop for the Yankees in 2022, though his below-average bat could keep him in more of a utility role.
Headed back to Minnesota in the deal are a pair of players who have spent the majority of their careers in New York.
Although much improved from a dreadful 2020 campaign, the veteran catcher posted just a .204 batting average with 23 home runs and 54 RBI in 2021.
The glove-first Urshela also saw his numbers take a dip last season, hitting .267 with 14 home runs and 49 RBI.

     Twins, Yankees complete trade to send Gary Sánchez to Minnesota and Josh Donaldson to New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees have agreed to a significant multi-player trade that involves two All-Stars.
Urshela has been the Yankees' starting third baseman for most of the last three seasons when healthy.
With the trade of Sánchez, Kyle Higashioka moves into the starting catcher role in the Bronx.
Sánchez, 29, hit .204/.307/.423 with 23 homers and 54 RBI in 440 plate appearances last season.
In 2019-20 with the Yankees, Urshela slashed a combined .310/.359/.523 (134 OPS+), so the Twins will be hoping they get that version.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees and Twins make a deal.
Going to the Yankees: Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt.
Donaldson is owed $21.75 million for the next two seasons, with an option for 2024 at $16 million and an $8 million buyout.
Urshela had a rough time with the Blue Jays but had two excellent seasons with the Yankees and then didn’t do well last year, hitting .267/.301/.419.
I don’t see the trade helping either team, but I’ll hate seeing Donaldson in the Yankees jersey.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Catcher Gary Sánchez and Gio Urshela will head to Minneapolis, as the Twins sent back former MVP Josh Donaldson, presumptive new shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and 24-year old catching prospect Ben Rortvedt.
Maybe some offensive tweaks have been made in the offseason, maybe not, but I can’t see him catching 130 games.
I can’t really see Ben Rortvedt catching half the games this season either, unless, again, the Yankees think they’ve unlocked something in his game.
For what it’s worth, catching coach Tanner Swanson had a strong connection with him when they worked together in Minnesota, so maybe there’s something there.
Now’s the time to make one more move, maybe trade for Matt Olson with a fully stocked farm or really pursue Freddie Freeman.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York jettisoned Sanchez, a two-time All-Star who's been a defensive liability and slumped at the plate in four straight seasons.
Kiner-Falefa was acquired by the Twins just on Saturday from Texas in a deal for catcher Mitch Garver.
He agreed to a $92 million, four-year contract with the Twins, the richest free-agent deal in franchise history.
Now 36, he hit .247 with 26 homers and 72 RBIs last year in his second season with the Twins.
Urshela, 30, is a smooth fielder who hit 267 with 18 doubles, 14 homers and 49 RBIs last season.

New York’s infield now projects to feature DJ LeMahieu or Luke Voit at first base, Torres at second base, Kiner-Falefa at shortstop and Donaldson at third base.
Donaldson, 36, is a three-time All-Star (2014-16) and two-time Silver Slugger (2015-16) who won the 2015 American League MVP Award while playing for the Blue Jays.
He batted .247/.352/.475 (127 OPS+) in 135 games for the Twins last season, tallying 26 doubles, 26 homers and 72 RBIs.
The 29-year-old Sánchez had been one of the longest-tenured players in the Yankees' organization, having been signed as an international free agent in July 2009.

A change of scenery could help, but it feels like something of a long shot.
Kiner-Falefa's lack of pop keeps him from being a prized commodity in Fantasy, but he's enough of a base-stealer to factor in deeper Rotisserie leagues.

     Yankees Acquire Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Ben Rortvedt From Twins For Gary Sanchez, Gio Urshela
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bronx Bombers’ quiet offseason has come to an abrupt end, as the Yankees and Twins have combined on a blockbuster of a five-player deal.
Third baseman Josh Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and catcher Ben Rortvedt are all heading to the Yankees, while the Twins will pick up catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
The $50MM still owed on Donaldson’s contract is being entirely absorbed by the Yankees, as per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
Another flip doesn’t appear to be forthcoming, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal says the Twins plan to use Sanchez behind the plate.
Should Sanchez and Urshela return to their 2019 form, that will be more than make up for the loss of Donaldson’s bat.
