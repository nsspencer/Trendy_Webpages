     Yankees acquire Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa in trade that includes Gary Sanchez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NorthJersey.com Digital DeskThe New York Yankees and Minnesota Twins struck a deal late Sunday night, swapping catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela for third baseman Josh Donaldson, shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and catcher Ben Rortvedt.
Urshela, who mostly played third base during his three years with the Yankees, was looked at as the team's starting shortstop prior to the move.
Donaldson will likely be the Yankees' starting third baseman, and could also DH sometimes.
This allows the Yankees to use DJ LeMahieu at first base, second base or third base, depending on the day.
Gleyber Torres is the team's incumbent starting second baseman and Luke Voit is the top first baseman on the current depth chart.

     Yankees acquire Josh Donaldson from Twins, send Gary Sanchez to Minnesota
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The blockbuster deal, which was finalized on Sunday night, will include the Bronx Bombers paying the remainder of Josh Donaldson’s contract.
The 3-for-2 deal gives the Yankees an upgrade at infield with Donaldson, who boasts a career .269 batting average, along with a solid .367 on base percentage.
The catcher played just 39 games in his MLB rookie season, and secured a .169 batting average, while getting on base .229% of the time in 98 plate appearances.
The shortstop has played 4 seasons in the major leagues, with a career .265 batting average, a .316 on base percentage, and a .354 slugging percentage.
The Yankees lose Sanchez, their veteran catcher — but the team clearly believes the upgrade to Rortvedt, along with the added presence of Donaldson and Kiner-Falefa is worth dealing Sanchez.

     Twins, Yankees complete trade to send Gary Sánchez to Minnesota and Josh Donaldson to New York
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees have agreed to a significant multi-player trade that involves two All-Stars.
Urshela has been the Yankees' starting third baseman for most of the last three seasons when healthy.
With the trade of Sánchez, Kyle Higashioka moves into the starting catcher role in the Bronx.
Sánchez, 29, hit .204/.307/.423 with 23 homers and 54 RBI in 440 plate appearances last season.
In 2019-20 with the Yankees, Urshela slashed a combined .310/.359/.523 (134 OPS+), so the Twins will be hoping they get that version.

     Summary: Catcher Gary Sánchez and Gio Urshela will head to Minneapolis, as the Twins sent back former MVP Josh Donaldson, presumptive new shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and 24-year old catching prospect Ben Rortvedt.
Maybe some offensive tweaks have been made in the offseason, maybe not, but I can’t see him catching 130 games.
I can’t really see Ben Rortvedt catching half the games this season either, unless, again, the Yankees think they’ve unlocked something in his game.
For what it’s worth, catching coach Tanner Swanson had a strong connection with him when they worked together in Minnesota, so maybe there’s something there.
Now’s the time to make one more move, maybe trade for Matt Olson with a fully stocked farm or really pursue Freddie Freeman.

     Summary: New York jettisoned Sanchez, a two-time All-Star who's been a defensive liability and slumped at the plate in four straight seasons.
Kiner-Falefa was acquired by the Twins just on Saturday from Texas in a deal for catcher Mitch Garver.
He agreed to a $92 million, four-year contract with the Twins, the richest free-agent deal in franchise history.
Now 36, he hit .247 with 26 homers and 72 RBIs last year in his second season with the Twins.
Urshela, 30, is a smooth fielder who hit 267 with 18 doubles, 14 homers and 49 RBIs last season.

     Summary: Check out some of the best highlights that Yankees fans can come to expect from new third baseman Josh Donaldson.
Less than 24 hours later, he was traded to the New York Yankees alongside former American League MVP Josh Donaldson and catcher Ben Rortvedt in exchange for catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
Earlier in the day, Yankees manager Aaron Boone had announced Urshela as the Yankees' starting shortstop.
On a conference call with Minnesota reporters after the trade, Kiner-Falefa addressed his disappointment in getting dealt, saying that Seager's acquisition "definitely hurt."
After the trade to New York was announced, Kiner-Falefa took to Twitter to express his enthusiasm in donning the pinstripes.

     Summary: The New York Yankees acquired Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for catcher Gary Sanchez and third baseman Gio Urshela.

The bottom fell out on the 2019 and 2020 AL Central champions, though, as the team finished last at 73-89 in 2021.
Urshela hit 21 home runs in 2019 and just slashed .267/.301/.419 with 14 long balls and 49 RBI last year.

Where I’m confused is Josh Donaldson.
The Yankees have not spent a lot of money on position players as of late, yet they are taking on the full $50 million over two years to acquire an aging Josh Donaldson.

Donaldson, 36, is a three-time All-Star (2014-16) and two-time Silver Slugger (2015-16) who won the 2015 American League MVP Award while playing for the Blue Jays.

     Yankees Acquire Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Ben Rortvedt From Twins For Gary Sanchez, Gio Urshela
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bronx Bombers’ quiet offseason has come to an abrupt end, as the Yankees and Twins have combined on a blockbuster of a five-player deal.
Third baseman Josh Donaldson, infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and catcher Ben Rortvedt are all heading to the Yankees, while the Twins will pick up catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.
The $50MM still owed on Donaldson’s contract is being entirely absorbed by the Yankees, as per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
Another flip doesn’t appear to be forthcoming, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal says the Twins plan to use Sanchez behind the plate.
Should Sanchez and Urshela return to their 2019 form, that will be more than make up for the loss of Donaldson’s bat.
