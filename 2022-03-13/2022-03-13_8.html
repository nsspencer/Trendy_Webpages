     Jason Sudeikis on making "Ted Lasso" and the show's future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Sudeikis on how many seasons "Ted Lasso" might runWhen actor Jason Sudeikis introduced coach Ted Lasso to the world nearly ten years ago, no one could have predicted the character's trajectory.
He began as a silly ad-campaign for NBC Sports to promote soccer's English Premier League in the United States but the Apple TV+ show that bears his name has become a phenomenon.
Sunday on 60 Minutes, correspondent Norah O'Donnell reported from England where she met the show's stars and went for a walk around Richmond.
In newly released videos, O'Donnell asks Sudeikis if Ted Lasso will fall in love and how many seasons he thinks the show will last.
The Emmy Award winning actor and Saturday Night Live alum also showed O'Donnell around the AFC Richmond locker room, explaining the secret history of the club and who some of the Richmond Greyhounds are named for.

     ‘Succession’ Won Big at the Critics Choice TV Awards, but So Did These Shows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entertainment critics and journalists are never short on opinions, but at the Critics Choice Awards, they really get to have their say.
Emmy-winner Brett Goldstein also joined the fun this year, winning comedy supporting actor for his portrayal of cantankerous soccer veteran Roy Kent.
This is all important because if the CCA Awards are any indication, “Ted Lasso” currently remains the untouchable comedy frontrunner in the long-term awards conversation.
The ceremony saw “Succession” win three categories, again winning drama series, with Kieran Culkin winning supporting actor and Snook winning supporting actress.
Plus, to be blunt, the most valuable aspect of the CCA Awards being a little unpredictable is the ability to make choices that are less conventional than other awards shows but just as deserving.
