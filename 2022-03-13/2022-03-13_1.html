     Retired QB Tom Brady's final touchdown ball goes for $518K at auction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Clark doesn't believe that Tom Brady is fully committed to retiring after his initial announcement.
(1:28)TAMPA, Fla. -- The ball from the last career touchdown pass quarterback Tom Brady threw as a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers has sold for $518,000, according to the auction site Lelands.
With 3:20 to go in the fourth quarter of the NFC divisional playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams, Brady heaved a 55-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Evans, cutting the Rams' lead to 27-20.
Brady's first career touchdown pass (to Terry Glenn) as a member of the New England Patriots was previously auctioned off on the site last year for $428,841.
A total of 23 people placed bids on Brady's last touchdown ball, with the starting bid at $100,000.

     Tom Brady Says He Will Return to the N.F.L. and the Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brady’s quick reversal puts the Buccaneers in a much better position on Monday, when teams can begin talking to and signing free agents.
Even with Brady’s return, the team has holes to fill in free agency and the draft.
Any team with Brady will be competitive, but Licht will have to be creative in constructing a roster capable of another Super Bowl appearance.
The team is $3 million over the salary cap, according to the salary website Spotrac.
Brady is set to earn $25 million next season, though only about $20 million of that will count against the team’s salary cap.

     Tom Brady changes mind on retirement, will return to Buccaneers to play 23rd NFL season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just more than a month after he announced plans to retire, the seven-time Super Bowl-champion quarterback announced on Sunday that he actually will return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2022 season, his 23rd in the NFL.
I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa.
He finished second to the Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers in the voting for the Associated Press' NFL Most Valuable Player award.
After Brady announced his decision on Feb. 1 to step away from the NFL, Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said the organization wasn't ruling out the possibility of a return.
Tampa Bay, however, could be poised to lose several starters in free agency, which officially begins Wednesday.

     How Tom Brady news impacts key Buccaneers players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the emergence of the news that Tom Brady is returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season, the entire plan for the Bucs offseason has to be rewritten from what the front office was thinking.
For one, star tight-end Rob Gronkowski will almost certainly be returning to finish his career with good friend Brady.
Second, the Bucs will need to secure vital players like wide receiver Chris Godwin on a long-term deal and center Ryan Jensen.
Both should be a bit more willing to take a little less money with the Brady news, which would benefit the Buccaneers tremendously.
With Brady back, it’s on the front office to find a way to put together a team that can win it all this coming season.
