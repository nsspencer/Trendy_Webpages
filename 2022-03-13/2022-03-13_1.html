     Brent Renaud, Crusading Filmmaker, Is Killed at 50

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brent Renaud, who with his brother Craig formed a Peabody Award-winning documentary film team that drew attention to human suffering, often working with major news organizations like The New York Times, was fatally shot in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, on Sunday.
A Ukrainian news agency said Mr. Renaud had been shot by Russian troops.
His death was confirmed by Craig Renaud, who was not with him in Ukraine at the time.
He said Brent was working for MSNBC and the television and film division of Time magazine on one segment of a multipart series about refugees around the world called “Tipping Point.”Migration under desperate circumstances was a recurring subject for Brent, who with Craig also made documentaries about Haitians deported from the United States and children fleeing poverty and danger in Central America.
