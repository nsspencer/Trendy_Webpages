     MoMA Patron, Denied Entry, Stabs Two Employees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the suspect was denied entry, he became “upset,” and then “proceeded to attack and stab two employees of the museum multiple times,” Mr. Miller said.
Mr. Miller said that the suspect was “known to the department” because of two earlier incidents in the same area, and had been a regular at MoMA.
But he did not have “an extensive record or any arrest records that we are aware of,” Mr. Miller said.
After turning around, he said he witnessed the attacker stab one person in the back and another in the neck.
The security guard near the entrance proceeded to pick up what appeared to be a large binder and throw it at the attacker to distract him.
