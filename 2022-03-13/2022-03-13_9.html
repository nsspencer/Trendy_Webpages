     CD sales just rose for the first time in almost two decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CD sales in the US for 2021 increased for the first time in almost two decades, according to data published by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
Shipments rose from 31.6 million in 2020 to 46.6 million in 2021, and revenue from the format rose from $483.2 million to $584.2 million.
Although CD sales are still far from their 2000 peak — when almost a billion CD albums were shipped in the US — Axios notes that the increase is another key element of the resurgence in physical music.
Meanwhile, CD and vinyl album sales combined made up less than 11 percent of revenue.
And whereas vinyl offers a distinct sound compared to digital music, CDs contain digital music that’s essentially identical to what’s offered by lossless music services from Apple and Amazon (though, crucially, not Spotify).

She says the change in light can disrupt your circadian rhythm, your body’s internal clock.
“For those dealing with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and more, Glick says the best thing to do as your body adjust is to sleep.
“That sleep loss just results in more feelings of depression and really you know those mood disturbances as well,” she said.
It takes about 5-7 days for your circadian rhythm to adjust, so make sure you go to bed at a decent time, eat healthily, and unwind.

     How Daylight Saving Time affects your health
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CARLSBAD, Calif. – Sleep scientists are once again warning of health repercussions as Daylight Saving Time is in full effect.
Colin Lawlor, CEO of SleepScore Labs headquartered in Carlsbad, says there is a 24% increase in heart attacks on Monday, immediately after Daylight Saving Time.
He said the research is clear: springing the clock ahead an hour increases the risk of stroke and car crashes the first week of the time change.
“One of the key things we have is this constant clock, which is going inside our bodies, it’s our circadian rhythm,” he said.
Lawlor said it doesn’t matter which clock lawmakers choose because it’s all about consistency.

     New bill could have California voters weigh in on daylight saving time — again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Proposition 7, approved by 59% of voters, gave state lawmakers the authority to move the state to year-round daylight saving time, but only after approval from Congress.
But in the years since, state lawmakers haven’t passed legislation to join the list of states officially waiting for Congress to legalize year-round daylight saving time.
The federal government does not currently permit states to be on year-round daylight saving time.
Assembly member Steven Choi (R-Irvine) wants California to join Arizona and Hawaii in year-round standard time, but he wants voters to weigh in, too.
His new bill, AB2868, in its current form would switch to permanent daylight saving time upon federal approval.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, time in most of the U.S. advanced by one hour to begin daylight saving time, a tradition regulated by the Uniform Time Act of 1966.
Under federal law, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
"There are bills in both houses of Congress that would make daylight saving time permanent year-round," Jim Reed, NCSL’s director of the Environment, Energy &amp; and Transportation program, said.
Before 1966, there were few standards for DST, and states were on their own for its implementation.
RELATED: Tips for checking smoke alarms during daylight saving timeExperts say without substantial movement in congress on the bills, the current method of switching from standard time to DST, and vice versa, will be sticking around for a while.

Dr. Koshla adds that heart attacks and strokes are more common on the Monday after daylight saving time begins as well.

Ron Meadows, Sporting Director, Mercedes AMG, Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director, Mercedes AMG Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport ImagesBut it's not just the porpoising that is the problem.
Car weight has become a big issue for teams this year, with few teams getting anywhere near the minimum weight limit.
Mercedes knows the W13 has promise, and the downforce needed to take on the very best at the front.
As Hamilton was quite clear about at the end of the test: "There is a potential within our car to get us there.
