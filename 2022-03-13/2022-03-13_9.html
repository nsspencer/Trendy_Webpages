     Summary: Chelsea edged Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday amid the ongoing uncertainty over the club's ownership.
Havertz told Sky Sports: "It's tough, we players are privileged to train and continue to do what we love.
The Premier League disqualified owner Roman Abramovich on Saturday after the United Kingdom government sanctioned him in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Chelsea beat Newcastle as questions continued over the club's direction.
The deal was met by strong public opposition in many quarters, given Saudi Arabia's human rights record and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.

     Chelsea vs Newcastle: Player ratings, analysis and VAR appeals as Kai Havertz strikes late
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The anti-climax rather summed up Chelsea’s day – until Havertz brought down Jorginho’s perfectly measured pass and triggered pandemonium.
Havertz had jumped to challenge the 6ft 6in defender but his left elbow had collided with Burn’s face.
The referee immediately issued a yellow card, but the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took a minute to investigate the incident while Burn was down.
The incident was referred to VAR as a possible penalty incident, but Werner was ruled offside which rendered the foul null and void.
Kai Havertz – 7Was a little lucky not to face more punishment than a yellow card for the connection his elbow made with Dan Burn’s face.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newcastle supporters feel like they are the coming force in English football.
At some stage Newcastle supporters may have to address the geopolitical realities that come with being owned by the Saudi Investment Fund.
Chelsea remain in dialogue with the government over the terms of the license under which they operate.
Meanwhile Werner was back in the form that has all too often defined his Chelsea career, heavy touches when through on goal.
With inches of space in which to operate, a shrug of the outside of his boot took the ball beyond Dubravka.
