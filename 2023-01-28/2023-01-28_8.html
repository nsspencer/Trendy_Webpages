     Triple H Comments After Joel Embiid’s Fine for DX Chop Celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, Sixers center Joel Embiid brought out the DX crotch chop celebration in a win over the Nets, which led to a fine from the NBA for $25,000.
“Curious, Joel Embiid If you wrote a bigger check now, could you get a volume discount to cover the rest of the season?
Triple H was a member of DeGeneration X, the wrestling group that created the crotch chop and popularized it in the mainstream as its signature taunt.
Embiid has used the crotch chop before for in-game celebrations, and this is just the latest instance.
So, even if the NBA didn’t necessarily approve of Embiid’s celebration, getting Triple H’s approval is probably worth the $25,000 fine.

     Joel Embiid drops 47 points as Nikola Jokic, Nuggets fall at Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA – When Nikola Jokic called Joel Embiid “probably” the most dominant player in the NBA ahead of Saturday’s showcase, he knew the storm that awaited him.
Embiid showed off a level few players in the league ever reach, bludgeoning the Nuggets for 47 points and 18 rebounds en route to Philadelphia’s 126-119 win.
“I’m not worried about Joel Embiid,” Malone said afterward.
Tucker on Jokic instead of Embiid, it led to angst — and a handful of technical fouls on both sides.
Prior to the game, Malone wasn’t interested in juicing Saturday’s matchup between Jokic and Embiid, who’ve finished 1-2 in MVP voting each of the last two years.

     Summary: Embiid is widely considered as the biggest starter snub.
"Having been a starter the last five years, it is kind of disrespectful.
I don't think anybody has had a better year than me," Embiid said to media members.
As long as the team can stay healthy down the stretch, they'll have a chance to make a real run.
"Let's keep offending Joel by fining him and not putting him on the All-Star starters," Rivers said.

JAMES HARDEN recorded 17 points and 13 assists, marking his 19th game this season with at least 15 points and 10 assists.

     Summary: Unsurprisingly, the Jokic-led Nuggets outscored the Sixers by five points during Montrezl Harrell’s initial stint of approximately two and a half minutes.
Upon returning, Embiid hit two top-of-the-key threes and at least kept the Nuggets from seizing complete control of the game.
Before all of that, the Sixers began the second half well on both ends.
And Tucker picked the perfect time for his only points, tipping in a Harden miss after the Nuggets had cut the Sixers' lead to 120-117.
His fourth three of the afternoon put the Sixers up eight points and was a fitting punctuation to an MVP-caliber day.

As Embiid stepped to the free-throw line after drawing a foul on Jokić on the Sixers’ first possesion, the “M-V-P!” chants began.
He went 2-of-5 from the floor during the second half, but recorded four rebounds and four assists during that span.

     Summary: Celtics 76ers top exec claims ‘shameless Boston media’ is why Joel Embiid wasn’t named an All-Star starter while Jayson Tatum was "Joel Embiid completely hosed once again."
Jayson Tatum and Joel Embiid fought for one of the three Eastern Conference starting frontcourt spots for the NBA All-Star Game.
They haven’t recused themselves, and they shoved Joel low enough so that he’s not an All-Star starter.
As a result, Tatum finished third with a weighted score of 2.75 while Embiid had a weighted score of 3.5.
Of course, both Embiid and Tatum have résumés that are worthy of being named an All-Star starter.
