     Summary: For the Nets, Kyrie Irving had 32 points and nine assists while Joe Harris had 16 points and two assists.
He started off the game shooting the ball well, but he found little success shooting the ball from anywhere on the court as the game went on.
He also did a good job of attacking closeouts and making some mid-range shots that way.
He did a good job being active on the glass and he played some solid defense.
He did a good job passing the ball and he wasn‚Äôt much of a detriment for the Nets on the defensive end.
