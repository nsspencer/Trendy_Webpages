     Jubilant Aryna Sabalenka celebrates Grand Slam breakthrough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka didn’t get much sleep Saturday night after a rambunctious come-from-behind victory, but you wouldn’t have known it early on the morning after.
“I still feel like I’m on another planet trying to understand what just happened,” Sabalenka said while reveling in a photo shoot at Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens.
Resplendent in a glamorous pink dress and wearing high heels instead of her usual tennis pumps, Sabalenka took to a boat and glided around a lake with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup clutched firmly in hand.

     Key detail left off Aryna Sabalenka’s Australian Open trophy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aryna Sabalenka was finally able to capture her first championship at the Australian Open after defeating Elena Rybakina in three sets on Saturday.
Following the traditional trophy presentation and photoshoot inside Rod Laver Arena, Sabalenka finally caught a good look at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, the Women’s Singles Champion trophy.
Sabalenka’s name is engraved in the trophy without her home country of Belarus.
Throughout this year’s Australian Open, Sabalenka played with a white flag next to her name instead of Belarus’ red, green, and white flag, while all her opponents played with their national flags next to their names.
Sabalenka became just the second Belarusian woman to win a Grand Slam title, following Victoria Azarenka‘s back-to-back Australian Open titles in 2012 and 2013.

“I think I need a few more days to realize what happened,” Sabalenka told photographers.
“I still feel like I’m on another planet trying to understand what happened!”The champion’s outfit was perfect for the occasion, too, as Sabalenka stepped out in a lilac look by Zimmermann, an acclaimed Australian luxury fashion label based in Sydney.
She matched the capped-sleeve blouse and skirt featuring delicate floral appliques with a pair of royal blue Manolo Blahnik Hangisi pumps.

     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia — (AP) — One point away from her first Grand Slam title, Aryna Sabalenka faulted.
Clearly, this business of winning the Australian Open was not bound to happen without a bit of a struggle Saturday night.
“She played really well today,” said Rybakina, who has lost all four matches she's played against Sabalenka, all in three sets.
Quite a difference from a year ago at Melbourne Park, when Sabalenka departed after 15 double-faults in a fourth-round loss.
“I really feel right now that I really needed those tough losses to kind of understand myself a little bit better.
