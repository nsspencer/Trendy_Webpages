     Strong quake in northwest Iran kills at least three people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 struck northwest Iran near the border with Turkey on Saturday, killing at least three people and injuring more than 300, state media reported.
The official news agency IRNA reported the toll citing the head of emergency services at the university in the city of Khoy, near the quake's epicentre.
An emergency official told state TV that it was snowing in some of the affected areas, with freezing temperatures and some power cuts reported.
Major geological faultlines crisscross Iran, which has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drones attacked an Iranian defense factory in the central city of Isfahan overnight, the state-run IRNA news agency reported early Sunday.
It carried a Defense Ministry statement saying the attack occurred late Saturday and caused minor damage to a rooftop.
Iran and Israel have long been engaged in a shadow war that has included covert attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.
U.S. intelligence agencies, Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency have said Iran ran an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.
Both the U.S. and Israel have vowed to prevent Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, and neither has ruled out military action.

     Iran Says 'Small Drones' Attacked Its Military Site

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports and videos from Iran speak of multiple explosions and a fire at an ammunition factory in the Iranian city of Esfahan shortly after midnight local time.
Small drones have a very short flying time and if these were used against the ammunition factory, they must have been launched from a close distance.
Some Twitter users say that the Esfahan factory was manufacturing warheads for the Shahed kamikaze drone that Iran is supplying Russia for attacks in Ukraine.
A social media post by a group of protesters in the southwestern Khuzestan province reports an explosion in Dezful.

     Summary: A Defense Ministry statement described three drones being launched at the facility, with two of them successfully shot down.
Iranian defense and nuclear sites increasingly find themselves surrounded by commercial properties and residential neighborhoods as the country's cities sprawl ever outward.
Some locations as well remain incredibly opaque about what they produce, with only a sign bearing a Defense Ministry or paramilitary Revolutionary Guard logo.
The Defense Ministry only called the site a “workshop," without elaborating on what it made.
In 2020, Iran blamed Israel for a sophisticated attack that killed its top military nuclear scientist.
