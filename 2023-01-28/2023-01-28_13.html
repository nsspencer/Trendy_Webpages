     Strong quake in northwest Iran kills at least three people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 struck northwest Iran near the border with Turkey on Saturday, killing at least three people and injuring more than 300, state media reported.
The official news agency IRNA reported the toll citing the head of emergency services at the university in the city of Khoy, near the quake's epicentre.
An emergency official told state TV that it was snowing in some of the affected areas, with freezing temperatures and some power cuts reported.
Major geological faultlines crisscross Iran, which has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years.

     Iranian state TV says defense factory hit in drone attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Drones attacked an Iranian defense factory in the central city of Isfahan overnight, the state-run IRNA news agency reported early Sunday.
It carried a Defense Ministry statement saying the attack occurred late Saturday and caused minor damage to a rooftop.
Iran and Israel have long been engaged in a shadow war that has included covert attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.
U.S. intelligence agencies, Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency have said Iran ran an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.
Both the U.S. and Israel have vowed to prevent Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, and neither has ruled out military action.

     Iran thwarts drone attack on military site, state media report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A loud explosion at a military plant in Iran's central city of Isfahan was caused by an "unsuccessful" drone attack, Iranian state media reported on Sunday, citing the defence ministry.
Fortunately, this unsuccessful attack did not cause any loss of life and caused minor damage to the workshop's roof," the ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency IRNA.
There have been a number of explosions and fires around Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities in the past few years.
In 2021, Iran accused Israel of sabotaging its key Natanz nuclear site and vowed revenge for an attack that appeared to be the latest episode in a long-running covert war.
Israel has long threatened military action against Iran if indirect talks between Washington and Tehran fail to salvage a 2015 nuclear pact.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Defense Ministry statement described three drones being launched at the facility, with two of them successfully shot down.
Iranian defense and nuclear sites increasingly find themselves surrounded by commercial properties and residential neighborhoods as the country's cities sprawl ever outward.
Some locations as well remain incredibly opaque about what they produce, with only a sign bearing a Defense Ministry or paramilitary Revolutionary Guard logo.
The Defense Ministry only called the site a “workshop," without elaborating on what it made.
In 2020, Iran blamed Israel for a sophisticated attack that killed its top military nuclear scientist.

     Iran-linked Cyber Group Aims To Disrupt Saudi-Israeli Ties: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cyber security company Secureworks Counter Threat has reported on efforts by a group affiliated to the Islamic Republic aiming to disrupt relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The threat actor known as Cobalt Sapling has been spotted creating a new persona dubbed "Abraham's Ax" to target Saudi Arabia for political leverage.
Further, the security researcher noticed that Abraham's Ax mirrors the iconography, videography and leak sites of a separate threat actor known as Moses Staff.
"Iran has a history of using proxy groups and manufactured personas to target regional and international adversaries," Pilling added.
Considering that experts still consider the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel farfetched, the Islamic Republic hopes to prevent such an agreement through disruptive activities.

     Earthquake Strikes Northwestern Iran, Killing At Least Three
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In early 2020, lawyer Meghdad Jebelli took the drastic decision to leave Iran and seek asylum in the West.
Tehran's delayed claim of responsibility for the shootdown sparked angry protests in Iran and increased distrust in the clerical regime.
I remember we had fights and arguments [with my family members] during those days,” he said.
Hours before the Ukrainian plane was shot down, Iran had launched missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq to avenge Soleimani’s killing, and Tehran's air defenses were on high-alert in case of a U.S. retaliation, which never came.
“This can only happen with the overthrow of the Islamic regime.”Peyman Jebelli has downplayed his brothers’ decision to leave Iran.
