     Florida Panthers rally for wild overtime win over Boston Bruins ahead of All-Star break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A game that saw all ranges of emotion ended in euphoria for the Florida Panthers with a 4-3 overtime win over the NHL-leading Boston Bruins at FLA Live Arena.
Overall, the game saw two massive blunders from the Panthers followed by two moments of redemption, a go-ahead goal by Boston with 48.6 seconds left, a game-tying goal by Florida with two seconds left and, finally, Reinhart’s overtime game winner 17 seconds into overtime.

David Pastrnak scored with 48.6 seconds left, getting a shot through traffic past Lyon to give Boston to a 3-2 lead.
