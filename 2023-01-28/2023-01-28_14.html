     Marie Kondo's House Is Messy Having After 3 Kids
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marie has previously written about the challenges of tidying with small children, saying in one 2019 blog , "When I first became a mother, I felt frustrated when I couldn’t tidy my home exactly the way I wanted.
Then, after having my second child, I didn’t even have the energy to consider some of my former practices around the house!
Motherhood taught me to be more forgiving of myself.
The joy that comes from parenting exceeds any satisfaction that could have come from a perfectly neat home."

     Marie Kondo has “kinda given up” on tidying up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reassuring news for parents everywhere as Marie Kondo, the viral Japanese consultant who specializes in decluttering and organization, has confessed that she lets her home get messy.
In a recent webinar promoting her latest book, ‘Marie Kondo’s Kurashi at Home: How to Organize Your Space and Achieve Your Ideal Life’, the specialist in keeping things neat announced she is no longer tidying up as much after giving birth to her third child.
“My home is messy, but the way I am spending my time is the right way for me at this time at this stage of my life,” Kondo said (via an interpreter).
Kondo is best known for her two Netflix series, ‘Tidying Up’ and ‘Sparking Joy with Marie Kondo’.
The central theme of Kondo’s work is sustainable and meaningful methods of organizing and decluttering a space.

     Why Marie Kondo Has “Kind Of Given Up” on Keeping Her Home Tidy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While she's still sparking joy, Marie Kondo is not tidying up at home as much these days.
"Up until now, I was a professional tidier, so I did my best to keep my home tidy at all times.
While pregnant with her first daughter, Kondo made great efforts to organize her home to prepare for the baby.
In 2016, Kondo told Good Housekeeping that after Miko was born, she thinks she "became more forgiving" about her tidying, adding, "especially because I'm so much more limited in time and [given] the sheer number of things that increase."
But Kondo does encourage her children to help her keep their home tidy.

     Marie Kondo Admits She's Given Up on Tidying: 'My Home Is Messy'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At one point in time, Marie Kondo was convincing many people to spruce up their own homes with her widely-viewed reality series as well as several books about home organizing.
After the success of her 2011 book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, Kondo would later teach her methods to Netflix subscribers with the series Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, which premiered on the streaming service in 2019.
The show had garnered Kondo a lot of praise, earning her an Emmy nomination and prompting Netflix to give her a second series, 2021's Sparking Joy with Marie Kondo.
Given how she's getting lax with her tidying and spending more time with her family, it's unclear if and when Kondo will return to Netflix for a new reality series.
For now, you can go stream both of her previous shows, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo and Sparking Joy with Marie Kondo, on the streaming platform.

     Summary: Her KonMari method took over the world of home organizing, resulting in two Netflix docuseries and surplus donations at thrift stores.
Now, in 2023, even Kondo's house is a bit messier.
"Up until now, I was a professional tidier, so I did my best to keep my home tidy at all times.
The KonMari method was always about living and organizing a life customized around whatever made a person happy.
As many of Kondo's supporters have pointed out, the expert is not alone in her decision to give up on complete neatness.

     Marie Kondo’s new messier mode chimes neatly with the times | Arwa Mahdawi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marie Kondo embraces goblin modeMarie Kondo, the queen of clean, has always been rather more aspirational than relatable.
“Up until now, I was a professional tidier, so I did my best to keep my home tidy at all times … I have kind of given up on that in a good way for me.
But Kondo’s “messy” house (and, by the way, I refuse to believe it’s messy by normal people’s standards without photographic evidence) has generated a lot of headlines.
Kondo’s pivot when it comes to tidying up may be due to her personal circumstances, but it’s also a savvy business move.
Surprise Brett Kavanaugh documentary premieres at Sundance“I do hope this triggers outrage,” said the producer after the premiere.
