The Nets are a really bad rebounding team.
The Knicks are a really good rebounding team.
This may turn out to be ugly if the Nets aren’t diligent on the boards ... or are missing critical players.
It’s a great sign for Irving, the Nets, and most importantly, Nets fans.

     Is Knicks-Nets A Rivalry? The Answer May Be Murky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The question of what constitutes a rivalry was a popular topic Saturday afternoon in Brooklyn.
“Probably (it will take) a playoff series, something like that.
Even with other cities it is hard to define a rivalry based on the playoff series criteria.
Since the Knicks and Nets began occupying the same city, 41 of their 219 regular-season meetings have been played within the city limits.
None have responded to those queries in a postseason series, continuing the debate of“Yeah, I lean more in that direction of [it is needing] meaningful games,” Vaughn said.

     Nets’ Kyrie Irving reacts to team ‘having control’ in win over Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving did not have a particularly good game in the first three quarters of the Nets’ game against the New York Knicks.
Through the first three periods, Irving was 4-of-12 from the field as the Knicks made sure to send a second player towards Irving whenever he touched the ball.
Things changed in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s 122-115 win over New York as Irving scored 21 points of 8-of-15 shooting from the field.
However, Irving recognized that what made Saturday’s win impressive was that everybody else on the team played well.
Just had some good looks in transition and just wanted to make them (the Knicks) play on their heels a little bit.
