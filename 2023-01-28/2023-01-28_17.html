     Bulls' Nikola Vucevic keeps producing big games in contract year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Similar to his current situation with the Bulls, the Magic didn’t seriously entertain contract extension talks entering 2018-19.
After Vucevic delivered his huge season, the Magic promptly signed him to a four-year, $100 million deal.
The Bulls didn’t seriously entertain contract extension talks with Vucevic last offseason and now face a decision as the Feb. 9 trade deadline looms.
All season, Vucevic has said he isn’t focused on business, just basketball.
I feel it’s a very underrated part of my game,” Vucevic said.

     DeRozan, LaVine lead Bulls to 128-109 win over Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine each scored 32 points, Nikola Vucevic added 26 points and 13 rebounds and the Chicago Bulls turned back a late rally and beat the Orlando Magic 128-109 on Saturday night.
“I thought we controlled most of the game,” said Vucevic, who had 17 points and eight rebounds in the first half.
Wagner scored the Magic’s final 11 points in the third period and their first five points in the fourth, pulling the Magic back into contention.
But when the Bulls’ lead got down to six, DeRozan and LaVine responded with baskets, and a 3-pointer by Williams made it 116-106 with 3:29 left.
Magic: F Jonathan Isaac had five points and four rebounds in nine minutes in his third game back from a knee injury.

     Bulls still searching for late-game identity; win over Magic helps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Like many, Dragic believes this Bulls roster has playoff talent from top to bottom.
He just couldn’t fathom why the team was still searching for missing ingredients this late in the season.
That didn’t mean the up-and-coming Magic were just going to go away, but neither were the Bulls (23-26).
Anytime the Magic looked to run down the Bulls, a big basket was made.
The Magic cut the Bulls’ lead to five, but Zach LaVine answered with a drive, then, 30 seconds later, Patrick Williams hit a clutch three.
