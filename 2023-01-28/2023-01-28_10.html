This is at least the sixth mass shooting in California this month.
Frank Preciado of the Los Angeles Police Department said earlier Saturday that the three people killed were inside a vehicle.

He drove to another dance hall but was thwarted by an employee.

     At Least 3 Dead In 4th California Mass Shooting This Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineAt least three people were killed and four injured in a mass shooting in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood early Saturday morning—the fourth mass shooting in the state this month, as the state mourns the loss of at least 19 people in three separate shootings last week.
The alleged gunman in Half Moon Bay, who faces seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as the suspect in the Monterey Park shooting were both 65 years old.
That’s how many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. so far this month, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which considers a mass shooting an event with four or more injuries or deaths.
That’s already eight more than the 34 mass shootings recorded last January—the most in a given January since at least 2014, when the GVA started tracking mass shooting data.
