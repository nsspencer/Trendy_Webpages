     Summary: The Panthers force overtime by scoring with two seconds remaining in regulation, as Sam Reinhart's goal gives Florida the improbable victory vs. the Bruins.
(1:13)SUNRISE, Fla. -- Sam Reinhart scored 17 seconds into overtime to cap a late scoring flurry and give the Florida Panthers a 4-3 victory over the NHL-leading Boston Bruins on Saturday night.
"We're facing a little adversity right now," Boston coach Jim Montgomery said on his postgame interview on NESN.
After David Pastrnak scored to give the Bruins the lead with 48.6 seconds left in regulation, Florida captain Aleksander Barkov tied it with 2.4 seconds remaining.

     Florida Panthers rally for wild overtime win over Boston Bruins ahead of All-Star break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A game that saw all ranges of emotion ended in euphoria for the Florida Panthers with a 4-3 overtime win over the NHL-leading Boston Bruins at FLA Live Arena.
Overall, the game saw two massive blunders from the Panthers followed by two moments of redemption, a go-ahead goal by Boston with 48.6 seconds left, a game-tying goal by Florida with two seconds left and, finally, Reinhart‚Äôs overtime game winner 17 seconds into overtime.
Montour‚Äôs came late in the first period, shortly after the Panthers killed off a four-minute Bruins power play.
Montour redeemed himself by re-directing a Barkov shot past Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman 8:55 into the second period to tie the game at 1-1.
David Pastrnak scored with 48.6 seconds left, getting a shot through traffic past Lyon to give Boston to a 3-2 lead.

     Summary: Bruins Takeaways: Bruins on first two-game skid following frantic finish in Florida Here's what we learned following Boston's first two-game losing streak of the season.
Give CC an üçé too pic.twitter.com/c9Wvc7ZkBN ‚Äî Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 29, 2023Bennett atoned for his scoring error after notching Florida‚Äôs second equalizer at 8:29 of the final period.
The Bruins have not quite been themselves these past few games, and not just because of their subpar third-period play.
Poor passing, flat feet, and a surprisingly dogged Florida penalty kill kept the Bruins from converting with a man up.
But for the first time this season, Boston gave the nod to Marc McLaughlin.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "It's tough to lose a game like that," Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said after the loss.

Hitting a nice milestone, Montour's point streak reached eight games, which set a new record for the longest such streak by a defenseman in Panthers history.
Panthers: Matthew Tkachuk has 21 points (eight goals, 13 assists) over his last 13 games.
