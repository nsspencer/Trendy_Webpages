     Iran-linked Cyber Group Aims To Disrupt Saudi-Israeli Ties: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cyber security company Secureworks Counter Threat has reported on efforts by a group affiliated to the Islamic Republic aiming to disrupt relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The threat actor known as Cobalt Sapling has been spotted creating a new persona dubbed "Abraham's Ax" to target Saudi Arabia for political leverage.
Further, the security researcher noticed that Abraham's Ax mirrors the iconography, videography and leak sites of a separate threat actor known as Moses Staff.
"Iran has a history of using proxy groups and manufactured personas to target regional and international adversaries," Pilling added.
Considering that experts still consider the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel farfetched, the Islamic Republic hopes to prevent such an agreement through disruptive activities.

     Iran reports drone attack on defense facility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2020, Iran blamed Israel for a sophisticated attack that killed its top nuclear scientist.
U.S. intelligence agencies, Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency have said Iran ran an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.
The United Nations' top nuclear official, Rafael Mariano Grossi, recently warned that Iran has enough highly enriched uranium to build "several" nuclear weapons if it chooses.
Efforts to revive a 2015 agreement with world powers that placed limits on Iran's nuclear activities ground to a halt last year.
Both the U.S. and Israel have vowed to prevent Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, and neither has ruled out military action.

     Iran thwarts drone attack on military site, state media report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A loud explosion at a military plant in Iran's central city of Isfahan was caused by an "unsuccessful" drone attack, Iranian state media reported on Sunday, citing the defence ministry.
Fortunately, this unsuccessful attack did not cause any loss of life and caused minor damage to the workshop's roof," the ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency IRNA.
There have been a number of explosions and fires around Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities in the past few years.
In 2021, Iran accused Israel of sabotaging its key Natanz nuclear site and vowed revenge for an attack that appeared to be the latest episode in a long-running covert war.
Israel has long threatened military action against Iran if indirect talks between Washington and Tehran fail to salvage a 2015 nuclear pact.

     Iran says drone attack targets defense facility in Isfahan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Details on the Isfahan attack, which happened around 11:30 p.m. Saturday, remained scarce.
A Defense Ministry statement described three drones being launched at the facility, with two of them successfully shot down.
Some locations as well remain incredibly opaque about what they produce, with only a sign bearing a Defense Ministry or paramilitary Revolutionary Guard logo.
The Defense Ministry only called the site a “workshop," without elaborating on what it made.
In April 2021, Iran blamed Israel for an attack on its underground Natanz nuclear facility that damaged its centrifuges.
