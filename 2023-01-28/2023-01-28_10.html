    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arnaut Danjuma got his Tottenham Hotspur career off to a dream start by scoring on his debut in a 3-0 win at Preston North End.
The 25-year-old, who joined Spurs on loan from Villarreal earlier in the week, entered Saturday's FA Cup fourth round game as a substitute in the 71st minute.
Sixteen minutes later, he found the net with a scuffed right-foot shot following a cross cross from Dejan Kulusevski.
He had scored 17 times for Bournemouth in the EFL Championship during the 2020/21 season.
Danjuma's goal against Preston came after Son Heung-min had scored twice to put Spurs in control.

     Son at the double to fire Spurs past Preston in FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PRESTON, England, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's Son Heung-min returned to form with two goals in their 3-0 defeat of second-tier Preston North End in the FA Cup fourth round, with debutant Arnaut Danjuma also on target at Deepdale on Saturday.
South Korean Son has endured a lean season but made the difference with two superb goals after the break as the visitors moved comfortably through to the next round.
It was the kind of position I like to shoot," said Son, who has eight Spurs goals in all competitions this season.
"In the first half I had a couple of chances to shoot but the keeper made a good save.
Apart from a brief spell in between Tottenham's goals, Preston rarely troubled the away side who did not even need to bring leading scorer Harry Kane off the bench.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Record-chasing Harry Kane was limited to a watching brief as Son Heung-min fired Tottenham into the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 victory at Preston in a battle of the lilywhites.
A push for the top four would be a much more realistic prospect if he is back firing again.
Spurs started the second half with more energy and got their rewards five minutes after the restart.
Moments later, Son had his second and the tie was effectively over.
Perisic turned provider, his neat flick finding Son inside the area.
