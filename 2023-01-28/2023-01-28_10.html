    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Nobody tells you it’s going to be easy,” Aryna Sabalenka kept saying to herself on Saturday night in Rod Laver Arena.
Alongside Naomi Osaka, who is one year older, the 6-foot, long-limbed, heavy-hitting Sabalenka seemed destined to power her way to multiple major titles.
She couldn’t, as Rafael Nadal would say, “play with calm.”“I was, like, overdoing things,” Sabalenka says of those three semifinal defeats.
Screaming, doing all this stuff.”This time Sabalenka kept her cool in a semifinal win over Magda Linette, but the old issues returned right away in the final against Elena Rybakina.
Up 40-0 in an early service game, Sabalenka double-faulted it away, then double-faulted again at 4-4, break point.

Clearly, this business of winning the Australian Open was not bound to happen without a bit of a struggle Saturday night.
“She played really well today,” said Rybakina, who has lost all four matches she's played against Sabalenka, all in three sets.
Quite a difference from a year ago at Melbourne Park, when Sabalenka departed after 15 double-faults in a fourth-round loss.
“I really feel right now that I really needed those tough losses to kind of understand myself a little bit better.
