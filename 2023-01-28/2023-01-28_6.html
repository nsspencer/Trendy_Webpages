     Nets‚Äô Kyrie Irving reacts to team ‚Äòhaving control‚Äô in win over Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving did not have a particularly good game in the first three quarters of the Nets‚Äô game against the New York Knicks.
Through the first three periods, Irving was 4-of-12 from the field as the Knicks made sure to send a second player towards Irving whenever he touched the ball.
Things changed in the fourth quarter of Saturday‚Äôs 122-115 win over New York as Irving scored 21 points of 8-of-15 shooting from the field.
However, Irving recognized that what made Saturday‚Äôs win impressive was that everybody else on the team played well.
Just had some good looks in transition and just wanted to make them (the Knicks) play on their heels a little bit.
