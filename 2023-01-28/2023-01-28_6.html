     Joel Embiid drops 47 points as Nikola Jokic, Nuggets fall at Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA – When Nikola Jokic called Joel Embiid “probably” the most dominant player in the NBA ahead of Saturday’s showcase, he knew the storm that awaited him.
Embiid showed off a level few players in the league ever reach, bludgeoning the Nuggets for 47 points and 18 rebounds en route to Philadelphia’s 126-119 win.
“I’m not worried about Joel Embiid,” Malone said afterward.
Tucker on Jokic instead of Embiid, it led to angst — and a handful of technical fouls on both sides.
Prior to the game, Malone wasn’t interested in juicing Saturday’s matchup between Jokic and Embiid, who’ve finished 1-2 in MVP voting each of the last two years.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unsurprisingly, the Jokic-led Nuggets outscored the Sixers by five points during Montrezl Harrell’s initial stint of approximately two and a half minutes.
Upon returning, Embiid hit two top-of-the-key threes and at least kept the Nuggets from seizing complete control of the game.
Before all of that, the Sixers began the second half well on both ends.
And Tucker picked the perfect time for his only points, tipping in a Harden miss after the Nuggets had cut the Sixers' lead to 120-117.
His fourth three of the afternoon put the Sixers up eight points and was a fitting punctuation to an MVP-caliber day.

Overall, the Sixers outscored the Nuggets, 68-46, in the second half.
