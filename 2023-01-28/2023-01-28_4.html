     Summary: It was a fairly neutral outing for Hudson's side.
There were flashes of potential from a couple of players, but the US couldn't systematically create chances, despite the space available to them in the final third.
The intensity was surprisingly high for what amounts to a preseason match for most of the player pool, and that probably excuses some of the lack of quality in the final third.

     Paxten Aaronson a bright spot in USMNT-Colombia draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paxten Aaronson was a bright spot in the USMNT's scoreless draw against Colombia.
And it was the U.S. that had the better chances with Paxten Aaronson, in his USMNT debut, going close in the first half.
There was plenty of end-to-end play and some clear looks at goal in the opening half, including a deflected effort from Paxten Aaronson in the 14th minute that grazed the post.
That meant another pair of international debuts, this time for Paxten Aaronson -- brother of Leeds United and U.S. international midfielder Brenden Aaronson -- and New York Red Bulls defender John Tolkin.
Best: Paxten Aaronson, U.S.Aaronson's had more positives than negatives in his international debut, and adjusted his game in the second half.

There is an attempt to get key domestic-based USMNT players minutes during the offseason, but there's also a serious eye on the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
The eyes will mostly be on 19-year-old Paxten Aaronson and 21-year-old Matthew Hoppe, plus 19-year-old John Tolkin could make an impression.
Starting today's match, Paxten Aaronson joins older brother Brenden as the eighth set of brothers to appear for the Red, White and Blue.
