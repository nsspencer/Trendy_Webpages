     Bengals vs. Chiefs: Behind enemy lines Q&amp;A before AFC title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals again find themselves staring down a matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs for a chance to advance to the Super Bowl.
Sunday’s AFC title game is a repeat of last year’s affair at the same Arrowhead Stadium featuring the same key players.
This time, though, the Bengals don’t enter as longshot underdogs — they’re riding a 10-game winning streak, among other notables.
And things are a little more complex than expected from the Kansas City side with quarterback Patrick Mahomes nursing an ankle injury and tight end Travis Kelce a surprise late addition to the injury report.
With so much intrigue, we sought out Chiefs expert Charles Goldman of Chiefs Wire for a Q&amp;A session on some of the game’s most notable talking points.

     Summary: The Chiefs will try to counter that with a secondary that often employs three rookie cornerbacks and a rookie safety.
“Hopefully we’ve grown enough that we can match what they put out there,” Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said.
Bengals 24, Chiefs 23Four downsTight spot: The Bengals will be tasked with trying to at least slow down Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who had a career-high 110 receptions and 12 TDs this season.
In the past four postseasons, Kelce has played in 10 games and has 77 receptions for 964 yards and 12 TDs.
Conversely, Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones, who often looks unblockable and had 15 .5 sacks in the regular season, is still searching for his first career postseason sack.

     Summary: The AFC Championship Game will feature a rematch of last year’s battle with the Cincinnati Bengals facing the Kansas City Chiefs.
Last year’s AFC Championship game was a thriller that resulted in a combined total of 65 points.
If they opt to lean heavily on the run game, can the Chiefs effectively score at the rate they have all year long?
At the end of the day, there is too much talent on display for both teams to envision a low-scoring game.
After their last contest was relatively close, look for this game to be a high-scoring clinic that is reminiscent of last year’s title game.
