“I think it’s more of a motivation to go out there and try to win the whole thing,” Embiid said.

     Summary: Embiid is widely considered as the biggest starter snub.
"Having been a starter the last five years, it is kind of disrespectful.
I don't think anybody has had a better year than me," Embiid said to media members.
As long as the team can stay healthy down the stretch, they'll have a chance to make a real run.
"Let's keep offending Joel by fining him and not putting him on the All-Star starters," Rivers said.

     Sixers vs. Nuggets: Joel Embiid drops 47 points in Sixers' seventh straight win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unsurprisingly, the Jokic-led Nuggets outscored the Sixers by five points during Montrezl Harrell’s initial stint of approximately two and a half minutes.
Upon returning, Embiid hit two top-of-the-key threes and at least kept the Nuggets from seizing complete control of the game.
Before all of that, the Sixers began the second half well on both ends.
And Tucker picked the perfect time for his only points, tipping in a Harden miss after the Nuggets had cut the Sixers' lead to 120-117.
His fourth three of the afternoon put the Sixers up eight points and was a fitting punctuation to an MVP-caliber day.

So I think we've got a good chance."
Embiid has repeatedly praised Jokic extensively, saying he's a tremendous player and that he has a lot of respect for him.
When given the chance to advocate for himself for MVP -- and asked if this was a statement game -- Embiid said he's done doing so.

     Triple H Comments After Joel Embiid’s Fine for DX Chop Celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, Sixers center Joel Embiid brought out the DX crotch chop celebration in a win over the Nets, which led to a fine from the NBA for $25,000.
“Curious, Joel Embiid If you wrote a bigger check now, could you get a volume discount to cover the rest of the season?
Triple H was a member of DeGeneration X, the wrestling group that created the crotch chop and popularized it in the mainstream as its signature taunt.
Embiid has used the crotch chop before for in-game celebrations, and this is just the latest instance.
So, even if the NBA didn’t necessarily approve of Embiid’s celebration, getting Triple H’s approval is probably worth the $25,000 fine.

     Summary: After the game, Embiid told television cameras that there isn’t any rivalry with Jokic.
Jokic caused Embiid to make a couple of mistakes, but as the game went on, Embiid started to figure him out.
And even with the Jokic matchup hanging over the entire game, Embiid did not let emotions get the best of him.
Sitting on 44 points, Embiid still made the winning play: a pass to Tobias Harris in the corner.
To be considered the best player in this talent-rich NBA, you have to consistently go above and beyond.
