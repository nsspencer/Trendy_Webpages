     Bengals vs. Chiefs: Behind enemy lines Q&amp;A before AFC title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals again find themselves staring down a matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs for a chance to advance to the Super Bowl.
Sunday’s AFC title game is a repeat of last year’s affair at the same Arrowhead Stadium featuring the same key players.
This time, though, the Bengals don’t enter as longshot underdogs — they’re riding a 10-game winning streak, among other notables.
And things are a little more complex than expected from the Kansas City side with quarterback Patrick Mahomes nursing an ankle injury and tight end Travis Kelce a surprise late addition to the injury report.
With so much intrigue, we sought out Chiefs expert Charles Goldman of Chiefs Wire for a Q&amp;A session on some of the game’s most notable talking points.

     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsIt’s been a wild couple of days for bettors tracking the Cincinnati Bengals versus Kansas City Chiefs odds.
Bengals vs Chiefs First TD Scorer Pick and PredictionRemember, betting on first TD scorer is different than anytime TD scorer in the person you bet on needs to score the first touchdown of the game, not the first touchdown for their team and not a TD at any point in the game.
He had four rushing TDs this year and has recorded at least one rushing TD in playoffs every years he’s played.
Because Mahomes is dealing with an ankle injury, I anticipate the Chiefs to play out of the shotgun more often.
If that’s the case, he should be on the field when the Chiefs get close to the end zone early in the game.

     'Burrowhead' explained: How Mike Hilton’s bold Joe Burrow quote became bulletin board material for Bengals vs. Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/9P8fTJkgcg — TopFanTV (@TopFanTV) January 24, 2023The trash talk from Hilton marked one of the latest additions to a growing NFL rivalry between Joe Burrow's Bengals and Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs.
What is Joe Burrow's record at Arrowhead Stadium?
Part of what makes "Burrowhead" a bold proclamation is that Burrow has played in Arrowhead Stadium just once.
And when defensive tackle Chris Jones finished his press conference Friday, he told the media in attendance he would "see you all at Burrowhead Stadium."
However Sunday's contest plays out, there will certainly be a lot said afterward about "Burrowhead Stadium."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Well, this feels familiar, seeing Bengals vs. Chiefs odds on the board again in late January.
We’re looking for a Bengals vs. Chiefs pick as the two teams meet in Kansas City with a spot in the Super Bowl on the line for the second straight season.
Cincinnati, of course, pulled off the upset in the AFC Championship game last season.
Or will the Chiefs exact revenge at home in their fifth straight AFC Championship Game appearance?
However, if that favors the Bengals significantly, the Chiefs will likely be playing from behind in a favorable game state for passing yards.
