     Guitarist Tom Verlaine, co-founder of Television, dies at 73
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — (AP) — Tom Verlaine, guitarist and co-founder of the seminal proto-punk band Television who influenced many bands while playing at ultra-cool downtown New York music venue CBGB alongside the Ramones, Patti Smith and Talking Heads, has died.
“Tom Verlaine has passed over to the beyond that his guitar playing always hinted at.
He was the best rock and roll guitarist of all time, and like Hendrix could dance from the spheres of the cosmos to garage rock.
Though Television never found much commercial success, Verlaine’s jaggedly inventive playing as part of the band's two-guitar assault influenced many musicians.
Tributes online included those from Susanna Hoffs and Billy Idol, who said Verlaine made music that influenced the US and UK punk scene.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Verlaine, singer and guitarist for punk legends Television who crafted the band’s 1977 masterpiece Marquee Moon, has died at the age of 73.
Jesse Paris Smith, the daughter of Patti Smith, confirmed Verlaine’s death following a “brief illness” to Rolling Stone on Saturday.
Arriving in Manhattan’s Lower East Side at the dawn of punk, Verlaine and Hell first teamed up for the short-lived act Neon Boys before co-founding Television in 1973 alongside guitarist Richard Lloyd.
Editor’s picks“As exhilarating in its lyrical ambitions as the Ramones’ debut was in its brutal simplicity, Marquee Moon still amazes,” Rolling Stone wrote.
Tom Verlaine, Singer and Guitarist of Punk Legends Television, Dead at 73In a 1988 interview with Rolling Stone, U2’s the Edge cited Verlaine as one of his chief influences.

     Tom Verlaine, Founder of Influential Punk-Era Band Television, Dies at 73
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Verlaine, who redefined rock guitar in the punk era of the 1970s with his band Television, died Saturday in Manhattan.
But a year later the three musicians reconvened, joined by guitarist Richard Lloyd, whose benefactor Terry Ork employed Miller and Meyers at his Village memorabilia store Cinemabilia.
Meyers had renamed himself Richard Hell; Miller took the stage name Tom Verlaine, after the 19th-century French poet; and the band, in acknowledgement of Verlaine’s handle, was renamed Television.
(Some of Hell’s songs for Television were heard on “Blank Generation,” the 1977 debut by his band the Voidoids.)
After the “Television” reunion album and the instrumental set “Warm and Cool” in 1992, he opted out on recording for nearly a decade and a half.
