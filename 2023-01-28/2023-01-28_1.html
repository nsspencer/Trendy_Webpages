     Lakers voice frustration with controversial no-call in loss to Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Resiliency, and perhaps some help from the officials, propelled the Boston Celtics to a thrilling overtime victory vs. the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night.
With the game tied, Jayson Tatum appeared to foul Lakers superstar LeBron James at the rim in the final seconds of regulation.
But instead of letting James attempt to seal L.A.'s win at the free throw line, the refs sent the game into OT.
The NBA determined in its postgame review that officials missed the call, but that didn't make the Lakers feel any better about what had transpired.

     Anthony Davis blasts refs for missed foul in Lakers' loss to Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Davis sat in his chair in a quiet and disappointed Lakers locker room, a towel over his shoulders, his ire about the officials coming out very strong.
Clearly,” said Davis, who had 16 points and 10 rebounds in his second game back from injury.
But after a few seconds, the referees called a foul on Beverley, to the dismay of the Lakers.
“They’re not gonna do anything next game,” Davis said.
And I guarantee that if the refs started getting fined for missed calls, it’d be a lot better.
