     Manchester United vs. Reading
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three quick-fire second-half goals allowed Manchester United to ease to a 3-1 win over Championship side Reading in Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at Old Trafford.
After a frustrating first half, Casemiro struck twice in four minutes before the hour mark to put United on the path to victory.
You don't win what he's won without being a top player," United captain Harry Maguire said.
Perhaps spurred on by that escape or some strong words from Ten Hag at the interval, United took just nine minutes into the second half to finally get on the scoresheet.
The goal was an all-Brazilian affair with Antony supplying a perfectly weighted through ball and Casemiro finishing with a delicate chip over the out-rushing Joe Lumley in the Reading goal.

     How Manchester United beat 10-man Reading 3-1 to advance to FA Cup last 16 thanks to Casemiro double, Fred goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United have beaten 10-man Reading 3-1 to advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup.
Rashford would miss his opportunity to become the first player in club history to score in 10 straight home matches.
The floodgates burst open for the home side early in the second half though.
Casemiro scored twice in the space of four minutes, the first a sweet chip over the keeper and the second a deflected effort from long range.
Fred scored United's third just a minute later with a sweet heel-flicked finish, putting the game out of reach.
