     Aryna Sabalenka Wins Her First Grand Slam Title at the Australian Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today at the Australian Open, the 24-year-old Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka stormed to victory over Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan in a riveting two-and-a-half-hour match that spanned three sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
As this year’s women’s singles champion in Melbourne, Sabalenka will be taking home her first Grand Slam title, capping an extraordinary start to 2023 after winning her first 11 matches of the season and already receiving two titles within the first month of the year.
While this year’s women’s singles race felt wide open after a number of favorites were knocked out in earlier rounds, both Sabalenka and Rybakina proved their right to be in the final with their intense focus, athleticism, and of course, their breathtakingly powerful serves and groundstrokes.
Rybakina, who took home her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon last year, kicked off the match explosively, dropping just six service points in the opening set.
But from the beginning of the second set onwards, the battle between the two players—which was as much a test of Sabalenka’s psychological mettle as it was of both their volcanic power—began to turn, with Sabalenka settling in and breaking serve for a 3-1 lead.

     Summary: Aryna Sabalenka was finally able to capture her first championship at the Australian Open after defeating Elena Rybakina in three sets on Saturday.
Following the traditional trophy presentation and photoshoot inside Rod Laver Arena, Sabalenka finally caught a good look at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, the Women’s Singles Champion trophy.
Sabalenka’s name is engraved in the trophy without her home country of Belarus.
Throughout this year’s Australian Open, Sabalenka played with a white flag next to her name instead of Belarus’ red, green, and white flag, while all her opponents played with their national flags next to their names.
Sabalenka became just the second Belarusian woman to win a Grand Slam title, following Victoria Azarenka‘s back-to-back Australian Open titles in 2012 and 2013.

     Summary: “Nobody tells you it’s going to be easy,” Aryna Sabalenka kept saying to herself on Saturday night in Rod Laver Arena.
Alongside Naomi Osaka, who is one year older, the 6-foot, long-limbed, heavy-hitting Sabalenka seemed destined to power her way to multiple major titles.
She couldn’t, as Rafael Nadal would say, “play with calm.”“I was, like, overdoing things,” Sabalenka says of those three semifinal defeats.
Screaming, doing all this stuff.”This time Sabalenka kept her cool in a semifinal win over Magda Linette, but the old issues returned right away in the final against Elena Rybakina.
Up 40-0 in an early service game, Sabalenka double-faulted it away, then double-faulted again at 4-4, break point.

Clearly, this business of winning the Australian Open was not bound to happen without a bit of a struggle Saturday night.
“She played really well today,” said Rybakina, who has lost all four matches she's played against Sabalenka, all in three sets.
Quite a difference from a year ago at Melbourne Park, when Sabalenka departed after 15 double-faults in a fourth-round loss.
“I really feel right now that I really needed those tough losses to kind of understand myself a little bit better.
