     WNBA free agent Candace Parker to sign with Las Vegas Aces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:55)Two-time WNBA champion and MVP Candace Parker plans to sign with the Las Vegas Aces as an unrestricted free agent, she announced Saturday on Instagram.
"After evaluating the landscape together with my family, we've decided the Las Vegas Aces are the right organization for us at this point in our lives."

     Former MVP Candace Parker to sign with champion Aces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS — (AP) — Former two-time MVP Candace Parker announced on social media Saturday that she would sign with the defending champion Las Vegas Aces.
Parker spent the past two seasons playing for her hometown Sky, leading Chicago to the WNBA championship in 2021.
Parker, a 6-foot-4 forward/center, adds to an already loaded lineup that includes reigning MVP A'ja Wilson, who also won the league's top award in 2020.
Chelsea Gray was MVP of the WNBA Finals and Kelsey Plum MVP of the All-Star Game.
Parker, the 2020 Defensive Player of the Year and the 2016 Finals MVP, certainly fits that bill.

     Sky lose Candace Parker to Aces in free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A little more than a year removed from winning their first WNBA title, the Sky lost the player most responsible for it.
“After evaluating the landscape together with my family, we’ve decided the Las Vegas Aces are the right organization for us at this point,” said Parker, who met with the Los Angeles Sparks, Sky and Aces.
The Aces offer Parker a chance at another ring and the luxuries of playing for an owner in Mark Davis who’s willing to invest.
In two seasons with the Sky, Parker averaged 13.2 points, 4.3 assists and 8.5 rebounds.
Parker had said there were only two franchises she would consider playing for, the Sparks and Sky.
