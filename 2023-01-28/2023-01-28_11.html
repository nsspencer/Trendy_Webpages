     Michael B. Jordan Portrays an Unhinged Jake From State Farm in Funny and Subversive ‘SNL’ Sketch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael B. Jordan donned a State Farm polo for a hilarious “Saturday Night Live” video short as not-so-good neighbor Jake, who first shows up to demonstrate the insurance company’s app for a family and then refuses to leave.
Jake then continues to assimilate into the family unit, bringing Gardner and the kids to church on Sunday morning, causing a fight between the two spouses.
Slowly but surely, Day is phased out of his family, as Jake plays with his kids, throwing the football with his son, now wearing the State Farm polo, hits on his wife, and moves all of his State Farm wardrobe into the closet.
Day tries to scheme a way to rid the family of the visitor by googling Geico, but Jake shows up in the shadows, whispering that it won’t be so easy, because State Farm matches rates.
Then, out of nowhere, he is saved by insurance mascots LiMu Emu and Doug, from Liberty Mutual.
