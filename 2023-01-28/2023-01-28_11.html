     Summary: Drones attacked an Iranian defense factory in the central city of Isfahan overnight, the state-run IRNA news agency reported early Sunday.
It carried a Defense Ministry statement saying the attack occurred late Saturday and caused minor damage to a rooftop.
Iran and Israel have long been engaged in a shadow war that has included covert attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.
U.S. intelligence agencies, Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency have said Iran ran an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.
Both the U.S. and Israel have vowed to prevent Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, and neither has ruled out military action.

     Iran Says 'Small Drones' Attacked Its Military Site
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports and videos from Iran speak of multiple explosions and a fire at an ammunition factory in the Iranian city of Esfahan shortly after midnight local time.
Small drones have a very short flying time and if these were used against the ammunition factory, they must have been launched from a close distance.
Some Twitter users say that the Esfahan factory was manufacturing warheads for the Shahed kamikaze drone that Iran is supplying Russia for attacks in Ukraine.
A social media post by a group of protesters in the southwestern Khuzestan province reports an explosion in Dezful.

PAST EXPLOSIONS, FIRESThe Islamic Republic has in the past accused arch-enemy Israel of planning attacks using agents inside Iranian territory.
Several Iranian nuclear sites are located in Isfahan province, including Natanz, centrepiece of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme, which Iran accuses Israel of sabotaging in 2021.
There have been a number of explosions and fires around Iranian military, nuclear and industrial sites in recent years.
Moscow denies its forces use Iranian drones in Ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there.

     Summary: A Defense Ministry statement described three drones being launched at the facility, with two of them successfully shot down.
Iranian defense and nuclear sites increasingly find themselves surrounded by commercial properties and residential neighborhoods as the country's cities sprawl ever outward.
Some locations as well remain incredibly opaque about what they produce, with only a sign bearing a Defense Ministry or paramilitary Revolutionary Guard logo.
The Defense Ministry only called the site a “workshop," without elaborating on what it made.
In 2020, Iran blamed Israel for a sophisticated attack that killed its top military nuclear scientist.

     Secrecy In Iran’s New Privatization Plan Raises Corruption Concerns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iranian media and economic experts are characterizing a privatization plan the officials keep secret as "a plunder of public property" and "economic apartheid."
The government's plan is to make 1,080 trillion rials out of selling public assets presumably to well-connected regime insiders.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has approved the sales and wants them to be done as soon as possible.
Committee members have already received immunity from any prosecution resulting from privatization transactions.
Referring to the potential financial corruption involved as a result of secrecy, he warned that "This is auctioning public property and reminiscent of what happened in previous privatization measures."
