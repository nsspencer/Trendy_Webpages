     Watch Michael B. Jordan make his ‘SNL’ debut as Jake from State Farm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael B. Jordan showed up for his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut this weekend, but so did Jake ... from State Farm.
Jordan, who grew up in Newark, plays the red-shirted insurance pitchman in an “SNL” sketch with Heidi Gardner and Mikey Day.
As the familiar slogan goes, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there” ... and won’t leave.
When the man returns home from work, Jake is still there, entertaining the children.
Jordan, 35, makes his directorial debut in the upcoming film “Creed III,” in which he reprises the role of boxer Adonis Creed.

He lucked out, he explained, because the vast majority of Google image results for “sad Michael Jordan” are of the meme of former Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan shedding tears at his 2009 NBA Hall of Hame induction speech.
Jordan and Gardner would later appear together on Weekend Update, with Gardner playing “every boxer’s girlfriend from every movie about boxing ever” and Jordan playing his character in the Creed franchise.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael B. Jordan donned a State Farm polo for a hilarious “Saturday Night Live” video short as not-so-good neighbor Jake, who first shows up to demonstrate the insurance company’s app for a family and then refuses to leave.
Jake then continues to assimilate into the family unit, bringing Gardner and the kids to church on Sunday morning, causing a fight between the two spouses.
Slowly but surely, Day is phased out of his family, as Jake plays with his kids, throwing the football with his son, now wearing the State Farm polo, hits on his wife, and moves all of his State Farm wardrobe into the closet.
Day tries to scheme a way to rid the family of the visitor by googling Geico, but Jake shows up in the shadows, whispering that it won’t be so easy, because State Farm matches rates.
Then, out of nowhere, he is saved by insurance mascots LiMu Emu and Doug, from Liberty Mutual.
