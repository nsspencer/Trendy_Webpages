     R.I.P. Tom Verlaine, guitarist, singer, and co-founder of Television
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the singer, songwriter, and guitar player for influential New York band Television, Verlaine shaped the sound of rock and punk music in the 1970s and beyond , applying a poetic flair (and serious musicianship) to the rougher edges of the wider movement.
VenusBorn in New Jersey (as Thomas Miller) and raised in Delaware , Verlaine started playing music as a kid, forming an early interest in both jazz and rock.
The band quickly became Television after the addition of second guitarist Richard Lloyd.
A follow-up, 1978's Adventure, drove more strong (if slightly more muted) reviews, even if Television never reaped similar success in the commercial sphere .
Meanwhile, Verlaine embarked on a long and fruitful solo career, starting with, fittingly, Tom Verlaine in 1979.

     Tom Verlaine, Singer and Guitarist of Punk Legends Television, Dead at 73
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Verlaine, singer and guitarist for punk legends Television who crafted the band’s 1977 masterpiece Marquee Moon, has died at the age of 73.
Jesse Paris Smith, the daughter of Patti Smith, confirmed Verlaine’s death following a “brief illness” to Rolling Stone on Saturday.
His vision and his imagination will be missed,” Smith wrote.
Arriving in Manhattan’s Lower East Side at the dawn of punk, Verlaine and Hell first teamed up for the short-lived act Neon Boys before co-founding Television in 1973 alongside guitarist Richard Lloyd.
Editor’s picks“As exhilarating in its lyrical ambitions as the Ramones’ debut was in its brutal simplicity, Marquee Moon still amazes,” Rolling Stone wrote.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Verlaine, a founding father of American punk and a fixture of the 1970s New York rock scene, died Saturday in Manhattan as the result of a brief illness.
"I met Tom when I was a child, not long after my dad passed away," Jesse Paris Smith wrote in a statement to NPR.
Verlaine was best known as the singer and guitarist with the influential rock band Television.
He adopted the stage name Tom Verlaine in honor of the French 19th century Symbolist poet Paul Verlaine after moving to New York City in the late 1960s.
"Tom and I had an hysterically funny conversation that lasted the last 42 years," guitarist and Television member Jimmy Rip wrote in a statement to NPR.

     Tom Verlaine, Founder of Influential Punk-Era Band Television, Dies at 73
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Verlaine, who redefined rock guitar in the punk era of the 1970s with his band Television, died Saturday in Manhattan.
But a year later the three musicians reconvened, joined by guitarist Richard Lloyd, whose benefactor Terry Ork employed Miller and Meyers at his Village memorabilia store Cinemabilia.
Meyers had renamed himself Richard Hell; Miller took the stage name Tom Verlaine, after the 19th-century French poet; and the band, in acknowledgement of Verlaine’s handle, was renamed Television.
(Some of Hell’s songs for Television were heard on “Blank Generation,” the 1977 debut by his band the Voidoids.)
After the “Television” reunion album and the instrumental set “Warm and Cool” in 1992, he opted out on recording for nearly a decade and a half.
