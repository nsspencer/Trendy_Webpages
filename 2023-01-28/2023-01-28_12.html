     Lakers' Anthony Davis: Officially active off bench
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davis (foot) will play in Saturday's game against the Celtics, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports.
He will come off the bench.
Davis was initially probable, so his availability does not come as a surprise.
He was incredible in his first game back from a foot injury, recording 21 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks across 26 minutes Wednesday.
Davis will likely remain on a similar minutes restriction to Wednesday's contest but remains a must-start in fantasy even with the limitations.

     Summary: Earlier this week, Anthony Davis returned to the court in a big way for the LA Lakers as the team picked up a 113-104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.
After exiting the December 16th showdown against the Denver Nuggets with a foot injury, Davis then wound up sitting out the next month.
In just 26 minutes off the bench, Davis recorded 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 blocks, picking up right where he left off in December.
According to reports, it's a matter of how many minutes he will play rather than whether he will play at all.
