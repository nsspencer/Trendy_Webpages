    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USMNT announces starting lineup for friendly vs. Colombia originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoThe second starting lineup of 2023 is here for the United States men's national team.
Veteran goalkeeper Sean Johnson comes in between the sticks after Gabriel Slonina's impressive debut against Serbia.
In midfield is Kellyn Acosta (captain) and Eryk Williamson, both of whom came off the bench against Serbia and formed a double-pivot partnership.
Paxten Aaronson, younger brother of Brenden, is logging his first cap in what should be a central attacking role.
Alejandro Zendejas, who had a promising debut on Wednesday, returned to Club America after that match, so he's the lone player not available tonight.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States men's national team finished without a victory from its two January friendlies after a scoreless draw with Colombia at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, on Saturday.
There was still plenty of youth, though, including debuts for Paxten Aaronson and John Tolkin and a first start for DeJuan Jones.
Despite several players on both sides being in their preseason, there was plenty of intensity in the opening 45 minutes.
But with Paul Arriola begging for a square pass, the Middlesbrough forward shot straight at the Colombia keeper after being found by Jesus Ferreira's through-ball.
It was to Yilmar Velazquez that Colombia's best chance of the opening half fell, but the midfielder scuffed his shot wide of the target.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An entertaining first half, much less so in the second period.
The second period was rather more of a let-down, with neither goalkeeper having a single save to make.
The USMNT were marginally more menacing but most of their threat came from set plays.
Neither manager will have been especially impressed with any of his attackers, with defences very much on top, especially in the second half.
In any case, the USMNT and Colombian will both send out vastly different teams when they play their next competitive fixtures in March.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USMNT instant match ratings from 0-0 draw vs. Colombia originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoLOS ANGELES -- Zero wins for the United States men's national team in January.
Colombia managed nine shots, primarily generated from sloppy U.S. giveaways, but only one hit the target, with the rest provoking little damage.
Most of the second half was played in the Stars and Stripes' defensive third, but Colombia couldn't find that one moment of inspiration for a breakthrough.
CB Walker Zimmerman – 6: Had a sluggish start playing the ball, which has never really been a strength, but did well in the second half clearing out play before coming off for Jalen Neal.
The second half was more quiet for him, but that theme spread across the team.
