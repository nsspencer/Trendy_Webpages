     Summary: James Harden costs Sixers with boneheaded moveJames Harden cost his Philadelphia 76ers with a boneheaded move on Saturday.
After the turnover, Harden for some reason left the court and went to sit down on Philly‚Äôs bench.
That left the Sixers with four players on defense.
When a coach on the bench alerted Harden, he tried to run onto the court mid-play.
Perhaps Harden thought Thybulle was able to check in after Embiid‚Äôs turnover, which is why he went to the bench.

     76ers vs. Nuggets: James Harden leaves bench mid-play, deflects ball leading to technical foul on Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers star guard James Harden decided to try a new form of defense late in the third quarter of the contest between the Sixers and Denver Nuggets on Saturday afternoon.
With just under two minutes remaining in the quarter, Harden was seated on Philly's bench and jumped directly onto the floor to deflect a pass from Bones Hyland in the corner.
That tipped pass went right into the hands of Sixers forward Georges Niang, but the referees weren't having it.
That play was just one of many entertaining ones from the matinee contest between Philadelphia and Denver.
Jokic finished the game with 24 points, nine assists and eight rebounds.
