     Bulls' Lonzo Ball gets brutal new injury update from Billy Donovan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chicago Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball is “nowhere close” to returning from the knee injuries that have caused him to be sidelined since January 2022, according to the Chicago Tribune’s Julia Poe.
Bulls head coach Billy Donovan adds that while there’s no cut-off date set for Ball’s return this season, Chicago will have one after All-Star Weekend if Ball’s injury doesn’t improve by then.
Originally diagnosed with knee soreness, it’s since been revealed that Ball suffered a bone bruise and meniscus tear in his left knee.
From the immediate future and the Bulls’ playoffs hopes, to the distant future and Ball’s playing future, there are questions that need to be answered.
To make matters worse, Ball was playing some of his best basketball with Chicago after blossoming with the New Orleans Pelicans.

     Summary: Similar to his current situation with the Bulls, the Magic didn’t seriously entertain contract extension talks entering 2018-19.
After Vucevic delivered his huge season, the Magic promptly signed him to a four-year, $100 million deal.
The Bulls didn’t seriously entertain contract extension talks with Vucevic last offseason and now face a decision as the Feb. 9 trade deadline looms.
All season, Vucevic has said he isn’t focused on business, just basketball.
I feel it’s a very underrated part of my game,” Vucevic said.

"I thought we controlled most of the game," said Vucevic, who had 17 points and eight rebounds in the first half.
We let them back in the game, but this time we were able to finish the game off."
But when the Bulls' lead got down to six, DeRozan and LaVine responded with baskets, and a 3-pointer by Williams made it 116-106 with 3:29 left.

     Summary: Like many, Dragic believes this Bulls roster has playoff talent from top to bottom.
He just couldn’t fathom why the team was still searching for missing ingredients this late in the season.
That didn’t mean the up-and-coming Magic were just going to go away, but neither were the Bulls (23-26).
Anytime the Magic looked to run down the Bulls, a big basket was made.
The Magic cut the Bulls’ lead to five, but Zach LaVine answered with a drive, then, 30 seconds later, Patrick Williams hit a clutch three.

When asked about possibly shutting down injured point guard Lonzo Ball for the rest of the season, he said the team isn’t there yet, but the situation is moving in that direction.
He’s just not.’’Ball was injured more than a year ago and eventually had a second surgery on his left knee.
Ball spoke with the media last week in Paris and wouldn’t rule himself out for the season.

     Bulls' Lonzo Ball 'Nowhere Close' to Return From Knee Injury, HC Billy Donovan Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jonathan Daniel/Getty ImagesChicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball is looking increasingly less likely to appear in a game this season as he continues to recover from a knee injury that has required two surgical procedures.
Ball hasn't appeared in a game since Jan. 14, 2022, when he suffered a meniscus tear in his knee that required arthroscopic surgery.
Following Chicago's first-round playoff loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, Ball told reporters on April 28 that he was "at a standstill" in his recovery and still experiencing pain.
Donovan's comments seem to suggest that Ball won't be returning in the next three weeks before the All-Star Game.
Ball averaged 13.0 points, 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals per game in 35 starts last season.

On Saturday in Orlando, Donovan told reporters that Ball is "nowhere near playing."
And like Ball with his comments from Paris, Donovan acknowledged that time may be running out to salvage this season.
Story continuesBut Ball's season-long absence has thwarted management's desire to see its plan for roster continuity develop.
Ball's impact at both ends over the 35 games he played last season was undeniable.
