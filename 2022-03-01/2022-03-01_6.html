    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Long before it was canon in the comic books, Selina Kyle has oozed bisexuality.
In fact, The Batman may be the most bisexual installment we’ve ever seen in the Batman universe.
“That’s definitely the way I interpreted that, that they had some kind of romantic relationship,” Kravitz says in an interview with Pedestrian.
“[The film is] very true to the character of Selina Kyle.
She’s not yet Catwoman, but all the elements of how she’s going to become Catwoman are there,” Reeves says.

     The DC Movie Zoe Kravitz Almost Starred In Before The Batman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of them includes a part in "The Dark Knight Rises," the final film in Christopher Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy.
In a 2015 story for Nylon magazine, Kravitz revealed that she had been rejected to audition for "The Dark Knight Rises" because she was "too urban" for it.
"In the last Batman movie, they told me that I couldn't get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren't 'going urban,'" she said.
Unlike Kravitz's Selina Kyle, Jen had very little screen time in "The Dark Knight Rises" and wasn't fully explored.
In a turn of events, Kravitz ended up being the voice behind Catwoman in the 2017 movie titled "The Lego Batman Movie," and now has a rather prominent role as the femme fatale in what critics call the best Batman movie of all time.

     Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz team up as Batman and Catwoman in the latest cinematic outing of the famed DC Comics figures for The Batman.
The new direction has Pattinson and Kravitz a little worried about how audiences will respond.
“I feel scared and very excited at the same time but definitely intimidated,” Kravitz told Reuters in an interview.
Robert Pattinson’s Batman has a different silhouette from previous incantations.
In this film, directed by Matt Reeves, he has a much slimmer pointy-eared mask.

During one scene of “The Batman,” Selina Kyle enters her apartment in search of her friend Anika.
Selina calls Anika her “baby,” a somewhat vague descriptor that leaves open the possibility that their relationship is more than just platonic.
“[The film is] very true to the character of Selina Kyle,” “The Batman” director Matt Reeves told Pedestrian.
