It was a pity because in these type of game you have to start and kill your opponent.
If you give them hope, they will take confidence and improve during the game.
"First of all, it is important to say that Middlesbrough played a good game, deserves respect and congratulate them for the win.

     Why Oleksandr Zinchenko Has Been Named Manchester City Captain for FA Cup Clash With Peterborough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oleksandr Zinchenko has captained Manchester City in their Emirates FA Cup fifth-round tie against Peterborough United on Tuesday evening.
Manchester City travel to the Cambridgeshire to secure their place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for a third successive season ahead of a derby meeting with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.
Speaking to ITV ahead of kick-off, Guardiola said: "Our captain (Fernandinho) decided to give the captain's armband to him (Oleksandr Zinchenko), to show how important the situation (in Ukraine) is.
Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Monday, Pep Guardiola confirmed that Zinchenko would start for Manchester City on Tuesday after being an unused substitute at Goodison Park on Saturday.
"I think it will be good for him (Zinchenko) to play and show the reason why he’s here," the 51-year-old said ahead of the FA Cup tie.

     (Reuters) – Riyad Mahrez and Jack Grealish were on target as Premier League leaders Manchester City beat Championship strugglers Peterborough United 2-0 on Tuesday to advance to the FA Cup quarter-finals.
City struggled to break down the second tier’s bottom club until Mahrez put them ahead on the hour and then Pep Guardiola’s side doubled their lead with a goal of prime quality.
Phil Foden struck a ball from deep which Grealish brought down with a sublime touch before a clinical finish for his first goal in the FA Cup.
Jairo Riedewald grabbed an 82nd-minute winner for Crystal Palace at home to second tier Stoke City.
Stoke’s Josh Tymon had cancelled out Cheikhou Kouyate’s 53rd-minute opener for Palace before Riedewald struck.

     Second-tier Middlesbrough is toppling some of English soccer’s biggest clubs in its FA Cup run.
TROPHYLESS SEASONThe defeat ensured it will be another season without a trophy for Tottenham, whose last piece of silverware was the League Cup in 2008.
After a loss at Burnley last week, Tottenham’s often-emotional manager, Antonio Conte, questioned whether he was the right man to lead the team.
Ukraine captain Oleksandr Zinchenko was made captain for the game by City.
James Maddison and Jamie Vardy came off the bench in the 72nd minute and scored the goals for the visitors.

     Spurs, though, were poor, reverting to the clueless bunch who had lost four in five before their weekend reprieve.
Conte came into this game claiming his threats to quit last week were a strategy designed to bring about improvement in his team.
The Spurs boss, rather, was in a huff following defeat at Burnley and only victory at Leeds restored his rationale.
The Championship's bottom side will be hoping to cause a huge shock against the Premier League champions, as will Middlesbrough when they host Tottenham Hotspur.

     Tottenham end season trophy-less after Middlesbrough FA Cup giant killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tottenham's wait for a major trophy stretches on for a 14th year in 2022 as the Premier League side suffered a humbling 1-0 FA Cup away defeat at Championship high flyers Middlesbrough.
Another cup frustration raises more questions about Conte's future in North London as their 2008 League Cup win seems like an eternity ago for Spurs fans.
Spurs' focus is now on securing the highest possible Premier League finish with a European qualification push still on the cards for Conte.
Tottenham are currently seventh in the Premier League with 13 games to go, but they have crucial matches in hand over their rivals.
The FA Cup exit means Spurs' last trophy win remains Juande Ramos's 2008 League Cup (Carabao Cup), with defeats in the 2009, 2015 and 2021 League Cup finals and the 2019 Champions League final.

     Fernandinho refused the Manchester City captaincy on Tuesday night, instead telling his club to give the armband to Oleksandr Zinchenko before he walked out with the Ukrainian flag at Peterborough.
Pep Guardiola described it as a great gesture of support for the 25-year-old left back, whose homeland is under siege from Russian forces.
When City announced their line-up an hour before kick-off, they named Fernandinho as captain.
But the 36-year-old Brazilian told Guardiola he wanted Zinchenko to lead the team.
