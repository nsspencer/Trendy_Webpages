     Takeaways From the Texas Primary Elections
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For nearly a decade, the refrain from Texas Democrats has been that they are on the verge of making their state competitive, even though no Democrat has won a statewide race since 1994.
Tuesday’s primary results illustrated that Democrats still have a long way to go.
With more than three-quarters of the votes counted, nearly 800,000 more Republicans than Democrats voted for a candidate for governor — a gap far larger than the one in 2018, the last midterm primary election in Texas.
To be sure, Republicans had a more competitive primary than Democrats.
And Democrats will be quick to note that primary turnout is not always a predictor of big turnout in November.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (LM Otero/AP/File)Beto O’Rourke will win the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Texas, CNN projects.
O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, was heavily favored to come out on top Tuesday.
O'Rourke shot to stardom with a near-miss Senate campaign in 2018 against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.
But his failed 2020 Democratic presidential primary run left his national brand badly dented in the eyes of many within the party.
Greg Abbott – who was projected by CNN to win his party’s primary on Tuesday night – spent most of his primary campaign attacking O’Rourke, using the Democratic politician’s left-leaning policy proposals as campaign fodder.

     Democrats love to talk up policies they’ll never in a hundred years have the political power to implement.
Democrats are out of power and need to look serious, while Republicans have all the power and so don’t need to look serious.
A pandemic, which was much more fatal here than in peer states such as California, exposed severe weaknesses in the state’s health care system and social safety net.
So, in the past few weeks Ken Paxton and Greg Abbott, who both need to avoid a runoff, took bold action.
Last week, Abbott ordered state agencies to investigate the parents of trans children for child abuse, weeks after Texas attorney general Ken Paxton issued an opinion that gender affirming care for children is such.
