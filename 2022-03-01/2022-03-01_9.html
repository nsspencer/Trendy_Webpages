     Why Oleksandr Zinchenko Has Been Named Manchester City Captain for FA Cup Clash With Peterborough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oleksandr Zinchenko has captained Manchester City in their Emirates FA Cup fifth-round tie against Peterborough United on Tuesday evening.
Manchester City travel to the Cambridgeshire to secure their place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for a third successive season ahead of a derby meeting with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.
Speaking to ITV ahead of kick-off, Guardiola said: "Our captain (Fernandinho) decided to give the captain's armband to him (Oleksandr Zinchenko), to show how important the situation (in Ukraine) is.
Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Monday, Pep Guardiola confirmed that Zinchenko would start for Manchester City on Tuesday after being an unused substitute at Goodison Park on Saturday.
"I think it will be good for him (Zinchenko) to play and show the reason why he’s here," the 51-year-old said ahead of the FA Cup tie.

     Fernandinho hands Oleksandr Zinchenko the captain's armband for FA Cup tie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fernandinho refused the Manchester City captaincy on Tuesday night, instead telling his club to give the armband to Oleksandr Zinchenko before he walked out with the Ukrainian flag at Peterborough.
Pep Guardiola described it as a great gesture of support for the 25-year-old left back, whose homeland is under siege from Russian forces.
When City announced their line-up an hour before kick-off, they named Fernandinho as captain.
But the 36-year-old Brazilian told Guardiola he wanted Zinchenko to lead the team.
