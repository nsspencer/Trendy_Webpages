     Takeaways From the Texas Primary Elections
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For nearly a decade, the refrain from Texas Democrats has been that they are on the verge of making their state competitive, even though no Democrat has won a statewide race since 1994.
Tuesday’s primary results illustrated that Democrats still have a long way to go.
With more than three-quarters of the votes counted, nearly 800,000 more Republicans than Democrats voted for a candidate for governor — a gap far larger than the one in 2018, the last midterm primary election in Texas.
To be sure, Republicans had a more competitive primary than Democrats.
And Democrats will be quick to note that primary turnout is not always a predictor of big turnout in November.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (LM Otero/AP/File)Beto O’Rourke will win the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Texas, CNN projects.
O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2018 and the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, was heavily favored to come out on top Tuesday.
O'Rourke shot to stardom with a near-miss Senate campaign in 2018 against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.
But his failed 2020 Democratic presidential primary run left his national brand badly dented in the eyes of many within the party.
Greg Abbott – who was projected by CNN to win his party’s primary on Tuesday night – spent most of his primary campaign attacking O’Rourke, using the Democratic politician’s left-leaning policy proposals as campaign fodder.

One survey by Hearst Newspapers of Texas GOP congressional candidates found dozens who dispute the outcome of President Joe Biden’s victory.

Democrats have said abortion rights will be a centerpiece of their national strategy in the 2022 midterms, but the issue has not been at the forefront in Texas’ primary.
But this primary is also the first test of a GOP-engineered election overhaul that Texas Republicans muscled through the state Capitol last year.
