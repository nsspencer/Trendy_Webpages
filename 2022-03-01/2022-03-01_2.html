     LAS CRUCES – Ash Wednesday is March 2, signifying the beginning of the 2022 Lenten season which will last six weeks and culminate with Easter Sunday on April 17.
Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists and many other Christians will head to church Wednesday and begin their journey of prayer, fasting and giving alms.
Unlike the previous year, state public health orders concerning COVID-19 will not restrict the number of people allowed inside a church or religious gathering.
However, individual churches are allowed to enforce restrictions as they see fit to protect their congregants.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pastor Hannah Kardon from Urban Village Church said last year, her Methodist congregation mailed ash to people’s home with a prayer and also set up in two locations in the city to distribute it.
This year the church’s members will be at 12 locations across the city in addition to returning to in-person Ash Wednesday services.
But they will continue virtual events and have mailed ash to those who requested it.
“I always found it to be really important to meet people where they’re at,” Kardon said.
A coalition of churches will also observe Ash Wednesday by launching a “40 Days of Peace” campaign in Pilsen.

     “May the Queen of Peace preserve the world from the madness of war,” Pope Francis wrote in his call for fasting.
The ancient Christian practice of fasting allows believers to heighten their senses and focus their spiritual energies, said the Rev.
It’s a way for people to do something concretely.”Other Christian leaders have also called for prayer on Ash Wednesday on behalf of Ukrainians.

“It’s interesting to think, people are latching onto fasting as a way to give them agency,” he said.
