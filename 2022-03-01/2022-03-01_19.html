     Colin Farrell Loved Playing an Uggo in 'The Batman'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No, he didn’t just put on a pair of glasses and adopt a kind of nebbish persona.
It’s Colin Farrell, and they made him ugly to play the Penguin in The Batman.
According to Farrell, all it takes is several hours in the makeup trailer and a can-do attitude.
“I went into Starbucks and ordered myself a very un-Oswald drink, an oat-milk latte with two stevia sweeteners,” Farrell said.
I just felt like I had such license to inhabit a character in a way I had never been given.

     Studio Says No Cigar for Colin Farrell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But despite this movie having a gritty look and plenty of violence, it seems that a cigar proved too controversial to include.
Irish actor Colin Farrell plays The Penguin in the film, and lobbied unsuccessfully to have his character chomp on a cigar.
“Big studios make big decisions around such things as the presence of cigarettes in films,“ Farrell said.
In the comics and other media, the character has also been known to smoke a thick cigar.
Warner Brothers, the studio that holds the rights to the DC Comics characters, was the first major studio to adopt an anti-tobacco policy back in 2005.

     Colin Farrell Says His Son, 12, Is 'Mortified' When His Dad Wears Short ShortsColin Farrell isn't changing his style choices — even if it means embarrassing his son.
During Monday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the 45-year-old actor revealed how his son Henry Tadeusz, 12, reacts when his dad goes out in public wearing short shorts.
"The short shorts — of course you know, you're stylish — are in now," DeGeneres says while showing a photo of Farrell wearing a pair while out for a run.

     Colin Farrell has said that fellow Irish actor and The Batman co-star Barry Keoghan is “an extraordinary human being.”In an interview on RTE 2fm with Stephen Byrne, Farrell said he loves Keoghan.
“I love him to bits.”The pair are currently both appearing in The Batman and recently filmed The Banshees of Inisherin together with Brendan Gleeson.
“We worked on Martin McDonagh’s film out west there last year.”Farrell opened up about what it was like living with the 29-year-old during filming.
And now Barry Keoghan has thrown his hat in the ring.
Keoghan would not be the first Irish Bond star, Navan man Pierce Brosnan played 007 from 2005 to 2015.

     Hollywood star Colin Farrell, who will be seen playing the role of Penguin in the upcoming ‘The Batman’ movie, has talked about what it was about director Matt Reeves’ take on the story that drew him in.
And I had known Matt Reeve’s work from Cloverfield and from Let Me In, and then the Ape films, and Matt’s an extraordinary filmmaker.
“He is one of those rare filmmakers that really, I feel, mixes altruistic brilliance with a sense of commercial entertainment as well.
Farrell said: “I got a call from my agent, just saying did I know they were doing The Batman?
I don’t know if he’s his right-hand man, but if not, he’s pretty close to being his right-hand man.

     Colin Farrell reveals runtime of HBO Max's Penguin TV spin-off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Audio player loading…The Batman star Colin Farrell has suggested that his Penguin TV show could comprise eight episodes.
Speaking exclusively to TechRadar ahead of The Batman's release, Farrell teased that the upcoming TV series may contain as many episodes as Peacemaker, HBO Max's hit Suicide Squad spin-off that starred John Cena.
He's kind of funny, but he's kind of not, but he thinks he is.
No other casting announcements have been made for the Penguin TV spin-off.
The Penguin TV show won't be the only spin-off series from the Dark Knight's latest movie adventure.
