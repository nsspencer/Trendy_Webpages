     What are the Boston Bruins Missing in their Lineup?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s the biggest piece that the Boston Bruins are missing in their lineup?
One of the toughest, grittiest teams in NHL history is the Boston Bruins, but where did they go?
In the 2021-22 season, the Bruins have been one of the softest teams in the league as they lack serious toughness in their lineup.
Boston has always been the team to stir the bee’s nest and wreak havoc throughout games, playing at their pace by setting the tone.
If the Boston Bruins truly want to contend for another Stanley Cup before their window closes (which is dramatically soon), they need to add more toughness on the offense and defense.

     NHL trade deadline: Why Bruins keeping Jake DeBrusk might be best plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Boston Bruins forward Jake DeBrusk's name has been front and center in trade rumors and speculation since his trade request became public in late November, and it seemed that at some point the team would eventually move him.
The Bruins need to bolster their scoring depth to make a deep playoff run.
2 center remains Boston's biggest need before the March 21 trade deadline, but finding another scoring right winger is not far behind.
Of course, there are some downfalls to keeping DeBrusk past the trade deadline.
Should the Bruins trade Jake DeBrusk, who has five goals in three games since joining the top line?

     The Jake DeBrusk situation remains an interesting one for Bruins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)By his own recollection, it’s been almost three years since Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk felt this good about his game.
“Obviously when pucks are going in and production’s there, it feels good,” DeBrusk admitted Monday night in Los Angeles.
Maybe they weren’t kidding when they said the Kraken’s Mason Appleton was the best that the Bruins could fetch for the trade-me-right-effin’-now DeBrusk.
Given the Bruins’ needs (and they have more than one of ’em, which is an important thing to remember), that’s an interesting discussion.
The Bruins and DeBrusk have another three weeks to figure that all out.

     Jake DeBrusk Is The Bruins’ Bellwether
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was one thing when Boston Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk wanted a move away from the team back in November, when he was continuing a sluggish 2020–21 season with a slow start to this one.
“He’s shown a lot of maturity in trying to handle this as appropriately as possible,” Bruins GM Don Sweeney said at the time.
This is the most obvious and comprehensible reason why the whole DeBrusk request is more urgent than it was in November.
2: With 53 games under their belts, coming off back-to-back second-round playoff losses, the Bruins are in kind of a weird spot, big-picture.
Do they play the long game and deal DeBrusk for future assets to a team they could meet in the playoffs in two months?

A leaguewide shutdown followed.The Bruins were out of the top eight in the Eastern Conference.
