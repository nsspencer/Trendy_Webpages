     After Burning for Days, a Ship Carrying Thousands of Luxury Cars Sinks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two weeks after catching fire, a mammoth ship that was transporting thousands of luxury cars sank on Tuesday morning about 253 miles off the Azores, according to the company that managed the vessel.
The ship, the Felicity Ace, went down at about 9 a.m. local time after tilting starboard, plunging about 4,000 cars — including more than 1,000 Porsches and 200 Bentleys — into the sea, according to the company, MOL Ship Management.
Environmental groups had been deeply concerned that the ship would sink and about the pollution it would cause in the unique ecosystem of the Azores, the Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic, where the seabed is covered with coral reefs, coral forests and sponges.
The area is home to sperm whales, blue whales, humpback whales, dolphins and sharks, among other species, according to Oceana, an environmental group.

     Cargo ship carrying luxury cars sinks after massive fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailA cargo ship carrying luxury cars that caught fire in February sunk in the Atlantic Ocean Tuesday despite efforts save it, according to the ship operator.
Why it matters: The risk assessment company Russell Group estimated last week that the fire to the ship could cost Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi and Lamborghini at least $155 million in losses.
The big picture: MOL Ship Management, a unit of Mitsui OSK Lines, said the ship, which was destined for Rhode Island before it caught fire, suffered "a list to starboard" in bad weather and sunk around 220 nautical miles off the coast of Portugal’s Azores Islands Tuesday morning.

     The Portuguese navy confirmed the sinking, saying it occurred outside Portuguese waters.
It wasn't clear how many cars were onboard the ship, but vessels of the Felicity Ace's size can carry at least 4,000 vehicles.
The ship was carrying 2,000 metric tons (2,200 tons) of fuel and 2,000 metric tons (2,200 tons) of oil.
The Portuguese navy said in a statement that only a few pieces of wreckage and a small patch of oil was visible where the ship went down.
A Portuguese Air Force plane and a Portuguese navy vessel are to remain at the scene on the lookout for signs of pollution.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A large cargo ship that was carrying luxury cars from Germany to the U.S. sank Tuesday in the mid-Atlantic — nearly two weeks after a fire broke out on board, according to Portuguese navy officials.
Officials confirmed that the ship, Felicity Ace, lost stability and sank about 250 miles off Portugal's Azores islands as it was being towed to land.
The ship sank in a location outside Portugal's economic zone in an area that's nearly 2 miles deep.
