     Arizona man sentenced to 21 months for threatening to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHOENIX — An Arizona man was sentenced to 21 months in prison last week after being convicted of threatening to kill Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, authorities said.
Steven Arthur Martis, 77, of Bullhead City, will also have three years of supervised release after being released from prison, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona, said in a press release.
He called Speaker Pelosi’s Washington District Office on Jan. 17, 2021, and left two voicemails, authorities said.
Martis in the first voicemail threatened, “I’m coming to kill you…” while in the second voicemail said, “You’re dead…”The FBI prior to the two voicemails had approached and warned Martis about making similar calls in the past, authorities said.
Investigation of the case was conducted by the FBI, with assistance from the United States Capitol Police.

     A member of the US Capitol Police was arrested in connection with a drunken fight in Israel last month while on an advance security detail ahead of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to the Middle East, a report said.
The circumstances of the fight and arrest were unclear, according to the network.
Pelosi and seven other Democrats reaffirmed the United States’ support for Israel in Jerusalem two weeks ago after Iran unveiled long-range missiles capable of hitting the country.

Capitol police told ABC News in a statement they would not be releasing the agent's name since he wasn't charged with a crime and it was a "discipline/personnel matter."

     House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Tuesday that Americans are uninformed about President Biden's agenda and what he has worked to do in the White House, but concluded that those who call the United States home are "blessed" to have him as president.
"With it you can accomplish almost everything, without it, practically nothing," Pelosi said, echoing Lincoln's view on public opinion.
Announced Sunday by Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician, the Capitol lifted its mask requirement on the House floor just days before Biden's speech.
"I'll make my own judgment that I won't be wearing a mask tonight," Pelosi reiterated.
Last week, Pelosi told reporters that it was important for Americans to understand the "brilliance" of Biden's response to the Russian invasion in Ukraine .

     House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was blasted on Twitter Tuesday for suggesting that President Biden is underwater in polling because Americans don’t know what he’s accomplished.
WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 28: U.S President Joe Biden gives remarks at a Black History Month celebration.
In a statement to Fox News, Pelosi Chief of Staff Drew Hammill said the RNC's initial Twitter post represented "desperation."
On the economy, 24% of voters say it is in excellent or good shape, down from 29% earlier in Biden’s term (April 2021).
More than twice as many think the administration’s actions on inflation are hurting rather than helping, and nearly two-thirds say Biden is at least somewhat responsible for rising gas prices .
