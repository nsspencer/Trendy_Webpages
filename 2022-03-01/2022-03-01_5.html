     Celtics' Jaylen Brown exits game vs. Hawks with right ankle sprain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Celtics guard Jaylen Brown suffered a right ankle sprain while driving to the basket early in the first quarter and did not return to Boston’s 107-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
Coach Udoka says Jaylen Brown’s ankle is still a bit sore and swollen after rolling it in the first quarter.
Jaylen wanted to come back and play, but was kept out to be safe.
— Boston Celtics (@celtics) March 2, 2022After the game, Celtics head coach Ime Udoka provided an update on Brown’s condition.
After facing the Grizzlies on Thursday, the Celtics will have three days off before facing the Nets on Sunday.

(Photo by Maddie Malhotra/Getty Images)Despite a lackluster loss to the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night, the Boston Celtics have been putting the NBA on notice, particularly on the defensive end of the basketball court.
But, as good as Smart is defensively, one of his flaws surfaced again during the 21-point loss to the Pacers.
As aggressive and savvy as Smart is with his playmaking and on defense, Perkins suggest he gets on the ref’s good side.
NBA rumors: Celtics sign Matt Ryan to a two-way dealAccording to NBA insider Marc Stein, the Boston Celtics will sign Matt Ryan to a two-way contract, and that’s not THAT Matt Ryan.

With Jayson Tatum stepping up and players like Derrick White and Grant Williams making contribution, the team should be fine.

     Jaylen Brown exits with ankle sprain; Boston Celtics hopeful injury not long term
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jaylen Brown is helped to the locker room after rolling his right ankle on a drive to the hoop.
(0:33)BOSTON -- Celtics coach Ime Udoka said after Boston's 107-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden on Tuesday night that he is optimistic Jaylen Brown's right ankle sprain won't keep him out long term.
Hawks star Trae Young suffered a left ankle sprain when he landed on Marcus Smart's foot late in the first quarter.
Okongwu appeared to get caught with an accidental elbow from Celtics guard Derrick White early in the second quarter, exiting the game a few seconds later.
The Hawks ruled the second-year forward out for the rest of the contest due to the protocols right before the start of the second half.

Ryan averaged 15.8 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.6 assists, while shooting 38.5 percent from the 3-point line for the G League’s Grand Rapids Gold.
The Celtics had five open roster spots following their collection of moves at the Feb. 10 trade deadline.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Celtics are using that, along with the league’s best defense since the start of December, to take the express elevator up the East standings.
While that’s an issue for another day, it’s fair to salute the Celtics for refusing to crumble and for how they discovered a way to reverse their once-troubled season.
“We took our lumps early, especially with finishing games,” Udoka said.
In the 2021 portion of this season, he had 10 games of 35 or more points … but also seven games of less than 20 points.
“We definitely lost some games we felt like we shouldn’t have lost early in the season,” Brown said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And for the first couple months of this season — indeed, for the last few years — that is exactly what the Boston Celtics were.
The best type of basketball team to be, other than a true championship threat, is one that knows what it is.
“It’s suffocating at times, with our size and versatility” Udoka said after Boston held Sacramento to a high-school score on Jan. 25.
Tatum has managed an effective field-goal percentage of just 49.9 this season — right in line with the league-low number the Celtics yield to their opponents.
Now they’re a team stamped with a new motto: If it’s going to be hard, it’s going to be hard for everybody.
