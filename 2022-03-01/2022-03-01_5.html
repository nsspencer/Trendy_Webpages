     LAS CRUCES – Ash Wednesday is March 2, signifying the beginning of the 2022 Lenten season which will last six weeks and culminate with Easter Sunday on April 17.
Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists and many other Christians will head to church Wednesday and begin their journey of prayer, fasting and giving alms.
Unlike the previous year, state public health orders concerning COVID-19 will not restrict the number of people allowed inside a church or religious gathering.
However, individual churches are allowed to enforce restrictions as they see fit to protect their congregants.

     The season of penance and preparation Christians celebrate prior to Easter begins today with Ash Wednesday.
However, Tonos believes that Lent is the time to give up something that you need out your life altogether.
“Whatever you give up for Lent is something that you need to give up, period.
“Our pope has actually asked us to think about Ukraine and do acts of mercy and spiritual acts for Ukraine,” said Tonos.
If you are looking to observe Ash Wednesday, a good number of local churches are holding services.

     "Many of us have been too busy doing other things that haven't brought us the happiness God wants us to have" — Lent is "the perfect opportunity to deepen our relationship with God."
Lent is a "penitential time" that allows us to better prepare to "enter into the mystery" of Holy Week, Fr.
Rock related Lent to current world events.
"The world is a mess, our society seems adrift and issues related to COVID have made things worse," the priest said.
Rock added, "Many of us have been too busy doing other things that have never brought us the happiness that God wants us to have."
