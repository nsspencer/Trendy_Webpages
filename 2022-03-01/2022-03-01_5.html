     Why Oleksandr Zinchenko Has Been Named Manchester City Captain for FA Cup Clash With Peterborough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oleksandr Zinchenko has captained Manchester City in their Emirates FA Cup fifth-round tie against Peterborough United on Tuesday evening.
Manchester City travel to the Cambridgeshire to secure their place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for a third successive season ahead of a derby meeting with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.
Speaking to ITV ahead of kick-off, Guardiola said: "Our captain (Fernandinho) decided to give the captain's armband to him (Oleksandr Zinchenko), to show how important the situation (in Ukraine) is.
Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Monday, Pep Guardiola confirmed that Zinchenko would start for Manchester City on Tuesday after being an unused substitute at Goodison Park on Saturday.
"I think it will be good for him (Zinchenko) to play and show the reason why he’s here," the 51-year-old said ahead of the FA Cup tie.

     Not since a League Cup win in 2008 have Tottenham lifted a trophy and another hugely disappointing defeat poses further questions over the future of manager Antonio Conte.

“It is early to say something about this.”Teenager Josh Coburn came off the bench to score the only goal with a thumping finish across Hugo Lloris in the 107th minute.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Generally a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield cameos, including Matt Crooks, hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight.
Retaining their composure, Wilder’s players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs seemed content to play very much on the counterattack.
Harry Kane and a full-strength Spurs side could not find a way past Middlesbrough’s solid defence.
Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but was denied by an offside flag.
Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide.

     Fernandinho hands Oleksandr Zinchenko the captain's armband for FA Cup tie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fernandinho refused the Manchester City captaincy on Tuesday night, instead telling his club to give the armband to Oleksandr Zinchenko before he walked out with the Ukrainian flag at Peterborough.
Pep Guardiola described it as a great gesture of support for the 25-year-old left back, whose homeland is under siege from Russian forces.
When City announced their line-up an hour before kick-off, they named Fernandinho as captain.
But the 36-year-old Brazilian told Guardiola he wanted Zinchenko to lead the team.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Spurs, though, were poor, reverting to the clueless bunch who had lost four in five before their weekend reprieve.
Conte came into this game claiming his threats to quit last week were a strategy designed to bring about improvement in his team.
The Spurs boss, rather, was in a huff following defeat at Burnley and only victory at Leeds restored his rationale.
The Championship's bottom side will be hoping to cause a huge shock against the Premier League champions, as will Middlesbrough when they host Tottenham Hotspur.

     Middlesbrough continued their stunning FA Cup run amid dramatic scenes at the Riverside Stadium on Tuesday but it was "typical" Tottenham Hotspur as the Premier League side were knocked out in the FA Cup fifth round.
In front of the Riverside Stadium, it cannot get better than that against a Premier League team," the 19-year-old told BBC Sport.
It is Middlesbrough's second Premier League scalp in a row, having beaten Manchester United on penalties at Old Trafford to reach this stage.
Spurs were so flaky, typical Tottenham."
Former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe called it "massively disappointing" and said Tottenham should have dominated against a side a division below them.
