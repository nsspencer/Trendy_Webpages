     Middlesbrough 1-0 Tottenham: Boro bounces Spurs from FA Cup in ET
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a match that had far more technical difficulties than goals, Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 fell to Middlesbrough in the fifth round of the FA Cup.
The score was tied until the second period of extra time when Boro’s Josh Coburn fired a shot past Hugo Lloris to put the home side ahead.
Tottenham battled hard for an equalizer to force a penalty shootout but couldn’t find a way past keeper Joe Lumley.
This was the second consecutive Premier League team that Boro has defeated in this competition after they dispatched Manchester United in penalties a few weeks ago.
Tottenham rolled out the exact same lineup against Championship side Boro as they did in last weekend’s away win at Leeds United, hoping for a similar result.

     Middlesbrough vs Tottenham live score updates: FA Cup latest as Chris Wilder's side cause another upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Middlesbrough caused another FA Cup upset as the Championship outfit booked their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Tottenham at the Riverside.
The game started evenly but both sides struggled to create any clear-cut chances before the half-time break with neither team able to register a shot on target.
The intensity of the game went up a level after the interval as both sides created opportunities to score.
It was Middlesbrough who almost took the lead 10 minutes after the break as Matt Crooks fired a header over the bar, having been unmarked inside the box.
Chris Wilder's side are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Tottenham's long trophy drought continues.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oleksandr Zinchenko has captained Manchester City in their Emirates FA Cup fifth-round tie against Peterborough United on Tuesday evening.
Manchester City travel to the Cambridgeshire to secure their place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for a third successive season ahead of a derby meeting with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.
Speaking to ITV ahead of kick-off, Guardiola said: "Our captain (Fernandinho) decided to give the captain's armband to him (Oleksandr Zinchenko), to show how important the situation (in Ukraine) is.
Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Monday, Pep Guardiola confirmed that Zinchenko would start for Manchester City on Tuesday after being an unused substitute at Goodison Park on Saturday.
"I think it will be good for him (Zinchenko) to play and show the reason why he’s here," the 51-year-old said ahead of the FA Cup tie.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Generally a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield cameos, including Matt Crooks, hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight.
Retaining their composure, Wilder’s players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs seemed content to play very much on the counterattack.
Harry Kane and a full-strength Spurs side could not find a way past Middlesbrough’s solid defence.
Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but was denied by an offside flag.
Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide.

     Spurs, though, were poor, reverting to the clueless bunch who had lost four in five before their weekend reprieve.
Conte came into this game claiming his threats to quit last week were a strategy designed to bring about improvement in his team.
The Spurs boss, rather, was in a huff following defeat at Burnley and only victory at Leeds restored his rationale.
The Championship's bottom side will be hoping to cause a huge shock against the Premier League champions, as will Middlesbrough when they host Tottenham Hotspur.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fernandinho refused the Manchester City captaincy on Tuesday night, instead telling his club to give the armband to Oleksandr Zinchenko before he walked out with the Ukrainian flag at Peterborough.
Pep Guardiola described it as a great gesture of support for the 25-year-old left back, whose homeland is under siege from Russian forces.
When City announced their line-up an hour before kick-off, they named Fernandinho as captain.
But the 36-year-old Brazilian told Guardiola he wanted Zinchenko to lead the team.

We preview the remaining fifth-round games...Henri Lansbury and Elijah Adebayo are hoping to be fit for Luton's FA Cup clash with Chelsea on Wednesday.
Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku's first FA Cup goal was back in March 2014, in a 4-1 defeat to Arsenal while he was at Everton.
West Ham have never lost to Southampton in the FA Cup, winning three and drawing three of their six meetings.
Liverpool have already beaten Norwich three times in all competitions this season, twice in the Premier League and once in the League Cup - they've never beaten a team four times in a single season across league, FA Cup and League Cup.
