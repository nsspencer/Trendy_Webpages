     Sam Elliott criticizes 'The Power of the Dog'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sam Elliott slammed the Oscar-nominated film "The Power of the Dog" in an interview with Marc Maron on his podcast "WTF."
Elliott, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in "A Star Is Born" and stars in the Paramount+ Western series "1883," bristled when Maron asked him on Monday's podcast whether he liked "The Power of the Dog."
“You want to talk about that piece of s--t?” Elliott said when Maron brought up the Netflix film.
Elliott likened the cowboys in “The Power of the Dog” to Chippendales dancers.
Representatives for Netflix, Campion and Elliott did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

     It’s fun when a celebrity just totally steps in it.
It seems to happen rarely these days, outside of celebrities who are active on social media, but that’s one thing that the podcast boom has been good for.
So, apologies if you have any particular fondness for generally lovable cowboy man Sam Elliott, because he stepped in it.
AdvertisementIt happened on this week’s episode of Marc Maron’s WTF podcast (via IndieWire), during which Maron asked Elliott—who currently stars on Yellowstone prequel 1883—if he liked Jane Campion’s Oscar-nominated The Power Of The Dog.
So that raises the question: What’s different about Sergio Leone making his movies in Italy and Jane Campion making this movie in New Zealand?

     Sam Elliott Rails Against “Piece of Shit” Movie The Power of the Dog
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That would be frequent Western headliner Sam Elliott, who made his many, many feelings about The Power of the Dog known on a recent episode of WTF With Marc Maron.
It all began when comedian Marc Maron asked Elliott if he’d seen the film, which was recently nominated for a field-leading 12 Oscars.
“That’s what all these fuckin’ cowboys in that movie looked like,” Elliott replied.
There’s all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the fuckin’ movie.” Maron replied, “Yeah, I think that’s what the movie’s about.” (Benedict Cumberbatch’s character, Phil Burbank, is a closeted homosexual man.)
“But what the fuck does this woman from down there, New Zealand, know about the American West?

     Can someone explain to Sam Elliott what The Power of the Dog is about – and what movies are?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The episode’s guest, Sam Elliott, rumbles on amiably about all manner of subjects, and he seems to be building a genuine rapport with Maron.
And then, almost as a closing afterthought, Maron asks Elliott: “Did you see Power of the Dog?”And then everything went to hell.
Maron laughs a stunned “Oh no”, and then Elliott proceeds to give the weirdest take on a film that may have ever been spoken aloud.
First, it’s slightly ridiculous to assume that a forcefield is in place across the entire American west that sucks the gayness out of anyone who crosses it.
Imagine the rage when he realises that Robert Downey Jr didn’t actually go into space in those Avengers movies.

     Western film icon Sam Elliott is being spit-roasted online after railing on Jane Campion’s 12-time Oscar-nominated drama “The Power of the Dog” for including “allusions to homosexuality” and other LGBTQ themes.
“They’re all running around in chaps and no shirts,” Sam Elliott ranted.
And every f – – king time he would walk in from somewhere — he never was on a horse, maybe once — he’d walk into the f – – king house, storm up the f – – king stairs, go lay in his bed in his chaps and play his banjo,” he said.
Sam Elliott reinforces the whole message of the film in accidental endorsement of Power of the Dog,” another wrote.
When asked if he thought it denigrated the cowboy, Elliott responded, “I do not think it’s anti-cowboy.

“I mean, Cumberbatch never got out of his fucking chaps.
Despite his feelings on the modern Western, Elliott concluded by admitting he took his criticisms of the film personally.
