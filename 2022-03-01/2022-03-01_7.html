    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If the season ended today, the Raptors and Nets would battle in the Play-In Tournament for the Eastern Conference's No.
The Nets were the favorites to win it all heading into the season, but things haven't exactly gone as planned.
Basically, there's no knowing what Nets team the Raptors would be facing in the Play-In.
Harris is one of the league's best 3-point shooters and gives a Nets team that's light on wings some size.
The icing on the cake is the Nets are 2-1 against the Raptors this season despite not having their full roster available.
