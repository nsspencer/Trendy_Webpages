     Boebert heckled Biden about deaths in Afghanistan while he mentioned his son's cancerEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesColorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert heckled President Biden during his State of the Union speech as he was describing the death of his son Beau Biden, an Iraq War veteran who succumbed to brain cancer.
Biden outlined the severe medical symptoms that U.S. troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan endured from breathing in toxic fumes from "burn pits," saying many of the troops developed "a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin."
Thirteen of them," Boebert then yelled, referring to the terrorist attack at a gate outside the Kabul airport last summer that killed 13 U.S. service members.
Biden appeared to look in the direction of Boebert but continued with his remarks, saying that one of those killed by cancer "was my son, Major Beau Biden."
He acknowledged he didn't know if exposure to the fumes led to Beau's cancer but added he was committed to investigating any links.

Boebert was apparently referencing the 13 service members who died during the U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan last year.
But I am committed to find out everything we can.”Boebert was dressed in a shawl that read “Drill Baby Drill” printed on it.

“When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best-trained warriors were never the same,” Biden said.
