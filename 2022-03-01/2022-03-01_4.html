     Foundation for Women Warriors CEO discusses upcoming events for Women’s History Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Vista-based Foundation for Women Warriors heads into Women’s History Month in March with a series of events to raise awareness for the issues facing women veterans and their families.
“Our mission is to serve women veterans and their children so their next mission is clearer and continues to impact the world,” said Jodie Grenier, the CEO of the foundation.
A marine veteran, Grenier served in the United States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2005, after joining out of high school.
She served two deployments to Iraq back to back, and then went to Iraq and Afghanistan from 2009-11 as a contractor.
The organization typically serves about 1,000 women and children each year, mostly in San Diego County.

     Erie County's Trailblazing Women Monument Project pays tribute to female pioneers in WNY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BUFFALO, N.Y. — Currently, Erie County cites just two public monuments to women in Buffalo, but a group is trying to change that.
The Erie County Commission on the Status of Women and a steering committee are behind an effort to pay tribute to some of Western New York's women trailblazers.
The steering committee members are women with a background in education, public art curation, and of course, women's history.
We also have a pretty significant population of Native Americans in Erie County, so for that reason, I think it's critically important that we are included.
They will be placed outside the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library downtown — in the shadow of the Lafayette Hotel, which was one of Bethune's projects.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas women in particular have made significant contributions to this legacy.
Texas women claim many firsts—like Mary Austin Holley, who wrote the first English book about Texas in the 1830s.
Countless other Texas women across the Lone Star State serve as elected and appointed officials, playing an important role in both government and their communities.
At this time, I encourage all Texans to join me in honoring the women of the Lone Star State and recognizing their accomplishments.
Therefore, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, do hereby proclaim March 2022, to be Women’s History Month in Texas and urge the appropriate recognition whereof.

     Why the U.S. celebrates Women’s History Month every March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Women’s history becomes an academic disciplineIn the mid-20th century, a burgeoning women’s rights movement begged to differ with the “great man” theory of history.
“This is garbage, this is not the world I have experienced.”Lerner began teaching women’s history in the late 1960s and eventually joined colleagues at Sarah Lawrence who were creating the nation’s first master’s degree program in women’s history.
The group quickly coalesced into the National Women’s History Project (now the National Women’s History Alliance).
In 1999, a national women’s history commission created by President Bill Clinton recommended initiatives to find “hidden women” in museums and archives, establish statewide women’s history initiatives, and incorporate women’s history more extensively in educational curricula.
A 2017 survey by the National Women’s History Museum found that state educational standards overemphasize women’s domestic roles and overlook the breadth and depth of women’s history.

ABOUT WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTHWomen’s History Month had its origins as a national celebration in 1981 when Congress passed Pub.
L. 97-28 which authorized and requested the President to proclaim the week beginning March 7, 1982 as “Women’s History Week.” Throughout the next five years, Congress continued to pass joint resolutions designating a week in March as “Women’s History Week.” In 1987 after being petitioned by the National Women’s History Project, Congress passed Pub.
L. 100-9 which designated the month of March 1987 as “Women’s History Month.” Between 1988 and 1994, Congress passed additional resolutions requesting and authorizing the President to proclaim March of each year as Women’s History Month.
