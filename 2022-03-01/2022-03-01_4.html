     After scathing report, NCAA makes changes for March Madness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     UNDATED (AP)- A year after the NCAA got called out for gender inequities between its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, the organization has made changes over the past six months to make the events more equitable.
Many of the changes so far have been relatively easy to do.
The women’s tournament field expanded to 68 teams and also will use the phrase “March Madness” in branding and social media.
The NCAA has spent millions more on the women’s tournament this year to make it more financially equal to the men.

     Hulu New Releases: March 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     March 2022 is a great month for blonde women with cold, dead stares on Hulu.
With its list of new releases for March 2022, Hulu is highlighting two major original series ripped straight from the headlines.
Hulu is certainly hoping its version is the definitive one.
There aren’t many films of note this month though Deep Water promises to be an interesting, if awkward watch.
This sexual thriller stars the former couple Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas and premieres on March 18.

     In like a lion, out like a lamb? Understanding the March folklore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (NEXSTAR) – You may have heard the saying “If March comes in like a lion, it will go out like a lamb.” But where does it come from?
According to the Farmers’ Almanac, the weather folklore stems from ancestral beliefs in balance, meaning if the weather at the start of March was bad (roaring, like a roaring lion), the month should end with good weather (gentle, like a lamb).
The Paris Review outlines a few origin theories for the March folklore, including an astronomical connection.
“Jesus’s first appearance was as the sacrificial lamb, but he will return as the Lion of Judah, hence those symbolic animals,” The Guardian writes.
Not sure if March will come in like a lion or a lamb where you live?

     NCAA Projects LSU Women As No. 2 Seed For March Madness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BATON ROUGE – Fourteen days from Selection Sunday, the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Committee projected LSU as a No.
As a top-16 seed, LSU would host first and second round games in the PMAC.
The announcement was made during halftime of the Baylor and Iowa State game, the two respective No.
Baylor won that game by over 20 points which would likely cause Iowa State to drop.

     NCAA Tournament countdown: Five March Madness bubble teams sweating the most
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With one week left in the regular season before conference tournaments begin, every game for bubble teams will be scrutinized by the NCAA tournament men's basketball selection committee.
1 seed after wild weekendA look at the five bubble teams seating it out the most on the first day of March.
MemphisThe Tigers (17-9, 11-5 American Athletic Conference) have won eight of their last nine, which is the late-season recipe for any bubble team to hear its name called on Selection Sunday.
Memphis is in the mix right next to fellow AAC bubble team SMU, which it lost to twice this season.
The Gators need to beat the Wildcats or stage a deep run in the SEC tourney to be among the 68 NCAA tournament teams.

     Dribble Handoff: March has arrived and our college basketball experts have bold predictions for the next month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In college basketball, it's the best way to describe the entire month of March and what happens in the actual games.
Assuming the Gaels don't slip up in the conference tournament, they'll be in the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year.
The ACC teams in position to make the Big Dance are teams with likable traits (for the most part).
Fellow coaching legends Jim Boeheim at Syracuse and Leonard Hamilton at Florida State are also aging and will need miraculous runs through the ACC Tournament to even reach the NCAA Tournament.
But the league should have a better winning percentage in this NCAA Tournament than it did while posting a 4-7 mark in last year's event.
