     Zain Nadella, son of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, dies at age 26
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Microsoft Corp. said Zain Nadella, son of Chief Executive Officer Satya and his wife, Anu, died Monday morning.
The software maker told its executive staff in an email that Zain had passed away.
The message asked executives to hold the family in their thoughts and prayers while giving them space to grieve privately.
Since taking on the CEO role in 2014, Satya Nadella focused the company on designing products to better serve users with disabilities and cited lessons he had learned raising and supporting Zain.
Last year, Seattle Children’s hospital, where Zain received much of his treatment, joined with the Nadellas to establish the Zain Nadella Endowed Chair in Pediatric Neurosciences, as part of Seattle Children’s Center for Integrative Brain Research.

     Zain Nadella, the son of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, has died, the company confirmed Tuesday.
"Very sadly Satya’s son Zain Nadella has passed away," the company said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.
Zain Nadella was born with cerebral palsy, was legally blind and had spastic quadriplegia, according to a 2021 story from Seattle Children's Hospital, where he received care.
Satya Nadella said Zain would require the use of a wheelchair along with constant care because of cerebral palsy, according to an excerpt from his book, "Hit Refresh."
In the post, Satya Nadella said Zain's life had inspired him to push Microsoft to make accessibility a key priority.
