     LAS CRUCES – Ash Wednesday is March 2, signifying the beginning of the 2022 Lenten season which will last six weeks and culminate with Easter Sunday on April 17.
Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists and many other Christians will head to church Wednesday and begin their journey of prayer, fasting and giving alms.
Unlike the previous year, state public health orders concerning COVID-19 will not restrict the number of people allowed inside a church or religious gathering.
However, individual churches are allowed to enforce restrictions as they see fit to protect their congregants.

     What Is Ash Wednesday? The Meaning Behind the Christian Holy Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today marks the annual Ash Wednesday observance, a prominent date for many Christians across the globe.
The day gets its name from early Christian traditions held to honor the date, as believers would practice public penance and be sprinkled in ashes in order to seek forgiveness from God.
Traditionally, the ashes are made by burning psalm leaves from the previous year's celebration and symbolize death, repentance and purification.
Ash Wednesday During COVIDLast year, traditional Ash Wednesday proceedings were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as social distancing obligations worldwide forbade the usual drawing of the cross on worshiper's foreheads.
Churches are offering a number of alternatives such as making the imposition of ashes optional, providing at-home ashing, the option to draw the ash cross on oneself, or q-tip drawn crosses.

     Why Christians wear ashes for Ash Wednesday and give up their favorite things for Lent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Ash Wednesday, you may encounter Christians, especially Catholics, wearing a smudge of ashes on their foreheads.
The six-week Lenten period culminates with Easter, when Christians believe Jesus died and was resurrected.
Ash Wednesday – officially known as the Day of Ashes – is a day of repentance, when Christians confess their sins and profess their devotion to God.
Ash Wednesday is important because it marks the start of the Lenten period leading up to Easter, when Christians believe Jesus was resurrected.
Early Christians in Rome were sprinkled with ashes during Lent, but the Ash Wednesday practice of placing ashes on the forehead of Christians didn't begin until the Middle Ages.

     Catholic Students Look Forward to Ash Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Catholic Students Look Forward to Ash WednesdayOne writer looks into how students celebrate Ash Wednesday on campus.
Father Tim Danaher at Aquinas House, Dartmouth’s Catholic Student Center, acknowledges the anxiety that accompanies the bleak Lenten season.
Spiritual leaders want to make these traditions accessible for students, regardless of their schedules or other time commitments.
After attending Catholic school my entire life, it is jarring to not have a school-designated time to observe these events.
Dartmouth acknowledges that students may have religious commitments and that time off may be necessary, but I am still conflicted.
