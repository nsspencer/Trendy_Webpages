His three daughters have been identified as 9-year-old Samarah Mora Gutierrez, 10-year-old Samantha Mora Gutierrez, and 13-year-old Samia Mora Gutierrez.

     Man in Sacramento church shooting prohibited from having gunSACRAMENTO — A man who was under a restraining order and not supposed to have a gun fatally shot his three daughters, a chaperone and himself during a supervised visit with the girls at a California church, officials said Tuesday.
Ortega said she knew little about the non-demoninational church named The Church in Sacramento and said it’s busy on Sundays but mostly quiet during the week.
The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office has offered few details about the shooting inside the church, which sits on a mostly residential block near a commercial area east of downtown Sacramento.
After the shooting, California Gov.
Gavin Newsom tweeted: “Another senseless act of gun violence in America — this time in our backyard.
