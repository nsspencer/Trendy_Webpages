     Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa uses G.O.P. response to blast Biden over ‘runaway inflation.’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Reynolds of Iowa delivered a scathing Republican rebuke of President Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, casting his presidency as an unwanted remake of “That ‘70s Show,” complete with “runaway inflation,” rampant crime and a rampaging “Soviet army.”Ms. Reynolds, who was chosen by Republican Senate leadership to deliver the party’s official response, portrayed the populist revolt against mask mandates and remote learning as a “pro-parent, pro-family revolution,” hoping to harness the backlash ahead of this year’s midterm elections.
The governor, who has been in that office since 2017, used her address to preview themes, poll-tested and echoed by conservatives on social media, that are likely to be repeated by Republican candidates across the country as they seek to seize control of Congress two years after the party lost the White House and Senate.
That included stoking fears that the Biden administration — and Democrats — want to control what children can learn in school and whether parents should have a say.
“We are tired of politicians who tell parents they should sit down, be silent and let government control their kids’ education and future,” she said.

     Republicans Are Trying to Send a Message
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 62-year-old governor of Iowa delivered the official Republican response to Joe Biden’s State of the Union address from outside the capitol in Des Moines.
By selecting Reynolds to deliver the State of the Union response, GOP leaders are hoping to send a message to America’s swing voters: Not all Republicans are off-the-deep-end election-fraud conspiracists, they’re trying to say.
So Republicans want to be thoughtful about their message.
In her response, Reynolds condemned mask mandates, vaccine requirements, and school closures that have prevented children from attending in-person classes.
Republicans see Reynolds as a kind of fusion politician who can appeal to moderates and Trump fanatics alike, someone who won’t scare off the swing voters Republicans need to sweep back into power in November.

     Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds criticizes Biden over inflation, crime in GOP response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As Biden did in his speech, she praised Ukraine's staunch defense while assailing the "tyranny" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Reynolds, who wore twin U.S. and Ukrainian flag pins on her red jacket, didn't explicitly fault Biden's handling of Russia's assault.
Reynolds said Biden and congressional Democrats are pushing up inflation through rampant spending.
Reynolds appeared at a rally in Iowa last year at which Trump again claimed falsely that he won the 2020 election.
"It's important to appreciate that the risk is just as high as the reward," said Brendan Buck, a former House Republican leadership aide.

     Gov. Reynolds presents ‘an alternative’ to Democratic policies in State of the Union response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Reynolds emphasized the importance of personal freedom and presented Iowa’s approach to the economy and COVID-19 as “an alternative” to Democratic policies during her nationally televised GOP response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address.
On behalf of Republicans, she criticized Biden’s approach to crises in Ukraine and Afghanistan.
Biden said the U.S. and its allies were enforcing “powerful economic sanctions.”“We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine,” Biden said.
Reynolds criticizes high inflation and spending proposalsThe U.S. inflation rate was 7.5% in February – a record-high in recent history.
Reynolds said inflation was “an everybody problem,” comparing it to the inflation of the 1980s, when the inflation rate peaked above 14%.
