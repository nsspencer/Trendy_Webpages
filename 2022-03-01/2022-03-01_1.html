     The Food Guy: Paczki ‚Äì A Fat Tuesday Tradition in Chicago's Polish Community
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And while a Jefferson Park bakery fries them up year-round, they're especially in high demand on Fat Tuesday, appropriately referred to by some as Paczki Day.
"Paczek means one, paczki means many," explained Dobra Bielinski, who runs the Delightful Pastries bakery along with her family.
Bielinski says the tradition of paczki stems from a medieval Polish king.
Bielinski says the days leading up to Fat Tuesday are like her own sort of Polish, fried, sweet Super Bowl.
The community will typically stop coming after Fat Tuesday because they‚Äôre fasting, but since Delightful Pastries continues to make paczki year-round, Dolinsky says you‚Äôre in luck if you happen to miss March 1.

     Fat Tuesday: What to know about the unofficial start of Lent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (NEXSTAR) ‚Äì The Lenten season is here for Christians and the unofficial first day has arrived: Fat Tuesday.
Fat Tuesday ‚Äì otherwise known by its French name, Mardi Gras ‚Äì is the last day before Lent begins on March 2, or Ash Wednesday, according to the Christian calendar.
As a last hurrah before fasting for the six weeks of Lent, Fat Tuesday is usually marked by celebrations and indulgence.
Mandelkow points to the U.K., where the day is called Pancake Day, and German and Polish communities, which refer to it as Faschnaut Day or Paczki Day, respectively (Both Faschnaut and Paczki are words for doughnut).
So eat your paczki, enjoy your cheese, wear your beads, and prepare for Ash Wednesday‚Äôs fast.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LANSING ‚Äî Loretta Wroblewski moved from Lansing to New Lenox this year, but there's still something that draws her back: the paczki at Calumet Bakery.
"I always come here and get cakes and pastries, pies, everything," Loretta Wroblewski said.
But Calumet Bakery, which opened on Chicago's South Side in 1935, is still going strong.
Gant likes the variety of paczki ‚Äî Calumet Bakery lists 23 different versions on its menu board for $1.50 or $1.85 each, ranging from strawberry, raspberry and lemon to custard and chocolate mousse.
Though it's 87 years old, Calumet Bakery is keeping up with the times.
