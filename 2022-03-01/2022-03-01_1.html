     Meet the Carefree Queens of Mardi Gras - The New York Times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The short documentary above celebrates womanhood by spotlighting the baby dolls — one of the earliest Mardi Gras traditions established by Black women.
Segregated during Mardi Gras, Black Americans created their own traditions, including the baby dolls, who wore ornate dresses and carried decorated umbrellas.
I became intrigued by the dolls while studying at Xavier University of Louisiana, by how this group of women gave themselves permission to be free.
Masking traditions like these are a way of setting oneself free in the hope of coming closer to one’s most authentic self.
The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following a year of canceled festivities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mardi Gras celebrations are returning in full force to Louisiana.
What is Mardi Gras?
However, the very first Mardi Gras celebration to be held on American soil took place in Mobile, Alabama in 1703.
Mardi Gras 2022 Schedule and Parade DetailsFestivities for Mardi Gras officially kicked off on January 6, and parades have been marching through New Orleans sporadically for the past number of weeks.
Some of the popular and staple foods eaten during Mardi Gras include King Cake, a rich cake that often comes with a hidden baby toy in it which is meant to represent baby Jesus.

Who better to make a few Mardi Gras meals with on Fat Tuesday than Toups himself?
During Mardi Gras, we cut these po'boys up into small sandwiches and bring them out with us on the parade routes to keep us satiated throughout the festivities.

I’d rather miss Christmas than Mardi Gras," a man calling himself Bo Ski Love said as he waited for the parade with his son.
He said he loves just about everything about Mardi Gras: the crowds, the atmosphere, the people, the happiness.
“Also the coronavirus was sort of looming over us,” even though its presence wasn't yet known in New Orleans, Houston said.
In other parts of town the Mardi Gras Indian tribes will be coming out after spending months working on their intricately beaded costumes.
