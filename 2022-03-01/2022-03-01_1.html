     WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH KICKOFF EVENT USC kicks off the monthlong commemoration with a universitywide event featuring President Carol L. Folt faculty, staff, students, alumni and community members.
“Women’s History Month reminds us that women have made great progress despite so many challenges.”But Karen Tongson notes that progress isn’t measured in a straight line.
Just days ago, President Joe Biden delivered on a campaign promise to nominate a Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Women’s History Month shows us the different sacrifices our forebears have made,” said Tongson, the chair of the Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies at USC Dornsife.
We can use that example to fortify our efforts to change and transform our roles and to make things better — to make what seemed impossible, achievable.”More stories about: Faculty, Women's History Month

     Why the U.S. celebrates Women’s History Month every March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Women’s history becomes an academic disciplineIn the mid-20th century, a burgeoning women’s rights movement begged to differ with the “great man” theory of history.
“This is garbage, this is not the world I have experienced.”Lerner began teaching women’s history in the late 1960s and eventually joined colleagues at Sarah Lawrence who were creating the nation’s first master’s degree program in women’s history.
The group quickly coalesced into the National Women’s History Project (now the National Women’s History Alliance).
In 1999, a national women’s history commission created by President Bill Clinton recommended initiatives to find “hidden women” in museums and archives, establish statewide women’s history initiatives, and incorporate women’s history more extensively in educational curricula.
A 2017 survey by the National Women’s History Museum found that state educational standards overemphasize women’s domestic roles and overlook the breadth and depth of women’s history.
