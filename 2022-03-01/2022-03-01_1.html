     New Orleans Hosts Its 1st Full-Dress Mardi Gras Since 2020
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     People are out to party as New Orleans’ first full-dress Mardi Gras since 2020 dawns Tuesday, with a day of back-to-back parades through the city and masks against COVID-19 required only in indoor public spaces.
Parade routes are shorter than usual, because there aren't enough police for the standard ones, even with officers working 12-hour shifts as they always do on Mardi Gras and the end of the Carnival season leading up to it.
But “2020 was weird,” Houston said, because two people were hit by floats and killed in the week leading up to Mardi Gras and the mayor suspended use of multiple floats hitched behind one tractor.
“Also the coronavirus was sort of looming over us,” even though its presence wasn't yet known in New Orleans, Houston said.
After that are the Krewe of Elks and the Krewe of Orleans, a not-quite-endless stretch of homemade floats on long flatbed trailers.

What is Mardi Gras?
However, the very first Mardi Gras celebration to be held on American soil took place in Mobile, Alabama in 1703.
Mardi Gras 2022 Schedule and Parade DetailsFestivities for Mardi Gras officially kicked off on January 6, and parades have been marching through New Orleans sporadically for the past number of weeks.
Some of the popular and staple foods eaten during Mardi Gras include King Cake, a rich cake that often comes with a hidden baby toy in it which is meant to represent baby Jesus.

And over the last week and a half, the city's beloved high school bands have returned to the streets.
While band culture is still big in New Orleans, band directors say it's been stunted in recent years, and the pandemic didn't make things any better.
That's because Mardi Gras parades are one of the most important recruitment opportunities bands have.
