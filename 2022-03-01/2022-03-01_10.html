     Zoë Kravitz Says Her Catwoman Is Bisexual in 'The Batman'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Recently, Kravitz spoke with the Australian entertainment magazine Pedestrian, and revealed that she envisioned her character as queer.
According to the actress, it seemed like Catwoman was romantically linked to her friend Anika, though it’s never explicitly stated.
During one scene in The Batman, Catwoman walks into her apartment and calls out for Anika, referring to her as “baby.” It could mean nothing, but it could also definitely mean something, right?
Matt Reeves, who directed The Batman, also provided his perspective on Catwoman’s sexuality in The Batman.
She’s not yet Catwoman, but all the elements of how she’s going to become Catwoman are there,” he said.

     Zoë Kravitz says she 'interpreted' Catwoman as bisexual in 'The Batman'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zoë Kravitz is the latest actor to take on the role of Catwoman, starring opposite Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne in “The Batman.” Kravitz recently told Australia’s Pedestrian that she interpreted her Catwoman as bisexual in the film.
During one scene of “The Batman,” Selina Kyle enters her apartment in search of her friend Anika.
Selina calls Anika her “baby,” a somewhat vague descriptor that leaves open the possibility that their relationship is more than just platonic.
The film's director, Matt Reeves, told Pedestrian the film is "very true to the character of Selina Kyle."
“She’s not yet Catwoman, but all the elements of how she’s going to become Catwoman are there," he said.

     The DC Movie Zoe Kravitz Almost Starred In Before The Batman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of them includes a part in "The Dark Knight Rises," the final film in Christopher Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy.
In a 2015 story for Nylon magazine, Kravitz revealed that she had been rejected to audition for "The Dark Knight Rises" because she was "too urban" for it.
"In the last Batman movie, they told me that I couldn't get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren't 'going urban,'" she said.
Unlike Kravitz's Selina Kyle, Jen had very little screen time in "The Dark Knight Rises" and wasn't fully explored.
In a turn of events, Kravitz ended up being the voice behind Catwoman in the 2017 movie titled "The Lego Batman Movie," and now has a rather prominent role as the femme fatale in what critics call the best Batman movie of all time.

     Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz team up as Batman and Catwoman in the latest cinematic outing of the famed DC Comics figures for The Batman.
The new direction has Pattinson and Kravitz a little worried about how audiences will respond.
“I feel scared and very excited at the same time but definitely intimidated,” Kravitz told Reuters in an interview.
Robert Pattinson’s Batman has a different silhouette from previous incantations.
In this film, directed by Matt Reeves, he has a much slimmer pointy-eared mask.
