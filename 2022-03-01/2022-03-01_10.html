     An Analysis of Markelle Fultz’s Return Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO - Considering he hadn’t played in a game in nearly 14 months, Markelle Fultz deserves a high grade for his highly anticipated return performance Monday against the Indiana Pacers.
First and foremost, when Fultz was on the court, the Orlando Magic’s offense was like a well-oiled machine.
A prerequisite for a lead guard, Fultz reads the game well, and makes smart choices with the ball in his hands.
He said leading up to Monday’s return that shooting has been something he has tirelessly worked at the past several months.
Another aspect of his game that he’s heavily focused on is initiating more contact on drives.

     Markelle Fultz makes strong return to game action for Magic in win over Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There have not been too many bright spots for the Orlando Magic this season, but one came on Monday night when Markelle Fultz made his return to game action against the Indiana Pacers after nearly 14 months on the sideline.
Prior to the contest against Indiana, Fultz last played in a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in early January of 2021.
He suffered a torn left ACL in that game and had been on the road to recovery ever since.
In his return game, Fultz played 16 minutes off the bench for Orlando and tallied 10 points, six assists and two rebounds while hitting five of his seven attempts from the floor.
After the game, Fultz detailed his approach to his rehabilitation, and how he managed to remain optimistic throughout the process.

     Maybe Now Markelle Fultz Can Finally Just Play Some Basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Orlando Magic are, at best, the third-worst team in the NBA this season.
But for the other 16 minutes, this otherwise forgettable game marked the triumphant return to action of one Markelle Fultz.
Watch Now on NBA League Pass: https://t.co/oz9UCQxdQa pic.twitter.com/rox2KyGzQn — NBA (@NBA) March 1, 2022Still, this will be a happy blog.
Fultz played eight minutes in each half Monday night and looked very much like a solid NBA player.
He is, for now, no better than the third guard on the Orlando Magic, stuck behind two younger players taken by the Magic in the time since they traded for Fultz, back in 2019.

     Takeaways from Markelle Fultz's much-anticipated return in Orlando
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Markelle Fultz played in an NBA game for the first time in 418 days, returning to the Orlando Magic after a lengthy rehab for a knee injury.
Fultz played 16 minutes in a sizable victory over the Indiana Pacers, finishing with 10 points and 6 assists, going 5 of 7 from the field.
Fultz didn't take a three last night, but he also didn't fully need to, as Orlando schemed to try to make it all about getting to paint and creating.
Fultz's game is so predicated on interior play, so returning without hesitancy is so crucial to his efficacy and confidence.
Overall, this was a really fun game from Fultz, as he demonstrated his feel and court vision.
