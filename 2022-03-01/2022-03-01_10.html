     Zoë Kravitz says she 'interpreted' Catwoman as bisexual in 'The Batman'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zoë Kravitz is the latest actor to take on the role of Catwoman, starring opposite Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne in “The Batman.” Kravitz recently told Australia’s Pedestrian that she interpreted her Catwoman as bisexual in the film.
During one scene of “The Batman,” Selina Kyle enters her apartment in search of her friend Anika.
Selina calls Anika her “baby,” a somewhat vague descriptor that leaves open the possibility that their relationship is more than just platonic.
The film's director, Matt Reeves, told Pedestrian the film is "very true to the character of Selina Kyle."
“She’s not yet Catwoman, but all the elements of how she’s going to become Catwoman are there," he said.

     Zoë Kravitz takes over as the latest version of Selina Kyle in The Batman, but this cat doesn’t just have eyes for bats.
The Warner Bros. film introduces Kravitz, 33, as a young burglar who is just trying to find her missing roommate, Anika.
When Kravitz was directly asked whether Catwoman is bisexual, the Big Little Lies actress confirmed that she assumed Selina and Anika were more than friends.
“That’s definitely the way I interpreted that, that they had some kind of romantic relationship,” Kravitz told Australian outlet Pedestrian.
Director and cowriter Matt Reeves, however, revealed that he wasn’t necessarily thinking about Catwoman as being queer.

Before the premiere of the film, fans already knew Jason was showing up to support with his family, as he and Zoe were spotted getting dinner on Feb. 28 with Nakoa-Wolf, Lola, and Zoe’s beau, Channing Tatum.
Zoe sported a chic brown trench coat, black outfit, and black Yves Saint Laurent bag for the outing while Nakoa-Wolf opted for an outfit that featured his Doc Martens and striped shirt, and Lola went with an animal print look.
“Jason moved back in with Lisa about two weeks ago and they are very much back together,” the pal told us.
