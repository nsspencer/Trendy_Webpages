     Governor Abbott Proclaims March 2022 As Women’s History Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas women in particular have made significant contributions to this legacy.
Texas women claim many firsts—like Mary Austin Holley, who wrote the first English book about Texas in the 1830s.
Countless other Texas women across the Lone Star State serve as elected and appointed officials, playing an important role in both government and their communities.
At this time, I encourage all Texans to join me in honoring the women of the Lone Star State and recognizing their accomplishments.
Therefore, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, do hereby proclaim March 2022, to be Women’s History Month in Texas and urge the appropriate recognition whereof.

ABOUT WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTHWomen’s History Month had its origins as a national celebration in 1981 when Congress passed Pub.
L. 97-28 which authorized and requested the President to proclaim the week beginning March 7, 1982 as “Women’s History Week.” Throughout the next five years, Congress continued to pass joint resolutions designating a week in March as “Women’s History Week.” In 1987 after being petitioned by the National Women’s History Project, Congress passed Pub.
L. 100-9 which designated the month of March 1987 as “Women’s History Month.” Between 1988 and 1994, Congress passed additional resolutions requesting and authorizing the President to proclaim March of each year as Women’s History Month.
This month, Women's History Month, let's celebrate the wonderful women astronauts who have ventured out among the stars.

     In 1865, when she was 16 years old, Maritcha Lyons was denied admission to Providence High School because she was Black.
Anna Atkins, “Porphyra laciniata” (1853-09), currently on view as part of NYPL’s Treasures exhibitionPortraits of Lyons and her sister Pauline, captured using the ambrotype method of early photography, are among the New York Public Library’s (NYPL) highlights for Women’s History Month, beginning today, March 1.

Coblentz, who died in 2021, is the latest to be inducted into NYPL’s “Hall of Femme,” which recognizes women’s trailblazing contributions to librarianship.

     Why the U.S. celebrates Women’s History Month every March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Women’s history becomes an academic disciplineIn the mid-20th century, a burgeoning women’s rights movement begged to differ with the “great man” theory of history.
“This is garbage, this is not the world I have experienced.”Lerner began teaching women’s history in the late 1960s and eventually joined colleagues at Sarah Lawrence who were creating the nation’s first master’s degree program in women’s history.
The group quickly coalesced into the National Women’s History Project (now the National Women’s History Alliance).
In 1999, a national women’s history commission created by President Bill Clinton recommended initiatives to find “hidden women” in museums and archives, establish statewide women’s history initiatives, and incorporate women’s history more extensively in educational curricula.
A 2017 survey by the National Women’s History Museum found that state educational standards overemphasize women’s domestic roles and overlook the breadth and depth of women’s history.
