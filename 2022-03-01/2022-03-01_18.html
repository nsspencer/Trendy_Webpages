     Abbott and O’Rourke Win Their Texas Primaries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Despite overseeing a sharp push to the right in state government over the last year and in the campaign’s closing days — including telling state agencies to investigate treatment for transgender adolescents as “child abuse” — Mr. Abbott faced backlash.
Statewide, Mr. Trump has endorsed more than two dozen candidates, including Mr. Abbott, though most were expected to win before earning his backing.
Texas has a two-step primary system: Any candidate who finishes below 50 percent will face off against the No.
In South Texas, progressives are attempting to defeat one of the last anti-abortion Democrats remaining in Congress, Representative Henry Cuellar, and they received a political gift when the F.B.I.
Falling short under those circumstances would be a blow for the left after Mr. Cuellar narrowly won two years ago.

     Live updates: Texas primary election results and news
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The banner contest on Tuesday revolves around Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.
Like Bush, former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state's high court, is a relative moderate.
The pair clashed in a recent debate, which saw Guzman question Bush's qualifications and Bush denounce Guzman as a "gutter politician."
Hanging over it all, though, are concerns — at least among Democrats and voting rights advocates — about the effect of the state's restrictive new voting rules.
Some larger Texas counties have already reported spikes in ballot rejections because would-be voters did not meet beefed-up and, to many, confusing new identification requirements.

     Here’s what to watch as the Texas primary unfolds:What issues are driving the Texas races?
One survey by Hearst Newspapers of Texas GOP congressional candidates found dozens who dispute the outcome of President Joe Biden’s victory.
READ MORE: Texas primary offers first midterm measure of U.S. political moodThe primary also marks six months since Texas put in place the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S. in nearly 50 years.
Democrats have said abortion rights will be a centerpiece of their national strategy in the 2022 midterms, but the issue has not been at the forefront in Texas’ primary.
But this primary is also the first test of a GOP-engineered election overhaul that Texas Republicans muscled through the state Capitol last year.

     Democrats love to talk up policies they’ll never in a hundred years have the political power to implement.
Democrats are out of power and need to look serious, while Republicans have all the power and so don’t need to look serious.
The moral panic about children took on a seedier, grubbier, more menacing tone as time went on.
So, in the last few weeks Ken Paxton and Greg Abbott, who both need to avoid a runoff, took bold action.
Last week, Abbott ordered state agencies to investigate the parents of trans children for child abuse, weeks after Texas attorney general Ken Paxton issued an opinion that gender affirming care for children is such.

     This is on all of us.”A more competitive race was taking shape in the GOP primary for state attorney general.
Political Cartoons View All 441 ImagesDemocrats, who haven't won statewide office in Texas since 1994, face challenges of their own.
Nine-term U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar is hoping to avoid becoming the first Democratic member of Congress to lose a primary this year.
A 28-year-old immigration attorney who supports Medicare for All, Cisneros nearly toppled Cuellar during Texas' 2020 primary.
Emily Winnenberg, 29, who owns a small business in Dallas, voted in the Democratic primary and said abortion and voting rights were top of mind.
