     Maksim Chmerkovskiy posts about 'traumatizing' exit from Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Maksim Chmerkovskiy has shared that he has made it safely to Poland from his native Ukraine.
In a note posted on his Instagram stories late Monday, Chmerkovskiy wrote that he had made it onto a train bound for Poland.
"The situation at the train station is insane.
At first it feels manageable but it gets a lot worse when it comes time to actually board the train.
Long story but all I can say now is that I'm a big man with nothing but a backpack and it's traumatizing."

     Maksim Chmerkovskiy tells Instagram he's in Poland after fleeing Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "Dancing with the Stars" alum Maksim Chmerkovskiy revealed on Tuesday that the train he's traveling on has made it to Poland after fleeing his native country Ukraine.
While he's crossed the border into Poland by train, the 42-year-old said he was still one and a half hours away from his destination.
The star's latest update follows several others he's shared with fans via social media since first revealing last week that he was in Kyiv when the Russia invasion began.
Chmerkovskiy said in a video shared to his account which appeared to show the packaged food from a tank he said local Ukrainians stole from the Russian army.
"[There’s] a lot of fighting everywhere," Chmerkovskiy said in a video update earlier Monday.
