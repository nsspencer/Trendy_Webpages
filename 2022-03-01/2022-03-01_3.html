If you included the paczki pre-sales, “roughly, you know, 42,000 for the two days,” Callen said.

     Fat Tuesday: What to know about the unofficial start of Lent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (NEXSTAR) – The Lenten season is here for Christians and the unofficial first day has arrived: Fat Tuesday.
Fat Tuesday – otherwise known by its French name, Mardi Gras – is the last day before Lent begins on March 2, or Ash Wednesday, according to the Christian calendar.
As a last hurrah before fasting for the six weeks of Lent, Fat Tuesday is usually marked by celebrations and indulgence.
Mandelkow points to the U.K., where the day is called Pancake Day, and German and Polish communities, which refer to it as Faschnaut Day or Paczki Day, respectively (Both Faschnaut and Paczki are words for doughnut).
So eat your paczki, enjoy your cheese, wear your beads, and prepare for Ash Wednesday’s fast.

     But on a cold March morning in honor of Fat Tuesday, he braved the winter temperatures to get a taste of his first-ever polish pastry.
But where Jake got Boston Cream, Lenny says the berries are the best flavor, following by a lemon and an apple.
Fat Tuesday is Paczki day, and the line out the door of the New Martha Washington Bakery in Hamtramck stretched well out the doors of the business.
Although custard, lemon, and Boston Cream are popular variations as well, the traditional filling is prune.
Besides New Martha Washington Bakery, there's also New Palace Bakery, and Paris Bakery in Livonia.
