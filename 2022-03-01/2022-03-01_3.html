     LAS CRUCES – Ash Wednesday is March 2, signifying the beginning of the 2022 Lenten season which will last six weeks and culminate with Easter Sunday on April 17.
Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists and many other Christians will head to church Wednesday and begin their journey of prayer, fasting and giving alms.
Unlike the previous year, state public health orders concerning COVID-19 will not restrict the number of people allowed inside a church or religious gathering.
However, individual churches are allowed to enforce restrictions as they see fit to protect their congregants.

     Lent is a solemn period of time to reflect on our lives and to remember the death and resurrection of Jesus at Easter.
“It’s not like a New Year’s resolution,” the reverend said of the common way some Christians “give up” something at Lent.
St. Francis of Assisi Church, 227 E. Cherokee Street, will hold Ash Wednesday mass at 12:10 and 6 p.m., and both will include distribution of ashes.
First United Methodist Church will hold a traditional Ash Wednesday service at 5:30 p.m. at its location on 215 W Cherokee.
New Hope United Methodist Church, 2216 Highway 550 NW, will hold its Ash Wednesday service at 6 p.m.

     "Many of us have been too busy doing other things that haven't brought us the happiness God wants us to have" — Lent is "the perfect opportunity to deepen our relationship with God."
Lent is a "penitential time" that allows us to better prepare to "enter into the mystery" of Holy Week, Fr.
Rock related Lent to current world events.
"The world is a mess, our society seems adrift and issues related to COVID have made things worse," the priest said.
Rock added, "Many of us have been too busy doing other things that have never brought us the happiness that God wants us to have."

     “May the Queen of Peace preserve the world from the madness of war,” Pope Francis wrote in his call for fasting.
It’s a way for people to do something concretely.”Other Christian leaders have also called for prayer on Ash Wednesday on behalf of Ukrainians.
Five Christian world communions — including the World Communion of Reformed Churches, the Lutheran World Federation and the Mennonite World Conference — will be holding a joint Ash Wednesday prayer service for peace in Ukraine.

“It’s interesting to think, people are latching onto fasting as a way to give them agency,” he said.
