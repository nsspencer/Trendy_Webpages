     Ukraine says forces 'eliminated' assassins targeting President Zelensky

     1/2Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) arrives to watch Ukrainian troops take part in a military drill outside the city of Rivne, northern Ukraine, on February 16.
Photo courtesy of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry | License PhotoMarch 1 (UPI) -- Ukrainian forces foiled a plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky amid Russia's invasion of the country, Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council chief Oleksiy Danilov said Tuesday.
Danilov said Ukraine received intelligence about the assassination plot from Russian Federal Security Service -- or FSB -- agents who oppose the war.
Last week, Zelensky told the nation in an address that he was Russia's "number one target," saying Russian forces sought to "destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state."

     Ukraine foils assassination attempt on Zelensky by Chechen special unit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A unit of Chechen special forces sent on a mission to assassinate Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was "eliminated," head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov announced Tuesday on Ukrainian parliament's official television station Rada TV.
Ukraine received intelligence on the assassination attempt from agents of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), he said.
"The special operation that was to be carried out directly by the Kadyrovites to eliminate our president is fully known to us today," Danilov stated.
"One group was covered in Gostomel, another group is now, let's say, under the gun," Danilov said.
"The Kadyrovites' elite group, which came here specifically to eliminate our president, was directly destroyed."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A top Ukrainian official revealed on Tuesday that authorities in the country thwarted an alleged assassination plot against President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During a briefing, Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council chief Oleksiy Danilov disclosed that Ukrainian forces stopped a plan to kill Zelensky, according to a Telegram post by Ukrainian authorities.
Danilov said individuals from Russia's Federal Security Service who are not in favor of war told authorities about the plot.
He added that the Kadyrovites group that was behind the assassination plot was split into two — one was destroyed in Gostomel and the other is “under fire,” according to Axios.
Russian shelling hit a number of locations in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, on Tuesday as Russian forces moved closer to Kyiv.

     Volodymyr Zelensky Assassination Foiled After Russian Tip-Off, Ukraine Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian intelligence officers opposed to their country's invasion of Ukraine reportedly tipped off officials in Kyiv who thwarted an assassination plot against President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The Kadyrov forces unit, which came to kill our President, was eliminated," Danilov told Ukraine 24 TV.
Zelensky has said that he and his family are the Kremlin's top two targets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week.
While Russia has been reluctant to reveal its casualties during the war, Kadyrov said on Tuesday that Chechens had been killed during the conflict.
Although a Putin loyalist, Kadyrov wrote on Telegram on Sunday that the tactics in Ukraine "are too slow," are "not effective" and called for the Russian president to give harsher orders.

     Ukraine says a plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky was foiled by Russian spies who were secretly working against Putin

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukraine on Tuesday said it defeated Chechen forces sent to kill President Volodymyr Zelensky.
A Ukrainian defense official said double agents in Russia's security agency gave intel on the plot.
Per the post, Danilov said Ukraine had "received information" about the plot against Zelensky from people in Russia's Federal Security Service who "do not want to take part in this bloody war."
The Federal Security Service, also known as the FSB, is a successor to the KGB.
Several reports and rumors of assassination attempts against Zelensky have emerged since Russia invaded Ukraine last Thursday.

     Ukraine says it killed Chechen forces sent to assassinate Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A group of Chechen assassins sent to kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were “eliminated” after their plot was foiled, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council said Tuesday.
The announcement from Oleksiy Danilov came days after Ukraine’s military reportedly destroyed a column of Chechen tanks controlled by Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov near Hostomel, a key battleground outside Kyiv.
“The Kadyrov forces unit, which came to kill our President, was eliminated,” Danilov told Ukraine 24 TV.
He said the killed Chechen fighters “chose to become heroes.”“Yes, they kill in war and that was their choice of profession,” he said.
Earlier reports indicated that the Chechen unit had been deployed to “capture and kill” Ukrainian leaders.
