     Jurgen Klopp Makes Goalkeeper Decision For Liverpool's Fifth Round FA Cup Clash With Norwich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool face Norwich City in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday and it looks like manager Jurgen Klopp has made a decision as to who will start in goal.
Caoimhin Kelleher was the hero on Sunday as Liverpool won the Carabao Cup final 11-10 on penalties against Chelsea at Wembley.
IMAGO / SportimageThe Ireland international stepped up with the penalties locked at 10-10 to score his spot-kick before watching Kepa Arrizabalaga blaze over for Liverpool to win the trophy.
Despite his heroics, Klopp explained in his pre-match press conference that Kelleher will not start against the Canaries.

     Tottenham end season trophy-less after Middlesbrough FA Cup giant killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tottenham's wait for a major trophy stretches on for a 14th year in 2022 as the Premier League side suffered a humbling 1-0 FA Cup away defeat at Championship high flyers Middlesbrough.
Another cup frustration raises more questions about Conte's future in North London as their 2008 League Cup win seems like an eternity ago for Spurs fans.
Spurs' focus is now on securing the highest possible Premier League finish with a European qualification push still on the cards for Conte.
Tottenham are currently seventh in the Premier League with 13 games to go, but they have crucial matches in hand over their rivals.
The FA Cup exit means Spurs' last trophy win remains Juande Ramos's 2008 League Cup (Carabao Cup), with defeats in the 2009, 2015 and 2021 League Cup finals and the 2019 Champions League final.

     Middlesbrough vs Tottenham live score updates: FA Cup latest as Chris Wilder's side cause another upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Middlesbrough caused another FA Cup upset as the Championship outfit booked their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Tottenham at the Riverside.
The game started evenly but both sides struggled to create any clear-cut chances before the half-time break with neither team able to register a shot on target.
The intensity of the game went up a level after the interval as both sides created opportunities to score.
It was Middlesbrough who almost took the lead 10 minutes after the break as Matt Crooks fired a header over the bar, having been unmarked inside the box.
Chris Wilder's side are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Tottenham's long trophy drought continues.

     Middlesbrough 1-0 Tottenham: Boro bounces Spurs from FA Cup in ET
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a match that had far more technical difficulties than goals, Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 fell to Middlesbrough in the fifth round of the FA Cup.
The score was tied until the second period of extra time when Boro’s Josh Coburn fired a shot past Hugo Lloris to put the home side ahead.
Tottenham battled hard for an equalizer to force a penalty shootout but couldn’t find a way past keeper Joe Lumley.
This was the second consecutive Premier League team that Boro has defeated in this competition after they dispatched Manchester United in penalties a few weeks ago.
Tottenham rolled out the exact same lineup against Championship side Boro as they did in last weekend’s away win at Leeds United, hoping for a similar result.

     Supersub Riedewald fires Crystal Palace past Stoke and into FA Cup last eight

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jaïro Riedewald was the unlikely supersub for Patrick Vieira after his goal eight minutes from time fired Crystal Palace to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Stoke and took them a step closer to Wembley.
“It is a really exciting period and moment I would say but it is still one step before Wembley.
Jaïro Riedewald (centre) watches his shot go past Stoke City’s Jack Bonham.
The celebrations of the recent Africa Cup of Nations winner were short-lived as Stoke equalised five minutes later.
Clearly there was no contact with the shot with James Chester and we end up losing a goal as a result.”
