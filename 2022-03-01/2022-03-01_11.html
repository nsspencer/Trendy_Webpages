     After Burning for Days, a Ship Carrying Thousands of Luxury Cars Sinks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two weeks after catching fire, a mammoth ship that was transporting thousands of luxury cars sank on Tuesday morning about 253 miles off the Azores, according to the company that managed the vessel.
The ship, the Felicity Ace, went down at about 9 a.m. local time after tilting starboard, plunging about 4,000 cars — including more than 1,000 Porsches and 200 Bentleys — into the sea, according to the company, MOL Ship Management.
Environmental groups had been deeply concerned that the ship would sink and about the pollution it would cause in the unique ecosystem of the Azores, the Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic, where the seabed is covered with coral reefs, coral forests and sponges.
The area is home to sperm whales, blue whales, humpback whales, dolphins and sharks, among other species, according to Oceana, an environmental group.

     Cargo ship carrying luxury cars to Massachusetts sinks off the coast of Portugal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 650-foot-long cargo ship that was reported to be in serious trouble last week has sunk roughly 250 miles off the coast of Portugal.
The vessel named Felicity Ace was carrying cars from Germany to the United States when its 22 crew members abandoned ship on Wednesday due to fire.
The Felicity Ace sank about 250 miles off Portugal’s Azores Islands as it was being towed, according to the Associated Press.
Ernie Boch Jr., who owns car dealerships across Massachusetts, owned a Bentley on the burning ship, WCVB reported.
With supply chain delays already hampering the Massachusetts auto industry, Boch told the TV station the fire will further disrupt dealers across the state and region.

     Ship carrying thousands of luxury cars sinks in the Atlantic after burning for weeksEnlarge this image toggle caption Portuguese navy via AP Portuguese navy via APA large cargo ship that was carrying luxury cars from Germany to the U.S. sank Tuesday in the mid-Atlantic — nearly two weeks after a fire broke out on board, according to Portuguese navy officials.
The ship sank in a location outside Portugal's economic zone in an area that's nearly 2 miles deep.
One of the vessels that had been monitoring the Felicity Ace was en route to Ponta Delgada in the Azores to pick up pollution containment equipment, Portuguese navy officials said.
The Portuguese navy rescued all 22 members of the crew from the ship, which was scheduled to arrive in Davisville, R.I., on Feb. 16.
The total estimated loss for all the cargo, which included Porsches, Bentleys, Lamborghinis and Volkswagens, is close to $440 million, the Journal reported.

     The Portuguese navy confirmed the sinking, saying it occurred outside Portuguese waters.
It wasn't clear how many cars were onboard the ship, but vessels of the Felicity Ace's size can carry at least 4,000 vehicles.
The ship was carrying 2,000 metric tons (2,200 tons) of fuel and 2,000 metric tons (2,200 tons) of oil.
The Portuguese navy said in a statement that only a few pieces of wreckage and a small patch of oil was visible where the ship went down.
A Portuguese Air Force plane and a Portuguese navy vessel are to remain at the scene on the lookout for signs of pollution.
