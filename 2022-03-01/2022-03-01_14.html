     New THE ADAM PROJECT Trailer Is a Time Travel Family Affair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But the newest trailer for Netflix’s The Adam Project shows director Shawn Levy tells a very different kind of story.
Not after Ruffalo’s adult son Adam Reed (Reynolds) travels back nearly 30 years to 2022.
And it turns out no matter how young or old a Ryan Reynolds character might be; he’s got a sharp wit.
If Adam Reed really did watch too many movies, he definitely saw all of these actors onscreen many times.
The Adam Project, the second film from Free Guy‘s Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds, comes to Netflix on March 11.

     Ryan Reynolds and ‘Adam Project’ Team on Releasing Netflix Film Amid Ukrainian Crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mood was bittersweet on the blue carpet for the world premiere of Netflix’s star-studded film The Adam Project.
The Adam Project director and producer Shawn Levy also sang Reynolds’ and Lively’s praises and has been a part of the couple’s effort to raise funds.
“I always hoped that Adam Project would be a movie that is emotionally connected,” Levy said.
“I think things have been varying shades of dark for a while,” Reynolds told THR.
It’s a tool in our toolkit to lift us up, to unite us, and, luckily, this is that kind of film,” she said, adding that The Adam Project is “all about love transcending time.”For Saldaña, the project is incredibly personal.
