     Belarus President Lukashenko appears to stand in front of map of planned Moldova-state invasion: reports

     Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko appeared to stand in front of a map that shows plans to invade Transnistria, a breakaway state in Moldova, during a meeting that was broadcast in the country, according to reports.
Lukashenko is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and allowed Putin to place Russian troops on the border between Belarus and Ukraine before the invasion ostensibly for joint military exercises, according to The Hill.
RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES"At today's security council meeting, Lukashenko showed what looks like an actual invasion map," Belarussian journalist Tadeusz Giczan tweeted Tuesday.
"It shows Ukraine military facilities destroyed by missiles from Belarus, attacks directions (everything agrees except Odessa-Transnistria).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Images have emerged of Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko standing in front of a battle map that appears to show a planned invasion of Moldova, along with Ukraine.
The map appeared to show troop movement plans and infrastructure targets in Ukraine, as well as targets in Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria.
Reports have emerged this week that Belarus is preparing to send troops into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion.
The country’s close ties to Moscow in the attack prompted the U.S. State Department to suspend operations Monday at its embassy in Belarus.
The Pentagon, meanwhile, has said it had not yet seen signs of Belarussian troops in Ukraine.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing for their lives have arrived in Moldova, a country on Ukraine’s southern border, since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine last week.
Moldova, like Ukraine, was part of the former Soviet Union, and is facing a labor shortage.
Only two other countries – Poland and Hungary – have taken in more Ukrainian refugees so far.
Refugees "should be integrated economically and earn money," Igor Grosu, president of Moldova's parliament, said in an interview.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko appears to have indicated Vladimir Putin's forces have plans to invade Moldova, Daily Mail reported.
Putin's war-mongering sidekick addressed security officials Wednesday while standing in front of a battle map that seems to show a planned operation from southern into its tiny neighbour.
The map also showed proposed battle plans for Russian troops across the country.
It detailed Russian lines of attack heading into Ukraine, some of which have materialised in the first few days of the invasion -- such as forces storming towards Kyiv from the north, and towards Kherson from Crimea, Daily Mail reported.
But they also showed off several attacks that have yet to come to pass -- with one even appearing to point from the port city of Odessa into Moldova, suggesting plans to march troops into Ukraine's neighbour.

At today's security council meeting, Lukashenko showed what looks like an actual invasion map.
Gizcan said that the display looked "like an actual invasion map" and could possibly represent Russia's plans for post-annexation of Ukraine.
Lukashenko's television appearance occurred on the same day that the Ukrainian Parliament said Belarusian troops had entered Ukrainian territory.
"Belarusian troops have entered Chernihiv region," the parliament said in a translated tweet.
