     ANTONIO CONTEThe Tottenham manager's reaction: "For sure the result is not good and we have to be frustrated.
It was a pity because in these type of game you have to start and kill your opponent.
If you give them hope, they will take confidence and improve during the game.
"First of all, it is important to say that Middlesbrough played a good game, deserves respect and congratulate them for the win.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Middlesbrough caused another FA Cup upset as the Championship outfit booked their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Tottenham at the Riverside.
The game started evenly but both sides struggled to create any clear-cut chances before the half-time break with neither team able to register a shot on target.
The intensity of the game went up a level after the interval as both sides created opportunities to score.
It was Middlesbrough who almost took the lead 10 minutes after the break as Matt Crooks fired a header over the bar, having been unmarked inside the box.
Chris Wilder's side are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Tottenham's long trophy drought continues.

     Tottenham end season trophy-less after Middlesbrough FA Cup giant killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tottenham's wait for a major trophy stretches on for a 14th year in 2022 as the Premier League side suffered a humbling 1-0 FA Cup away defeat at Championship high flyers Middlesbrough.
Another cup frustration raises more questions about Conte's future in North London as their 2008 League Cup win seems like an eternity ago for Spurs fans.
Spurs' focus is now on securing the highest possible Premier League finish with a European qualification push still on the cards for Conte.
Tottenham are currently seventh in the Premier League with 13 games to go, but they have crucial matches in hand over their rivals.
The FA Cup exit means Spurs' last trophy win remains Juande Ramos's 2008 League Cup (Carabao Cup), with defeats in the 2009, 2015 and 2021 League Cup finals and the 2019 Champions League final.
