     Britney Spears has shared some insights into her reasons for posting a string of nude photos on Instagram in recent days, stating she is now a "free woman."
Her father, Jamie Spears, was at the helm of both of the financial and personal branches of the conservatorship.
Over the summer—several weeks after Britney Spears' June court testimony, in which she spoke out about her experiences under the conservatorship—the star also posted images of herself posing semi-nude.

     Britney Spears, who is currently vacationing in French Polynesia with her fiancé Sam Asghari, has finally revealed the reason behind her au-natural snaps.
The US pop star has shared multiple beach photos (censored with diamond emojis) to her social media over the past several months.
Taking to Instagram on Tuesday, the 40-year-old singer revealed the reason for her recent pattern of her amazing gesture.
Britney tried to explain her freedom to the world by sharing her beach snaps in which she left nothing to imagine.
Britney appeared to be savoring her newfound freedom ever since she was freed from her conservatorship in November—and it looks like that includes ditching the constraints of clothing.
