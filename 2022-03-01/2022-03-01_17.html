     Brad Marchand addresses David Krejci's Bruins exit on Twitter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We've seen plenty of that recently, as the Boston Bruins star has taken a few shots at his opponents on social media in recent weeks.
Late Monday night, however, Marchand used his Twitter account to come to the defense of David Krejci, who announced last July he was leaving the Bruins to finish his playing career in his native Czechia.
Bruins reporter Matt Kalman didn't even mention Marchand in his tweet wondering whether Krejci should take criticism for leaving the team without a top-six center.
If Krejci was centering a second line of David Pastrnak and Taylor Hall, Boston could have two elite forward groups.
If you ask Marchand, Krejci's former teammates seem at peace with that.

     What are the Boston Bruins Missing in their Lineup?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s the biggest piece that the Boston Bruins are missing in their lineup?
One of the toughest, grittiest teams in NHL history is the Boston Bruins, but where did they go?
In the 2021-22 season, the Bruins have been one of the softest teams in the league as they lack serious toughness in their lineup.
Boston has always been the team to stir the bee’s nest and wreak havoc throughout games, playing at their pace by setting the tone.
If the Boston Bruins truly want to contend for another Stanley Cup before their window closes (which is dramatically soon), they need to add more toughness on the offense and defense.

     Jake DeBrusk Is The Bruins’ Bellwether
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was one thing when Boston Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk wanted a move away from the team back in November, when he was continuing a sluggish 2020–21 season with a slow start to this one.
“He’s shown a lot of maturity in trying to handle this as appropriately as possible,” Bruins GM Don Sweeney said at the time.
This is the most obvious and comprehensible reason why the whole DeBrusk request is more urgent than it was in November.
2: With 53 games under their belts, coming off back-to-back second-round playoff losses, the Bruins are in kind of a weird spot, big-picture.
Do they play the long game and deal DeBrusk for future assets to a team they could meet in the playoffs in two months?

     The Jake DeBrusk situation remains an interesting one for Bruins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)By his own recollection, it’s been almost three years since Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk felt this good about his game.
“Obviously when pucks are going in and production’s there, it feels good,” DeBrusk admitted Monday night in Los Angeles.
Maybe they weren’t kidding when they said the Kraken’s Mason Appleton was the best that the Bruins could fetch for the trade-me-right-effin’-now DeBrusk.
Given the Bruins’ needs (and they have more than one of ’em, which is an important thing to remember), that’s an interesting discussion.
The Bruins and DeBrusk have another three weeks to figure that all out.

     LOS ANGELES — Bruce Cassidy was worried.
The last game the Bruins played was a 3-1 loss to the Islanders on Dec. 16, 2021.
Patrice Bergeron Anton Blidh and Oskar Steen were all in protocol.The NHL postponed their next three games.
A leaguewide shutdown followed.The Bruins were out of the top eight in the Eastern Conference.
