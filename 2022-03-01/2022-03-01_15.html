     Middlesbrough 1-0 Tottenham (AET) LIVE RESULT: Boro pull off ANOTHER giant killing as Coburn downs Spurs in FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ANTONIO CONTEThe Tottenham manager's reaction: "For sure the result is not good and we have to be frustrated.
It was a pity because in these type of game you have to start and kill your opponent.
If you give them hope, they will take confidence and improve during the game.
"First of all, it is important to say that Middlesbrough played a good game, deserves respect and congratulate them for the win.
These type of games, in these trophies away from home, you have to try to kill the game quickly.

     Middlesbrough vs Tottenham LIVE: FA Cup result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Getty Images)Teenager Josh Coburn was the hero as Middlesbrough produced another FA Cup upset by knocking out Tottenham with a 1-0 extra-time victory in the fifth round.
Boro dumped Manchester United out on penalties at Old Trafford in the fourth round and followed it up in style to beat Spurs, with 19-year-old Josh Coburnâ€™s 107th-minute strike settling the tie.
The Championship outfit were the better side throughout, booking their quarter-final spot and ensuring Spurs will end another season without a trophy after an abject display on Teesside.
Middlesbrough now join Manchester City and Crystal Palace in the quarter-finals after both Premier League sides recorded victories of their own.

     Middlesbrough vs Tottenham live score updates: FA Cup latest as Chris Wilder's side cause another upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Middlesbrough caused another FA Cup upset as the Championship outfit booked their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Tottenham at the Riverside.
The game started evenly but both sides struggled to create any clear-cut chances before the half-time break with neither team able to register a shot on target.
The intensity of the game went up a level after the interval as both sides created opportunities to score.
It was Middlesbrough who almost took the lead 10 minutes after the break as Matt Crooks fired a header over the bar, having been unmarked inside the box.
Chris Wilder's side are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Tottenham's long trophy drought continues.
