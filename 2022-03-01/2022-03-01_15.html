     Russia's 40-mile convoy has stalled on its way to Kyiv, a U.S. official saysEnlarge this image toggle caption Maxar MaxarLogistics problems are stalling a massive Russian convoy that's pushing its way toward Kyiv, according to a senior U.S. defense official.
The convoy, which has been measured as stretching for 40 miles, is apparently being hampered by fuel and food shortages.
As night fell on Ukraine on Tuesday, Russia's large convoy was still about 18 miles north of Kyiv — representing little or no change from Monday, the official said.
Despite Russia's vastly larger armed forces, Ukraine's airspace remains contested, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's country currently mounting a viable defense, the senior defense official said.
As in the first days of the war, Russia's military appears to be having more success in southern Ukraine, the official said.

     A second missile attack struck the TV tower in Kyiv and the country’s main Holocaust memorial, just miles from the city’s center.
As the Russian convoy approached the capital Tuesday, Zelenskyy appointed Gen. Mykola Zhyrnov to lead the defense of Kyiv.
“I decided to appoint a professional military man as the head of the Kyiv city military administration for the duration of the war,” Zelenskyy said.
The Russian defense ministry said those troops merged with Russian soldiers in the breakaway region of Donbas and cut off Ukraine’s access to the Sea of Azov.
On Tuesday, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly made a formal request to the International Criminal Court to investigate the Kremlin for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
