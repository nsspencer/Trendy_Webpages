If Desmond Bane and Dillon Brooks continue playing strong two-way basketball, the Grizzlies have a great chance to win this series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN released its second-round NBA playoff predictions on Sunday morning, and all 20 of its self-proclaimed experts picked the Golden State Warriors to beat the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference semifinals.
Curiously missing from ESPN's "experts" group was former NBA player and current "Inside the NBA" analyst Jalen Rose, who said during the first round he still thinks the Grizzlies are better than the Warriors.
The now fully healthy (save a still-injured Andre Iguodala) Warriors squad blazed through a 4-1 first round series win against the Denver Nuggets on their way to becoming Vegas' favorite to win the NBA title.
In addition to ESPN's being all-in on the Warriors, The Athletic's John Hollinger picked Golden State to win in seven against Memphis before the playoffs even began.
Wood graduated from journalism school last year and joined SI after a stint at WUFT News and the Independent Florida Alligator.

     Summary: Warriors at Grizzlies OddsWarriors Odds -2 Grizzlies Odds +2 Over/Under 221.5 Time 3:30 p.m.
Memphis’ saving grace has been their play in the fourth quarter, a quarter where their stars have risen to the occasion and got this team back in a winning position.
However, I think much of their fourth quarter success was due to the offense, or lack thereof, of Minnesota as opposed to their own play.
The Grizzlies simply can not rely on tremendous fourth quarter scoring in order to win games, especially against this Warriors team.
Golden State ranks second in the NBA this postseason in fourth quarter scoring, scoring 30.6 points per game in the fourth quarter, which ranks just behind Memphis.
