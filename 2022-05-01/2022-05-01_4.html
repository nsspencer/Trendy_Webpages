     Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Star in the White House Correspondents’ Dinner: The Reality Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, that much-maligned evening of political and media schmoozing formerly known as the “nerd prom,” returned Saturday night after a two-year Covid-19 hiatus.
It may not be the most obvious place for an obsessively-followed, newish celebrity couple to make their red carpet debut.
Enter Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: Couple of Substance.
Unlike Drew Barrymore, who wore a Lanvin dress with floor-sweeping sleeves, Ms. Kardashian and Mr. Davidson didn’t vamp for the photographers, or get caught taking giggly selfies with fellow attendees like Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell.
Mr. Davidson didn’t even pull any silly faces, as his “Saturday Night Live” characters often do.

     Pete Davidson Responds to Kanye West Comments at Netflix Comedy Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pete Davidson made his first public comments about being harassed by Kanye “Ye” West at this weekend’s Netflix Is A Joke Festival, where he headlined two stand-up shows that were also being recorded for the streamer.
Doing back-to-back sets for his “Pete Davidson and Best Friends” shows at Los Angeles’ Fonda Theatre on Friday, the comedian opened by remarking what a weird year he had had so far, quipping it started with an AIDS scare.
There were allegations earlier this year that West was trying to spread a rumor that Davidson had the condition.
“Chris got slapped, I got decapitated,” he teased, warning Stewart to watch his back.
He also joked that he hoped West would pull a Mrs. Doubtfire and show up one day disguised as a housekeeper in his ex-wife’s home.
