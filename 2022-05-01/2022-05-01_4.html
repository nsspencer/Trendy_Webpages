     John Lynch: “Nothing’s changed” on Deebo Samuel

     Summary: Getty ImagesAs it turns out, Odell Beckham Jr. was treating the last day of April as if it was the first day of April, tweeting as a joke that 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel was being traded to the Patriots.
John Lynch was asked by reporters on Saturday whether there were any more phone calls from other teams about Samuel and whether anything has changed.
“Nothing’s changed.”The 49ers made it clear on Friday night that they hope nothing changes.
Other teams can still try to trade for Samuel.
They’ll now try to persuade Deebo to change his tune.

     NFL Rumors: Deebo Samuel remains 'dug in' on trade from 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appears that Deebo Samuel isn't going anywhere ... for now.
After reportedly requesting a trade from the 49ers, Samuel ended up staying put through the NFL draft, as San Francisco did not receive any trade packages that met their asking price.
Over the weekend, star NFL wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. took to Twitter on multiple occasions where he engaged with Samuel and posted trade rumors that were quickly proven false.
"I guess Odell Beckham Jr. is out here breaking news, saying Deebo Samuel is going to the Patriots, I guess that was a joke," Fowler said.
I'm told Deebo still is dug in, still wants to be traded, but knows this could drag out for a while."

     Summary: Despite there not being a trade this weekend, Deebo Samuel still wants to go to a new team.
ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported the news on Sunday morning as Samuel is “dug in” on leaving the San Francisco 49ers.
The trade request could also drag on since San Francisco isn’t interested in moving him right now.
Some NFL fans don’t see him leaving San Francisco.

     Summary: You see this wide receiver contract market.
You don’t have to be traded, you’re a free agent that unfortunately tore an ACL in the Super Bowl.
AdvertisementAll weekend Beckham has been on Twitter acting like he’s an NFL insider whose sole beat is Deebo Samuel.
He doesn’t believe that his time as a top NFL wide receiver is over, but with all of these younger players either getting paid or causing a ruckus by holding out, we’re forgetting about the player whose first three seasons as an NFL wide receiver can only be compared to Randy Moss and Jerry Rice.
He wants to make sure that his name is still on people’s lips while the wide receiver contract market is exploding, and it’s actually a good idea on his part.

     Ten moves that should be made after 2022 NFL Draft: Baker Mayfield to Lions, Deebo Samuel to Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some teams added a whole lot of premium talent (looking at you, Jets).
Mayfield, while still a mid-tier option, is younger, cheaper and brings far more of the moxie Dan Campbell seemingly prefers.
But why not Indy, where Frank Reich loves him some Foles and the Colts need a more proven reserve behind Matt Ryan?
