     Summary: Tens of thousands of people marched Sunday in cities around the world for May Day protests to honor workers and shame governments into doing more for their citizens.
In France, protesters shouted slogans against newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, a development that may set the tone for his second term.
May Day is often a time of high emotions for workers in Europe, and protests in the last two years have been limited by pandemic restrictions.
Turkish police moved in quickly in Istanbul to encircle protesters near the barred-off Taksim Square — where 34 people were killed In 1977 during a May Day event.
May Day celebrations in Russia also saw the arrests of antiwar protesters and bystanders across the country, including some who demonstrated in support of the authorities.

     Seattle May Day rally and march tout new union strength
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two years of slimmed-down crowds amid pandemic lockdowns, more than 200 May Day marchers packed the streets, striding from Judkins Park to downtown Seattle.
Fueled in part by recent union victories for workers at Amazon and Starbucks — two corporate giants headquartered in Seattle — some marchers credited the crowd size to a renewed optimism for workers’ rights.
“We’re tired of living under the constant threat of losing our jobs,” said Stephen Hoth, an Uber and Lyft driver and member of the Drivers Union.
By midday, the display was largely peaceful, with Seattle police officers scattered along the route, hemming in marchers.
Police didn’t block the streets for the demonstration, a departure from how the city managed May Day marches of years past.

(KOIN) — Activists marched through the city Sunday in recognition of May Day — an annual celebration of the working class where people around the world protest for human rights, better working conditions and job protections.
Rally-goers gathered downtown around 11 a.m. at the Battleship Oregon Memorial and then marched to the South Park Blocks.
Protesters waved signs, played music and gave speeches admonishing some corporations, like Starbucks, for what they called “union busting” behavior.
“We had representatives from Starbucks, from Amazon, we had postal service workers here, we had teamsters with UPS that were here today,” said Quentin Kanta with Starbucks Workers United.
“Really just bridging all of the struggles in labor right now under the banner headline of new organizing.”These rallies were in contrast to previous years’ destructive events during May Day celebrations.
