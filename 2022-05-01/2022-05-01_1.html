     John Lynch: “Nothing’s changed” on Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAs it turns out, Odell Beckham Jr. was treating the last day of April as if it was the first day of April, tweeting as a joke that 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel was being traded to the Patriots.
John Lynch was asked by reporters on Saturday whether there were any more phone calls from other teams about Samuel and whether anything has changed.
“Nothing’s changed.”The 49ers made it clear on Friday night that they hope nothing changes.
Other teams can still try to trade for Samuel.
They’ll now try to persuade Deebo to change his tune.

     Deebo Samuel still does not plan to play for 49ers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel still does not plan to play for 49ers?
With the NFL Draft officially in the books, the likelihood of the San Francisco 49ers trading Deebo Samuel before the start of the 2022 season has decreased significantly.
If the Niners were going to trade Samuel, it would have made sense for them to do so prior to or during the first round of the draft.
The Pro Bowler is entering the final year of his contract, but San Francisco could still use the franchise tag next offseason.
Of course, the situation has the potential to turn ugly if Samuel truly wants out and does not get his way.

     49ers’ star Deebo Samuel’s trade stance after 2022 NFL Draft, revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NFL Draft came and went and Deebo Samuel is still a San Francisco 49er.
On Sunday morning, Bleacher Report tweeted that, according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Samuel is “dug in” on leaving San Francisco.
But the first-team All Pro wants to go back to a traditional wide receiver role.
Samuel’s motivation behind his desire to maintain a wide receiver status is unclear.
And while San Francisco seems determined to avoid moving their star offensive weapon, Deebo Samuel is standing by his trade request.
