     Bucks’ Physical Play Makes Celtics Suddenly Look Average
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The task of stopping a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo — has there ever been a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo?
You need a player at once big and strong and nimble enough to stay in front of him.
You need others, preferably long-armed men, pestering him with their hands from the periphery.
Then you need someone to stand tall and protect the rim from the inevitable onslaught.
The Boston Celtics have all of those things.

     Summary: Jayson Tatum met with the media after the Boston Celtics lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 1 on Sunday.
The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics faced off in Game 1 of their second-round of the playoffs on Sunday afternoon in Massachusetts, and the Bucks won the game by a score of 101-89.
The win gives the Bucks a 1-0 series lead, and Game 2 will be back in Boston on Tuesday evening.
Tatum and the Celtics had been riding high after their first-round playoff series against the Brooklyn Nets.
Even more impressive about their first-round series and their win over the Celtics; they have been playing without Khris Middleton since Game 2 of the first-round due to a knee injury.

     Bucks 101, Celtics 89: Defending champs lock down Boston in taking Game 1 of Eastern Conference semifinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks opened their second round Eastern Conference playoff series with the Boston Celtics with an emphatic, 101-89, victory at TD Garden, with the defending NBA champions putting on an extraordinary defensive effort in the home of the league’s top-ranked defensive unit.
BOX SCORE: Bucks 101, Celtics 89RELATED: Twitter compares Giannis Antetokounmpo to Magic in first halfGame 2 is in Boston on Tuesday night at 6 p.m.
From there, the Celtics just couldn’t muster up enough firepower – nor make enough stops – to mount a legitimate comeback.
Tatum also struggled from the field (3-for-10) and he and Horford led the Celtics with nine first half points.
Boston cut it to 45-43 but over the final three minutes of the half Milwaukee went on a 11-3 run.

     Boston Celtics 'hit in mouth,' outmuscled by Milwaukee Bucks in physical Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Sunday's Game 1 against the Boston Celtics, the Bucks played with their usual level of physicality on defense and it seemed to catch Boston off guard.
Celtics coach Ime Udoka said the Bucks' physicality was something that took Boston out of its sets early, but that it shouldn't have caught the team off guard.
Milwaukee played effective defense throughout the game, holding Boston to 33.3% shooting overall.
Boston made just 10 2-point field goals in total, the second-fewest ever by a team in a playoff game.
Boston had never made fewer than 14 2-point shots in a regular-season game or a playoff game prior to Sunday.

     Summary: Celtics The Celtics need much more from their stars: 6 takeaways from Game 1 vs.
The only problem: The Bucks had a lot to do with their struggles in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.
The Bucks looked like a completely different team on Sunday than the one the Celtics faced during the regular season.
The prescription is simple, even if acquiring the medicine isn’t: The Celtics need more from Tatum, who is the starting point for all of their best offense.
The Celtics also need to do a much better job of covering the Bucks’ shooters.

     5 takeaways from Celtics-Bucks Eastern Conference semifinal Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Durant, however, is mainly a (lethal) jump shooter while Giannis is an 18-wheeler without brakes careening down the mountain.
Lopez was once again solid on defense Sunday, especially when Giannis was forced to the bench with foul trouble.
In the first round against Chicago, the Bucks held the Bulls under 90 points twice in five games, and now, the Celtics once in one game.
The Celtics discovered this firsthand when they managed just 33% shooting and spent much of the game playing catch-up.
“In a way, it’s good to get this dud out of the way, offensively,” said Celtics coach Ime Udoka.
