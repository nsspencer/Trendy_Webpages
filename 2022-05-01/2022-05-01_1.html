     Summary: By Dominique Vidalon and Noemie OlivePARIS (Reuters) -Police fired tear gas to push back black-clad anarchists who ransacked business premises in Paris on Sunday during May Day protests against the policies of newly re-elected President Emmanuel Macron.
Thousands of people joined May Day marches across France, calling for salary increases and for Macron to drop his plan to raise the retirement age.
Macron won a new five-year presidential term after beating far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in last Sunday's runoff vote.
Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round of the presidential vote, attended the Paris march.
He wants to rally a union of the left, including the Greens, to dominate parliament and force Macron into an awkward "cohabitation", but so far this has not materialised.
