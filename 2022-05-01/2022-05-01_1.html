Boston cut it to 45-43 but over the final three minutes of the half Milwaukee went on a 11-3 run.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks strike first in their Eastern Conference semifinal showdown against the Boston Celtics with an impressive 101-89 road win in Game 1.
Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with a 24-point, 13-rebound, 12-assist triple-double as the Bucks steal home court away from Boston at TD Garden.
Rather than follow the typical playoff model of downsizing, the Bucks went in the other direction and played big.
Giannis Antetokounmpo, who played center for much of the season, started at small forward.
Point GiannisOn paper, this looked like a bad matchup for Giannis Antetokounmpo.
