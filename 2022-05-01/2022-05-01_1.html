Tens of thousands marked May Day – the international day of workers – with rallies in South Korea, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Serbia, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Greece, France and Cyprus, among others.
Turkish riot police arrested dozens of protesters trying to reach Istanbul’s main Taksim Square for May Day demonstrations against economic hardship caused by raging inflation.
Many Chinese marked a quiet May Day this year as the government’s “zero-COVID” approach restricts travel and enforces lockdowns in multiple cities.
Millions remain restricted to their buildings or compounds in Shanghai, China’s largest city, under a lockdown that has only slightly eased.

     Summary: Tens of thousands of people are marching in cities across Europe for May Day protests to honor workers and shame governments into doing more for their citizensPARIS -- Tens of thousands of people marched Sunday in cities around Europe for May Day protests to honor workers and shame governments into doing more for their citizens.
May Day is often a time of high emotion for trade unionists and other workers, and protests in the last two years have been limited by pandemic restrictions.
On the Asian side of sprawling Istanbul, a May Day gathering drew thousands, who sang, chanted and waved banners, a demonstration organized by the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey.
Thousands of workers, unemployed and retirees marched peacefully in North Macedonia’s capital of Skopje, demanding wage increases and respect for workers’ rights.
Darko Dimovski, head of the country’s Federation of Trade Unions, told the crowd that workers are demanding an across-the-board wage increase.

     May 1, International Workers’ Day: A brief history of resistance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FRANCE 24 takes a look back at the history of May 1 as International Workers’ Day, a day of protests, parades and an annual challenge to the status quo.
Against this backdrop, France is expecting the largest and most raucous May Day rallies it has seen in decades.
The federation, which advocated for parliamentary democracy while affirming its belief in the Marxist idea of the inevitability of class struggle, decided to designate May 1 as International Workers’ Day.
The US labour movement’s campaign for an eight-hour day burgeoned despite the violent end to the Haymarket movement.
French labour unions won a comprehensive victory when then-prime minister Georges Clemenceau put in place a 40-hour week in 1919.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May Day, celebrated by workers across the globe as International Labor Day, falls on May 1.
While the day traces its origins to an American laborers’ fight for a shorter work day, the U.S. does not officially recognize International Labor Day.
Like other countries that mark Labor Days on different dates, the U.S. and Canada celebrate their Labor Day in September.
U.S. resistance to celebrate International Labor Day — also called International Workers’ Day — in May stems from a resistance to emboldening worldwide working-class unity, historians say.
May Day in America has bloody originsMay Day in America was born out of the 8-hour workday movement in 19th-century Chicago.

     Summary: ISTANBUL (Reuters) – Turkish riot police detained dozens of protesters trying to reach Istanbul’s main Taksim Square for May Day demonstrations against economic hardship caused by raging inflation.
The Istanbul governor’s office had allowed May Day celebrations to be held in another district and deemed gatherings in all other locations as unauthorised and illegal.
A statement from the Istanbul governor’s office on Sunday said that 164 protesters had been detained across the city for “attempting to hold illegal demonstrations”.
Marches led by workers and unions are held on May 1 every year as part of International Labour Day celebrations in many countries.
The soaring inflation and the economic hardship it causes were cited in May Day statements from several groups.

     Summary: By Dominique Vidalon and Noemie OlivePARIS (Reuters) -Thousands of people joined May Day protests across France on Sunday to demand social justice and salary increases and to push newly re-elected President Emmanuel Macron to drop his plan to raise the retirement age.
Macron won a new five-year presidential term after beating far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in last Sunday's runoff vote.
Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round of the presidential vote, was attending the Paris march.
He wants to rally a union of the left, including the Greens, to dominate parliament and force Macron into an awkward "cohabitation" but so far this has not materialised.
She was replaced by the Rassemblement National Interim President Jordan Bardella, who said Le Pen was preparing for the legislative elections.

     Summary: Police detain May Day protesters in IstanbulRiot police in Istanbul detained at least 25 protesters trying to reach Taksim square for May 1st International Labour Day celebrations.
Security forces attempted to block press members from recording footage of the arrests and encircled protesters to rapidly detain them.
Taksim Square holds a special place for labour unions and political groups in Turkey celebrating May 1st, as it was the site of an armed attack that led to the death of 34 labour protesters in 1977 and mass anti-government Gezi Park protests in 2013.
Access to the city centre is usually blocked off by the police, allowing only small wreath-laying ceremonies to commemorate Labour day.
