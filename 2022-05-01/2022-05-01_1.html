     Summary: Good afternoon/late morning/whatever, it’s time for Game 1 of the East Semis between the two former employers of a player named Semi Milwaukee Bucks and the Boston Celtics.
It sounds like Bud will roll with the same starting lineup as he did during the latter half of the Bulls series:Just deleted it all.
The starting lineup that the Bucks used in games 3-5 against the Bulls will be the one they use in Game 1 today against Boston.

From there, the Celtics just couldn’t muster up enough firepower – nor make enough stops – to mount a legitimate comeback.
Tatum also struggled from the field (3-for-10) and he and Horford led the Celtics with nine first half points.
Boston cut it to 45-43 but over the final three minutes of the half Milwaukee went on a 11-3 run.

     NBA Playoffs Preview Guide Bucks vs. Celtics: three-pointers will determine second round series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the course of the regular season, it may not be as noticeable.
The Nets finished with a 115.0 offensive rating, better than their 113.2 points per 100 possessions in the regular season.
During the regular season, Antetokounmpo lead the Bucks in passes that resulted in three-pointers attempted at 10.0 per game.
The Celtics and Bucks split their four regular season meetings, but only the two games in December can really give us a good sense of what a seven-game series could look like.
For the Bucks, that’s right around their regular season averages of 38.4 attempts for themselves and giving up 40.6 to their opponents.
