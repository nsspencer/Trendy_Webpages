     Five Things We Learned: Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City (Premier League)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City returned to the top of the Premier League with a crucial 4-0 victory against Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday evening.
Here are five things City Xtra learnt from Manchester City's dominant win in west Yorkshire on Saturday evening-1.
Guardiola's set-piece BluesOften criticised for their lack of goals from dead-ball positions under Guardiola, City set themselves clear of the rest by notching their 18th goal from a set-piece of the Premier League campaign against Leeds on Saturday - a league-high tally.
Pep not repeating his mistakes of oldIf one analyses Pep Guardiola's tenure at Manchester City, their shortcomings in the Champions League year-in, year-out could be pointed towards some rather questionable calls made by the manager in his selection at some stage of the campaign.
However, with just five league games to get over the finishing line, Guardiola is not resting easy and is managing his troops commendably amidst what has been a tough time of late in terms of fitness issues in defence for the Premier League champions.

     Premier League: Manchester City back on top after rampant victory at Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City returned to the top of the Premier League standings after thumping Leeds United 4-0 at Elland Road on Saturday, a match in which the champions were made to work harder than the scoreline suggested.
Liverpool had regained top spot earlier in the day with a 1-0 win at Newcastle United, putting pressure on City to respond against a Leeds side battling to avoid relegation this season.
It was City`s 17th goal from a set piece this term – more than any other Premier League side.
The champions continued to misplace passes to give Leeds plenty of moments of promise, but poor finishing and a wayward final pass meant the home side could not capitalise.
City continued to look nervy after the break but Leeds still lacked that killer instinct with another goal from a corner, this time stabbed home by Ake, punishing the profligate hosts.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool and Man City are enjoying the pressure of the title race and make keeping on each other's tails "look easy", says Sky Sports' Gary Neville.
But this doesn't feel like that, even when they played against each other in that brilliant 2-2 draw.
"Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition.
But when I saw that, I thought, 'Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?'.
I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four games, four wins, 31 goals and two trophy lifts: it has been a truly incredible weekend of football for Manchester City.
Vital wins over Leeds and Brighton kept our respective Premier League title ambitions and FA Women’s Super League Champions League qualification prospects alive.
With two hat-trick heroes and a further four-goal haul to boot, each of our sides averaged just shy of an astonishing eight goals per game across the weekend.
And City did not disappoint, putting Leeds to the sword at Elland Road in a convincing Premier League triumph.
Gabriel Jesus added a third with his sixth goal in the space of a week, before Fernandinho marked his 260th Premier League appearance – a new record for a Brazilian – with a thunderous late strike.
