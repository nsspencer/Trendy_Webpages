     Summary: The crash occurred while Biden was away in Washington mere weeks after he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
But there was Fritz and Joan; they embraced me,” Biden said referring to Mondale by his longtime nickname.
The Covid-19 pandemic had delayed the memorial for Mondale, who died in April 2021 at the age of 93.
Biden referred to Mondale on Sunday “one of the great giants in American history.
“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright,” Biden said at the Washington National Cathedral.

     Biden Extols Mondale as ‘One of the Great Giants of American History’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Mondale was among the Democratic senators who encouraged Mr. Biden to take his seat after winning the 1972 election even though the candidate’s wife and daughter had just died in a tragic auto accident.
The two went on to serve together in the Senate for four years and for another four years when Mr. Mondale was vice president under Jimmy Carter.
Mr. Mondale and Mr. Biden were both exemplars of a different generation of Washington Democrats that has now mostly passed from the scene.
While serving under Mr. Carter from 1977 to 1981, Mr. Mondale set a standard for the vice presidency that later benefited Mr. Biden.
Thirty-six years later, Vice President Kamala Harris broke that glass ceiling as part of Mr. Biden’s ticket.

     Biden remembers Walter Mondale as a "giant" in American politics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden remembered former Vice President Walter "Fritz" Mondale on Sunday as a "giant in American political history."
The big picture: Mondale, a former U.S. senator, ambassador to Japan and 1984 Democratic presidential nominee, died in April 2021 at 93.
The Minnesota Democrat, who mentored countless politicians, has been credited with transforming the role of vice president to what we know it to be today.
"Walter Mondale was a giant of the Senate, a formidable vice president and a truth-telling presidential nominee of his party, who never stopped standing by principle," presidential biographer Jon Meacham said.
Sunday's speakers, including Biden, shared stories of how his friendship and counsel shaped their lives.

     Biden honors Walter Mondale as one of America's 'great giants' at memorial service
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden on Sunday honored former Vice President Walter Frederick "Fritz" Mondale as one of America's "great giants" during a deeply personal memorial service address in Minneapolis.
Mondale, who served as vice president under Democratic President Jimmy Carter, died at 93 in April of last year.
Fritz was both the candle and the mirror in my view," Biden said during the memorial service at the University of Minnesota.
Throughout his remarks, the President recalled his decades-long friendship with Mondale as he urged the nation to follow the late Minnesotan's example.
In a particularly poignant moment, the President recalled the tragic car accident in which his then-wife Neilia Hunter Biden and daughter Naomi died, and talked about how Mondale and his wife, the late Joan Mondale, were there for him.

     Biden calls former VP Walter Mondale a ‘giant’ of political history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mondale “was a giant in American political history,” Biden said of Mondale, known to friends as “Fritz.” He added that Mondale was one of the “toughest, smartest men I’ve ever worked with” both as Senate colleagues and as a mentor when Biden was Obama’s No.
Biden emphasized Mondale’s empathy, recalling his own promise during the 2020 presidential campaign to unite the country.
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar described once being an intern who climbed under chairs and a table to carry out a furniture inventory when Mondale was vice president.
Mondale followed a trail blazed by his political mentor, Hubert H. Humphrey, serving as Minnesota attorney general before replacing Humphrey in the Senate.
He was Carter’s vice president from 1977 to 1981.
