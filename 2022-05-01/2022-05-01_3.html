     Summary: Everton vs Chelsea: Frank Lampard and the Toffees find themselves with six must-win games remaining, beginning when the Blues visit Goodison Park on Sunday (Watch live at 9 am ET, on USA Network and online via NBCSports.com).
EVERTON vs CHELSEA STREAM LIVEDefeat to Liverpool last weekend saw Everton (29 points – 18th place) tumble into the bottom-three for the first time all season after ending six straight matchweeks in 17th, which is now occupied by Burnley (31 points), who have thus far played one more game than Everton.
By the time they kick off at Goodison Park on Sunday, the Toffees could five points behind with the Clarets taking on 19th-place Watford (22 points) on Saturday (WATCH HERE).
Every point that Burnley pick up makes the task that much taller for Everton, who must navigate a difficult stretch of fixtures to end the season — Chelsea home, Leicester away, Watford away, Brentford home, Crystal Palace home and Arsenal away.

     How Everton beat Chelsea 1-0: Richarlison strike gives Lampard's side vital three points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everton kept their Premier League survival hopes alive after Richarlison’s second-half strike gave them a 1-0 win over Champions League-chasing Chelsea at Goodison Park.
Everton began brightly and caused Chelsea problems right from the start.
Everton then had Jordan Pickford to thank as two world-class saves kept Chelsea at bay.
Everton held on for the final seven minutes of stoppage-time to claim a monumental three points and reduce the deficit between themselves and 17th-placed Leeds United to two points.
For third-placed Chelsea, they now sit five points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and six ahead of Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

Vitaliy Mykolenko wasted a golden chance to double Everton’s lead, before Jordan Pickford made a series of stunning saves to rescue Everton at the other end.

     The Opposition View: Everton vs Chelsea | Lampard faces former side
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a difficult Merseyside Derby last week, Everton have another really trying tie on Sunday when Chelsea come visiting.
Thomas Tuchel and Chelsea have not been the same machine they were earlier this season.
With trophies under their belt this season and still a chance for one more via the FA Cup, Chelsea has done well through a trying year in their own right.
RBM: What has substantively changed regarding Chelsea since the earlier days of this season - apart from the obvious ownership circumstances?
RBM: Will Thomas Tuchel be safe with Chelsea, given that the man who so routinely fired Chelsea managers no longer has that power?
