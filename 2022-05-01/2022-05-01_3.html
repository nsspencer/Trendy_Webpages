     No honeymoon for Macron as thousands protest at May Day rallies in France
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Macron has dismissed such criticism and insisted he has more economically sound policies for tackling the problem.
His France Unbowed party is currently in talks with the Socialist Party about a pre-election pact.
Macron comfortably won another term in the election’s second round last Sunday, garnering 58.5 percent of the vote to defeat far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
The parliamentary election, which takes place over two rounds on June 12 and 19, is the country’s next political battleground.
“Without MPs to support him, Emmanuel Macron will be powerless to apply his harmful project for France and his unfair choices for the French,” Le Pen said in a video shared with her supporters on Sunday.
