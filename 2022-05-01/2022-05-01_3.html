    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) -Arsenal regained fourth spot in the Premier League as they ground out a 2-1 victory away at West Ham United thanks to a second-half header by Brazilian defender Gabriel at the London Stadium on Sunday.
The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City.
Arsenal have 63 points from 34 games with Tottenham on 61 points, also with four games left to play.
‚ÄúYou have to find a way to win and today we won ugly.
We have to recognise that is the way we had done it,‚Äù said Arteta, who is trying to deliver Champions League football for the first time since 2016-17.

Ben White misses out on the day with a tight hamstring, per Arsenal.
Kurt Zouma, who has been dealing with an ankle problem, makes a somewhat early and surprising start for West Ham.
It‚Äôs a surprisingly strong lineup from West Ham, who played a Europa League semifinal on Thursday night and have to go away this coming Thursday to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Eintracht Frankfurt.

The uncertainty from Arsenal's point of view is certainly clear to see, with West Ham proving to be difficult to break down and keep quiet.
Gabriel Magalhaes restored his side's lead shortly into the second half, but West Ham look far from down and out at the moment.

     Summary: Chelsea looks well placed to qualify for the Champions League despite now being only three points ahead of Arsenal with four games remaining after losing 1-0 at Everton.
It‚Äôs a result ‚Äî secured by Richarlison ‚Äî that gives Everton renewed hope of avoiding relegation after a 68-year stay in the top division.
Everton relied on Jordan Pickford‚Äôs saves to preserve the win ‚Äî denying Cesar Azpilicueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Thiago Silva.
Before scoring against Leicester, Son also provided the opener in the 22nd minute by delivering a corner for the unmarked Harry Kane to head into the bottom corner to end a five-game goalless run.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice and close and we‚Äôll have to keep going for the rest of the season,‚Äù Holding said.

     How Arsenal beat West Ham 2-1: Gabriel gives Arsenal advantage in Champions League race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal restored their place in the top four as they defeated West Ham 2-1 at the London Stadium.
Goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel either side of a Jarrod Bowen volley were enough for the Gunners, as they reclaimed their two point advantage over Spurs.
Holding's first half header - is first goal in the Premier League - stunned a cagey affair into life after 38 minutes, with Bowen levelling for the hosts on the stroke of half-time.
However, Arsenal restored their lead nine minutes into the second half, as Gabriel found himself unmarked at the back post before managing to beat Lukasz Fabianski.
The Hammers failed to respond to the setback, with their intentions firmly on Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

     Summary: Arsenal's Gabriel heads the ball to score his sides second goal of the game during the English Premier League soccer match between West Ham United and Arsenal at the London stadium in London, Sunday, May 1, 2022.
(AP Photo/Ian Walton) APHeaders from defenders Gabriel and Rob Holding nudged Arsenal closer to a return to the Champions League with a 2-1 victory at West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday.
Saka picked out Holding, who nodded in his first Premier League goal almost six years after his debut.
The second half started at a frantic pace as Bowen was shown a yellow card for simulation as he avoided Ramsdale‚Äôs lunge, amid a breathless spell for West Ham that ended abruptly when Arsenal scored again.
Arsenal qualified for the Champions League for 19 successive seasons until failing to do so in 2017.
