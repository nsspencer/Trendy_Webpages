     Rob Font almost unrecognisable after five-round beating from Marlon Vera at UFC Vegas 53
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC bantamweight Rob Font suffered nasty facial injuries during his main event match-up against Marlon â€˜Chitoâ€™ Vera on Saturday night.
Font started well at UFC Vegas 53 and landed a near-record number of significant strikes for a UFC bantamweight fight throughout the bout but ultimately the fight started to turn against him in the later rounds.
In the third frame, Vera landed a flying knee that wobbled Font, who fell to the floor after a couple of seconds.
Font hit the floor again in the fourth round when Vera landed a kick to the face.
As Font missed weight in the build-up to their fight, he was not eligible for the bonus and Vera instead walked away with double money.

     5 biggest takeaways from UFC on ESPN 35: Rob Font must reevaluate after back-to-back losses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I donâ€™t think Marlon Vera wins that fight against Rob Font in the main event if it happened a few years ago.
Not that he wouldnâ€™t be capable, but he didnâ€™t have the maturity or execution that he showed over five rounds at an earlier stage of his career.
He was outlanded 271 to 159 in significant strikes (the largest negative margin in UFC history for a fighter who won a decision).
The three knockdowns he landed were critical, and the damage he inflicted on Fontâ€™s face was impossible to ignore.
Whether Vera can navigate through that top five and get his hands on UFC gold remains to be seen.
