     Summary: Everton kept their Premier League survival hopes alive after Richarlison’s second-half strike gave them a 1-0 win over Champions League-chasing Chelsea at Goodison Park.

     Richarlison boosts Everton’s survival hopes with winner against Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Richarlison struck the only goal that condemned Chelsea to a fourth successive Premier League defeat at Goodison Park and left Thomas Tuchel openly worrying about his team’s Champions League qualification prospects.
Richarlison will consider it a small price to pay if his contribution ultimately hauls in Burnley or Leeds.
Everton’s Jordan Pickford saves a close-range shot from Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger in the second half at Goodison Park.
Richarlison won it under pressure from Rüdiger only for Chelsea to recover possession through Silva.
Goodison was in uproar and should have been celebrating the luxury of a second goal minutes later.
