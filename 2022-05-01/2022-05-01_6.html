     Soccer-Arsenal earn crucial win at West Ham in top-four hunt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) -Arsenal regained fourth spot in the Premier League as they ground out a 2-1 victory away at West Ham United thanks to a second-half header by Brazilian defender Gabriel at the London Stadium on Sunday.
The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City.
Arsenal have 63 points from 34 games with Tottenham on 61 points, also with four games left to play.
‚ÄúYou have to find a way to win and today we won ugly.
We have to recognise that is the way we had done it,‚Äù said Arteta, who is trying to deliver Champions League football for the first time since 2016-17.

     How Arsenal beat West Ham 2-1: Gabriel gives Arsenal advantage in Champions League race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal restored their place in the top four as they defeated West Ham 2-1 at the London Stadium.
Goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel either side of a Jarrod Bowen volley were enough for the Gunners, as they reclaimed their two point advantage over Spurs.
Holding's first half header - is first goal in the Premier League - stunned a cagey affair into life after 38 minutes, with Bowen levelling for the hosts on the stroke of half-time.
However, Arsenal restored their lead nine minutes into the second half, as Gabriel found himself unmarked at the back post before managing to beat Lukasz Fabianski.
The Hammers failed to respond to the setback, with their intentions firmly on Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

It‚Äôs a result ‚Äî secured by Richarlison ‚Äî that gives Everton renewed hope of avoiding relegation after a 68-year stay in the top division.
Everton relied on Jordan Pickford‚Äôs saves to preserve the win ‚Äî denying Cesar Azpilicueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Thiago Silva.
Before scoring against Leicester, Son also provided the opener in the 22nd minute by delivering a corner for the unmarked Harry Kane to head into the bottom corner to end a five-game goalless run.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON -- It has long felt as though Arsenal's absence from Europe this season would provide them a telling advantage at some stage, and Sunday's 2-1 win at West Ham was it.
- Report: Arsenal's Champions League hopes boosted by beating West HamPerhaps they spent the week working on set pieces?
Jarrod Bowen's deflected equaliser restored parity on the stroke of half-time before West Ham faltered at the back again, failing to deal with Saka's delivery as Gabriel Martinelli returned the ball back across goal for Gabriel to head beyond Lukasz Fabianski.
West Ham surrendered any hope of gatecrashing the top four a while ago, and Sunday was their 52nd game of a gruelling campaign, 11 more than Arsenal have played.
It is also a result that confirms Arsenal will play European football in some form next season, the Europa League at a minimum.
