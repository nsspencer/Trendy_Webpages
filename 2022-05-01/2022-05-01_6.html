     How Arsenal beat West Ham 2-1: Gabriel gives Arsenal advantage in Champions League race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal restored their place in the top four as they defeated West Ham 2-1 at the London Stadium.
Goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel either side of a Jarrod Bowen volley were enough for the Gunners, as they reclaimed their two point advantage over Spurs.
Holding's first half header - is first goal in the Premier League - stunned a cagey affair into life after 38 minutes, with Bowen levelling for the hosts on the stroke of half-time.
However, Arsenal restored their lead nine minutes into the second half, as Gabriel found himself unmarked at the back post before managing to beat Lukasz Fabianski.
The Hammers failed to respond to the setback, with their intentions firmly on Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

     Soccer-Arsenal earn crucial win at West Ham in top-four hunt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) -Arsenal regained fourth spot in the Premier League as they ground out a 2-1 victory away at West Ham United thanks to a second-half header by Brazilian defender Gabriel at the London Stadium on Sunday.
The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City.
Arsenal have 63 points from 34 games with Tottenham on 61 points, also with four games left to play.
“You have to find a way to win and today we won ugly.
We have to recognise that is the way we had done it,” said Arteta, who is trying to deliver Champions League football for the first time since 2016-17.

     Summary: Arsenal travel across London to face West Ham today in a tough test with implications for the European places.
Ben White misses out on the day with a tight hamstring, per Arsenal.
Kurt Zouma, who has been dealing with an ankle problem, makes a somewhat early and surprising start for West Ham.
It’s a surprisingly strong lineup from West Ham, who played a Europa League semifinal on Thursday night and have to go away this coming Thursday to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Eintracht Frankfurt.

     Arsenal's Champions League return is within their grasp after big win at West Ham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON -- It has long felt as though Arsenal's absence from Europe this season would provide them a telling advantage at some stage, and Sunday's 2-1 win at West Ham was it.
- Report: Arsenal's Champions League hopes boosted by beating West HamPerhaps they spent the week working on set pieces?
Jarrod Bowen's deflected equaliser restored parity on the stroke of half-time before West Ham faltered at the back again, failing to deal with Saka's delivery as Gabriel Martinelli returned the ball back across goal for Gabriel to head beyond Lukasz Fabianski.
West Ham surrendered any hope of gatecrashing the top four a while ago, and Sunday was their 52nd game of a gruelling campaign, 11 more than Arsenal have played.
It is also a result that confirms Arsenal will play European football in some form next season, the Europa League at a minimum.

Players from West Ham and Arsenal argue after an incident near the end of the match at the London Stadium.

     Summary: Chelsea looks well placed to qualify for the Champions League despite now being only three points ahead of Arsenal with four games remaining after losing 1-0 at Everton.
It’s a result — secured by Richarlison — that gives Everton renewed hope of avoiding relegation after a 68-year stay in the top division.
Everton relied on Jordan Pickford’s saves to preserve the win — denying Cesar Azpilicueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Thiago Silva.
Before scoring against Leicester, Son also provided the opener in the 22nd minute by delivering a corner for the unmarked Harry Kane to head into the bottom corner to end a five-game goalless run.
“It’s nice and close and we’ll have to keep going for the rest of the season,” Holding said.

     Summary: If you have earned three wins from three against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham United you do not need to show your working.
West Ham were able to stifle attacks at source with Rob Holding, Gabriel and Mohamed Elneny in particular taking much too long to get the ball up field.
With Rice driving West Ham forward they looked more than a match for their hosts with a Manuel Lanzini shot well blocked by Holding.
West Ham were prepared to push forward in search of an equalizer even if it meant leaving the visiting center forward with all the space he wanted to attack, correctly gambling that he would not make them pay.
Michail Antonio and Tomas Soucek entered the fray late on, Bowen and Rice completed 90 minutes ahead of the biggest games of their West Ham careers.

     Summary: Rob Holding starred at both ends of the pitch in our 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, scoring his first Premier League goal to break the deadlock, then helping the defence to stand firm and see out the win in the second half.
"Yeah, we were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half time," he said to Arsenal Media after the game.
"It would have been nice to go in one-nil, but he gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play."
It was only Holding's second league start since January, though he has been instrumental in helping the side close out wins in recent months as a substitute.
"Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on!"
