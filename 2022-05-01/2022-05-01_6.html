     Summary: Axl Rose teamed up with crossover country star Carrie Underwood this weekend for a historic rendering of two Guns N' Roses classics.
Thank you Axl Rose, for making this lifelong dream come true!!!
Underwood has long been a Gun N' Roses fan, and wore a band t-shirt during the Stagecoach show.
“We were nowhere near Las Vegas, so naturally I said, ‘Let’s go to Las Vegas with the band and go see GNR play!
Couldn’t waste that opportunity, so I abandoned my husband, abandoned my children, went to Vegas, and saw Guns N’ Roses.

     Carrie Underwood brings pop-country bombast, and a grinning Axl Rose, to Stagecoach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pose makes for dramatic images, as the former “American Idol” winner certainly understands.
(Consider that Twain, who headlined Stagecoach in 2017, returned to the desert recently not for Stagecoach but for Coachella, where she appeared with Harry Styles.)
She found the pathos in the shopworn clichés of “Cry Pretty,” which featured actual fireworks to go along with the metaphorical kind.
A choir flanked the singer for that one, then stuck around for “See You Again,” which Underwood dedicated to Naomi Judd, whose death was announced Saturday.
For all their differences in age and background, in Underwood he’d found an A-list star who still believes in spectacle — and who still believes in him.

     Watch Carrie Underwood and Axl Rose Turn Stagecoach Into Paradise City With Two Guns N’ Roses Songs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Carrie Underwood’s band broke into the opening strains of “Sweet Child o’ Mine” at the Stagecoach Festival Saturday, it seemed like business as usual.
But within a few bars, she let loose the closely held secret that, tonight, paradise would be a shared experience.
“Give it up for Axl Rose!”Her rock god wasn’t limiting himself to just one song.
The Stagecoach show was a substantially different one than what she’s doing in Vegas, and not just because of the bucket-list 10-minute cameo by Rose.
While Underwood mentioned Judd, the act that preceded her on the main stage, Brothers Osborne, took their tribute a step further.
