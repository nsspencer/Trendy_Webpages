     Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Star in the White House Correspondents’ Dinner: The Reality Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, that much-maligned evening of political and media schmoozing formerly known as the “nerd prom,” returned Saturday night after a two-year Covid-19 hiatus.
It may not be the most obvious place for an obsessively-followed, newish celebrity couple to make their red carpet debut.
Enter Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: Couple of Substance.
Unlike Drew Barrymore, who wore a Lanvin dress with floor-sweeping sleeves, Ms. Kardashian and Mr. Davidson didn’t vamp for the photographers, or get caught taking giggly selfies with fellow attendees like Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell.
Mr. Davidson didn’t even pull any silly faces, as his “Saturday Night Live” characters often do.

     Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Make Their Red Carpet Debut in Style
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the past few months, the budding romance between Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson has proven to be as stylish as it is surprising.
Last night, the newly-minted couple finally made their red carpet debut, attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in looks that adhered to the event’s style mandate of classic, old world glamour.
Davidson, meanwhile, wore a sharp black suit by Prada with a skinny tie and rectangular sunglasses, finishing off the look with a very Davidson twist: a pair of lace-up Vans.
While their style as a couple has thus far had a charming sense of unpredictability, their red carpet debut marked the perfect sartorial marriage of Kardashian’s flair for the fashion-forward and Davidson’s laid-back “scumbro” style.
For their big night out in Washington, D.C., it seems Kardashian and Davidson have finally found their style sweet spot as a couple, and it’s proven to be just as captivating—and unexpected—as their romance.
