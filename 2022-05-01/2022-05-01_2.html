     May Day rallies in Europe honor workers, protest govts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May Day is a time of high emotion for participants and their causes, with police on the ready.
On Sunday, police detained 164 people for demonstrating without permits and resisting police at the square, the Istanbul governor’s office said.
In Italy, after a two-year pandemic lull, an outdoor mega-concert was set for Rome with rallies and protests in cities across the country.
Italy’s three main labor unions were focusing their main rally in the hilltop town of Assisi, a frequent destination for peace protests.
This year’s slogan is “Working for peace.”“It’s a May Day of social and civil commitment for peace and labor,” said the head of Italy’s CISL union, Daniela Fumarola.

     May 1, International Workers’ Day: A brief history of resistance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FRANCE 24 takes a look back at the history of May 1 as International Workers’ Day, a day of protests, parades and an annual challenge to the status quo.
Against this backdrop, France is expecting the largest and most raucous May Day rallies it has seen in decades.
The federation, which advocated for parliamentary democracy while affirming its belief in the Marxist idea of the inevitability of class struggle, decided to designate May 1 as International Workers’ Day.
The US labour movement’s campaign for an eight-hour day burgeoned despite the violent end to the Haymarket movement.
French labour unions won a comprehensive victory when then-prime minister Georges Clemenceau put in place a 40-hour week in 1919.

     A gloomy May Day awaits Nigerian workers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The majority of Nigerian workers have to make do with a monthly minimum wage of 30,000 Naira (US$72).
Only 17 percent of Nigerian workers hold jobs that pay enough to get them out of poverty.
This will cause overall inflation and food prices to continue to increase well into 2023, a pointer that Nigerian workers are in for a very rough ride during the next several months.
The rising cost of living has left Nigerian workers with a stark choice.
A starting point is to learn how India successfully addressed its food shortages and rising food prices.
