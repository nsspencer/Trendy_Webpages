     May Day rallies in Europe honour workers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Citizens and trade unions in cities around Europe are taking to the streets for May Day marches, and to put out protest messages to their governments.
The marches on Sunday where notable in France where the holiday to honour workers was being used as a rallying cry against newly re-elected President Emmanuel Macron.
In Italy, after a two-year pandemic lull, an outdoor mega-concert was set for Rome with rallies and protests in cities across the country.
In France, the May Day rallies are meant to show Macron the opposition he could face in his second five-year term and to power up against his centrists before June legislative elections.

     Summary: *All results from games played on Saturday, April 30, 2022GAME ONEROCHESTER 3, SYRACUSE 0 / 7 (BOX)Cade Cavalli pitched really well.
His replacement, Jordan Weems, also pitched really well; if it wasn’t for Nick Plummer’s bunt single in the sixth, Syracuse would’ve been no-hit in fact!
GAME TW0SYRACUSE 4, ROCHESTER 2 / 7 (BOX)The Mets faced not one, but two old friends- Logan Verrett and Tyler Clippard.
The Mets 2011 third-round draftee got tagged for three runs, while Clippard tossed a scoreless seventh.
Daytona scored a few more in the eighth, but St. Lucie had enough insurance to weather the storm.

     May 1, International Workers’ Day: A brief history of resistance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FRANCE 24 takes a look back at the history of May 1 as International Workers’ Day, a day of protests, parades and an annual challenge to the status quo.
Against this backdrop, France is expecting the largest and most raucous May Day rallies it has seen in decades.
The federation, which advocated for parliamentary democracy while affirming its belief in the Marxist idea of the inevitability of class struggle, decided to designate May 1 as International Workers’ Day.
The US labour movement’s campaign for an eight-hour day burgeoned despite the violent end to the Haymarket movement.
French labour unions won a comprehensive victory when then-prime minister Georges Clemenceau put in place a 40-hour week in 1919.
