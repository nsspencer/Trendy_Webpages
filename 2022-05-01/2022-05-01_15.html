    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES -- A sold-out crowd rose to its feet after Clayton Kershaw recorded the 2,697th regular-season strikeout of his career Saturday in the fourth inning, breaking a Los Angeles Dodgers record that Don Sutton held across five decades.
He recorded two more strikeouts that inning, then tipped his cap to recognize another standing ovation as he approached the third-base dugout.
When Kershaw finished the top half of the sixth inning, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts approached him on the bench and told him to "enjoy this."
In the other four instances, Kershaw didn't finish any worse than fifth in Cy Young voting.
"I don't wanna just pitch to pitch," said Kershaw, who returned to the Dodgers on a one-year, $17 million contract.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But no Dodgers pitcher has done it as well, as consistently, and for as long as Kershaw.
Kershaw vs. Koufax debate is settledWe can only guess the heights Koufax, the pitcher Kershaw is most often compared to, would’ve reached if fate played out differently.
In any comparison with Koufax, Kershaw has longevity on his side.
Koufax had an other-worldly 1.37 ERA at Dodger Stadium, but a much more mortal 2.57 ERA on the road.
Kershaw also benefitted from the friendly pitching confines of Dodger Stadium, but his splits during that seven-year stretch are less extreme (1.77 at home; 2.46 on the road).

     Summary: As Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully once said of future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw: “He’s done it.” The “it,” of course, was Kershaw’s No-Hitter at Dodger Stadium on June 18, 2014.
Kershaw sends a heartfelt thank you for the thunderous ovation he received from the 52,613 fans at Dodger Stadium who witnessed his remarkable franchise record-setting feat on Saturday night.
“I think that he is arguably the best pitcher of our generation.
Clayton’s used him as a mentor, and Sandy watches every start that Clayton makes, so I think it’s a great comparison.
The entire staff at ThinkBlueLA.com extends our sincerest congratulations to Clayton Kershaw and his family for this tremendous accomplishment – undoubtedly with more on the way.
