     Summary: The crash occurred while Biden was away in Washington mere weeks after he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
But there was Fritz and Joan; they embraced me,” Biden said referring to Mondale by his longtime nickname.
The Covid-19 pandemic had delayed the memorial for Mondale, who died in April 2021 at the age of 93.
Biden referred to Mondale on Sunday “one of the great giants in American history.
“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright,” Biden said at the Washington National Cathedral.

     Biden Calls Former VP Mondale 'Giant' of Political History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mondale “was a giant in American political history,” Biden said of Mondale, known to friends as “Fritz.” He added that Mondale was one of the “toughest, smartest men I've ever worked with” both as Senate colleagues and as a mentor when Biden was Obama’s No.
Biden emphasized Mondale’s empathy, recalling his own promise during the 2020 presidential campaign to unite the country.
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar described once being an intern who climbed under chairs and a table to carry out a furniture inventory when Mondale was vice president.
Mondale followed a trail blazed by his political mentor, Hubert H. Humphrey, serving as Minnesota attorney general before replacing Humphrey in the Senate.
He was Carter's vice president from 1977 to 1981.
