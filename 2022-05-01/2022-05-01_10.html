     Son double as Tottenham beats Leicester 3-1 in push for CL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLONDON (AP) — Son Heung-min's double after Harry Kane's header gave Tottenham a 3-1 victory over Leicester on Sunday that kept the Champions League-chasing side two points behind north London rival Arsenal in the Premier League.
Tottenham is still trying to overhaul Arsenal from fourth place in the remaining four games that includes their derby meeting on May 12.
Son provided Tottenham's opener in the 22nd minute by delivering a corner for the unmarked Harry Kane to head into the bottom corner to end a five-game goalless run.
Leicester scored a consolation in stoppage time when Kelechi Iheanacho sent a low shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.
With Leicester 11th in the standings, winning the competition is the only way back into Europe next season.

It is entirely possible they rotate for this match, considering they played a near full-strength squad just three days ago.

     Son Heung-min leads Tottenham past Leicester to bolster top-four bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Where would Tottenham be without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min?
“It’s a very important result because there is a lot of pressure at this stage of the season.
Harry Kane wheels away after scoring the opening goal against an under-strength Leicester on Sunday.
Nampalys Mendy almost gifted Kane his second 10 minutes later with a sloppy backpass that forced Kasper Schmeichel into action.
“We’re frustrated at conceding the first two goals,” said Rodgers, who also handed 21-year-old Lewis Brunt his first Premier League appearance.

     Summary: Tottenham claimed a critical win in their bid for a top four finish with a 3-1 win over Leicester on Sunday.
Harry Kane headed Tottenham into the lead mid-way through the first half and Son-Heung Min doubled the lead on the hour.
The result was enough for Spurs to move into fourth, on 61 points, ahead of Arsenal's match at West Ham later in the day.
When I hit it I could see the way the ball flied and I was happy to score that.
We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."

     Tottenham 3-1 Leicester: Harry Kane and Son Heung-min help Spurs keep pace with Arsenal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On days like these, when Son Heung-min and Harry Kane find their groove, it is hard to imagine goals might be ever be scarce at Tottenham.
Son whipped the ball to the near post and Kane escaped Daniel Amartey to head past Schmeichel at the near post.
There is no team guaranteed to help Kane back to form quite like Leicester.
Leicester's Turkish centre-half seemed favourite but the sight of the Spurs defender charging his way in full-flow caused him to hesitate.
That's a really poor second goal.
