    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers star Clayton Kershaw made history on Saturday night by setting a new franchise record, passing Don Sutton for the most regular-season strikeouts in Dodgers history.
The Dodgers ace claimed he wasn’t expecting that type of response, per ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez:“It’s special,” Kershaw said after producing another solid outing in the Dodgers’ 5-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers.
While it took Sutton 550 appearances to get his 2,696 strikeouts, Kershaw broke the mark in just his 383rd.
Kershaw boasts a 2.35 ERA in four starts and has 30 strikeouts in 23 innings pitched.
He was infamously pulled from a perfect game after seven innings in his first start of the season.

     Clayton Kershaw moved by ovation for breaking Los Angeles Dodgers' career strikeouts record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES -- A sold-out crowd rose to its feet after Clayton Kershaw recorded the 2,697th regular-season strikeout of his career Saturday in the fourth inning, breaking a Los Angeles Dodgers record that Don Sutton held across five decades.
He recorded two more strikeouts that inning, then tipped his cap to recognize another standing ovation as he approached the third-base dugout.
When Kershaw finished the top half of the sixth inning, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts approached him on the bench and told him to "enjoy this."
In the other four instances, Kershaw didn't finish any worse than fifth in Cy Young voting.
"I don't wanna just pitch to pitch," said Kershaw, who returned to the Dodgers on a one-year, $17 million contract.
