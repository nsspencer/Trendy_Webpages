     Angelina Jolie exits train station as air-raid sirens go off during Ukraine visit, video shows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressLVIV, Ukraine – Hollywood actress and U.N. humanitarian Angelina Jolie made a surprise visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday.
During her visit, Jolie hastily exited a train station "as air-raid sirens went off" in the city, according to video tweeted by Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist for Bellingcat, and by Reuters.
The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming Russian offensive, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.
“She was very moved by (the children’s) stories,” Kozytskyy wrote.
“Plenty of people who saw Ms. Jolie in the Lviv region could not believe that it was really her.
