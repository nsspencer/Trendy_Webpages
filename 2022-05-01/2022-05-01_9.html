    </h2>

     Summary: "It is very embellished, very exaggerated, very structured," fashion historian and curator Kate Strasdin said of Gilded Age style in a video interview.
The Gilded Age was a 30-year period during which industrialists and real estate magnates saw their fortunes ascend to staggering heights thanks to the rapid expansion of trains, factories, and urban centers.
According to Strasdin, American dressmakers wouldn't have their moment until World War I disrupted the supply of European goods to the US.
"American women are having to actually travel there, so that's the first sign of enormous wealth — to actually get yourself there for the fittings," she said.
Several of such gowns from Adelaide Frick, the wife of industrialist and art collector Henry Clay Frick, reside at The Frick in Pittsburgh, which houses a number of Gilded Age designs.
