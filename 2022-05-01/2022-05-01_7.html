ETTV channel: ABCLive stream: WatchESPNIf you aren’t around a TV to check out this NBA matchup, you can stream the game with ABC, WatchESPN or via their mobile apps.
If you don’t have a cable login to access ABC for a live stream, you can get a free trial from YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, AT&amp;T TV Now, FuboTV, or Sling TV to stream the game.
The Grizzlies surprisingly aren’t going to get much rest after playing Friday, but that could potentially work in their favor.
If Desmond Bane and Dillon Brooks continue playing strong two-way basketball, the Grizzlies have a great chance to win this series.

     3 Best NBA Prop Bets Today Warriors vs. Grizzlies Game 1 (Trust Steph Curry, Dillon Brooks)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 defensive rating in the league during the regular season, and it held opponents to 48.0 points in the paint per game (good for 12th in the NBA).
Unless Morant’s jumpshot improves, I can’t see him getting to the rim at will the way he did in the regular season.
Dillon Brooks OVER 18.5 Points (-115)Dillon Brooks has been an up-and-down performer in the playoffs so far, but he has cleared this line in three of his six playoff games.
Brooks did shoot just 3-for-18 in Game 5, but the volume is there where he should be able to clear this number.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warriors at Grizzlies OddsWarriors Odds -2 Grizzlies Odds +2 Over/Under 221.5 Time 3:30 p.m.
Memphis’ saving grace has been their play in the fourth quarter, a quarter where their stars have risen to the occasion and got this team back in a winning position.
However, I think much of their fourth quarter success was due to the offense, or lack thereof, of Minnesota as opposed to their own play.
The Grizzlies simply can not rely on tremendous fourth quarter scoring in order to win games, especially against this Warriors team.
Golden State ranks second in the NBA this postseason in fourth quarter scoring, scoring 30.6 points per game in the fourth quarter, which ranks just behind Memphis.
