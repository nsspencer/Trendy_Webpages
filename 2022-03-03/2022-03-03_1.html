     Russian, Belarusian athletes banned from Winter Paralympic Games as IPC reverses ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons explains why they reversed their decision and now won't allow Russia and Belarus athletes to complete in Beijing.
"We do believe that the Russian Paralympic Committee and the Belarussian Paralympic Committee may take legal action," Parsons said.
The Russian Paralympic Committee called the decision to expel its athletes "baseless" and "illegal."
"[Russian athletes] have not done anything which could be interpreted as being involved in the current political complications," the RPC said.
"No one is happy with the decision, but certainly this is the best decision for the Paralympic Games to go ahead," Parsons said.
