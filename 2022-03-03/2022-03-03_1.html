     Google Doodle Celebrates Start of Winter Paralympic Games 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     GoogleThe Winter Paralympic Games 2022 open Friday in Beijing, and Google is marking the occasion with an animated Doodle that highlights the sports in which athletes will participate.
Beginning as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948, the Paralympic Games have grown into the world's largest sporting event for athletes with physical impairments.
Since 1960, the Paralympics have taken place during the same year the Olympic Games are held.
Officially known as the XIII Paralympic Winter Games, this year's competition will run from March 4-13 and be the biggest winter Paralympics to date.
The Games will be broadcast on NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Olympic Channel, NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports App.

     Winter Paralympics set to get underway in Beijing following exclusion of Russia and Belarus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As with last month's Winter Olympics, events will be held in the three separate zones of central Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou.
Having previously said that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as neutrals, on Thursday, the IPC barred 71 athletes from Russia and 12 from Belarus from competing at the Games.
Belarus has been a key military ally for Russia during the conflict, serving as a launch point for troops into Ukraine.
On the Canadian team, cross-country skier Brian McKeever will compete in his sixth and final Paralympic Games at the age of 42.
The countermeasures that were in place for the Winter Olympics in February are also being implemented for the Paralympics.
