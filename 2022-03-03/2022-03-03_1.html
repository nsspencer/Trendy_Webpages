     Supreme Court lets Kentucky attorney general take over defense of state’s abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Kentucky’s Republican attorney general can pick up the legal fight over a restrictive abortion law that the state’s Democratic governor no longer wishes to defend.
Already this term, the court has allowed a Texas abortion law, the strictest in the nation, to remain in force.
But the state’s newly elected attorney general, Republican Daniel Cameron, asked the full 6th Circuit to take another look at the law.
But by a vote of 8-1, the Supreme Court reversed that ruling Thursday, allowing the attorney general to step in to defend the law.
Their prospects of success may depend on what the Supreme Court ultimately says about the abortion right when it decides the Mississippi case in the next several months.

     U.S. Supreme Court lets Republican defend Kentucky abortion curbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     March 3 - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday let Kentucky's Republican attorney general seek to restore a restrictive abortion law after the state's Democratic governor dropped defense of the statute when lower courts struck it down.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron's request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Circuit Court of Appeals had already issued its decision in the case, it should have used its discretion to let the state's attorney general pursue a rehearing or an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Beshear's administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the U.S. Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

     In support of Ketanji Brown Jackson for Supreme Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On February 25, 2022, President Biden delivered by nominating Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the next, and first Black woman, Supreme Court Justice.
Judge Jackson is undoubtedly qualified and equipped to be our next Supreme Court Justice.
If confirmed, Jackson will become the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice and will further diversify the Court in an unprecedented way by becoming the first federal public defender to grace the Supreme Court bench, and therefore the only sitting Supreme Court Justice that has represented defendants in criminal proceedings.
Nominating and confirming Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court will advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in our judicial system.
For example, President Ronald Regan fulfilled his promise to nominate the first woman to the Supreme Court by tapping Sandra Day O’Connor for a Supreme Court vacancy in 1981.

Supporting or opposing a judge for a circuit court vacancy doesn’t always translate to a “yes” or “no” vote for the Supreme Court.
But given the higher stakes for a Supreme Court confirmation, it can be easier for a judge to win support for a lower court vacancy.
Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Manchin backed Barrett’s nomination to the Seventh Circuit but voted against her for the Supreme Court.

     Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend controversial abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky's Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.
Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law.
Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state's attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.
In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.

     WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Kentucky’s Republican attorney general may step in to defend a state ban on a common abortion procedure, allowing the case to continue in lower federal courts.
Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron sought to defend a 2018 law banning dilation and evacuation abortions after Democratic Gov.
Cameron, an independently elected attorney general, argued that he had an obligation to defend the state's law.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit struck it down.
Abortion rights groups say it is the safest and most common second-trimester abortion procedure.

     Mitch McConnell became the latest Republican to confirm what legal experts across the spectrum have said — Ketanji Brown Jackson is immensely qualified to serve as the next Supreme Court justice.
Take it from Mitch McConnell – there is “no question” Judge Jackson is qualified for the Supreme Court.
Burgess Everett: “”She’s clearly a sharp lawyer with an impressive resume,” McConnell said today.
Yesterday McConnell said “no question” she’s qualified.”Washington Examiner: McConnell: ‘No question’ Ketanji Brown Jackson qualified for Supreme Court“Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell heaped praise on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson following a meeting with the Supreme Court nominee Wednesday.”“The Kentucky Republican said there was ‘no question’ that she was a very qualified and intelligent pick for the Supreme Court.”Conservative legal experts and the Fraternal Order of Police have also endorsed Judge Jackson’s nomination, citing her immense qualifications.
There is little doubt that she has the temperament, intellect, legal experience, and family background to have earned this appointment.

     Climate-change activists rallied outside the Supreme Court on 28 February as the justices heard arguments in the case West Virginia vs Environmental Protection Agency.Credit: Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe US Supreme Court heard oral arguments this week in a controversial lawsuit that could deal yet another blow to President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.
Under Biden, the EPA has declined to revive the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and is instead crafting its own plan for power plants.
This means there are no actual regulations to challenge in this Supreme Court case, says GianCarlo Canaparo, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington DC.
Which way does it look like the Supreme Court will go?
The Supreme Court arguments came on the same day that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report, which documents the accelerating impacts of climate change on people and natural ecosystems.
