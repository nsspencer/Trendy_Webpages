     Former Illinois House speaker indicted on racketeering and bribery charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Michael J. Madigan, the former speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday on 22 federal charges related to racketeering, bribery and attempted extortion, prosecutors said.
Madigan served as the leader of the Illinois House of Representatives for 38 years, the longest tenure for a state speaker in modern US history.
The indictment alleges he "carried out illegal activity at Madigan's direction," charging him with crimes related to racketeering and bribery.
"For years, the Government has been trying to force Mike McClain to cooperate in its quest against former Speaker Mike Madigan.
These latest charges are nothing more than the Government's continued attempt to pressure Mike McClain to do the Government's bidding."

     Illinois politicians react to indictment of Michael Madigan: ‘Another chapter in the sad story of corruption’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As the longtime Illinois House speaker and Democratic Party chairman, Michael Madigan loomed over state politics for decades, leaving the top Democrats still seeking to move out of his shadow cautious in their reactions to news of his indictment Wednesday on federal corruption charges.
When the House took a recess, several Democrats, including at least one Madigan ally, declined immediate comment as they headed into a closed-door caucus meeting.
One of the 19 House members who publicly opposed Madigan’s reelection as speaker last year, however, praised news of the indictment.
“After hearing from just one witness, they dismissed it as a partisan stunt and protected Madigan and his political power at the time.
“It’s a shame that it has to come to an indictment all the time to get accountability.”Love 1 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0

     Illinois' ex-House speaker Michael Madigan charged in $3 million federal racketeering scheme
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Madigan, 79, is charged in the 22-count indictment with racketeering conspiracy, using interstate facilities in aid of bribery, wire fraud and attempted extortion.
Madigan, who resigned from the Legislature a year ago, was the longest-serving state House speaker in modern U.S. history and was nicknamed the “Velvet Hammer” for his insistence on strict party discipline.
A procession of senior Illinois politicians, including three governors, was charged during his tenure, but politicians long believed the savvy Madigan would never be among them.
The federal complaint came after more than half a dozen Democrats — including Madigan’s longtime chief of staff — were charged with crimes or had their offices and homes raided by federal agents.
Madigan, the son of a Chicago precinct captain, became House speaker in 1983.
