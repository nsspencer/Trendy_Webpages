     Supreme Court lets GOP Kentucky attorney general defend state's restrictive abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The U.S. Supreme Court building is seen January 24, 2022 in Washington, DC.
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Kentucky's Republican attorney general can step in to defend the state's restrictive abortion law, which had been abandoned by another top official.
And the ruling comes as the high court has yet to decide a case involving a strict Mississippi abortion law case that could end or erode longstanding abortion protections guaranteed by its landmark 1973 ruling in the Roe v. Wade case.
Cameron then asked the Supreme Court to reverse that decision.
Breyer is retiring this summer from the Supreme Court.

     US Supreme Court allows Kentucky official to defend abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The procedural ruling allows the Republican administration in Kentucky to pursue an appeal of a lower court ruling against state law.
The United States Supreme Court has allowed Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to take over the defence of a restrictive abortion law after the state’s Democratic governor dropped the case when lower courts struck down the statute.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron’s request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Beshear’s administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the US Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

     Supreme Court lets Kentucky attorney general take over defense of state’s abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Kentucky’s Republican attorney general can pick up the legal fight over a restrictive abortion law that the state’s Democratic governor no longer wishes to defend.
Already this term, the court has allowed a Texas abortion law, the strictest in the nation, to remain in force.
But the state’s newly elected attorney general, Republican Daniel Cameron, asked the full 6th Circuit to take another look at the law.
But by a vote of 8-1, the Supreme Court reversed that ruling Thursday, allowing the attorney general to step in to defend the law.
Their prospects of success may depend on what the Supreme Court ultimately says about the abortion right when it decides the Mississippi case in the next several months.

     Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend controversial abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky's Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.
Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law.
Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state's attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.
In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.

Sen. Lindsey Graham speaks during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 15, 2020.
Supporting or opposing a judge for a circuit court vacancy doesn’t always translate to a “yes” or “no” vote for the Supreme Court.
But given the higher stakes for a Supreme Court confirmation, it can be easier for a judge to win support for a lower court vacancy.
Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Manchin backed Barrett’s nomination to the Seventh Circuit but voted against her for the Supreme Court.

     This US Supreme Court decision could derail Biden’s climate plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Under Biden, the EPA has declined to revive the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and is instead crafting its own plan for power plants.
This means there are no actual regulations to challenge in this Supreme Court case, says GianCarlo Canaparo, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington DC.
Which way does it look like the Supreme Court will go?
In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, and by extension other sources.
The Supreme Court arguments came on the same day that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report, which documents the accelerating impacts of climate change on people and natural ecosystems.
