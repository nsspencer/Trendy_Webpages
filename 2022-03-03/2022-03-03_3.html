     A fire breaks out at a nuclear plant during a Russian assault, Ukraine says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service.
A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.
Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.
Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

     U.N. Atomic Agency Says Fire at Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Didn't Affect Essential Equipment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, prompting concern from the international community about a nuclear disaster and renewed fears about Moscow’s tactics as it continues its advance in the country.
In Kyiv, officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the fire that broke out at the facility didn’t affect essential equipment, the agency said, lessening initial concerns that the shelling damaged a reactor.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video posted on social media that Russia’s actions show that “Europe needs to wake up.”“Only immediate action can stop the Russian troops.
Do not let Europe die in the nuclear catastrophe,” he said, according to a translation posted online by Ukraine’s U.S. embassy, accusing Russia of “nuclear terror.”Mr. Zelensky spoke with President Biden about the incident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
The fire at the nuclear power plant comes after Moscow deepened its military offensive in southern Ukraine, penetrating the city of Kherson and pushing toward Zaporizhya, as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agreed to establish “humanitarian corridors” to allow civilians to leave besieged cities.

     Russians seize nuclear plant after attack, Ukrainian officials sayEnlarge this image toggle caption Vadim Ghirda/AP Vadim Ghirda/APUkrainian officials said on Friday that fire at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been extinguished, but that the facility is now under Russian control from fighting that has left an unknown number of casualties.
Ukraine's nuclear regulator issued a statement confirming that the fire was out.
The Ukrainian state company that runs the plant posted a message Friday on Telegram saying that the plant is now under Russian control.
"The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site," the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was "critical."
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe.

     Russian forces were occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Friday.
Ukrainian officials said the fire ignited at the power plant after Russian troops opened fire on it.
“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier on Twitter.
“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.
The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant are a different design, have a stronger containment structure and don’t feature graphite.

     Ukrainian nuclear power plant fire extinguished as Russian troops 'occupy' facility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Russian troops have occupied Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, where a fire that had threatened potential disaster was extinguished in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Ukraine's nuclear regulator.
Separately, Ukraine's nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the "administrative building and the checkpoint at the station are under occupiers' control."
Galushchenko said he had "demanded" the intervention of the IAEA in the security of Ukraine's nuclear power plants for several days, and called for "real intervention," including from NATO.
"Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.
The facility accounts for one-fifth of the average annual electricity production in Ukraine, according to Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator.
