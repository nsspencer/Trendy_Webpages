     Russia’s Shelling of Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Sparks Alarm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine—Russian shelling in southern Ukraine caused a fire at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant before Russian troops moved into the facility, highlighting the increasingly indiscriminate nature of Moscow’s war while raising fears that it could lead to a global environmental disaster.
The fire, extinguished Friday morning, erupted at the Zaporizhzhia power plant’s training facility which is adjacent to its six nuclear reactors in the town of Enerhodar, Ukraine’s emergency service said.
None of the six reactors, one of which is currently operational, were affected by the fire and there was no radiation leak at present.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces were occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Friday.
Ukrainian officials said the fire ignited at the power plant after Russian troops opened fire on it.
“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier on Twitter.
“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.
The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant are a different design, have a stronger containment structure and don’t feature graphite.

     Ukrainian nuclear power plant fire extinguished as Russian troops ‘occupy’ facility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CNN —Russian troops have occupied Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, where a fire that had threatened potential disaster was extinguished in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Ukraine’s nuclear regulator.
In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.
Separately, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the “administrative building and the checkpoint at the station are under occupiers’ control.” It said staff are working on the power units to ensure their stable operation.
Plant came under attack“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.
The facility accounts for one-fifth of the average annual electricity production in Ukraine, according to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator.
