     Fire breaks out at a nuclear power complex during a Russian assault, Ukraine says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, the Ukrainian government said.
Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles.
The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant.
The fire had not affected essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.
It said that personnel at the plant were “taking mitigatory actions.”

The fire burned after Ukraine's foreign minister said on Twitter earlier on Friday that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was under fire from Russian troops.
"The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site," the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was "critical."
The IAEA said the fire had not affected essential equipment and that Ukraine's nuclear regulator reported no change in radiation levels, according to the AP.
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe.

     U.N. Atomic Agency Says Fire at Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Didn't Affect Essential Equipment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, prompting concern from the international community about a nuclear disaster and renewed fears about Moscow’s tactics as it continues its advance in the country.
In Kyiv, officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the fire that broke out at the facility didn’t affect essential equipment, the agency said, lessening initial concerns that the shelling damaged a reactor.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video posted on social media that Russia’s actions show that “Europe needs to wake up.”“Only immediate action can stop the Russian troops.
Do not let Europe die in the nuclear catastrophe,” he said, according to a translation posted online by Ukraine’s U.S. embassy, accusing Russia of “nuclear terror.”Mr. Zelensky spoke with President Biden about the incident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
The fire at the nuclear power plant comes after Moscow deepened its military offensive in southern Ukraine, penetrating the city of Kherson and pushing toward Zaporizhya, as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agreed to establish “humanitarian corridors” to allow civilians to leave besieged cities.

     Fire extinguished at Ukraine nuclear plant after Russian attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian forces were occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Friday.
Ukrainian officials said the fire ignited at the power plant after Russian troops opened fire on it.
“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier on Twitter.
“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.
The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant are a different design, have a stronger containment structure and don’t feature graphite.

     Ukrainian nuclear power plant fire extinguished, as Zelensky condemns Russia's 'terror' attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A fire that threatened potential disaster at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant following an attack by Russian troops has been extinguished, authorities said early Friday morning.
In a Facebook post early Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a "terror attack" by intentionally firing at the power plant -- potentially risking the lives of millions.
The very fact Russia is launching attacks in the vicinity of Ukrainian nuclear plants is extremely dangerous, said Zelensky, while referencing the Chernobyl tragedy and its victims.
"Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.
The facility accounts for one-fifth of the average annual electricity production in Ukraine, according to Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator.

     War in Ukraine: Fire extinguished at Europe's largest nuclear power plant after Russian attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine — A fire at Europe’s biggest nuclear plant ignited by Russian shelling has been extinguished, Ukrainian authorities said Friday, and Russian forces have taken control of the site.
1 at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar.
The shelling of the plant came as the Russian military pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing Ukrainian city and gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea.
Earlier, nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to one of its six reactors.
Prior to the shelling, the Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant.
