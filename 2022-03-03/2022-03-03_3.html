     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".

     Taiwan was hit by widespread power outages this Thursday.
As reported by Nikkei Asia, Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, and Kaoshiung, the second biggest city in the country, were affected by this power outage.
Taiwan Power Co. said in a brief statement that its southern power grid system encountered a malfunction causing blackouts in southern Taiwan.
Knock-on effects from the outage triggered power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well.
The malfunction took place at Kaohsiung’s Hsinta Power Plant, the biggest power plant in southern Taiwan, according to the company.

     If convicted of the charges against him, former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan could face several years in prison.
Following the announcement of charges Tuesday evening, Madigan released the following statement:"I was never involved in any criminal activity.
The charges against Madigan come nearly one year after his resignation from the state legislature after nearly three decades in power.
Madigan was the longest-serving state House speaker in modern U.S. history and was nicknamed the “Velvet Hammer” for his insistence on strict party discipline.
Among them was Michael McClain, who served with Madigan in the House in the 1970s and early 1980s before becoming a lobbyist.

     Taiwan blames negligence for mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, March 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday blamed negligence during annual maintenance at a major power plant for a mass outage across the island that caused the lights to go off for more than 5 million households, though the crucial semiconductor sector was largely unaffected.
The power cut began shortly after 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) after a problem at the Hsinta power plant and while it impacted all parts of Taiwan the most extensive problems were in the south, especially the major port city of Kaohsiung.
Power has now mostly been restored, at least in northern Taiwan, and efforts are continuing in the south to reconnect those still without electricity.
The cut affected about a third of Taiwan's power supply, hitting some 5 million households, Wang said.
TSMC said "power dips" at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.

     Michael J. Madigan: Former Illinois House speaker is indicted on racketeering and bribery charges

     Taiwan's main iPhone plant hit by power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A power blackout that affected 5 million households across Taiwan, also affected the science park where iPhone processor firm TSMC is based.
Taiwan has been affected by power outages before, but in this case, the cause was reportedly a malfunction.
According to Nikkei Asia, the Taiwan Power Company says that an unspecified malfunction occurred at its Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung.
Power outages can cause the loss of chips being produced, and it's not clear what TSMC was making at the time.
The process required the Hsinta Power Plant to be disconnected from other power plants, all of which must then be restarted.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan is gradually restoring power supply, the state-run power operator said on Thursday, after much of the island’s south and 5 million households were hit by an outage caused by a malfunction at a major power generation plant.
“It all needs further proof and investigation, which requires evidence.”The cut affected about a third of Taiwan’s power supply, hitting about 5 million households, Wang said.
Power should start being restored in southern Taiwan from midday, she added, although it was not immediately clear what caused the problem.
TSMC said “power dips” at some of its fabs ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.
