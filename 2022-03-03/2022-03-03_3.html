Matt Jones, who played quarterback at Arkansas, clocked a 4.37 in 2005 running at his future NFL position – 0.01 faster than Maryland’s Vernon Davis in 2006.
Twelve tight ends ran the 40 at the combine on Thursday.

     Jelani Woods Stands Out at NFL Combine With Record-Breaking 40-Yard Dash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Draft stock in Jelani Woods is skyrocketing and one lucky NFL team will end up selecting the Virginia tight end in next month's NFL Draft.
Woods is participating in the NFL Scouting Combine this week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
Woods then ran a stunning 4.61 40-yard dash, which, according to NFL Research, is the fastest 40-yard dash ran by a tight end of Woods' height since 2003.
NFL GMs will be salivating over the combination of size, strength, mobility, and pass-catching abilities on display by Jelani Woods, whose name will surely begin to rise on front office draft boards around the league as we approach the NFL Draft on April 28th.
Which team should select Jelani Woods in the NFL Draft?

     Tennessee football: Ranking all four Vols by most to prove at 2022 NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This year’s NFL Draft Combine is underway, and Tennessee football has four players taking part in the event.
Some players need this event more than others based on their production in 2021 and how important physical gifts are for their position.
Here is our ranking of Tennessee football’s former players based on the most to gain (and lose) at the 2022 NFL Combine, which began on Tuesday, March 1 and will last through Monday, March 7.
These numbers alone prove that, and Jones being such a playmaker for Tennessee football will be a selling point on his own.
However, his football speed is obvious as is his ability to produce, so he likely won’t be hurt by anything at this event.

     Isaiah's Like(ly) ThatIt's a shame that Isaiah Likely didn't run the 40, but it seems like he didn't need to.
The speedy tight end from Coastal Carolina showed off everything he's got during the drills.
Likely became synonymous with the deep ball in his time in college, and used his speed and agility to show out at the Combine.
I can't recall seeing the young man drop a ball.
Likely also recorded the highest vertical jump among the tight ends at 36.00".

     Whatever they're putting in the water in Indianapolis, one thing is certain: this year's wide receiver class is fast.
Not long after Ohio State wideout Chris Olave clocked an official 4.39 second 40-yard dash (unofficial 4.26-second 40), Baylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton one-upped him but logging an official 4.28 second sprint per the NFL (4.21 unofficial for Thornton).
If Thornton's time would have been official, it would have been the fastest 40-yard dash in the history of the NFL combine.
The current record for fastest 40-yard dash at the combine is held by John Ross, who clocked in a 4.22 seconds in 2017.
9 overall that year, and was the third wide receiver off the board.
