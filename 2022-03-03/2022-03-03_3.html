     Russia’s Shelling of Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Sparks Alarm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine—Russian shelling in southern Ukraine caused a fire at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant before Russian troops moved into the facility, according to local authorities and international observers, highlighting the increasingly indiscriminate nature of Moscow’s war while raising fears that it could lead to a global environmental disaster.
The fire, extinguished Friday morning, erupted at the Zaporizhzhia power plant’s training facility that is adjacent to its six nuclear reactors in the town of Enerhodar, Ukraine’s emergency service said.
None of the six reactors, one of which is currently operational, were affected by the fire and there was no radiation leak at present.

     A fire breaks out at a nuclear plant during a Russian assault, Ukraine says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service.
A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.
Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.
Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

     Russian forces were occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Friday.
Ukrainian officials said the fire ignited at the power plant after Russian troops opened fire on it.
“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier on Twitter.
“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.
The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant are a different design, have a stronger containment structure and don’t feature graphite.

     More than 18,000 people have arrived in Germany from Ukraine since the Russian invasion just eight days ago, according to the German interior ministry.
"Up until now 18,436 refugees from Ukraine have arrived in Germany,” Maximilian Kall, interior ministry spokesperson told reporters at a press briefing in Berlin.
So far more than one million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine in just seven days, according to the United Nations.
Half a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crisis since World War II.

     Russian forces have captured Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, according to regional officials.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in the southern Ukraine steppe on the Dnieper River, some 550 kilometres (342 miles) southeast of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and about 525km (325 miles) south of Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986, which has also now been seized by Russian forces.
Later on Friday, local authorities said Russian military forces had seized the power plant, while operational personnel “were monitoring the condition of power units”.
