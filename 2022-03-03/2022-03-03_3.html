     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‘Phoenix Rising’ on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account”.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner”.

     Marilyn Manson has filed a defamation lawsuit in a Los Angeles Superior Court against ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood over her allegations of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred during the course of the relationship from 2007 to 2010.
“I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him before he ruins any more lives,” said Wood.
His complaint comes two weeks before the release of the Amy Berg-directed two-part documentary about Wood’s allegations, Phoenix Rising, which is set to premiere on HBO.
In an Instagram post on March 2, Warner said, “There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year.

     Marilyn Manson accuses Evan Rachel Wood of conspiracy after rape claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rocker Marilyn Manson -- whose real name is Brian Warner -- was 37 when he began dating 18-year-old Evan Rachel Wood (AFP/SUZANNE CORDEIRO) (SUZANNE CORDEIRO)Goth rocker Marilyn Manson on Wednesday filed court proceedings against ex-fiancee Evan Rachel Wood for conspiracy, fraud and defamation after the US actress accused him of raping her.
The complaint accuses Wood and her "romantic partner" actor Illma Gore of fabricating malicious claims against Manson, including fraudulently impersonating an FBI agent to pressure "prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse."
The allegations -- denied by Manson -- were made in the HBO documentary "Phoenix Rising," due to be released later this month.
The former child actress began dating Manson -- whose real name is Brian Warner -- in 2006 when she was 18 and he was 37.
Manson has asked for a jury trial to stop the allegations and to assess and award damages incurred by the singer.

     Marilyn Manson's Ex-Lover Says Evan Rachel Wood's Accusers Group Tried to Recruit Her

     Aurora told Newsweek she met Manson in Vienna, Austria, in January 2011, where Manson was attending an art exhibit.
"I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria," Aurora said.
"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary "one-sided" and "premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation."
"But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable—and this legal action will hold them to account."
