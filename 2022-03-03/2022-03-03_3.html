     'The Dropout' Revisits the Scandalous Tale of Elizabeth Holmes — Where Was the Series Filmed?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Holmes appeared on CNBC's Mad Money on Oct. 16, 2015, the same day Carreyrou's article came out.
"This is what happens when you work to change things.
And then, all of a sudden, you change the world," she said.
Holmes was found guilty on four counts of fraud in January 2022.
Her sentencing is scheduled to take place on Sept. 26, 2022.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Theranos, Holmes was trying to create the medicine and biotech world’s version of Apple.
That led to a precipitous fall for Holmes, the company, and many of its investors.
Elizabeth HolmesThe story of Theranos and the story of its founder are inextricably linked.
Elizabeth Holmes was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Houston.
Well, the Holmes family had its own unfortunate experience with corporate fraud well before Elizabeth founded Theranos.

     How the creator of Hulu’s ‘The Dropout’ tried to think like Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I felt a responsibility to think about her as a human being,” Meriwether says.
It’s the kind of Silicon Valley drama that Hollywood has been agog over.
advertisementThere was the 2019 documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley; there’s an upcoming film adaptation of John Carreyrou’s book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup; and Meriwether’s limited series is based on a 2019 ABC podcast.
That idea of Holmes busting a painfully awkward groove plays out throughout The Dropout as a coping mechanism.
“It was interesting shooting [The Dropout] after everybody went through these really personal experiences with [COVID-19] testing devices and home testing.

     The Dropout gazes into the abyss of Elizabeth Holmes’ unblinking eyes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That’s a good idea, especially in a country where healthcare is often expensive and inaccessible.
It came from Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford dropout whose good idea ballooned into a company with a $9 billion valuation.
It’s still a good idea.
And finally there’s Elizabeth herself, whose faith in her own technology is both admirable and delusional, propelled by a hubristic tendency to believe her own hype.
It’s Silicon Valley in a nutshell—pressure, money, ego—but the danger is that not all who fake it will eventually make it.

     ‘The Dropout’ Miniseries Episode 3 Recap: ‘Green Juice’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Dropout Green Juice Season 1 Episode 3 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next Photo: Beth Dubber/ HULUIf episode two found Elizabeth taking her first major step into scammery at the Novartis demo, “Green Juice” ups the fraud ante in a big way.
This despite saying she “hated” green juice earlier in the episode.
It certainly motivates her in “Green Juice,” as she gets both praise for her young woman CEO status and advice on that front from poached Apple designer Ana Arriola (Nicky Endres) and expresses a hyperawareness of the tightrope she’s walking.
But the show manages, in “Green Juice,” to acknowledge that reality without letting Elizabeth off scot-free.
Sunny, who has spent the whole episode languishing and feeling dismissed — by the discriminatory airport security guys and Elizabeth alike — is in.
