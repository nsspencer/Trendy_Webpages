     Joe vs. Carole Struggles in Shadows of Netflix's Tiger King
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nearly two years to the release of “Tiger King,” Peacock has taken the bait, and released its own miniseries “Joe vs. Carole,” which is based on the 2019 Wondery podcast "Joe Exotic: Tiger King."
As is, however, it has little purpose than to remind you of the first time you learned about this incredible saga.
The series repurposes much of what was already stated in the documentary, this time with even more artistic liberties in the storytelling.
Lest anyone has forgotten the story of “Tiger King,” “Joe vs. Carole” takes place in much of the same chronological timeline, while jumping back and forth to give us the origins of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin, two cult leaders in their worlds of big cat ownership.
The two clash over what is right about big cat ownership, and as certain sequences show, Baskin has efforts separate from her work to raise awareness and legislature.

    </h2>

     You go deeper,” John Cameron Mitchell, who plays Joe “Exotic” Schreibvogel on the Peacock limited series, says.
Joe vs. Carole dramatizes the rivalry between big cat enthusiast Carole Baskin (played by Kate McKinnon here), who sets out to shut down Joe’s venture after learning he’s breeding and using his animals for profit.
I think Joe calmed himself down.

     There’s a Clear Winner in Joe vs. Carole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning.
There are moments in Joe vs. Carole, if you really squint, when the outline of a real person hovers around the edges of McKinnon’s caricature.
He’s worked plenty since, as a director and an actor, but he’s probably not the biggest name the producers of Joe vs. Carole could have landed for such a notable role.
But for the purposes of the series, Mitchell brings a crucial texture and thoughtfulness, rescuing Joe vs. Carole from outright uselessness.
The ragged seams of a hurried cash-in are plainly evident in Joe vs. Carole.
