     Kim Kardashian Officially Removes “West” From Social Media Accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Watch : Kim Kardashian Supports Pete Davidson Amid "Eazy" BacklashKim Kardashian is a Kardashian once again.
One day after a Los Angeles judge approved her request to be legally single, Kim made it Instagram official.
At a hearing on March 2, the judge also granted Kim permission to legally revert back to her maiden name amid her ongoing divorce from Kanye "Ye" West.
So naturally, the SKIMS founder adjusted her social media accounts to reflect the change in the evening on Thursday, March 3.
While her last name "West" has been scrubbed from her Twitter and Instagram accounts, she still proudly promotes her KKW Fragrance brand that bears her married initials.

     Later, West posted an apology to Kardashian but the drama only intensified.
On March 2nd, West posted a music video for his song "EAZY" off his album Donda 2.
The music video has been under fire due to the graphic contents, including the violent kidnapping of Davidson.
The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has shown support for her boyfriend as she liked director James Gunn's tweet, defending Davidson amid the release of the music video.
On social media, Kardashian posted pictures while she hiking with members of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC) and people who were previously incarcerated.

     Kim Kardashian Drops Last Name 'West' From Her Instagram Account
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kim Kardashian is going back to her original moniker.
The reality TV mogul removed the last name West from her Instagram just one day after she was declared legally single.
Kim's petition to be declared legally single amid her divorce proceedings with Kanye "Ye" West was granted Tuesday.
While the ruling means that Kim will legally be dropping West from her last name, it does not mean her divorce is final.
Cochran also asked Kardashian if she's showering them with affection, to which she responded, "Absolutely."
