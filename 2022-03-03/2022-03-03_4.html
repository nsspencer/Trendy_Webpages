     Anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger shouted down by University of North Texas students
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A North Texas candidate running for the Texas House of Representatives to outlaw sex reassignment surgeries for children was shouted and cursed at by students at the University of North Texas in a recently posted social media video.
In the 17-second video, District 63 candidate Jeff Younger can be seen standing at the front of a classroom as students bang on their desks and shout insults at him.
The event was reportedly cut short, and Young Conservatives of Texas’s UNT chapter Chair Kelly Neidert was rushed out of the building.
Tensions at the University of North Texas were so high that President Neal Smatresk sent a campus wide email Feb. 22.
Gender-affirming medical care has become a popular issue among Texas conservatives in recent weeks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) invited Jeff Younger, a Republican running in the 63rd House district in Texas’s state legislature, to speak on Wednesday.
The students also shouted slogans that expressed support for transgender children in the state, who have been targeted by conservative lawmakers in recent weeks.
Anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger came to the University of North Texas and this is how students responded.

Younger is campaigning on making gender-affirming care illegal in the state through legislative statute beyond Abbott’s order.

     Watch: Anti-Trans Jeff Younger Heckled as "Fascist" by Students
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Younger, whose run for Texas House was motivated by a battle over his trans child's care, had to cut his appearance at the University of North Texas short.
An anti-transgender Texas House candidate who lost custody of his trans child got heckled and shut down by students during an appearance at the University of North Texas Wednesday night.
Anne Georgulas, Younger’s ex-wife and the twins’ mother, is a pediatrician who has supported the trans child in her transition.
However, the judge also barred Georgulas from allowing the trans child to undergo “hormonal suppression therapy, puberty blocks, and/or transgender reassignment surgery” without Younger’s consent.
Younger advanced to a runoff in Tuesday’s Republican primary for the House district, as no candidate received a majority of the vote.

     Protesters shut down anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger event at UNT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas House candidate Jeff Younger, who seeks to outlaw transgender youth care, was driven out of an event hosted at the University of North Texas by protesters on Wednesday, March 2.
The event played out on a thread from Twitter user Ismael Belkoura last night, who was posting photos and video from the event.
Younger, who is running for Texas House District 63, was scheduled to speak at an event organized by UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas.
The room where Younger was to speak was filled by protesters who drowned out Younger and organizers with a "F**k these fascists" and "trans rights" chants.
Younger, according to the tweets, only egged on the protesters by asking them to make more noise and proceeded to call the protesters "Communists."

     “I'm a trans person and UNT staff and alum, and I don’t want someone like Jeff Younger speaking at our university,” Jackson told VICE News.
Jackson said he left after about half an hour, but during the time he was there Younger mostly encouraged the students to yell at him.
AdvertisementAfterward, more than a hundred students continued the protest outside, chanting “Protect trans kids” and “Fuck Jeff Younger,” Belkoura said.
University of North Texas police eventually arrived at the scene, as did Texas Highway Patrol officers dressed in riot gear, according to Belkoura.
“We will fight to protect all trans youth across Texas,” Chase Strangio, the ACLU’s deputy director for transgender justice, said following the ruling Wednesday.

     At the University of North Texas in Denton, far-left activists shut down the Young Conservatives of Texas (@YctUnt) event featuring the father who lost custody of his trans child.
He was joined by Kelly Neidert, a student who is part of the conservative students' group.
What an embarrassing group of babies they have attending the University of North Texas.
The Young Conservatives of Texas called the activists "abusers" and accused them of "child abuse" as the activists yelled "protect trans kids."
A student at my university (University of North Texas) saw me and a friend printing flyers for our conservative club- he had a meltdown and stormed out of the library screaming at us.
