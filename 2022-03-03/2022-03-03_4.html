     Tyquan Thornton's Blazing 40-Yard Dash Falls Short of NFL Combine Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tyquan Thornton's blazing 40-yard dash falls short of NFL Combine record originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoBaylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton unofficially had the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record for about two hours.
On the opening night of drills at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine Thursday, Thornton ran his 40-yard dash in an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds, besting John Ross III's all-time event record of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton's 4.28 ties him with Champ Bailey and a few others for the ninth-fastest time in NFL Combine history.
Projected first-round pick Chris Olave out of Ohio State finished in an unofficial 4.26 seconds, and his official time was a 4.39.
Thornton may not have claimed the combine record, but he certainly boosted his draft stock with his blazing-fast 40.

     Although the 2022 NFL Combine has been technically underway for a few days, Thursday represents the first official day of measurements and on-field drills.
Group 1 of the NFL Combine includes the quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends.
This year, the NFL has moved those on-field drills to the late afternoon to try and bring in some primetime ratings.
Which of the wide receivers will firmly establish themselves as a first-round talent?

     Quarterbacks also performed some of those tests, though teams are much less interested in those times than they are in the on-field drills for passers.
Organizations in need of a future signal-caller paid close attention to how tightly the ball departed the hand of each quarterback, as well as the accuracy, strength and arc of downfield throws.
Most of these passing duos have not worked together in the past, though, so any slight synchronization issues might be overlooked.

     Jelani Woods Stands Out at NFL Combine With Record-Breaking 40-Yard Dash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Draft stock in Jelani Woods is skyrocketing and one lucky NFL team will end up selecting the Virginia tight end in next month's NFL Draft.
Woods is participating in the NFL Scouting Combine this week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
Woods then ran a stunning 4.61 40-yard dash, which, according to NFL Research, is the fastest 40-yard dash ran by a tight end of Woods' height since 2003.
NFL GMs will be salivating over the combination of size, strength, mobility, and pass-catching abilities on display by Jelani Woods, whose name will surely begin to rise on front office draft boards around the league as we approach the NFL Draft on April 28th.
Which team should select Jelani Woods in the NFL Draft?

     Nine wide receivers post 40-yard dash times under 4.4 seconds at NFL combine, led by Tyquan Thornton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS -- In a stadium that celebrates speed with Indy cars in the concourse, the wide receivers at the NFL scouting combine carved out a little history Thursday, the first night of on-field workouts.
Baylor's Tyquan Thornton led the way as nine wide receivers officially clocked sub-4.4-second times in the 40-yard dash inside Lucas Oil Stadium.
The group of pass catchers still left a contrail, as the nine sub-4.4 clockings were the most by the wide receivers at the combine in any year evaluated since 2006.
Kansas State wide receiver Yamon Figurs ran the fastest 40 at the combine that year at 4.30.
Penn State's Jahan Dotson ran a 4.43, and Arkansas wide receiver Treylon Burks ran a 4.55.

From Tyquan Thornton's official 4.28 to Velus Jones' 4.31 to nine -- yes, nine -- other wideouts running under 4.40, it's probably the fastest receiver group in combine history.
