But it was a dominant second half for the Aggies who played stifling defense, and outscored Bama 50-31 in the second half.
Here’s what we learned:Quenton Jackson and Tyrece Radford dominatedRadford dropped a season-high 22 points against the Crimson Tide Wednesday.
He made big shots all night and gave every Crimson Tide defender a hard time when they tried to guard him.
The Crimson Tide turned the ball over 10 times in the second half to finish with 19 turnovers, including some in pivotal moments.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     Liberty’s Malik Willis turning heads with NFL Scouting Combine approach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS — Liberty quarterback Malik Willis — a projected first-round pick — was seen in a viral video stopping on the streets of town to give unidentified items from his suitcase to a man in need on the street.
ESPN analysts Matt Miller and Todd McShay both reported that Willis has been doing “very well” in his private 15-minute-long formal interviews with teams at the NFL combine.
Malik Willis has impressed teams at the NFL combine with his on- and off-the-field actions.
Willis told at least one team that already has a young quarterback in the mix, “I know you aren’t drafting me,” a source said.
Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett’s hands measured 8.5 inches from pinky to thumb, meaning he has the smallest hands of any first-round quarterback since Michael Vick recorded that same measurement in 2001.

     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     NFL Combine takeaways: Malik Willis, Kenny Pickett, Desmond Ridder star in QB workouts for 2022 draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The quarterback class in the 2022 NFL Draft may not seem strong in relation to other years, and for some it might lack true star power.
Liberty's Malik Willis, Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Cincinnati's Desmond Ridder did their best to change that during their work on and off the field at the NFL Combine.
When he was throwing, Pickett showed off strong touch and accuracy as he completed passes at different levels of the field.
Ridder didn't have the same "Wow" moments with his arm that Willis did, and he wasn't as accurate in making all the throws the way Pickett was.
Given the high number of QB-needy teams, Willis, Pickett and Ridder should all be gone by No.

Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

     Commanders HC Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Considering his unparalleled mix of talent, skill and physical profile—Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton really shouldn’t draw many, if any, comparisons.
That man, of course, is Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera—who spoke with CBS Sports at the NFL Scouting Combine on Wednesday.
“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
