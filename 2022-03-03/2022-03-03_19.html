    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Matchup Iowa Hawkeyes 21-8 Michigan Wolverines 16-12 9 PM ET Fox Sports 1Michigan basketball can add another significant win to its tournament resume by beating Iowa tonight and here are three keys, as well as a prediction.
Following a huge win over Michigan State on Tuesday night, Michigan basketball is closing in on an NCAA Tournament berth but with two regular-season games left there is still work to do.
The Iowa Hawkeyes are up next.
Here are three keys to doing that and a prediction for Michigan basketball.
On the road against Iowa, Michigan lost the turnover battle by just one.

     Michigan Loses On Senior Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a year filled with ups and downs, it's unfortunate that senior night in Ann Arbor was a during a down resulting in a 82-71 loss to Iowa.
Starting with the big 24-point win over Purdue back on Feb. 10, Michigan has alternated wins and losses ever since — a span of eight games.
One of those wins for U-M was against Iowa in Iowa City, but unfortunately, the Hawkeyes haven't lost since.
Michigan actually shot the three ball at a decent clip tonight (37%) but they were nowhere near as hot as Iowa was from distance (58%).
Michigan also didn't get much from its bench, which has been an issue too many times this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A few weeks ago, Iowa men's basketball had a sour taste in their mouths courtesy of the Michigan Wolverines.
In a game both teams had to win, Iowa made the necessary winning plays down the stretch and enacted their revenge.
Iowa defeated Michigan 82-71 for their fifth consecutive win and their eighth win in nine games.
With the win, Iowa improves to 22-8 overall and 12-7 in Big Ten play while Michigan falls to 16-13 overall and 10-9 in the Big Ten.
As expected, Michigan made runs in the second half but Iowa answered each time.

     Michigan basketball returns to consistent inconsistency with 82-71 loss to Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As its season teetered, the question haunted Michigan basketball for the better part of three months.
Media members repeatedly lobbed the inquiry at head coach Juwan Howard, at his assistant coaches, at his players before and after nearly every game.
Once again, it's a mystery U-M was unable to solve in an 82-71 loss to No.
Iowa shot 52.6% from the field and finished 11-of-19 from 3-point range on a night U-M made seven 3s.
The evening felt somewhat off-kilter from the start as Michigan celebrated six seniors without its head coach, who has one game left on a five-game suspension.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Clearly, this long, athletic Michigan team bothered Iowa around the rim, where Iowa missed numerous lay-ups and dunks.
24 hours after the Iowa-Ohio State game, Michigan played at Wisconsin and, well, you know what happened.
With those results in the books, there are now five teams within a game of one another for the last double-bye spot - Iowa, Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers, and Michigan.
Ohio State’s form is as up and down as Michigan State and Michigan - lose at home to Iowa, win over Indiana, win at Illinois (!!
Michigan State and Michigan can still get to the 4-seed.
