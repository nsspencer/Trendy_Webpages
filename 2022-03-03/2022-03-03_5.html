     Although the 2022 NFL Combine has been technically underway for a few days, Thursday represents the first official day of measurements and on-field drills.
Group 1 of the NFL Combine includes the quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends.
This year, the NFL has moved those on-field drills to the late afternoon to try and bring in some primetime ratings.
Which of the wide receivers will firmly establish themselves as a first-round talent?
Feel free to share your observations as the NFL Combine truly gets underway at 4 p.m.

     Jelani Woods Stands Out at NFL Combine With Record-Breaking 40-Yard Dash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Draft stock in Jelani Woods is skyrocketing and one lucky NFL team will end up selecting the Virginia tight end in next month's NFL Draft.
Woods is participating in the NFL Scouting Combine this week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
Woods then ran a stunning 4.61 40-yard dash, which, according to NFL Research, is the fastest 40-yard dash ran by a tight end of Woods' height since 2003.
NFL GMs will be salivating over the combination of size, strength, mobility, and pass-catching abilities on display by Jelani Woods, whose name will surely begin to rise on front office draft boards around the league as we approach the NFL Draft on April 28th.
Which team should select Jelani Woods in the NFL Draft?

     Heading into the Combine we knew that Austin Allen had some pretty impressive game film to rely on.

Tight ends were asked to run different types of routes and make a couple of different catches.
In each drill Allen showed good hands as he plucked the ball out of the air or made a nice catch with the ball out in front him.

     Quarterbacks also performed some of those tests, though teams are much less interested in those times than they are in the on-field drills for passers.
Organizations in need of a future signal-caller paid close attention to how tightly the ball departed the hand of each quarterback, as well as the accuracy, strength and arc of downfield throws.
Most of these passing duos have not worked together in the past, though, so any slight synchronization issues might be overlooked.
