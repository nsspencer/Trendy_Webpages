     Pitt QB Kenny Pickett's hand measures 8 1/2 inches at NFL Scouting Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The intrigue around Pickett's hand size has picked up steam in recent weeks, as he declined to have his hand measured at the Reese's Senior Bowl in January due to a double-jointed thumb.
The former Panthers star revealed on Wednesday that he had been doing exercises in an effort to improve his measurement, but downplayed the conversation, saying "whatever it measures, it measures."
Quarterback hand size becomes a hot topic every year at the combine, with some scouts expressing concern about ball security for passers with hands on the small side, especially when battling the elements in rainy and/or cold conditions.

     Tennessee football: Ranking all four Vols by most to prove at 2022 NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This year’s NFL Draft Combine is underway, and Tennessee football has four players taking part in the event.
Some players need this event more than others based on their production in 2021 and how important physical gifts are for their position.
Here is our ranking of Tennessee football’s former players based on the most to gain (and lose) at the 2022 NFL Combine, which began on Tuesday, March 1 and will last through Monday, March 7.
These numbers alone prove that, and Jones being such a playmaker for Tennessee football will be a selling point on his own.
However, his football speed is obvious as is his ability to produce, so he likely won’t be hurt by anything at this event.

     Chig Okonkwo of Maryland ran the fastest 40-yard dash among the tight ends at the NFL Scouting Combine with a 4.52-second showing on Thursday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

Matt Jones, who played quarterback at Arkansas, clocked a 4.37 in 2005 running at his future NFL position – 0.01 faster than Maryland’s Vernon Davis in 2006.
Twelve tight ends ran the 40 at the combine on Thursday.

     Quarterbacks also performed some of those tests, though teams are much less interested in those times than they are in the on-field drills for passers.
Organizations in need of a future signal-caller paid close attention to how tightly the ball departed the hand of each quarterback, as well as the accuracy, strength and arc of downfield throws.
Most of these passing duos have not worked together in the past, though, so any slight synchronization issues might be overlooked.

     NFL Combine results: Malik Willis, Kenny Pickett, Desmond Ridder star in QB workouts for 2022 draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The quarterback class in the 2022 NFL Draft may not seem strong in relation to other years, and for some it might lack true star power.
Liberty's Malik Willis, Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Cincinnati's Desmond Ridder did their best to change that during their work on and off the field at the NFL Combine.
When he was throwing, Pickett showed off strong touch and accuracy as he completed passes at different levels of the field.
Ridder didn't have the same "Wow" moments with his arm that Willis did, and he wasn't as accurate in making all the throws the way Pickett was.
Given the high number of QB-needy teams, Willis, Pickett and Ridder should all be gone by No.

In blocking drills, he looked sharp, showing what he was known for when he played at Oklahoma State.
“I did a lot of fullback (at Virginia), a lot of in-line blocking,” Woods said at the Combine.
Trey McBride, Colorado State, 6-foot-4, 246Speaking of complete tight ends, everything looked easy for McBride in Indianapolis.
He also looked strong in the blocking drills and improved in his route running throughout the day.

Woods is participating in the NFL Scouting Combine this week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
Woods then ran a stunning 4.61 40-yard dash, which, according to NFL Research, is the fastest 40-yard dash ran by a tight end of Woods' height since 2003.
NFL GMs will be salivating over the combination of size, strength, mobility, and pass-catching abilities on display by Jelani Woods, whose name will surely begin to rise on front office draft boards around the league as we approach the NFL Draft on April 28th.
