     Supreme Court Lets Kentucky’s Attorney General Defend Abortion Law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Kentucky’s attorney general, a Republican, may step in to defend a state abortion law struck down by a federal appeals court after the governor, a Democrat, refused to pursue further appeals.
The question in the case was procedural, and the court did not address the constitutionality of the abortion law.
Questions from the conservative justices in the Mississippi case suggested that they may be preparing to overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
Thursday’s decision, in Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Center, No.
20-601, concerned a Kentucky law that challengers said effectively banned the most common method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy, dilation and evacuation.

     C.I.A. Black Sites Are State Secrets, the Supreme Court Rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday shut down efforts by a detainee at Guantánamo Bay to obtain information from two former C.I.A.
contractors involved in torturing him, ruling that the inquiry would impermissibly expose state secrets.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for a badly fractured court, said the main question was whether the information sought by the detainee, known as Abu Zubaydah, would confirm the location of a C.I.A.
black site, which is widely known to have been in Poland.
But as embarrassing as these facts may be, there is no state secret here.”

     UC Berkeley prepares to slash enrollment after California Supreme Court ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court’s decision does not mean the enrollment ruling is guaranteed to stand in the long run.
“It’s tragic that California allows courts and environmental laws to determine how many students UC Berkeley and other public colleges can educate,” Wiener said in a statement.
But the fight at UC Berkeley has brought the issue back to the forefront just as record numbers of high school students await admissions decisions from the prestigious campus.
California has dedicated funding to expand enrollment by 5,000 full-time students at University of California schools and 10,000 full-time students at the California State University System.
UC Berkeley plans to begin mailing admissions offers on March 23.

     Supreme Court lets Kentucky attorney general take over defense of state’s abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Kentucky’s Republican attorney general can pick up the legal fight over a restrictive abortion law that the state’s Democratic governor no longer wishes to defend.
Already this term, the court has allowed a Texas abortion law, the strictest in the nation, to remain in force.
But the state’s newly elected attorney general, Republican Daniel Cameron, asked the full 6th Circuit to take another look at the law.
But by a vote of 8-1, the Supreme Court reversed that ruling Thursday, allowing the attorney general to step in to defend the law.
Their prospects of success may depend on what the Supreme Court ultimately says about the abortion right when it decides the Mississippi case in the next several months.

     US Supreme Court allows Kentucky official to defend abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The procedural ruling allows the Republican administration in Kentucky to pursue an appeal of a lower court ruling against state law.
The United States Supreme Court has allowed Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to take over the defence of a restrictive abortion law after the state’s Democratic governor dropped the case when lower courts struck down the statute.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron’s request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Beshear’s administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the US Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Poland is believed to be the location of a “black site” where the CIA used harsh interrogation techniques against Zubaydah.
The contractors’ testimony “would be tantamount to a disclosure from the CIA itself”, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the ruling.
The Polish investigation concerns the treatment of Zubaydah, who remains held at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The European Court of Human Rights determined that Zubaydah was held in Poland in 2002 and 2003.
The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that Mitchell and Jessen could be subpoenaed, prompting the Justice Department to appeal to the Supreme Court.

     Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend controversial abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky's Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.
Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law.
Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state's attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.
In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.

Supporting or opposing a judge for a circuit court vacancy doesn’t always translate to a “yes” or “no” vote for the Supreme Court.
But given the higher stakes for a Supreme Court confirmation, it can be easier for a judge to win support for a lower court vacancy.
Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Manchin backed Barrett’s nomination to the Seventh Circuit but voted against her for the Supreme Court.

The appeals court concluded that at least some of the information sought by the man’s lawyers should be turned over.
In any event, Gorsuch spends several pages of his dissent laying out the overwhelming weight of evidence confirming that Zubaydah was tortured by the CIA in Poland.
The Court — or, at least, its Republican majority — isn’t always so concerned about ensuring the United States keeps its promises to foreign governments.
It’s unclear just how much this decision will prevent anyone from understanding what happened to Zubaydah in Poland.

     Abu Zubaydah case: Supreme Court blocks torture testimony sought by terrorism suspect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Abu Zubaydah is one of three alleged al Qaeda members who was subjected to water-boarding by the CIA.
CNN —The Supreme Court said Thursday that the US government can – in the name of national security – shield the testimony of two former government contractors from a terrorism suspect who seeks to use the information in a criminal proceeding abroad.
The case highlighted continuing terrorism concerns and examined the role courts play balancing national security interests against calls for greater transparency and government accountability.
In doing so, it overruled the judgment of then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo regarding the potential harm to national security.
Disclosure of that information, the court said, would not cause grave danger to national security.
