File Image / PixabayThe German authorities have arrested the yacht of Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg.
The $600 million vessel Dilbar has been seized while at the Hamburg shipyard of Germany's Blohm + Voss for repairs, news provider Forbes reported on Wednesday.
The vessel is the world's largest motor yacht by tonnage, and Usmanov bought it in 2016.
The case may prompt other authorities around the world to attempt similar actions against the yachts of wealthy Russians.

     German authorities have seized Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s nearly $600 million luxury yacht.
The 512-foot Dilbar, one of the biggest yachts globally, was seized after the European Union announced sanctions against him.
In addition to being the majority shareholder of Metalloinvest, he has links to Vladimir Putin, hence was added to a list of sanctioned individuals by the European Union.
The massive tanks of Dilbar superyacht cost a mind-boggling $783,822 for one re-fuel.
Daily Mail reported, ‘On 28 February 2022, I became the target of restrictive measures imposed by the European Union.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Everton have started to remove all branding connected to Alisher Usmanov firms from the club’s Goodison Park ground ahead of tonight’s FA Cup tie against Boreham Wood.
The ECHO revealed yesterday that the club were looking to immediately remove USM, MegaFon and Yota branding from Goodison after suspending all commercial ties with all three companies.
Tonight's programme will also not feature any USM branding throughout the pages or on the front cover, which have been prevalent for a number of years.
Away from Goodison Park there are also set to be immediate changes to the club’s first-team training kits, which have Megafon as a shirt sleeve sponsor.

     Germany Seizes Russian Oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s Superyacht
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A superyacht belonging to Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov was seized by German authorities in Hamburg on Wednesday, according to Forbes.
The German government has seized the Dilbar, Usmanov’s 512-foot yacht, the publication said, citing three unidentified industry sources.
She is reported to employ 84 full-time crew members, and contain the largest indoor swimming pool installed on any superyacht, at 180 cubic meters.
Some Russian tycoons also still have superyachts docked in European ports, according to a report in Fortune.
He’s the sixth-richest Russian with a fortune of $19.5 billion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index, although that figure includes the Dilbar.

     Everton owner Farhad Moshiri severs business links with sanctioned billionaire Alisher Usmanov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Everton owner Farhad Moshiri has severed business links with Alisher Usmanov in a fresh move which puts further distance between the club and the sanctioned billionaire.
Moshiri stepped down from the board of USM, a Russian holding company that Usmanov founded, within hours of suspending the club's multiple sponsorship ties.
Business databases in Moscow confirmed the move on Thursday, three days after the EU sanction against Usmanov over his "close ties" to Vladimir Putin.
It had long been suggested that his influence on the club is more extensive given the owner has been a business partner.
USM's naming-rights agreement with Everton began in 2017 for the training ground, but was due to expire this year.

     Dilbar, Alisher Usmanov’s $600m superyacht that may – or may not – have been seized in Germany.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.
In the UK, Usmanov has not been facing sanctions and retains full control of his lavish property portfolio and other assets.
