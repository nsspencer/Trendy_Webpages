     U.C. Berkeley Must Freeze Enrollment, California Supreme Court Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It could be harder to get into one of California’s most prestigious universities after the state’s highest court on Thursday declined to reverse a lower-court ruling that capped enrollment at the University of California, Berkeley, at 2020-21 levels.
The decision by the Supreme Court of California left in place a ruling issued last August that ordered the university to freeze student enrollment at 42,347.
The decision was the result of a legal battle with a residents’ group, Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods, that had accused the university of failing to provide enough on-campus housing while at the same time admitting high numbers of students, many of them from other states or countries.
University officials said on Thursday that, as a result of a new analysis that concluded that they needed to include in their head count hundreds of students who would be studying abroad or in Washington, the university would have to cut in-person enrollment by at least 2,500 students in the fall of 2022.

     US Supreme Court allows Kentucky official to defend abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The procedural ruling allows the Republican administration in Kentucky to pursue an appeal of a lower court ruling against state law.
The United States Supreme Court has allowed Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to take over the defence of a restrictive abortion law after the state’s Democratic governor dropped the case when lower courts struck down the statute.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron’s request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Beshear’s administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the US Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

     Kim Kardashian is going back to her original moniker.
The reality TV mogul removed the last name West from her Instagram just one day after she was declared legally single.
Kim's petition to be declared legally single amid her divorce proceedings with Kanye "Ye" West was granted Tuesday.
While the ruling means that Kim will legally be dropping West from her last name, it does not mean her divorce is final.
Cochran also asked Kardashian if she's showering them with affection, to which she responded, "Absolutely."

     Supreme Court rules against disclosure in torture caseEnlarge this image Al Drago/Getty Images Al Drago/Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the federal government can shield former government contractors from testifying about the torture of a post-9/11 detainee.
Indeed, at oral argument, the government refused to say whether it would allow Zubaydah, now detained at Guantanamo Bay, to testify himself about his interrogation.
"We are pleased the Supreme Court confirmed that the United States Government tortured Abu Zubaydah," he said in an email to NPR.
Josh Colangelo-Bryan, a lawyer who represents other Guantanamo Bay detainees, was more critical.
Since 2006, he has been at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and remains there despite having been cleared for release.

     Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend controversial abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky's Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.
Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law.
Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state's attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.
In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.

     UC Berkeley enrollment capped, forcing campus to decline by 3,000 students after state Supreme Court decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lawmakers could try to fast-track a bill to exempt campus enrollment from the state’s environmental quality act, a lawmaker said last month.
While the campus far exceeded its enrollment caps, UC Berkeley built fewer housing slots for students than it had anticipated.
UC Berkeley won’t agree to any enrollment cap, Mogulof, the UC Berkeley spokesperson said.
Bokovoy said UC Berkeley could expand its campus elsewhere in the Bay Area and not in city of Berkeley, such as in nearby Richmond.
Chemerinsky, the UC Berkeley law school dean, said the UC Berkeley case introduces larger questions about the state’s main environmental law and the role courts play in university affairs.

     US Supreme Court allows Kentucky official to defend abortion law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The procedural ruling allows the Republican administration in Kentucky to pursue an appeal of a lower court ruling against state law.
The United States Supreme Court has allowed Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to take over the defence of a restrictive abortion law after the state’s Democratic governor dropped the case when lower courts struck down the statute.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron’s request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Beshear’s administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the US Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

     The Supreme Court hands the CIA a victory in a horrid case about torture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held on Thursday, in United States v. Husayn a.k.a.
The appeals court concluded that at least some of the information sought by the man’s lawyers should be turned over.
In any event, Gorsuch spends several pages of his dissent laying out the overwhelming weight of evidence confirming that Zubaydah was tortured by the CIA in Poland.
The Court — or, at least, its Republican majority — isn’t always so concerned about ensuring the United States keeps its promises to foreign governments.
It’s unclear just how much this decision will prevent anyone from understanding what happened to Zubaydah in Poland.
