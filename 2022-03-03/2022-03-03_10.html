     Supreme Court Lets Kentucky’s Attorney General Defend Abortion Law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Kentucky’s attorney general, a Republican, may step in to defend a state abortion law struck down by a federal appeals court after the governor, a Democrat, refused to pursue further appeals.
The question in the case was procedural, and the court did not address the constitutionality of the abortion law.
Questions from the conservative justices in the Mississippi case suggested that they may be preparing to overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
Thursday’s decision, in Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Center, No.
20-601, concerned a Kentucky law that challengers said effectively banned the most common method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy, dilation and evacuation.

     U.C. Berkeley Must Freeze Enrollment, California Supreme Court Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It could be harder to get into one of California’s most prestigious universities after the state’s highest court on Thursday declined to reverse a lower-court ruling that capped enrollment at the University of California, Berkeley, at 2020-21 levels.
The decision by the Supreme Court of California left in place a ruling issued last August that ordered the university to freeze student enrollment at 42,347.
The decision was the result of a legal battle with a residents’ group, Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods, that had accused the university of failing to provide enough on-campus housing while at the same time admitting high numbers of students, many of them from other states or countries.
University officials said on Thursday that, as a result of a new analysis that concluded that they needed to include in their head count hundreds of students who would be studying abroad or in Washington, the university would have to cut in-person enrollment by at least 2,500 students in the fall of 2022.

     C.I.A. Black Sites Are State Secrets, the Supreme Court Rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday shut down efforts by a detainee at Guantánamo Bay to obtain information from two former C.I.A.
contractors involved in torturing him, ruling that the inquiry would impermissibly expose state secrets.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for a badly fractured court, said the main question was whether the information sought by the detainee, known as Abu Zubaydah, would confirm the location of a C.I.A.
black site, which is widely known to have been in Poland.
But as embarrassing as these facts may be, there is no state secret here.”

     UC Berkeley prepares to slash enrollment after California Supreme Court ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Supreme Court’s decision does not mean the enrollment ruling is guaranteed to stand in the long run.
“It’s tragic that California allows courts and environmental laws to determine how many students UC Berkeley and other public colleges can educate,” Wiener said in a statement.
But the fight at UC Berkeley has brought the issue back to the forefront just as record numbers of high school students await admissions decisions from the prestigious campus.
California has dedicated funding to expand enrollment by 5,000 full-time students at University of California schools and 10,000 full-time students at the California State University System.
UC Berkeley plans to begin mailing admissions offers on March 23.

     Supreme Court rules against disclosure in torture caseEnlarge this image Al Drago/Getty Images Al Drago/Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the federal government can shield former government contractors from testifying about the torture of a post-9/11 detainee.
Indeed, at oral argument, the government refused to say whether it would allow Zubaydah, now detained at Guantanamo Bay, to testify himself about his interrogation.
"We are pleased the Supreme Court confirmed that the United States Government tortured Abu Zubaydah," he said in an email to NPR.
Josh Colangelo-Bryan, a lawyer who represents other Guantanamo Bay detainees, was more critical.
Since 2006, he has been at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and remains there despite having been cleared for release.

     US Supreme Court blocks testimony over Guantanamo detainee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Poland is believed to be the location of a “black site” where the CIA used harsh interrogation techniques against Zubaydah.
The contractors’ testimony “would be tantamount to a disclosure from the CIA itself”, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the ruling.
The Polish investigation concerns the treatment of Zubaydah, who remains held at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The European Court of Human Rights determined that Zubaydah was held in Poland in 2002 and 2003.
The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that Mitchell and Jessen could be subpoenaed, prompting the Justice Department to appeal to the Supreme Court.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The procedural ruling allows the Republican administration in Kentucky to pursue an appeal of a lower court ruling against state law.
The United States Supreme Court has allowed Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to take over the defence of a restrictive abortion law after the state’s Democratic governor dropped the case when lower courts struck down the statute.
A federal appeals court had found that Cameron’s request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late.
Beshear’s administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the US Constitution to obtain an abortion.
Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.

     Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend controversial abortion law

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky's Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.
Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.
Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law.
Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state's attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.
In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.

     Lawmakers could try to fast-track a bill to exempt campus enrollment from the state’s environmental quality act, a lawmaker said last month.
While the campus far exceeded its enrollment caps, UC Berkeley built fewer housing slots for students than it had anticipated.
UC Berkeley won’t agree to any enrollment cap, Mogulof, the UC Berkeley spokesperson said.
Bokovoy said UC Berkeley could expand its campus elsewhere in the Bay Area and not in city of Berkeley, such as in nearby Richmond.
Chemerinsky, the UC Berkeley law school dean, said the UC Berkeley case introduces larger questions about the state’s main environmental law and the role courts play in university affairs.
