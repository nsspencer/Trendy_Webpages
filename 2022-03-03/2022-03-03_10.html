     The biggest Easter egg in ‘The Batman’ involves Barry Keoghan, star of Marvel’s ‘Eternals’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Irish actor Barry Keoghan is a rising star right now, recently playing Druig in Marvel‘s Eternals, following acclaimed performances in dramas like The Killing of a Sacred Deer and Dunkirk.
He also has a role in The Batman, getting surprisingly high billing in the credits.
Keoghan only appears in one scene, but it’s an important one that lays the groundwork for a sequel.
At the end of the movie, we see the incarcerated Riddler (Paul Dano) speaking with another inmate in Arkham Asylum.
But despite those inevitable protestations, Barry Keoghan is undeniably great casting.

     The Batman: Barry Keoghan's Mystery Character Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ✖The Batman is now out to the masses, and the DC Comics epic has undoubtedly left viewers with a lot to process.
The nearly-three-hour blockbuster presented Matt Reeves' unique vision for the DC universe, with a star-studded ensemble cast portraying new takes on iconic characters.
Among a long-rumored member of the cast was Eternals and Dunkirk star Barry Keoghan, who was first publicly added to The Batman shortly after the project's first trailer dropped.
Months of speculation ensued about who Keoghan would be portraying in the film — and fans definitely got their answer within the finished product.
The Batman is now playing exclusively in theaters.

While The Dark Knight’s arrival is front and center, actor Barry Keoghan also has a role in the latest adaptation worth keeping an eye on.
We explore what Barry Keoghan’s role could be in The Batman, share a collection of fan art depicting the actor as The Joker, and explain why the film has been given a PG-13 rating, despite DC fans beckoning for an R-rated superhero film.

     Who plays Joker in 'The Batman'? Barry Keoghan Role Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, Joker (Jack Nicholson) was the main villain.
So wondering if and when the Joker would make his way into The Batman is a perfectly reasonable thought.
This prisoner tells Riddler he can be a new friend, but folks, it seems like we've got ourselves a Joker.
Barry Keoghan is officially credited as "Unseen Arkham Prisoner"... but he's the Joker.
It also makes an interesting case, where Keoghan is playing a key role in both a DC property (The Joker, obviously), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (he plays Druig in Eternals).

While we never see his face, every Batman fan knows exactly who this prisoner is: The Joker.
The question everyone wants to know is, who is The Joker in The Batman?
“So in the comics, these characters often declare their alter egos in response to the fact that there’s a Batman out there.
And so here, we have a Joker who’s not yet the Joker,” he told IGN.
