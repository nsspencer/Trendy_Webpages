     Fire at nuclear power plant from Russian attack sparks fears of 'Fukushima-style meltdown'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fears of an unprecedented nuclear disaster spread rapidly overnight when part of Europe’s largest nuclear plant caught on fire in Ukraine as Russian forces shelled the area.
Nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the facility and had set fire to one of its six reactors.
"The immediate danger to Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant appears to have passed," he tweeted.
"But tonight's events underscore the dangers facing all of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.
And both are concerned about the precedent of a wartime attack affecting a nuclear power plant — an act Acton described as a "illegal and horrific onslaught from Russia."

     Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world.
The first report came from an employee at the plant, who posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”.
Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 2.30am, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”.
Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor.

     In the latest development on Russia’s intensifying attacks on Ukraine, forces pressed on with their invasion by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant in a vital energy-producing city late Thursday.
AdvertisementHere’s what we know about the Zaporizhzhia power plant.
The nuclear plant is located in the city of Enerhodar and can be found on the banks of the Dnieper River in Ukraine.
A spokesman for the nuclear plant told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the facility and had set fire to one of its six reactors.
Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported that “changes in the radiation situation have not been registered,” but stressed that the “loss of the possibility to cool down nuclear fuel will lead to significant radioactive releases into the environment.”“As a result, such an event may exceed all previous accidents at nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant,” the regulator said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Russian troops have occupied Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, where a fire that had threatened potential disaster was extinguished in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Ukraine's nuclear regulator.
Separately, Ukraine's nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the "administrative building and the checkpoint at the station are under occupiers' control."
He said on Telegram that Russian forces "entered the territory of the nuclear power plant, took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant."
"Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.
The Russian government claimed Ukrainian "provocation" had led to a firefight around the nuclear power plant.
