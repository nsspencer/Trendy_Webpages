     Rory McIlroy cards blistering 65 to take lead at Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     McIlroy’s superb opening round of 65 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida suggested he remains of a mind to right that Emirates Club wrong.
“Regardless of when it comes in the season, it’s nice to win,” McIlroy said.
I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.
“I did all the hard stuff right,” he said.
There’s been a lot of really, really good stuff happening in my game.”Adam Scott, playing in McIlroy’s company, signed for the same score as McDowell.

     Rory McIlroy Finds Peace With Driver, Takes Early Lead at Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     He added six birdies and a single bogey to take the early lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
It was the driver, however, that really shined, the club that has always distinguished McIlroy when he’s been at his best.
“It’s a drive-into-the-ball golf course, this one," said PGA Tour veteran Graeme McDowell, who like McIlroy, is from Northern Ireland.
“I really enjoy watching him play," said Adam Scott, who shot 68 and was in the same group as McIlroy, three shots back.
This is my fourth start of the calendar year, and I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO – Rory McIlroy followed his game plan for Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge perfectly.
“It felt as good as it has for a long time,” he said of his game.
“It’s one of these courses that I don’t feel like I have to do anything special to compete,” McIlroy explained on Wednesday.
You play conservatively the rest of the way, especially how the golf course here has been set up the past few years.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.
