     Alisher Usmanov: ex-fencer who ‘solves Putin’s business problems’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dilbar, Alisher Usmanov’s $600m superyacht that may – or may not – have been seized in Germany.
The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

     Government announces sanctions against Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton.
This expert group will coordinate cross-government work to sanction oligarchs, helping build cases against the list of oligarchs it has identified as targets.
Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
These latest sanctions are part of a tough package against Russia, including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK.
In coordination with the US and other allies, these measures amount to the largest set of financial sanctions in history.

NEW RUSSIA SANCTIONS: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs.
"Those reports are inaccurate," said Lampard when asked if Usmanov played a role in his hiring.

The news comes after Everton cut ties with the Russian oligarch and his 512ft yacht was seized in Germany, although authorities have confirmed it's not been confiscated.
The Russian president ordered his troops to invade Ukraine last Thursday, as a bloody war rages in eastern Europe.
Everton suspended their commercial ties with Usmanov on Wednesday afternoon.

     Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s $600M yacht seized in Germany: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities in Germany this week seized a lavish $600 million yacht belonging to a Russian oligarch, according to reports.
The Dilbar, a 512-foot vessel belonging to billionaire Alisher Usmanov, was taken over by authorities while it was being refitted in a German shipyard, Forbes reported.
30 October 2021, Hamburg: The luxury yacht Dilbar has moored at the quay wall of the Blohm+Voss shipyard.
The 156-metre-long yacht, which weighs almost 16,000 tonnes, was delivered by the Lürssen shipyard in Bremen to a Russian billionaire in 2016.
President Biden and other Western leaders have made Russian oligarchs a target of their efforts to put economic pressure on Putin as he continues the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Rory McIlroy Finds Peace With Driver, Takes Early Lead at Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     He added six birdies and a single bogey to take the early lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
It was the driver, however, that really shined, the club that has always distinguished McIlroy when he’s been at his best.
“It’s a drive-into-the-ball golf course, this one," said PGA Tour veteran Graeme McDowell, who like McIlroy, is from Northern Ireland.
“I really enjoy watching him play," said Adam Scott, who shot 68 and was in the same group as McIlroy, three shots back.
This is my fourth start of the calendar year, and I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.

     Sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs including Alisher Usmanov over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.

     Alisher Usmanov hit by UK government sanctions over Russia’s Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov, who had commercial ties to Everton, has had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Usmanov had already been hit with sanctions by the European Union.
UK foreign secretary Liz Truss announced on Thursday that Usmanov would be sanctioned, along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
USM Holdings, in which Usmanov has a 49 per cent stake, had sponsored the club’s training ground.

     Rory McIlroy continues Bay Hill mastery, leads Arnold Palmer Invitational early Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO – Rory McIlroy followed his game plan for Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge perfectly.
“It felt as good as it has for a long time,” he said of his game.
“It’s one of these courses that I don’t feel like I have to do anything special to compete,” McIlroy explained on Wednesday.
You play conservatively the rest of the way, especially how the golf course here has been set up the past few years.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.

McIlroy has posted top-20 finishes in his last eight worldwide starts"I feel there's a nice flow to this golf course where you can really build a score," McIlroy said.
"You have par-fives, one every few holes, and you've got a couple of scorable par-fours.
"I played the par-fives particularly well, and that was the bulk of the score.
