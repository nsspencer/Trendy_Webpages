     Lakers vs. Clippers: Lineups, injury reports and broadcast info for Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers play the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, and if you’re wondering how you can watch the action live, you’ve come to the right place.
The Lakers are in the midst of a miserable stretch, having lost three in a row and 10 of their last 13.
On Tuesday they made a spirited rally from a 15-point halftime deficit against the Dallas Mavericks and took a healthy fourth-quarter lead, only to lose by five points.
Even without stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, the Clippers have been doing an admirable job of staying afloat.
The Lakers have lost their last six games against the Clippers and are clinging to the ninth spot in the Western Conference.

     Lakers Vs. Clippers Preview &amp; TV Info: Still Looking For First Post All-Star Break Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers have a chance to get their first win since the All-Star break and get a little revenge on their rivals as they take on the Los Angeles Clippers in what’s technically a road game.
The two teams met just six days ago in both team’s first contest following All-Star Weekend with the Clippers coming away with a three-point victory.
Last week’s contest followed the same format as almost every recent Lakers game with the team falling behind early, making a big run to get close before coming up just short in the end.
Head coach Frank Vogel said that Augustin will definitely get minutes, while Gabriel will depend on how the game goes.
The Clippers continue to be a formidable team without their star duo of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard thanks to excellent all-around team play.

     The Lakers get outplayed 40-18 in the third quarter by the Clippers.
(2:38)LOS ANGELES -- — Reggie Jackson scored 12 of his season-high 36 points in the fourth quarter while adding nine assists and eight rebounds, and the Los Angeles Clippers completed a four-game season sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers with a 132-111 victory Thursday night.
The Clippers outscored their cross-hallway rivals 37-10 late into the third before coasting to their fifth consecutive victory in the past eight days, including two over the Lakers.
The Lakers used their 31st starting lineup of the season with Dwight Howard moving in alongside rookie Austin Reaves and Malik Monk.
Augustin had three points and six assists in his debut with the Lakers, who signed the 14-year NBA veteran Tuesday to bolster their backcourt depth.
