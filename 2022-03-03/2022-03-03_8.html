     Tennessee football: Ranking all four Vols by most to prove at 2022 NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This year’s NFL Draft Combine is underway, and Tennessee football has four players taking part in the event.
Some players need this event more than others based on their production in 2021 and how important physical gifts are for their position.
Here is our ranking of Tennessee football’s former players based on the most to gain (and lose) at the 2022 NFL Combine, which began on Tuesday, March 1 and will last through Monday, March 7.
These numbers alone prove that, and Jones being such a playmaker for Tennessee football will be a selling point on his own.
However, his football speed is obvious as is his ability to produce, so he likely won’t be hurt by anything at this event.

The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

Usmanov has not commented on the UK sanctions but on Tuesday he labelled European Union sanctions against him "restrictive and unfair", while also resigning from his position as International Fencing Federation president.
NEW RUSSIA SANCTIONS: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs.
"Those reports are inaccurate," said Lampard when asked if Usmanov played a role in his hiring.

     Sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs including Alisher Usmanov over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.
