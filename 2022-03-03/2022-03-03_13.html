     Baylor's Tyquan Thornton runs scorching 4.28-second 40-yard dash at NFL scouting combine record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The wide receivers showed off their speed Thursday as the NFL scouting combine opened in Indianapolis.
Baylor prospect Tyquan Thornton stood out from the group and nearly set a combine record.
Thornton clocked an official time of 4.28 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
Initially, his time was announced as 4.21 seconds, which would have set a combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash ever, breaking Washington receiver John Ross III's mark of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton was Baylor's leading receiver as a senior in 2021 with 62 catches for 948 yards and 10 touchdowns.

     NFL combine: Tyquan Thornton recorded a 4.28-second 40-yard dash at NFL combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Whatever they're putting in the water in Indianapolis, one thing is certain: this year's wide receiver class is fast.
Not long after Ohio State wideout Chris Olave clocked an official 4.39 second 40-yard dash (unofficial 4.26-second 40), Baylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton one-upped him but logging an official 4.28 second sprint per the NFL (4.21 unofficial for Thornton).
If Thornton's time would have been official, it would have been the fastest 40-yard dash in the history of the NFL combine.
The current record for fastest 40-yard dash at the combine is held by John Ross, who clocked in a 4.22 seconds in 2017.
9 overall that year, and was the third wide receiver off the board.

     Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes jokes about 40-yard dash times at combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2022 NFL Scouting Combine has on-field workouts going on in primetime this year and Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes is tuning in.
The Chiefsâ€™ star quarterback was watching the receivers run the 40-yard dash, which shouldnâ€™t surprise anyone who watched Kansas City play last season.
He happened to catch Baylor WR Tyquan Thornton running an unofficial 4.21s 40-yard dash time.
If confirmed, Thorntonâ€™s time would beat out John Rossâ€™ record 4.22s 40-yard dash set back in 2017.
4.21â€¦ðŸ”¥ â€” Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) March 4, 2022Mahomesâ€™ excitement quickly waned when he recalled the 4.8s 40-yard dash time that he ran back in the 2017 NFL Scouting Combine.
