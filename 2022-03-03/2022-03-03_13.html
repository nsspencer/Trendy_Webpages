     Jaguars owner Tony Khan to buy Ring of Honor wrestling from Sinclair Broadcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ring of Honor had said in October it would be shutting down this year for at least three months while the company reevaluated the business.
Ring of Honor said then that the loss of live events during the pandemic made it necessary to “reimagine ROH.”

     AEW buying Ring of Honor is good for everyone in wrestling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AEW owner Tony Khan stood in the middle of the ring on Wednesday night to deliver a “huge announcement” he’d teased for over a week.
However, the twist came with the revelation that AEW was buying everything, the library, the brand, trademarks, heck, even the ring and production equipment would come under his ownership.
It’s resulted in the release of brilliant wrestlers, huge names, all in service of saving money.
Now we can see a proud return of a wrestling company with a legacy, and history that deserves celebration.
Tony Khan and AEW didn’t just throw a lifeline, they gained the ability to bring back a legendary wrestling brand.

     AEW boss Tony Khan buys Ring of Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The All Elite Wrestling owner has bought Ring of Honor (ROH), one of the great independent wrestling companies of the 21st century.
Major ROH talent currently at AEW includes ROH Hall of Famer CM Punk, Hangman Page, Dr Britt Baker and Adam Cole.
Related: AEW EVPs Cody and Brandi Rhodes announce departureHe added: "Tony has the utmost appreciation and respect for Ring of Honor, and I’m truly excited to see how he continues the legacy."
As Ring of Honor owned the rights to All In, Khan now has those rights and can use the footage in AEW broadcasting, which would have certainly sweetened the deal.

     Triple H Reportedly Pushed for WWE to Buy Ring of Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "When Ring of Honor was kinda hot, I think this would be, I'm gonna say 2018, the early part of the year, WWE made a pitch... Paul Levesque [Triple H] wanted to buy Ring of Honor," Meltzer said.
"There was some smoke to that, even though Ring of Honor obviously denied it at the time.
McMahon had his sights set on other deals, and though WWE tried to purchase several promotions, no deals ended up happening.
WWE tried to buy New Japan, they tried to buy Stardom, they tried to buy NOAH... they tried to buy AAA, but nobody would sell to them from foreign countries at the price they were willing to pay.
Ring of Honor released their talent from their contracts and took time off to restructure and prep for a comeback.
