     Anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger shouted down by University of North Texas students
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A North Texas candidate running for the Texas House of Representatives to outlaw sex reassignment surgeries for children was shouted and cursed at by students at the University of North Texas in a recently posted social media video.
In the 17-second video, District 63 candidate Jeff Younger can be seen standing at the front of a classroom as students bang on their desks and shout insults at him.
The event was reportedly cut short, and Young Conservatives of Texas’s UNT chapter Chair Kelly Neidert was rushed out of the building.
Tensions at the University of North Texas were so high that President Neal Smatresk sent a campus wide email Feb. 22.
Gender-affirming medical care has become a popular issue among Texas conservatives in recent weeks.

     Texas College Students Chased an Anti-Trans Political Candidate Off Their Campus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At Younger’s event on Wednesday night, hosted by the campus group Young Conservatives of Texas, students packed the room to shout down Younger with chants of “Fuck these fascists” and “trans rights,” as MySanAntonio.com reported.
Twitter user Ismael Belkoura initially posted a video of the protest, but after the recording went viral, their entire account appears to have been deleted by Twitter.
Adding injury to insult, the campus police cruiser escorting the event’s organizer appears to have injured at least one protester.
The person filming stated that the victim was taken to the hospital and likely suffered a sprained ankle.
The Denton Record-Chronicle later received confirmation that the protest attendee who went to the hospital had filed a police report regarding the collision.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas House candidate Jeff Younger, who seeks to outlaw transgender youth care, was driven out of an event hosted at the University of North Texas by protesters on Wednesday, March 2.
The event played out on a thread from Twitter user Ismael Belkoura last night, who was posting photos and video from the event.
Younger, who is running for Texas House District 63, was scheduled to speak at an event organized by UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas.
The room where Younger was to speak was filled by protesters who drowned out Younger and organizers with a "F**k these fascists" and "trans rights" chants.
Younger, according to the tweets, only egged on the protesters by asking them to make more noise and proceeded to call the protesters "Communists."

     Person struck by UNT police vehicle at protest over Republican Jeff Younger's speech on criminalizing transgender-affirming care
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WFAA learned that the victim was reportedly struck by the police vehicle that was driving Republican Jeff Younger, of Flower Mound, from a speaking engagement on the topic of criminalizing transgender-affirming care.
Younger's visit comes against the backdrop of state officials targeting that very type of transgender care for young people.
Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents that sought medical care - including puberty-blocking medication - for their transgender children.
Denton police told WFAA that they took a report from the protester that was struck at the hospital Wednesday night.
UNT president Neal Smatresk released a statement to the UNT community Thursday afternoon, detailing the events from Wednesday’s night protest.

     Jeff Younger: Texas state House candidate fighting child gender-affirming care is shouted down at University of North Texas event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Social media videos show demonstrators banging on desks and chanting "fascist" as Republican candidate Jeff Younger mockingly claps and repeatedly misgenders protesters.
The event was hosted by the Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at UNT, which is located about 40 miles north of Dallas.
Joshua Medeiros -- leader of a Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at a different university -- attended the event and posted a video to social media.
Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion that giving gender-affirming treatment to minors amounts to child abuse.
"I want to thank you for showing the world what leftist politics really is," Younger said, as seen on a social media video.

     UNT students protest Jeff Younger, conservative speech on ‘transgender child abuse’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Student protests over a conservative politician who promotes criminalizing sex reassignment surgeries for children escalated to police intervention during a Wednesday night event at the University of North Texas.
Videos circulating online show dozens of students banging on desks, shouting and cursing at Jeff Younger, who will be in a May runoff in the Republican primary for Texas House District 63.
He was involved in a yearslong custody battle for his child, whose mother says is a transgender girl.
In some of Belkoura’s videos, Younger is seen clapping and encouraging the protesters as they chant.
UNT’s University Union and the University Program Council, the school’s student-run programming board, expressed their support of the transgender community this week.
