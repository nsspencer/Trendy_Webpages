    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian Kyrylo Fesenko, the normally extremely jovial former Utah Jazz player, is about midway through a phone interview on the Russian invasion of his home country.
38 pick in the 2007 NBA draft, the Jazz acquired Fesenko as a huge, promising 7-foot-1 center with significant room to grow in his game.
For example, Fesenko has numerous Russian contacts, thanks to his time playing in Russia and its basketball league.
From being civil and reasonable human being I am, I cannot speak with Russian people at this moment right now,” Fesenko said.
I blame Russia.
