     Before Hassan Whiteside elected to join the Utah Jazz during free agency this past summer, he wasn't entirely sure what he was getting into.
On the one hand, he'd always wanted to play for head coach Quin Snyder, widely regarded as one of the world's best basketball minds and renowned for his offensive and defensive schemes.
Whiteside got his answer following the first phone call with his soon-to-be new head coach — and couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Because of the turnaround and looking like legitimate title contenders, Snyder has been named the Western Conference Coach of the Month.!

     Ukrainian Kyrylo Fesenko, the normally extremely jovial former Utah Jazz player, is about midway through a phone interview on the Russian invasion of his home country.
38 pick in the 2007 NBA draft, the Jazz acquired Fesenko as a huge, promising 7-foot-1 center with significant room to grow in his game.
For example, Fesenko has numerous Russian contacts, thanks to his time playing in Russia and its basketball league.
From being civil and reasonable human being I am, I cannot speak with Russian people at this moment right now,” Fesenko said.
I blame Russia.
