     'Happy birthday, daddy': Jayson Tatum's son, Deuce, has St. Louis-inspired birthday message for dad

     Deuce Tatum hit all the highlights for his NBA star dad's birthday video.
ST. LOUIS ‚Äî If you've followed St. Louis native Jayson Tatum in the NBA with the Boston Celtics, you probably already know his son, Deuce.
Deuce is everywhere from the sidelines at the TD Garden, to being the star of Tatum's social media channels.
For his dad's birthday on March 3 this year, Deuce starred in a video honoring everything his dad loves about his hometown.
"I went around St. Louis for your birthday," Deuce said in a video Tatum put out on social media.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Birthday boy Jayson Tatum has much to be proud of as he turns 24 on Thursday.
But one thing Tatum hasn't yet done on his birthday in the NBA is win a game.
Boston lost on Tatum's 20th birthday during his rookie year, 123-120 at the Toyota Center, with Tatum scoring 12 points in 27 minutes.
Tatum was inactive on his 22nd birthday in 2020 as the Celtics lost to the Brooklyn Nets, 129-120, as Caris LeVert exploded for 51 points for the visitors at TD Garden.
Can Tatum finally enter the winner's column on his 24th birthday?

     While the joke that Boston Celtics All-Star point guard is only 19 years old has been around at least as long as when he was, he most certainly is not as of today, his actual 24th birthday.
And among those of us who follow his career in the NBA closely know just how important his son Deuce is, as well as his hometown of St. Louis, Chaminade Prep, and even Imo‚Äôs Pizza are to the Duke product.
Check out the clip embedded below that Tatum shared to social media on his birthday today and see for yourself ‚Äî there‚Äôs a reason why the younger Tatum rivals his pops in popularity at times.
And before we forget, happy birthday, Jayson!

     Speaking to the press on his 24th birthday, Boston Celtics star swingman Jayson Tatum had plenty to say after shootaround Thursday morning, sharing his thoughts on his relationship with Celtics head coach Ime Udoka, facing rising star point guard Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies, and more.
Tatum also spoke on his career as one of the brightest young stars in the league himself, and how it feels to be where he is.
I‚Äôm always trying to outdo myself, whether I score 50 or 60, I don‚Äôt carry it over.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always about what you‚Äôre going to do now, what you‚Äôre going to do next,‚Äù he later added.

     BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - MARCH 01: Jayson Tatum #0 of the Boston Celtics celebrates after Grant Williams #12 scored against the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden on March 01, 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts.

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)The Boston Celtics are always bound to be a good team with the likes of their All-Star wing duo, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, in tow.
The folks at Bleacher Report are also under the impression that more accolades are just on the horizon for the Boston Celtics, as they have recently predicted that, come year‚Äôs end, Jayson Tatum will find himself being selected to his second All-NBA team.
Still only 23-years-old, the wing is developing into, not just one of the best players under the age of 25 but, rather, one of the best players in the entire league period.

Tatum had 37 points ‚Äî 21 in the fourth quarter ‚Äî along with 6 rebounds and 5 assists, but he had plenty of help with Brown out.
Al Horford played 40 minutes and finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Smart added 18 points and 12 assists.
And down the stretch, Tatum ensured that there would be no comeback.
After the game, Smart was asked how he helps Tatum when he is in a groove such as that one.

     Jayson Tatum drops 37 points on his birthday, including 21 points in the fourth quarter, as the Celtics take care of business vs. the Grizzlies.
It's a win Boston picked up thanks to Tatum's heroics, as he went shot-for-shot with Morant and came out on top.
Morant did his best to will Memphis back into the game single-handedly on a night when the Grizzlies struggled against the league's second-ranked defense.
Morant, though, didn't enjoy the battle in the same way Tatum did -- for one obvious reason.
"That's him getting going," Morant said of if Memphis did anything wrong defending Tatum down the stretch.

‚ÄúThis is St. Louis!‚Äù, the young Tatum cheered as the video ends on location near the old courthouse in downtown.
His father is trying to keep his Boston Celtics in the NBA playoff picture, where the team is in 6th place in the Eastern Conference.
Tatum is averaging 26 points and 8 rebounds, and just came off his first NBA All-Star game start.
