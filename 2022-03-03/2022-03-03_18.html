     Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s $600M yacht seized in Germany: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities in Germany this week seized a lavish $600 million yacht belonging to a Russian oligarch, according to reports.
The Dilbar, a 512-foot vessel belonging to billionaire Alisher Usmanov, was taken over by authorities while it was being refitted in a German shipyard, Forbes reported.
30 October 2021, Hamburg: The luxury yacht Dilbar has moored at the quay wall of the Blohm+Voss shipyard.
The 156-metre-long yacht, which weighs almost 16,000 tonnes, was delivered by the Lürssen shipyard in Bremen to a Russian billionaire in 2016.
President Biden and other Western leaders have made Russian oligarchs a target of their efforts to put economic pressure on Putin as he continues the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Government announces sanctions against Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton.
This expert group will coordinate cross-government work to sanction oligarchs, helping build cases against the list of oligarchs it has identified as targets.
Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
These latest sanctions are part of a tough package against Russia, including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK.
In coordination with the US and other allies, these measures amount to the largest set of financial sanctions in history.

     Oligarch Alisher Usmanov - who has previously been associated with both Arsenal and Everton - has been sanctioned by the UK government following Russia's invasion of UkraineEx-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov has been sanctioned by the UK government.
The news comes after Everton cut ties with the Russian oligarch and his 512ft yacht was seized in Germany, although authorities have confirmed it's not been confiscated.
The Russian president ordered his troops to invade Ukraine last Thursday, as a bloody war rages in eastern Europe.
Everton suspended their commercial ties with Usmanov on Wednesday afternoon.
"Everyone at Everton remains shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine," read a statement from the Toffees.

Usmanov had already been hit with sanctions by the European Union.

The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

NEW RUSSIA SANCTIONS: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs.
"Those reports are inaccurate," said Lampard when asked if Usmanov played a role in his hiring.
"My interview was with the board, with Mr (Farhad) Moshiri, the chairman (Bill Kenwright), Denise (Barrett-Baxendale) the CEO and others - but not Mr Usmanov.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.
