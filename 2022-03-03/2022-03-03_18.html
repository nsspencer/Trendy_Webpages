     Although the 2022 NFL Combine has been technically underway for a few days, Thursday represents the first official day of measurements and on-field drills.
Group 1 of the NFL Combine includes the quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends.
This year, the NFL has moved those on-field drills to the late afternoon to try and bring in some primetime ratings.
Which of the wide receivers will firmly establish themselves as a first-round talent?
Feel free to share your observations as the NFL Combine truly gets underway at 4 p.m.

     Quarterbacks also performed some of those tests, though teams are much less interested in those times than they are in the on-field drills for passers.
Organizations in need of a future signal-caller paid close attention to how tightly the ball departed the hand of each quarterback, as well as the accuracy, strength and arc of downfield throws.
Most of these passing duos have not worked together in the past, though, so any slight synchronization issues might be overlooked.

First Combine player with an unofficial score and he's heading for a doozy of a day.
Winner: WR Christian Watson, North Dakota StateChristian Watson had one hell of a day at the NFL Combine.
The title that should be associated with Heyward is “football player” and nothing more.
In terms of how good he looked at the combine, Heyward was a chameleon, adapting to whatever drills the tight ends ran through with ease.

This year’s opening night was the backdrop for the fastest class of wide receivers in league history.
It also saw Desmond Ridder tie a quarterback prospect record by matching Marcus Mariota with a 4.52-second 40 in Indianapolis.
The end result was a handful of numbers on a spreadsheet that will allow us to overreact for the following eight weeks until the 2022 NFL Draft is finally upon us.
