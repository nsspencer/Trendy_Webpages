     Isaiah Thomas Speaks Out On Allen Iverson's Support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yesterday, Isaiah Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the Charlotte Hornets.
Last night, Thomas made his Hornets debut and scored 10 points in 14 minutes as the team blew out the Cleveland Cavaliers.
After the game, Thomas took to Twitter where he gave a shoutout to none other than Allen Iverson, who has always been there to support him.
"Always trips me out when Allen Iverson calls or texts my phone," Thomas said.
It remains to be seen whether or not Thomas will last with the Hornets, however, his first game with the team was definitely promising.

The Hornets weren‚Äôt expecting Thomas to be a starting point guard or the most important part of their team when they signed him.
They also wanted Thomas‚Äô expertise which would be very important for the young team ‚Äì especially if Thomas sticks around in the postseason.
There is a lot that has to be decided about the future of Thomas on the team.

     There‚Äôs something that goes off in the mind of Isaiah Thomas when he plays after signing 10-day contracts.
In his debut as a Charlotte Hornet, Thomas contributed 10 points, five rebounds, and three assists in only 14 minutes of action off the bench to help lead Charlotte to a much-needed 119-98 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Charlotte Needs ThomasThomas comes to the Hornets at a point when the team needs more than a little assist.
There was a lot of hope for this young team when the season began and, sure enough, for a while, the team was doing quite well.
If he does, perhaps Thomas will remain in Charlotte a lot longer.

     Charlotte got big-time contributions from their bench unit, including newcomer Isaiah Thomas.
The Hornets signed Thomas to a 10-day contract on Tuesday and he just joined the team at shootaround the morning before their tilt against the Cavs.
Terry Rozier, who was teammates with Thomas on the Boston Celtics, commented on everything Thomas brings to the team.
It‚Äôs his leadership, him being a vet, his voice in the huddles, in the locker room, already making an impact.
Despite Thomas not being able to hold down an NBA job in recent years, Rozier still thinks very highly of his former teammate.
