     Radiation levels normal as fire burns at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, IAEA says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A fire at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant is still burning following an attack by Russian troops, though a plant spokesman says background radiation levels are normal and fighting has temporarily ceased.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine had not sustained any critical damage in the attack, Andrii Tuz, a spokesman for the plant, told CNN on Friday, adding that when firefighters initially arrived they were blocked by Russian troops.
Attention has focused on the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power facilities as Russia's invasion of the country intensifies.
The prospect of the fire causing damage at the nuclear plant has alarmed experts, though they cautioned that it was too early to gauge the full impact.
Graham Allison, Professor at Belfer Center, Harvard University told Anderson Cooper early Friday that "facts are unfolding" but "not all fires in a power plant, have catastrophic consequences."

     Russian troops are attacking Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power PlantRussian troops appear to be at the entrance of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and are engaged in active combat.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:Ukraine's foreign minister has tweeted that Russian troops are trying to take the nation's largest nuclear power plant by force.
BRUMFIEL: Right, right.
So it's located in the southeast of the country, and it's actually the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
SHAPIRO: Of course, Ukraine is already home to the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

     Fire breaks out at nuclear plant in Ukraine after Russia attacks facility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fire broke out at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after the facility in the country's southeast endured heavy shelling from Russian troops Friday morning, Ukraine’s foreign minister said.
“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Twitter.
In a video posted on Telegram, Andriy Tuz, a facility spokesperson, demanded that Russia stop shelling the plant and said there was a “real threat of nuclear danger,” according to the Associated Press.
“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.
Lyman said that nuclear power plants — including those in Ukraine — have addressed vulnerabilities that were exposed by the 2011 disaster on Japan’s northern coast.

     The mayor of Energodar, a city about 275 miles southeast of Kyiv, said Russian bombs slammed into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe.
It says, “Russian Troops Attack Europe’s Largest Nuclear Power Plant.”Energodar is a city of 52,887 people.
The power plant supplies one-quarter of Ukraine’s power generation.
Russia claimed to have captured the power plant five days ago, but the mayor said that was not true.
Earlier Thursday, social media posts documented Ukrainians standing in front of Russian troops who were trying to enter the grounds of the nuclear plant.

     U.N. Atomic Agency Says Fire at Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Didn't Affect Essential Equipment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, prompting concern from the international community about a nuclear disaster and renewed fears about Moscow’s tactics as it continues its advance in the country.
In Kyiv, officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the fire that broke out at the facility didn’t affect essential equipment, the agency said, lessening initial concerns that the shelling damaged a reactor.
Do not let Europe die in the nuclear catastrophe,” he said, according to a translation posted online by Ukraine’s U.S. embassy, accusing Russia of “nuclear terror.”Mr. Zelensky spoke with President Biden about the incident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
The plant is located near the city of Enerhodar in southeastern Ukraine.

The IAEA urged parties to avoid fighting near the power plant.
In a video posted on Telegram, Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, accused Russia of shelling the facility, which provides a quarter of Ukraine's electricity.
Reuters reported that Russian forces struck a training building outside of the plant's perimeter.
