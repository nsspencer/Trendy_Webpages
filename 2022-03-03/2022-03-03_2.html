     Who Is Ana Arriola in 'The Dropout'? Here's What We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There's a scene in Episode 3 of Hulu's The Dropout where Amanda Seyfriend (who plays disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes) lines up outside of an Apple store to purchase the very first iPhone.
When a man exits the store, announcing he got the first one, Elizabeth screams like it's 1964 and she's seeing The Beatles in concert.
It's no secret she's obsessed with Apple and Steve Jobs, which is why she aims to hire Apple employees, like Ana Arriola.
But who exactly is Ana Arriola in The Dropout?
Let's take a bite out of this Apple.

     The Dropout review – another mind-blowing portrait of a great American fraudster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now we have The Dropout (Disney+), the story of the other great female fraudster of recent years, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the medical company Theranos.
It claimed it had developed technology that would revolutionise blood testing, and with it a massive part of the US healthcare system.
In 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest self-made female billionaire in the country, after Theranos was valued at $9bn (£6.75bn).
She is now on bail awaiting sentencing for convictions for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Unlike Inventing Anna, which was a heady, soapy rush that enjoyed the glamour of its protagonist, and wasn’t too bothered by any need to investigate her motivations, The Dropout plays it straight.

That helped me get through it.”Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout.
Costume designer Claire Parkinson, meanwhile, managed to track down both Holmes’s family photos and her high school’s yearbook to inform the character’s clothing on The Dropout.
Given that Holmes was more science-minded than fashion-minded, Parkinson put the character a few years back on clothing trends—referencing J.

     Hulu’s Theranos docu-series ‘The Dropout’ is like watching a car crash in slow motion – TechCrunch

     Hulu’s “The Dropout,” which focuses on the fall of Theranos, is the latest.
From this perspective, “The Dropout” feels like watching a car crash in slow motion.
“The Dropout” makes it clear that Balwani isn’t a hero in the Theranos story.
But for viewers who know Gibbons’ fate, each of his jovial appearances summons a sense of foreboding.
In 2013, Gibbons died by suicide shortly before he was required to testify in a lawsuit about Theranos’ technology.

     'The Dropout' dares to ask: How did Theranos get away with all this?
Amanda Seyfried plays Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in the new Hulu series The Dropout, based on the ABC News podcast of the same name.
There's a moment very early on in the series when a interviewer asks Holmes to describe herself in one word, and she hesitates, hesitates, hesitates, before finally saying: "Mission-oriented."
That weird, unconvincing blurt of business-speak, as Seyfried serves it up, is very, very Elizabeth Holmes.

     The Dropout review: More Elizabeth Holmes scandal drama isn’t a bad thing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Most people are familiar with the story (and crimes) of Elizabeth Holmes at this point.
Amanda Seyfried stars as Elizabeth Holmes, who’s joined by Lost’s Naveen Andrews, Stephen Fry, Law and Order star Sam Waterston, and Succession’s Alan Ruck as various members of her brain trust.
If you know the gist about Elizabeth HolmesWhat I know about Elizabeth Holmes basically boils down to a game of scammer Mad Libs: She dressed like Steve Jobs (on purpose?)
The Dropout is worth your time because Elizabeth Holmes was worth the time of countless writers, podcasters, and documentarians.
The Dropout clearly isn’t afraid to make on-the-nose creative choices in its dramatization of Holmes’ journey.
