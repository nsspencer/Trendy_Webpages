     Fire breaks out at nuclear complex, Ukraine says, as Russian forces move through.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A fire broke out early Friday morning at a complex in southern Ukraine that is home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, after Russian troops fired on the area, Ukraine’s foreign minister said.
Security camera footage filmed early on Friday and verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the power complex near a line of military vehicles.
The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant.
The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, Reuters reported early Friday, citing a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service.
The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian army was “firing from all sides” on the Zaporizhzhia complex, which includes the largest reactor site in Europe.

     Radiation levels normal as fire burns at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, IAEA says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A fire at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant is still burning following an attack by Russian troops, though a plant spokesman says background radiation levels are normal and fighting has temporarily ceased.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine had not sustained any critical damage in the attack, Andrii Tuz, a spokesman for the plant, told CNN on Friday, adding that when firefighters initially arrived they were blocked by Russian troops.
Attention has focused on the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power facilities as Russia's invasion of the country intensifies.
The prospect of the fire causing damage at the nuclear plant has alarmed experts, though they cautioned that it was too early to gauge the full impact.
Graham Allison, Professor at Belfer Center, Harvard University told Anderson Cooper early Friday that "facts are unfolding" but "not all fires in a power plant, have catastrophic consequences."

     A contested Ukrainian nuclear plant is under attack by Russian forcesEnlarge this image toggle caption Vadim Ghirda/AP Vadim Ghirda/APUkraine's foreign minister said on Twitter early Friday that Europe's largest nuclear power plant is under fire from Russian troops.
Security footage from the plant's main gate, geolocated by NPR, shows what appear to be Russian troops at the entrance of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, engaged in active combat on the site.
"The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site," the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was "critical."
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe.
Ukraine relies on 15 nuclear reactors spread throughout the country for around half of its electricity.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mayor of Energodar, a city about 275 miles southeast of Kyiv, said Russian bombs slammed into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe.
It says, “Russian Troops Attack Europe’s Largest Nuclear Power Plant.”Energodar is a city of 52,887 people.
The power plant supplies one-quarter of Ukraine’s power generation.
Russia claimed to have captured the power plant five days ago, but the mayor said that was not true.
Earlier Thursday, social media posts documented Ukrainians standing in front of Russian troops who were trying to enter the grounds of the nuclear plant.

The IAEA urged parties to avoid fighting near the power plant.
In a video posted on Telegram, Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, accused Russia of shelling the facility, which provides a quarter of Ukraine's electricity.
Reuters reported that Russian forces struck a training building outside of the plant's perimeter.

     ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:Ukraine's foreign minister has tweeted that Russian troops are trying to take the nation's largest nuclear power plant by force.
BRUMFIEL: Right, right.
So it's located in the southeast of the country, and it's actually the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
SHAPIRO: Of course, Ukraine is already home to the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
SHAPIRO: That is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel on the fighting at the nuclear power plant in Ukraine.
