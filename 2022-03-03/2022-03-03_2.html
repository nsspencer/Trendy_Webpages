     Europe's Largest Nuclear Power Plant on Fire as Russia Attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in eastern Ukraine came under attack from Russian shelling early Friday, Ukrainian officials said, raising the stakes in Vladimir Putin’s invasion as his forces bombarded cities across the nation.
Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency the fire “has not affected ‘essential’ equipment,” and that there had been no change reported in radiation levels.
The reactors are “being protected by robust containment structures” and are being safely shut down, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement, which added that the department activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team.

     Radiation levels normal as fire burns at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, IAEA says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A fire at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant is still burning following an attack by Russian troops, though a plant spokesman says background radiation levels are normal and fighting has temporarily ceased.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine had not sustained any critical damage in the attack, Andrii Tuz, a spokesman for the plant, told CNN on Friday, adding that when firefighters initially arrived they were blocked by Russian troops.
Attention has focused on the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power facilities as Russia's invasion of the country intensifies.
The prospect of the fire causing damage at the nuclear plant has alarmed experts, though they cautioned that it was too early to gauge the full impact.
Graham Allison, Professor at Belfer Center, Harvard University told Anderson Cooper early Friday that "facts are unfolding" but "not all fires in a power plant, have catastrophic consequences."

     A contested Ukrainian nuclear plant is under attack by Russian forcesEnlarge this image toggle caption Vadim Ghirda/AP Vadim Ghirda/APUkraine's foreign minister said on Twitter early Friday that Europe's largest nuclear power plant is under fire from Russian troops.
Security footage from the plant's main gate, geolocated by NPR, shows what appear to be Russian troops at the entrance of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, engaged in active combat on the site.
"The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site," the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was "critical."
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe.
Ukraine was the site of the world's largest nuclear disaster, the 1986 explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl plant.

     What we know about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mayor of Energodar, a city about 275 miles southeast of Kyiv, said Russian bombs slammed into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe.
It says, “Russian Troops Attack Europe’s Largest Nuclear Power Plant.”Energodar is a city of 52,887 people.
The power plant supplies one-quarter of Ukraine’s power generation.
Russia claimed to have captured the power plant five days ago, but the mayor said that was not true.
Earlier Thursday, social media posts documented Ukrainians standing in front of Russian troops who were trying to enter the grounds of the nuclear plant.

SHAPIRO: Of course, Ukraine is already home to the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

     Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on Fire After Russian Shelling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (KYIV, Ukraine) — Russian forces pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing city by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire and raising fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.
The mayor of Enerhodar said earlier that Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts.
The Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called on the West to close the skies over the country’s nuclear plants as fighting intensified.
In the south, Russian troops appeared to roll from Kherson toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west.
