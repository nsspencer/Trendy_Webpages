     TSMC checking the effects of Taiwan power outages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".
Evertiq will keep investigating the effects of the power outages.

In a brief statement, Taiwan Power Co. said its southern power grid system encountered a malfunction.
Taiwan’s largest power plant, Kaohsiung’s Hsinta Power Plant, was the focal point of the problem.
As of Thursday morning, iPhone chipmaker TSMC had not yet determined what affect, if any, the power outages affected its operations.

     Taiwan blames negligence for mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, March 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday blamed negligence during annual maintenance at a major power plant for a mass outage across the island that caused the lights to go off for more than 5 million households, though the crucial semiconductor sector was largely unaffected.
The power cut began shortly after 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) after a problem at the Hsinta power plant and while it impacted all parts of Taiwan the most extensive problems were in the south, especially the major port city of Kaohsiung.
Power has now mostly been restored, at least in northern Taiwan, and efforts are continuing in the south to reconnect those still without electricity.
The cut affected about a third of Taiwan's power supply, hitting some 5 million households, Wang said.
TSMC said "power dips" at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.

     A power blackout that affected 5 million households across Taiwan, also affected the science park where iPhone processor firm TSMC is based.
Taiwan has been affected by power outages before, but in this case, the cause was reportedly a malfunction.
According to Nikkei Asia, the Taiwan Power Company says that an unspecified malfunction occurred at its Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung.
Power outages can cause the loss of chips being produced, and it's not clear what TSMC was making at the time.
The process required the Hsinta Power Plant to be disconnected from other power plants, all of which must then be restarted.

     TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan is gradually restoring power supply, the state-run power operator said on Thursday, after much of the island’s south and 5 million households were hit by an outage caused by a malfunction at a major power generation plant.
“It all needs further proof and investigation, which requires evidence.”The cut affected about a third of Taiwan’s power supply, hitting about 5 million households, Wang said.
Power should start being restored in southern Taiwan from midday, she added, although it was not immediately clear what caused the problem.
TSMC said “power dips” at some of its fabs ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.
Some parts of northern Taiwan, including the capital, Taipei, also lost power.

     Opposition parties demand minister step down over major power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taipei, March 3 (CNA) Taiwan's opposition parties on Thursday called on Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) to step down after nationwide power outages occurred earlier in the day due to a power plant malfunction, leading to the sudden loss of around one-third of the country's power supply.
KMT Legislator Tseng Ming-chung (曾銘宗) demanded an explanation about the power outage, which according to state-run utility Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) had affected over 5 million households and businesses nationwide, after two similar large-scale power outages in the country last year.
An unstable power supply jeopardizes local business operations and inconveniences the public, he said.
The outages were sparked by a malfunction in an earthing switch at the coal and natural gas-fired power plant at 9:07 a.m., causing a supply-demand imbalance in the power grid, she added.
The government will speed up the construction of a third liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in Taoyuan to ensure power grid stability and stabilize the long-term energy supply within the country, Lo said.
