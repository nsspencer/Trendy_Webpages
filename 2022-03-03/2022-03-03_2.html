     The Dropout: Understanding Elizabeth Holmes and the Theranos Scandal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Theranos, Holmes was trying to create the medicine and biotech world’s version of Apple.
That led to a precipitous fall for Holmes, the company, and many of its investors.
Elizabeth HolmesThe story of Theranos and the story of its founder are inextricably linked.
Elizabeth Holmes was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Houston.
Well, the Holmes family had its own unfortunate experience with corporate fraud well before Elizabeth founded Theranos.

     Hulu’s Theranos docu-series ‘The Dropout’ is like watching a car crash in slow motion – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hulu’s “The Dropout,” which focuses on the fall of Theranos, is the latest.
From this perspective, “The Dropout” feels like watching a car crash in slow motion.
“The Dropout” makes it clear that Balwani isn’t a hero in the Theranos story.
But for viewers who know Gibbons’ fate, each of his jovial appearances summons a sense of foreboding.
In 2013, Gibbons died by suicide shortly before he was required to testify in a lawsuit about Theranos’ technology.

     The Dropout gazes into the abyss of Elizabeth Holmes’ unblinking eyes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That’s a good idea, especially in a country where healthcare is often expensive and inaccessible.
It came from Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford dropout whose good idea ballooned into a company with a $9 billion valuation.
It’s still a good idea.
And finally there’s Elizabeth herself, whose faith in her own technology is both admirable and delusional, propelled by a hubristic tendency to believe her own hype.
It’s Silicon Valley in a nutshell—pressure, money, ego—but the danger is that not all who fake it will eventually make it.

     ‘The Dropout’ Miniseries Episode 3 Recap: ‘Green Juice’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Dropout Green Juice Season 1 Episode 3 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next Photo: Beth Dubber/ HULUIf episode two found Elizabeth taking her first major step into scammery at the Novartis demo, “Green Juice” ups the fraud ante in a big way.
This despite saying she “hated” green juice earlier in the episode.
It certainly motivates her in “Green Juice,” as she gets both praise for her young woman CEO status and advice on that front from poached Apple designer Ana Arriola (Nicky Endres) and expresses a hyperawareness of the tightrope she’s walking.
But the show manages, in “Green Juice,” to acknowledge that reality without letting Elizabeth off scot-free.
Sunny, who has spent the whole episode languishing and feeling dismissed — by the discriminatory airport security guys and Elizabeth alike — is in.
