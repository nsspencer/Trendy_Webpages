     TSMC checking the effects of Taiwan power outages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".
Evertiq will keep investigating the effects of the power outages.

     There's a scene in Episode 3 of Hulu's The Dropout where Amanda Seyfriend (who plays disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes) lines up outside of an Apple store to purchase the very first iPhone.
When a man exits the store, announcing he got the first one, Elizabeth screams like it's 1964 and she's seeing The Beatles in concert.
It's no secret she's obsessed with Apple and Steve Jobs, which is why she aims to hire Apple employees, like Ana Arriola.
But who exactly is Ana Arriola in The Dropout?

     Amanda Seyfried certainly had the large blue eyes and blonde hair to play Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder and fraud who bilked investors out of millions of dollars.
“Because there was no way to look at the real Elizabeth Holmes without feeling some sort of pain.
That helped me get through it.”Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout.
Costume designer Claire Parkinson, meanwhile, managed to track down both Holmes’s family photos and her high school’s yearbook to inform the character’s clothing on The Dropout.
Given that Holmes was more science-minded than fashion-minded, Parkinson put the character a few years back on clothing trends—referencing J.

     The Dropout review – another mind-blowing portrait of a great American fraudster

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now we have The Dropout (Disney+), the story of the other great female fraudster of recent years, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the medical company Theranos.
It claimed it had developed technology that would revolutionise blood testing, and with it a massive part of the US healthcare system.
In 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest self-made female billionaire in the country, after Theranos was valued at $9bn (£6.75bn).
She is now on bail awaiting sentencing for convictions for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Unlike Inventing Anna, which was a heady, soapy rush that enjoyed the glamour of its protagonist, and wasn’t too bothered by any need to investigate her motivations, The Dropout plays it straight.

     Taiwan blames negligence for mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, March 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday blamed negligence during annual maintenance at a major power plant for a mass outage across the island that caused the lights to go off for more than 5 million households, though the crucial semiconductor sector was largely unaffected.
The power cut began shortly after 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) after a problem at the Hsinta power plant and while it impacted all parts of Taiwan the most extensive problems were in the south, especially the major port city of Kaohsiung.
Power has now mostly been restored, at least in northern Taiwan, and efforts are continuing in the south to reconnect those still without electricity.
The cut affected about a third of Taiwan's power supply, hitting some 5 million households, Wang said.
TSMC said "power dips" at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.

     Hulu’s “The Dropout,” which focuses on the fall of Theranos, is the latest.
From this perspective, “The Dropout” feels like watching a car crash in slow motion.
“The Dropout” makes it clear that Balwani isn’t a hero in the Theranos story.
But for viewers who know Gibbons’ fate, each of his jovial appearances summons a sense of foreboding.
In 2013, Gibbons died by suicide shortly before he was required to testify in a lawsuit about Theranos’ technology.

     Taiwan: Huge Power Blackout Affects Over 5 Million Households And Key Industrial Tech Parks, Human Error In Switchgear Operations Seen As Reason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The disruption affected Taipei and Kaohsiung, the second-biggest cities in Taiwan, as well as its most important iPhone processor production hub.
According to an initial investigation by Taiwan Power Co, the power outage was caused by human error in operating switchgear at Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan causing the power grid to malfunction.
The plant runs both coal-fired and natural gas-fired generators and is the third-largest power plant in Taiwan.
TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, said the power disruption had no significant impact on its production lines.
By evening today, power was restored to over 300,000 households in Tainan affected by the outage although rolling blackouts were implemented in eight districts.

     Taiwan: Huge Power Blackout Affects Over 5 Million Households And Key Industrial Tech Parks, Human Error In Switchgear Operations Seen As Reason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The disruption affected Taipei and Kaohsiung, the second-biggest cities in Taiwan, as well as its most important iPhone processor production hub.
According to an initial investigation by Taiwan Power Co, the power outage was caused by human error in operating switchgear at Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan causing the power grid to malfunction.
The plant runs both coal-fired and natural gas-fired generators and is the third-largest power plant in Taiwan.
TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, said the power disruption had no significant impact on its production lines.
By evening today, power was restored to over 300,000 households in Tainan affected by the outage although rolling blackouts were implemented in eight districts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan is gradually restoring power supply, the state-run power operator said on Thursday, after much of the island’s south and 5 million households were hit by an outage caused by a malfunction at a major power generation plant.
“It all needs further proof and investigation, which requires evidence.”The cut affected about a third of Taiwan’s power supply, hitting about 5 million households, Wang said.
Power should start being restored in southern Taiwan from midday, she added, although it was not immediately clear what caused the problem.
TSMC said “power dips” at some of its fabs ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.
Some parts of northern Taiwan, including the capital, Taipei, also lost power.

     'The Dropout' dares to ask: How did Theranos get away with all this?
Amanda Seyfried plays Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in the new Hulu series The Dropout, based on the ABC News podcast of the same name.
There's a moment very early on in the series when a interviewer asks Holmes to describe herself in one word, and she hesitates, hesitates, hesitates, before finally saying: "Mission-oriented."
That weird, unconvincing blurt of business-speak, as Seyfried serves it up, is very, very Elizabeth Holmes.

     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".
Evertiq will keep investigating the effects of the power outages.

     The Dropout review: More Elizabeth Holmes scandal drama isn’t a bad thing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Most people are familiar with the story (and crimes) of Elizabeth Holmes at this point.
Amanda Seyfried stars as Elizabeth Holmes, who’s joined by Lost’s Naveen Andrews, Stephen Fry, Law and Order star Sam Waterston, and Succession’s Alan Ruck as various members of her brain trust.
If you know the gist about Elizabeth HolmesWhat I know about Elizabeth Holmes basically boils down to a game of scammer Mad Libs: She dressed like Steve Jobs (on purpose?)
The Dropout is worth your time because Elizabeth Holmes was worth the time of countless writers, podcasters, and documentarians.
The Dropout clearly isn’t afraid to make on-the-nose creative choices in its dramatization of Holmes’ journey.
