     Liberty QB Malik Willis spotted helping homeless on streets of Indy [VIDEO]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest bit of viral news coming out of the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine circles back to the quarterback position.
A video posted by Twitter user Ryan Lacey showed footage of Liberty QB Malik Willis handing out supplies to the homeless in the streets of Indianapolis, where the Combine is currently being held.
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022Willis has been gaining traction as a likely first-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
He totaled just 2,857 passing yards, 27 TDs and 12 INTs in 2021, with at least 875 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in each of his last two seasons.
To complement the hype, Willis had an engaging interview session at the NFL Combine that highlighted a bit of low-key humor and ability to have fun with the media.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

     It has been said that greatness is truly defined by the things you do when nobody’s looking — or, at least when you think nobody’s looking.
That was the case for quarterback Malik Willis, the Liberty star who’s looking to establish himself as the top quarterback in this draft class.
Was having lunch yesterday and saw one of the Combine guys helping out someone on some hard times…@malikwillis being great even when nobody is watching.
How can you not be a fan of this guy?
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022It looks as if Willis is taking something out of a bag — perhaps a warm hat — to give to someone in need.

     And during an interview with the Washington Football Talk podcast at the NFL Combine, one draft expert recommended that the Commanders go with Willis over Pickett if they end up facing that decision next month.
Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     INDIANAPOLIS — Liberty University’s Malik Willis charmed his audience with honesty and irreverence.
I want to be happy, so I’m not going to think about it,” Willis said.
I’m going to let the opinion of people I trust and I can respect, I’m going to let that help me, my coaches and my family.”Willis, 22, said he first started learning that going to football camps while growing up in Atlanta.
“I’m going to hold you accountable if I want to see you be great.
“Somebody always is going to think you’re trash.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “So many different positions that as we keep going through the process,” the Detroit Lions general manager said the other day.
“Somebody always is going to think you’re trash,” the Liberty quarterback said after arriving here at the combine.
But I’m here now, so I’m happy.”The Lions hold the second overall pick, which seems too rich for Willis, plus two more selections at Nos.
But here’s betting if the Lions do decide to roll the dice on this year’s fraught quarterback market, Willis is the guy they take.
“If your ultimate upside for the player is Jared Goff, you’ve already got him, so don’t waste a pick,” NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said.
