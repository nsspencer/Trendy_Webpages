     Even the top-ranked golfer in the world isn't perfect as Jon Rahm is short on this putt from 10 inches out.

I just simply didn't stop," Rahm told reporters afterward in Orlando, Florida.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A slender young man built for tough golf courses and big stages, Zalatoris got off to a fast start in the opening round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard on Thursday, shooting 4-under 68 in friendly scoring conditions at Bay Hill Club &amp; Lodge.
Zalatoris would be a young man who tends to view the glass as half full.
McIlroy, the 2018 API champion, made his day appear rather effortless, making six birdies and an eagle.
The tougher the test becomes, the more likely that Zalatoris is a name that might be sticking around.
“It’s going to be fun,” said Zalatoris, the reigning Arnold Palmer Award winner as the TOUR’s Rookie of the Year.

     Jon Rahm missed a 10-inch putt as he endured a nightmare start to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Rahm played his first shot at the 7th to the fringe and second to within 10 inches, leaving a simple putt to save par.
That miss from 10 inches was the shortest putt Rahm has ever missed on the PGA Tour.
Watch the video below:Jon Rahm just missed a 3-inch putt…and didn’t even get it to the hole.
Maybe he should have told his Spanish rival to make sure he didn’t miss putts from within a foot of the hole!

Rick Gehman and Kyle Porter discuss Thursday's first round action at the 2022 Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Quote of the dayThe mutual admiration society between McIlroy and Scott (combined -11 on Thursday) was fun to see.
Rory McIlroy: +225Billy Horschel: 11-1Viktor Hovland: 12-1Sungjae Im: 12-1Will Zalatoris: 14-1Jon Rahm: 20-1I was surprised to see Rory this long and Rahm this short.
It shows how much folks (myself included) believe in the level of golf he's playing right now and what he could do if the putter gets hot over the final 54.

“It felt as good as it has for a long time,” he said of his game.
“It’s one of these courses that I don’t feel like I have to do anything special to compete,” McIlroy explained on Wednesday.
You play conservatively the rest of the way, especially how the golf course here has been set up the past few years.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.
