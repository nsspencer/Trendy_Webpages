     Baylor's Tyquan Thornton runs scorching 4.28-second 40-yard dash at NFL scouting combine record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The wide receivers showed off their speed Thursday as the NFL scouting combine opened in Indianapolis.
Baylor prospect Tyquan Thornton stood out from the group and nearly set a combine record.
Thornton clocked an official time of 4.28 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
Initially, his time was announced as 4.21 seconds, which would have set a combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash ever, breaking Washington receiver John Ross III's mark of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton was Baylor's leading receiver as a senior in 2021 with 62 catches for 948 yards and 10 touchdowns.

     Tyquan Thornton's Blazing 40-Yard Dash Falls Short of NFL Combine Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tyquan Thornton's blazing 40-yard dash falls short of NFL Combine record originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoBaylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton unofficially had the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record for about two hours.
On the opening night of drills at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine Thursday, Thornton ran his 40-yard dash in an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds, besting John Ross III's all-time event record of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton's 4.28 ties him with Champ Bailey and a few others for the ninth-fastest time in NFL Combine history.
Projected first-round pick Chris Olave out of Ohio State finished in an unofficial 4.26 seconds, and his official time was a 4.39.
Thornton may not have claimed the combine record, but he certainly boosted his draft stock with his blazing-fast 40.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS -- In a stadium that celebrates speed with Indy cars in the concourse, the wide receivers at the NFL scouting combine carved out a little history Thursday, the first night of on-field workouts.
Baylor's Tyquan Thornton led the way as nine wide receivers officially clocked sub-4.4-second times in the 40-yard dash inside Lucas Oil Stadium.
The group of pass catchers still left a contrail, as the nine sub-4.4 clockings were the most by the wide receivers at the combine in any year evaluated since 2006.
Kansas State wide receiver Yamon Figurs ran the fastest 40 at the combine that year at 4.30.
Penn State's Jahan Dotson ran a 4.43, and Arkansas wide receiver Treylon Burks ran a 4.55.

     The 2022 NFL Scouting Combine has on-field workouts going on in primetime this year and Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes is tuning in.
The Chiefsâ€™ star quarterback was watching the receivers run the 40-yard dash, which shouldnâ€™t surprise anyone who watched Kansas City play last season.
He happened to catch Baylor WR Tyquan Thornton running an unofficial 4.21s 40-yard dash time.
If confirmed, Thorntonâ€™s time would beat out John Rossâ€™ record 4.22s 40-yard dash set back in 2017.
