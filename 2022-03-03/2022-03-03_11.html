     Protesters shut down anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger event at UNT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas House candidate Jeff Younger, who seeks to outlaw transgender youth care, was driven out of an event hosted at the University of North Texas by protesters on Wednesday, March 2.
The event played out on a thread from Twitter user Ismael Belkoura last night, who was posting photos and video from the event.
Younger, who is running for Texas House District 63, was scheduled to speak at an event organized by UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas.
The room where Younger was to speak was filled by protesters who drowned out Younger and organizers with a "F**k these fascists" and "trans rights" chants.
Younger, according to the tweets, only egged on the protesters by asking them to make more noise and proceeded to call the protesters "Communists."

     Jeff Younger: Texas state House candidate fighting child gender-affirming care is shouted down at University of North Texas event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Social media videos show demonstrators banging on desks and chanting "fascist" as Republican candidate Jeff Younger mockingly claps and repeatedly misgenders protesters.
The event was hosted by the Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at UNT, which is located about 40 miles north of Dallas.
Joshua Medeiros -- leader of a Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at a different university -- attended the event and posted a video to social media.
Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion that giving gender-affirming treatment to minors amounts to child abuse.
"I want to thank you for showing the world what leftist politics really is," Younger said, as seen on a social media video.

     Person struck by UNT police vehicle at protest over Republican Jeff Younger's speech on criminalizing transgender-affirming care
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WFAA learned that the victim was reportedly struck by the police vehicle that was driving Republican Jeff Younger, of Flower Mound, from a speaking engagement on the topic of criminalizing transgender-affirming care.
Younger's visit comes against the backdrop of state officials targeting that very type of transgender care for young people.
Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents that sought medical care - including puberty-blocking medication - for their transgender children.
Denton police told WFAA that they took a report from the protester that was struck at the hospital Wednesday night.
UNT president Neal Smatresk released a statement to the UNT community Thursday afternoon, detailing the events from Wednesday’s night protest.

     The UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) invited Jeff Younger, a Republican running in the 63rd House district in Texas’s state legislature, to speak on Wednesday.
The students also shouted slogans that expressed support for transgender children in the state, who have been targeted by conservative lawmakers in recent weeks.
Anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger came to the University of North Texas and this is how students responded.

     A North Texas candidate running for the Texas House of Representatives to outlaw sex reassignment surgeries for children was shouted and cursed at by students at the University of North Texas in a recently posted social media video.
In the 17-second video, District 63 candidate Jeff Younger can be seen standing at the front of a classroom as students bang on their desks and shout insults at him.
The event was reportedly cut short, and Young Conservatives of Texas’s UNT chapter Chair Kelly Neidert was rushed out of the building.
Tensions at the University of North Texas were so high that President Neal Smatresk sent a campus wide email Feb. 22.
Gender-affirming medical care has become a popular issue among Texas conservatives in recent weeks.

     Watch: Anti-Trans Jeff Younger Heckled as "Fascist" by Students
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Younger, whose run for Texas House was motivated by a battle over his trans child's care, had to cut his appearance at the University of North Texas short.
An anti-transgender Texas House candidate who lost custody of his trans child got heckled and shut down by students during an appearance at the University of North Texas Wednesday night.
Anne Georgulas, Younger’s ex-wife and the twins’ mother, is a pediatrician who has supported the trans child in her transition.
However, the judge also barred Georgulas from allowing the trans child to undergo “hormonal suppression therapy, puberty blocks, and/or transgender reassignment surgery” without Younger’s consent.
Younger advanced to a runoff in Tuesday’s Republican primary for the House district, as no candidate received a majority of the vote.

     UNT students protest Jeff Younger, conservative speech on ‘transgender child abuse’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Student protests over a conservative politician who promotes criminalizing sex reassignment surgeries for children escalated to police intervention during a Wednesday night event at the University of North Texas.
Videos circulating online show dozens of students banging on desks, shouting and cursing at Jeff Younger, who will be in a May runoff in the Republican primary for Texas House District 63.
He was involved in a yearslong custody battle for his child, whose mother says is a transgender girl.
In some of Belkoura’s videos, Younger is seen clapping and encouraging the protesters as they chant.
UNT’s University Union and the University Program Council, the school’s student-run programming board, expressed their support of the transgender community this week.
