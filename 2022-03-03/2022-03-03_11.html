     The Batman's Colin Farrell Confirms All Of Our Suspicions About His Penguin Transformation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "Every discussion until I saw what Mike Marino, the makeup artist, had designed, was considering the character's psychology and where he was at this stage of his criminal career," Farrell said.
"None of it was about inhabiting this character that ended up being in the film."
"I knew where I was going with [the dialect]," he says, "but I wasn't fully comfortable [with playing the character] until I saw the makeup.
When I saw the makeup, it just all became really, really clear."
The makeup and prosthetics involved proved transformational on such a level that even most die-hard Farrell fans barely recognized him when the first trailer for "The Batman" was released.

     The Batman: Colin Farrell Calls Penguin Makeup "Absolute Liberation" as an Actor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Farrell went through an extreme makeup transformation to become the iconic villain, and even revealed that the scarred, pock-marked face "horrified" his son.
Today, a new episode of Hot Ones was released with Farrell as the guest, and the star revealed that wearing the prosthetics was "absolute liberation" as an actor.
"For me, it was absolute liberation," Farrell shared.
"The first day we tried the whole thing out, we took it for a drive – a spin, metaphorically speaking," Farrell shared.
The Batman already has a spin-off in development for HBO Max which is set to follow Farrell's Penguin.

     The weird and wonderful divergences of Colin Farrell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The last time we saw Colin Farrell play a colorful supporting bad guy in a superhero movie was nearly 20 years ago, at a time when he seemed to be everywhere.
All of these 2003 movies made money — yet only a year or two later, Farrell was already being labeled as in need of a comeback.
Also akin to those performers, Farrell occasionally takes roles that deliberately flout his handsome charm with weirder, more ostentatious behavior and get-ups.
Yet because The Batman is more effective as a drama than Daredevil, Farrell's comic relief works better, too.
Farrell plays Jake, who tasks himself with securing a repair for the family's android Yang (Justin H. Min), who has mysteriously shut down.

     The Batman brings the villain Penguin back to the big screen – but you may have a hard time working out who's playing the character.
Despite the grotesque outer appearance, that's actually the certifiably slim Colin Farrell underneath a whole lot of make-up.
Speaking to Total Film in anticipation of The Batman, Farrell walked us through getting into the character.
When I saw the makeup, it just all became really, really clear."
It was really, really cool.

     Yang is treated like an integral part of this clan, especially by Mika, who adores him.

He additionally determines that Yang had a secret female friend whom he later ascertains is named Ada (Haley Lu Richardson).
With quiet eyes and an equally still demeanor, a lightly bearded Farrell evokes Jake’s sorrow and confusion through gentle gestures and body language.
”Jake’s sleuthing results in revelations about Yang’s prior life and closeness to Ada, which further complicate his ideas about what it means to be human.

     After Yang review: Colin Farrell goes back to the future in a dreamy sci-fi experiment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Colin Farrell and Queen &amp; Slim's Jodie Turner-Smith are Jake and Kyra, a couple in some unspecified century not so unlike our current one; he runs an old-fashioned tea shop (loose leaves, not the more popular crystals), she works an office job.
So when he abruptly stops functioning one day, they're at a loss; Yang is a refurbished model — "certified!"
Jake blusters — which means he's no longer under warranty, and no one at the standard places seems to know how to fix him.
Nearly every frame is suffused with a kind of golden analog glow, as if the future portrayed here were already somehow nostalgic for itself.
Though he's ostensibly at the center of the story, the questions Koganada's script poses (what constitutes consciousness, identity, family?)

     Review: Showtime’s ‘After Yang’ with Colin Farrell asks what do androids really dream of?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This image released by A24 shows Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja, left, and Justin H. Min in a scene from "After Yang."
That’s the premise of “After Yang,” an exquisite bit of futurism from the filmmaker known as Kogonada.
Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith portray the parents; the young girl, Mika, hopelessly devoted to her brotherly companion Yang, is played by an effortless charmer named Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja.
There are moments in the second half of “After Yang” when some of the narrative beats get a little confusing or vague.
The question in “After Yang” is related, sort of, but gracefully humane and gently luminous in its execution: Do androids wish they were human?

     Review: ‘After Yang,’ with Colin Farrell, is a beautifully human glimpse of a posthuman world
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     About halfway through “After Yang,” an exquisite dispatch from a hazily defined future, Jake (Colin Farrell), a tea-shop proprietor, initiates his son, Yang (Justin H. Min), into some of the mysteries of his trade.
(“After Yang” was shot in mostly rigid widescreen compositions by Benjamin Loeb; Kogonada served as his own editor.)
The self-driving vehicles that carry Jake, Mika and Yang to their appointments are glimpsed only from the inside.
Another way of putting it is that “After Yang,” for all its restraint, is alive to the special power of actors.
And Kogonada has a superb one in Farrell, whose gaze, mournful and curious by turns, carries the weight of this movie’s speculative inquiry.
