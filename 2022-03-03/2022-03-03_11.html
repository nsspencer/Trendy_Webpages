     Former Illinois House speaker indicted on racketeering and bribery charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Michael J. Madigan, the former speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday on 22 federal charges related to racketeering, bribery and attempted extortion, prosecutors said.
Madigan served as the leader of the Illinois House of Representatives for 38 years, the longest tenure for a state speaker in modern US history.
The indictment alleges he "carried out illegal activity at Madigan's direction," charging him with crimes related to racketeering and bribery.
"For years, the Government has been trying to force Mike McClain to cooperate in its quest against former Speaker Mike Madigan.
These latest charges are nothing more than the Government's continued attempt to pressure Mike McClain to do the Government's bidding."
