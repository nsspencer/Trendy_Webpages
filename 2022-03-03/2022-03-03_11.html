     Deuce Tatum hit all the highlights for his NBA star dad's birthday video.
ST. LOUIS ‚Äî If you've followed St. Louis native Jayson Tatum in the NBA with the Boston Celtics, you probably already know his son, Deuce.
Deuce is everywhere from the sidelines at the TD Garden, to being the star of Tatum's social media channels.
For his dad's birthday on March 3 this year, Deuce starred in a video honoring everything his dad loves about his hometown.
"I went around St. Louis for your birthday," Deuce said in a video Tatum put out on social media.

     WATCH: Boston's Jayson Tatum shares birthday video made for him by son Deuce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While the joke that Boston Celtics All-Star point guard is only 19 years old has been around at least as long as when he was, he most certainly is not as of today, his actual 24th birthday.
And among those of us who follow his career in the NBA closely know just how important his son Deuce is, as well as his hometown of St. Louis, Chaminade Prep, and even Imo‚Äôs Pizza are to the Duke product.
Check out the clip embedded below that Tatum shared to social media on his birthday today and see for yourself ‚Äî there‚Äôs a reason why the younger Tatum rivals his pops in popularity at times.
And before we forget, happy birthday, Jayson!

     Jayson Tatum's 4-Year-Old Son Wishes Dad Happy Birthday In Adorable Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Celtics forward is celebrating his 24th birthday on Thursday ... and posted a video on social media of his adorable son showing him some love on the special day.
The video starts out with 4-year-old Deuce in a Cardinals jersey ... which, of course, is only fitting since Tatum is a native of St. Louis, Missouri.
Deuce is seen jumping excitedly in front of a place where JT has childhood ties to ... before the video transitions to Tatum's favorite pizza spot.
Deuce then hit up Tatum's old high school, Chaminade College Preparatory School ... where Jayson averaged 26.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game his sophomore season.
The video's precious ... with Deuce signing off by saying, "This is St. Louis," as Nelly's hit song "St. Louie" plays in the background.

     ‚ÄòThis is St. Louis‚Äô; Jayson Tatum‚Äôs son stars in cute birthday video for dad

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)ST. LOUIS‚ÄìJayson Tatum, Jr., also known as ‚ÄúDeuce‚Äù has had a front-row seat for some of his dad‚Äôs biggest games in the NBA.
‚ÄúI went around St. Louis for your birthday,‚Äù Jayson Jr., 4, said, taking viewers on a video trip of St. Louis from Tatum‚Äôs childhood home, to the Wohl Community Center in the city of St. Louis where he spent time as a child and which now has a computer lab the basketball star dedicated last fall.
‚ÄúThis is St. Louis!‚Äù, the young Tatum cheered as the video ends on location near the old courthouse in downtown.
His father is trying to keep his Boston Celtics in the NBA playoff picture, where the team is in 6th place in the Eastern Conference.
Tatum is averaging 26 points and 8 rebounds, and just came off his first NBA All-Star game start.

     Boston Celtics Mailbag: Daniel Theis trade, Sam Hauser minutes, Jayson Tatum‚Äôs fire, filling out roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As far as the Celtics assets, Horford is strictly salary-filler for a deal under his current deal.
The team has plenty of movable mid-sized contracts in Smart, Derrick White and Rob Williams (likely off limits) along with their cheaper rookie deals headed by Grant Williams.
What was the Celtics reasoning to trade three expiring contracts for the multi-year contract of Theis?
Lastly, can he play next to Rob Williams, like Al, or will it limit the floor spacing too much for them to coexist?
However, the defensive tactics and roster choices (Rob Williams guarding wings, sticking with double big starting five, eight man rotation) have helped this group find the best version of themselves.
