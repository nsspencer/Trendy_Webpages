     'Happy birthday, daddy': Jayson Tatum's son, Deuce, has St. Louis-inspired birthday message for dad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Deuce Tatum hit all the highlights for his NBA star dad's birthday video.
ST. LOUIS — If you've followed St. Louis native Jayson Tatum in the NBA with the Boston Celtics, you probably already know his son, Deuce.
Deuce is everywhere from the sidelines at the TD Garden, to being the star of Tatum's social media channels.
For his dad's birthday on March 3 this year, Deuce starred in a video honoring everything his dad loves about his hometown.
"I went around St. Louis for your birthday," Deuce said in a video Tatum put out on social media.

     Liberty QB Malik Willis spotted helping homeless on streets of Indy [VIDEO]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest bit of viral news coming out of the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine circles back to the quarterback position.
A video posted by Twitter user Ryan Lacey showed footage of Liberty QB Malik Willis handing out supplies to the homeless in the streets of Indianapolis, where the Combine is currently being held.
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022Willis has been gaining traction as a likely first-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
He totaled just 2,857 passing yards, 27 TDs and 12 INTs in 2021, with at least 875 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in each of his last two seasons.
To complement the hype, Willis had an engaging interview session at the NFL Combine that highlighted a bit of low-key humor and ability to have fun with the media.

     WATCH: Boston's Jayson Tatum shares birthday video made for him by son Deuce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While the joke that Boston Celtics All-Star point guard is only 19 years old has been around at least as long as when he was, he most certainly is not as of today, his actual 24th birthday.
And among those of us who follow his career in the NBA closely know just how important his son Deuce is, as well as his hometown of St. Louis, Chaminade Prep, and even Imo’s Pizza are to the Duke product.
Check out the clip embedded below that Tatum shared to social media on his birthday today and see for yourself — there’s a reason why the younger Tatum rivals his pops in popularity at times.
And before we forget, happy birthday, Jayson!

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

     ‘This is St. Louis’; Jayson Tatum’s son stars in cute birthday video for dad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)ST. LOUIS–Jayson Tatum, Jr., also known as “Deuce” has had a front-row seat for some of his dad’s biggest games in the NBA.
“I went around St. Louis for your birthday,” Jayson Jr., 4, said, taking viewers on a video trip of St. Louis from Tatum’s childhood home, to the Wohl Community Center in the city of St. Louis where he spent time as a child and which now has a computer lab the basketball star dedicated last fall.
“This is St. Louis!”, the young Tatum cheered as the video ends on location near the old courthouse in downtown.
His father is trying to keep his Boston Celtics in the NBA playoff picture, where the team is in 6th place in the Eastern Conference.
Tatum is averaging 26 points and 8 rebounds, and just came off his first NBA All-Star game start.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Celtics forward is celebrating his 24th birthday on Thursday ... and posted a video on social media of his adorable son showing him some love on the special day.
The video starts out with 4-year-old Deuce in a Cardinals jersey ... which, of course, is only fitting since Tatum is a native of St. Louis, Missouri.
Deuce is seen jumping excitedly in front of a place where JT has childhood ties to ... before the video transitions to Tatum's favorite pizza spot.
Deuce then hit up Tatum's old high school, Chaminade College Preparatory School ... where Jayson averaged 26.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game his sophomore season.
The video's precious ... with Deuce signing off by saying, "This is St. Louis," as Nelly's hit song "St. Louie" plays in the background.

     Boston Celtics Mailbag: Daniel Theis trade, Sam Hauser minutes, Jayson Tatum’s fire, filling out roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As far as the Celtics assets, Horford is strictly salary-filler for a deal under his current deal.
The team has plenty of movable mid-sized contracts in Smart, Derrick White and Rob Williams (likely off limits) along with their cheaper rookie deals headed by Grant Williams.
What was the Celtics reasoning to trade three expiring contracts for the multi-year contract of Theis?
Lastly, can he play next to Rob Williams, like Al, or will it limit the floor spacing too much for them to coexist?
However, the defensive tactics and roster choices (Rob Williams guarding wings, sticking with double big starting five, eight man rotation) have helped this group find the best version of themselves.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And during an interview with the Washington Football Talk podcast at the NFL Combine, one draft expert recommended that the Commanders go with Willis over Pickett if they end up facing that decision next month.
Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

     Who is most likely to select QB Malik Willis in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft? Ranking seven contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.
    </p>

     Liberty’s Malik Willis gunning, although not running, for QB1. And he has the Lions’ attention.

     “So many different positions that as we keep going through the process,” the Detroit Lions general manager said the other day.
“Somebody always is going to think you’re trash,” the Liberty quarterback said after arriving here at the combine.
But I’m here now, so I’m happy.”The Lions hold the second overall pick, which seems too rich for Willis, plus two more selections at Nos.
But here’s betting if the Lions do decide to roll the dice on this year’s fraught quarterback market, Willis is the guy they take.
“If your ultimate upside for the player is Jared Goff, you’ve already got him, so don’t waste a pick,” NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS — Liberty University’s Malik Willis charmed his audience with honesty and irreverence.
I want to be happy, so I’m not going to think about it,” Willis said.
I’m going to let the opinion of people I trust and I can respect, I’m going to let that help me, my coaches and my family.”Willis, 22, said he first started learning that going to football camps while growing up in Atlanta.
“I’m going to hold you accountable if I want to see you be great.
“Somebody always is going to think you’re trash.
