     Protesters shut down anti-trans Texas House candidate Jeff Younger event at UNT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Texas House candidate Jeff Younger, who seeks to outlaw transgender youth care, was driven out of an event hosted at the University of North Texas by protesters on Wednesday, March 2.
The event played out on a thread from Twitter user Ismael Belkoura last night, who was posting photos and video from the event.
Younger, who is running for Texas House District 63, was scheduled to speak at an event organized by UNT chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas.
The room where Younger was to speak was filled by protesters who drowned out Younger and organizers with a "F**k these fascists" and "trans rights" chants.
Younger, according to the tweets, only egged on the protesters by asking them to make more noise and proceeded to call the protesters "Communists."

     At Younger‚Äôs event on Wednesday night, hosted by the campus group Young Conservatives of Texas, students packed the room to shout down Younger with chants of ‚ÄúFuck these fascists‚Äù and ‚Äútrans rights,‚Äù as MySanAntonio.com reported.
Twitter user Ismael Belkoura initially posted a video of the protest, but after the recording went viral, their entire account appears to have been deleted by Twitter.
Adding injury to insult, the campus police cruiser escorting the event‚Äôs organizer appears to have injured at least one protester.
The person filming stated that the victim was taken to the hospital and likely suffered a sprained ankle.
The Denton Record-Chronicle later received confirmation that the protest attendee who went to the hospital had filed a police report regarding the collision.

     WFAA learned that the victim was reportedly struck by the police vehicle that was driving Republican Jeff Younger, of Flower Mound, from a speaking engagement on the topic of criminalizing transgender-affirming care.
Younger's visit comes against the backdrop of state officials targeting that very type of transgender care for young people.
Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents that sought medical care - including puberty-blocking medication - for their transgender children.
Denton police told WFAA that they took a report from the protester that was struck at the hospital Wednesday night.
UNT president Neal Smatresk released a statement to the UNT community Thursday afternoon, detailing the events from Wednesday‚Äôs night protest.

     Jeff Younger: Texas state House candidate fighting child gender-affirming care is shouted down at University of North Texas event

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Social media videos show demonstrators banging on desks and chanting "fascist" as Republican candidate Jeff Younger mockingly claps and repeatedly misgenders protesters.
The event was hosted by the Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at UNT, which is located about 40 miles north of Dallas.
Joshua Medeiros -- leader of a Young Conservatives of Texas chapter at a different university -- attended the event and posted a video to social media.
Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion that giving gender-affirming treatment to minors amounts to child abuse.
"I want to thank you for showing the world what leftist politics really is," Younger said, as seen on a social media video.

In the 17-second video, District 63 candidate Jeff Younger can be seen standing at the front of a classroom as students bang on their desks and shout insults at him.
The event was reportedly cut short, and Young Conservatives of Texas‚Äôs UNT chapter Chair Kelly Neidert was rushed out of the building.
Tensions at the University of North Texas were so high that President Neal Smatresk sent a campus wide email Feb. 22.
Gender-affirming medical care has become a popular issue among Texas conservatives in recent weeks.

     Student protests over a conservative politician who promotes criminalizing sex reassignment surgeries for children escalated to police intervention during a Wednesday night event at the University of North Texas.
Videos circulating online show dozens of students banging on desks, shouting and cursing at Jeff Younger, who will be in a May runoff in the Republican primary for Texas House District 63.
He was involved in a yearslong custody battle for his child, whose mother says is a transgender girl.
In some of Belkoura‚Äôs videos, Younger is seen clapping and encouraging the protesters as they chant.
UNT‚Äôs University Union and the University Program Council, the school‚Äôs student-run programming board, expressed their support of the transgender community this week.

File Photo by Christine Chew/UPI | License PhotoMarch 3 (UPI) -- Marilyn Manson filed a lawsuit Wednesday against his former fianc√©e, Evan Rachel Wood, accusing the actress of defamation and conspiring to sabotage his career, according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.
In the complaint, Warner asked for a jury trial as well as for Wood and Gore to stop the actions he is alleging.
AdvertisementWood, 34, testified in 2018 in front of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about sexual abuse.
The film chronicles Wood's political advocacy to increase the statute of limitations for domestic violence and sexual abuse.

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‚ÄòPhoenix Rising‚Äô on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable ‚Äì and this legal action will hold them to account‚Äù.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore ‚Äúprovided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner‚Äù.

"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manson‚Äôs suit, which asks for a jury trial, accuses Wood and Gore of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
‚ÄúThat same day, several other women, assisted and coordinated by Wood and/or Gore, sought media attention with remarkably similar public abuse allegations against Warner,‚Äù the lawsuit says.
‚ÄúThose claims, like Wood‚Äôs, were false.‚ÄùManson has not been charged with any crime connected to Wood‚Äôs allegations.
And in June, the model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson alleging sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking.
Manson has repeatedly denied any and all allegations of sexual assault and abuse.
