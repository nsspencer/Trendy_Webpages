"There was some smoke to that, even though Ring of Honor obviously denied it at the time.
McMahon had his sights set on other deals, and though WWE tried to purchase several promotions, no deals ended up happening.

"I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria," Aurora said.
"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary "one-sided" and "premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation."
"But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable‚Äîand this legal action will hold them to account."

     Marilyn Manson files defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood over rape and abuse allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manson‚Äôs suit, which asks for a jury trial, accuses Wood and Gore of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
‚ÄúThat same day, several other women, assisted and coordinated by Wood and/or Gore, sought media attention with remarkably similar public abuse allegations against Warner,‚Äù the lawsuit says.
‚ÄúThose claims, like Wood‚Äôs, were false.‚ÄùManson has not been charged with any crime connected to Wood‚Äôs allegations.
And in June, the model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson alleging sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking.
Manson has repeatedly denied any and all allegations of sexual assault and abuse.

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‚ÄòPhoenix Rising‚Äô on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable ‚Äì and this legal action will hold them to account‚Äù.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore ‚Äúprovided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner‚Äù.
