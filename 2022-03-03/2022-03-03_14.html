     Liberty QB Malik Willis spotted helping homeless on streets of Indy [VIDEO]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest bit of viral news coming out of the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine circles back to the quarterback position.
A video posted by Twitter user Ryan Lacey showed footage of Liberty QB Malik Willis handing out supplies to the homeless in the streets of Indianapolis, where the Combine is currently being held.
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022Willis has been gaining traction as a likely first-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
He totaled just 2,857 passing yards, 27 TDs and 12 INTs in 2021, with at least 875 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in each of his last two seasons.
To complement the hype, Willis had an engaging interview session at the NFL Combine that highlighted a bit of low-key humor and ability to have fun with the media.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

     Who is most likely to select QB Malik Willis in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft? Ranking seven contenders

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     And during an interview with the Washington Football Talk podcast at the NFL Combine, one draft expert recommended that the Commanders go with Willis over Pickett if they end up facing that decision next month.
Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

Willis, who spent time in college at Auburn before starring at Liberty, is making good impressions before the on-field work.

     Considering his unparalleled mix of talent, skill and physical profile—Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton really shouldn’t draw many, if any, comparisons.
That man, of course, is Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera—who spoke with CBS Sports at the NFL Scouting Combine on Wednesday.
“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
“This young man has a tremendous skill set,” he added.
But I can tell you I’ve had the opportunity to interview him—he’s a heck of a young man.

     “So many different positions that as we keep going through the process,” the Detroit Lions general manager said the other day.
“Somebody always is going to think you’re trash,” the Liberty quarterback said after arriving here at the combine.
But I’m here now, so I’m happy.”The Lions hold the second overall pick, which seems too rich for Willis, plus two more selections at Nos.
But here’s betting if the Lions do decide to roll the dice on this year’s fraught quarterback market, Willis is the guy they take.
“If your ultimate upside for the player is Jared Goff, you’ve already got him, so don’t waste a pick,” NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.
