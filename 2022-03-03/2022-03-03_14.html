     Epic Games to acquire music company Bandcamp — still an 'artists-first' platform
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Internet music company and online record store Bandcamp is set to join Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite and the Unreal Engine.
However, co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond states that Bandcamp will continue to operate as a standalone marketplace and music community.
Now, with Epic Games, the company wants to expand its vision.
The alternative music platform has accumulated a large fanbase over the past 14 years, so fans will be happy to know certain features such as Bandcamp Fridays and the "Daily" will continue after joining Epic Games.
However, Epic shut down Houseparty in 2021 (via The Verge), with the team continuing to work on social services for Epic Games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Music platform Bandcamp have announced that they are being bought by Epic Games.
That apparently includes Bandcamp Fridays, where on the first Friday of the month the platform waives its share of sales.
"Behind the scenes we're working with Epic to expand internationally and push development forward across Bandcamp," the statement continues.
Despite talking up their mission for a fair platform, Epic haven't always seen eye to eye with creators.
As well as various games acquisitions, like Fall Guys developers Mediatonic and Rocket League developers Psyonix , Epic acquired the artist marketplace ArtStation last year.

     Dear Epic Games, please don’t ruin Bandcamp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As a longtime user of Bandcamp, Epic Games’ acquisition of the online music storefront makes me nervous.
Why Bandcamp is different Bandcamp isn’t the only place where you can still buy and download music.
To be fair, I have no concrete reason to think that Epic will abandon downloadable music, and neither Epic nor Bandcamp have indicated that any fundamental changes are coming.
In 2020, revenue from downloads fell by 18% across the entire music industry according to the RIAA, and it accounted for just 6% of total recorded music revenue.
advertisementSo it’s fair to wonder if a company on the scale of Epic Games might eventually lose interest in that model.

     Epic Games Buying Bandcamp Is Another Death For The Independent Internet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Epic Games say Bandcamp will remain independent, but that cannot ever be true in acquisitions like this.
Who on Earth knows Epic Games as that, aside from Epic themselves?
In the very first paragraph from Bandcamp following the acquisition, Epic is already using the company as a mouthpiece.
There could also be metaverse ambitions on the horizon, and following Epic Games' acquisition of Harmonix, Epic seems to be building towards something.
Epic Games, champion for a fair and open internet, just killed an independent corner of it by buying it up, likely for a metaverse project it still cannot explain, define, or create.

     Epic Games to buy artist-focused site Bandcamp, adding music to its 'metaverse'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Credit: WikipediaVideo game developer Epic Games said Wednesday it is buying Bandcamp, a popular music marketplace used by artists, for an undisclosed sum.
Bandcamp, which allows users to buy and stream music, marks Epic's 18th acquisition, according to venture capital data company Crunchbase.
Last year, it bought ArtStation, a website that allows artists to sell their work and host their portfolios.
The two purchases are quickly turning the Epic Games Store into a place where users could potentially buy much more than just video games.

     Epic Games buys BandcampBy Chris Cooke | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Fortnite maker Epic Games has made a bigger move into the music domain – following last year’s acquisition of music gaming firm Harmonix – by buying itself direct-to-fan platform Bandcamp.
Bandcamp founder Ethan Diamond announced the deal in a blog post yesterday, stating: “I’m excited to announce that Bandcamp is joining Epic Games, who you may know as the makers of Fortnite and Unreal Engine, and champions for a fair and open internet”.
“You’ll still have the same control over how you offer your music, Bandcamp Fridays will continue as planned, and the Daily will keep highlighting the diverse, amazing music on the site”, Diamond added.
Although, in many ways, a lot of that popularity is as much down to the Bandcamp model as the Bandcamp brand.

     What does Bandcamp’s sale to Epic Games mean for independent music?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The sale was announced on social media by Bandcamp CEO Ethan Diamond, who wrote that the company would operate as a stand-alone entity within Epic’s ecosystem.
Diamond, who did not disclose a sale price, will continue in his role.
“Epic and Bandcamp share a mission of building the most artist-friendly platform that enables creators to keep the majority of their hard-earned money,” said Epic Games in a statement accompanying the purchase.
But, he notes, Tencent’s larger stake in Epic Games means that it could exert more direct influence on monetizing Bandcamp’s platform.
(Bandcamp)“Bandcamp and Epic Games are both fandom companies, and so is Tencent Music,” says Mulligan, adding that two-thirds of Tencent Music’s revenue “comes from non-music.
