     Baylor's Tyquan Thornton runs scorching 4.28-second 40-yard dash at NFL scouting combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The wide receivers showed off their speed Thursday as the NFL scouting combine opened in Indianapolis.
Baylor prospect Tyquan Thornton stood out from the group and nearly set a combine record.
Thornton clocked an official time of 4.28 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
Initially, his time was announced as 4.21 seconds, which would have set a combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash ever, breaking Washington receiver John Ross III's mark of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton was Baylor's leading receiver as a senior in 2021 with 62 catches for 948 yards and 10 touchdowns.

     Tyquan Thornton's Blazing 40-Yard Dash Falls Short of NFL Combine Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tyquan Thornton's blazing 40-yard dash falls short of NFL Combine record originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoBaylor wide receiver Tyquan Thornton unofficially had the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record for about two hours.
On the opening night of drills at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine Thursday, Thornton ran his 40-yard dash in an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds, besting John Ross III's all-time event record of 4.22 seconds from 2017.
Thornton's 4.28 ties him with Champ Bailey and a few others for the ninth-fastest time in NFL Combine history.
Projected first-round pick Chris Olave out of Ohio State finished in an unofficial 4.26 seconds, and his official time was a 4.39.
Thornton may not have claimed the combine record, but he certainly boosted his draft stock with his blazing-fast 40.

He was the lone player on Thursday to run a sub-4.3 time, with only the receivers, tight ends and quarterbacks completing the event.
The second-fastest time of the day came from Tennessee's Velus Jones, who completed the dash in 4.31 seconds.
5 wide receiver prospects according to The Athletic's Dane Brugler, clocked in at nearly the same exact time at 4.38 and 4.39, respectively.
Leading the way for the tight ends was Maryland's Chig Okonkwo, No.

The group of pass catchers still left a contrail, as the eight sub-4.4 clockings tied the most by the wide receivers at the combine in any year evaluated since 2006.
Kansas State wide receiver Yamon Figurs ran the fastest 40 at the combine that year at 4.30.
Initially, the NFL reported that nine wide receivers had broken the mark, which would have been a record.

     Tyquan Thornton's 4.28 40-yard dash headlines fastest receiver class ever at NFL Scouting Combine

     INDIANAPOLIS -- The first group of receivers set the tone for Thursday night's workouts at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine, with four separate players posting sub-4.4-second times in the 40-yard dash.
Then the second group took the field and nearly blew the roof off Lucas Oil Stadium.
A short time later, Baylor's Tyquan Thornton recorded an unofficial time of 4.21, putting John Ross' combine record of 4.22 in question.
Ross ultimately kept the crown, though, as Thornton's official time came in at 4.28.
Olave's mark also dropped -- to 4.39 -- in the official results.

     Snowflake Stock: Making Sense Of A 30% Drop In Pricing (NYSE:SNOW)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While strong business execution is evident in Snowflake's commercial results, slowing revenue growth puts up challenges for the firm's valuation.
Before I dig into the outlook, I would like to discuss Snowflake's fourth-quarter earnings because they proved that the company is doing a great execution job.
The net revenue retention rate in the fourth-quarter was 178%, showing a 10 PP improvement year over year.
The dollar-based net revenue retention rate shows how efficiently companies convert existing clients and Snowflake is doing great in this metric.
In the fourth-quarter, Snowflake generated $70.7M in free cash flow, four times as much as in the four previous quarters combined.

     Sports Illustrated Chicago Bears News, Analysis and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Thornton has been ranked the 26th best outside receiver by NFL Draft Bible in this draft.
A few other developments could have bigger impacts on Bears chances for a wide receiver.
On Wednesday, North Dakota State receiver Christian Watson had said the Bears talked to him twice already.
The vertical was sixth among wide receivers and the broad jump (11 feet, 4 inches) was best among receivers.
Purdue wide receiver David Bell has been projected as a possible Bears pick in many mock drafts and he went through a disappointing day with a time of 4.65.
