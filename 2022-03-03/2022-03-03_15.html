I think the last couple of years I’ve opened up the tournament really well with scores similar to what I shot today.’’Rory McIlroy is once again rolling at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational.

If he feeds off me, I certainly think I feed off him a little bit too.’’Adam Scott got an up-close look at Rory McIlory’s Arnold Palmer Invitiational confidence.
I thought, ‘Of course, he’s 6.’ He’s just good, isn’t he?’’

     He added six birdies and a single bogey to take the early lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
It was the driver, however, that really shined, the club that has always distinguished McIlroy when he’s been at his best.
“It’s a drive-into-the-ball golf course, this one," said PGA Tour veteran Graeme McDowell, who like McIlroy, is from Northern Ireland.
“I really enjoy watching him play," said Adam Scott, who shot 68 and was in the same group as McIlroy, three shots back.
This is my fourth start of the calendar year, and I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.

     Jon Rahm missed a 10-inch putt as he endured a nightmare start to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Rahm played his first shot at the 7th to the fringe and second to within 10 inches, leaving a simple putt to save par.
That miss from 10 inches was the shortest putt Rahm has ever missed on the PGA Tour.
Watch the video below:Jon Rahm just missed a 3-inch putt…and didn’t even get it to the hole.
Maybe he should have told his Spanish rival to make sure he didn’t miss putts from within a foot of the hole!

Quote of the dayThe mutual admiration society between McIlroy and Scott (combined -11 on Thursday) was fun to see.
Rory McIlroy: +225Billy Horschel: 11-1Viktor Hovland: 12-1Sungjae Im: 12-1Will Zalatoris: 14-1Jon Rahm: 20-1I was surprised to see Rory this long and Rahm this short.
It shows how much folks (myself included) believe in the level of golf he's playing right now and what he could do if the putter gets hot over the final 54.

     Bay Hill Bomber: 'When Rory's on with his driver, there's no one better in the world'

     ORLANDO – Rory McIlroy followed his game plan for Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge perfectly.
Rory McIlroy played the four par 5s at Bay Hill today in 5-under (eagle, 3 birdies).
He is 66-under on the par 5s at Bay Hill since 2015, 17 shots better than any other player in that span.
“I think, when Rory’s on with his driver, there’s no one better in the world than Rory with a driver,” said Graeme McDowell, who opened with 4-under 68.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.
