     What we learned as Alabama basketball falls to Texas A&amp;M 87-713/2/22 MBB Alabama vs Texas A&amp;M Alabama forward James Rojas (33) Photo by Crimson Tide PhotosBy WVUA 23 Digital Reporter AJ HollidayThe University of Alabama men’s basketball team took on the Texas A&amp;M Aggies Wednesday night, but the Aggies stunned the Crimson Tide at home, winning 87-71.
But it was a dominant second half for the Aggies who played stifling defense, and outscored Bama 50-31 in the second half.
Here’s what we learned:Quenton Jackson and Tyrece Radford dominatedRadford dropped a season-high 22 points against the Crimson Tide Wednesday.
He made big shots all night and gave every Crimson Tide defender a hard time when they tried to guard him.
The Crimson Tide turned the ball over 10 times in the second half to finish with 19 turnovers, including some in pivotal moments.

     Alabama Basketball: Latest SEC Tournament seeding filled with ties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A second concern is will Wednesday’s embarrassment be followed by a bad loss to LSU in Baton Rouge and a quick exit from the SEC Tournament.
In opposition to that is another fact, when the Crimson Tide is ‘good’ it can be very good.
Anyone claiming to know the March fates of the Alabama Crimson Tide is delusional.
Alabama Basketball and SEC Tournament SeedingBased on current SEC standings and factoring in SEC tie-breakers, the Crimson Tide is the No.
If the SEC Tournament started today, it would begin with Ole Miss vs. Missouri and Vanderbilt vs. Georgia in session No.

     And during that long period in the locker room, no players stood up and spoke while Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats was in the room.
24 Crimson Tide entered as a favorite in the final home game of the season.
He mentioned past Alabama players such as Herb Jones and how much the Crimson Tide misses their leadership.
Other guys, it seems like maybe sometimes their leadership … when they’re playing well, it’s easier to be a better leader.
Jaden Shackelford, who led Alabama with 16 points, said the Crimson Tide needs to be tougher.
