     Why Snowflake Stock Is Down By 16% Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s Next For Snowflake Stock?
Snowflake stock reached its all-time high levels back in December 2020, when it made an attempt to settle above the $430 level.
The stock market has become more cautious with growth stocks in recent months, and traders want to see that growth companies continue to grow at a fast pace.
In this light, it remains to be seen whether speculative traders will rush to buy Snowflake stock after the disappointing guidance.
The stock remains richly valued, so the company must prove that it can maintain aggressive growth rates in the next few years.

     Epic Games have purchased music platform Bandcamp

     Music platform Bandcamp have announced that they are being bought by Epic Games.
That apparently includes Bandcamp Fridays, where on the first Friday of the month the platform waives its share of sales.
"Behind the scenes we're working with Epic to expand internationally and push development forward across Bandcamp," the statement continues.
Despite talking up their mission for a fair platform, Epic haven't always seen eye to eye with creators.
As well as various games acquisitions, like Fall Guys developers Mediatonic and Rocket League developers Psyonix , Epic acquired the artist marketplace ArtStation last year.

     Disappointing Forecast Sends Snowflake Stock Lower
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cloud-based software name Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) is down 16.9% at $220.64 at last glance -- brushing off upbeat fourth-quarter results after a dismal fiscal 2023 revenue forecast.
To follow, no fewer than 12 analysts slashed their price targets, with one coming from J.P. Morgan Securities to $270 from $340.
This negative price action has SNOW trading at its lowest levels since May of 2021.
The security has been moving lower since its mid-February rally was rejected by the 80-day moving average.
It's also worth noting that today's volatility has put SNOW on the Short Sale Restricted (SSR) list today.

     3 views on the Epic-Bandcamp deal – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After the acquisition, Bandcamp says it will continue to operate as an independent entity.
Founder and CEO Ethan Diamond will remain in charge, and according to his blog post, Bandcamp Fridays – a day when fees are waived for artists – will continue as normal, with editorial arm Bandcamp Daily remaining intact as well.
Here are three views on what this move could possibly mean for both indie musicians and the future of a rising gaming company.
Amanda, Devin and Alex weighed in on the news, working to unspool what it means and who it might benefit.
Other artists, musicians and journalists expressed concern when at least two editors of the small-staffed Bandcamp Daily made their Twitter accounts private and deleted all of their tweets.

     Cloud company Snowflake delivered a fiscal Q4 2022 earnings beat that did not please investors.
Despite more than doubling revenues YOY for the full year and quarter, Snowflake stock (SNOW) - Get Snowflake, Inc. Class A Report cratered on the back of a timid outlook for fiscal 2023.

     What Bandcamp’s Acquisition by Epic Games Means for Music Fans and Artists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yesterday’s news that Epic Games bought Bandcamp for an undisclosed sum sent shockwaves through both the gaming and music industries, with the companies’ official statements raising more questions than answers.
To begin to consider how Epic will steer Bandcamp moving forward, it’s important to give the players involved a close look.
Epic began as an indie outsider in the early ’90s, giving itself an outsized name to match its ambition.
Their subsidiary, Tencent Music, is the largest Chinese music service, with more than 840 million active users.
Bandcamp allows artists to charge whatever they want—including nothing at all—for their music, as well as use their digital storefront to sell other merchandise.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As a longtime user of Bandcamp, Epic Games’ acquisition of the online music storefront makes me nervous.
Why Bandcamp is different Bandcamp isn’t the only place where you can still buy and download music.
To be fair, I have no concrete reason to think that Epic will abandon downloadable music, and neither Epic nor Bandcamp have indicated that any fundamental changes are coming.
In 2020, revenue from downloads fell by 18% across the entire music industry according to the RIAA, and it accounted for just 6% of total recorded music revenue.
advertisementSo it’s fair to wonder if a company on the scale of Epic Games might eventually lose interest in that model.

     Epic Games to buy artist-focused site Bandcamp, adding music to its 'metaverse'
    </h2>

     Credit: WikipediaVideo game developer Epic Games said Wednesday it is buying Bandcamp, a popular music marketplace used by artists, for an undisclosed sum.
Bandcamp, which allows users to buy and stream music, marks Epic's 18th acquisition, according to venture capital data company Crunchbase.
Last year, it bought ArtStation, a website that allows artists to sell their work and host their portfolios.
The two purchases are quickly turning the Epic Games Store into a place where users could potentially buy much more than just video games.

     Epic Games buys BandcampBy Chris Cooke | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Fortnite maker Epic Games has made a bigger move into the music domain – following last year’s acquisition of music gaming firm Harmonix – by buying itself direct-to-fan platform Bandcamp.
Bandcamp founder Ethan Diamond announced the deal in a blog post yesterday, stating: “I’m excited to announce that Bandcamp is joining Epic Games, who you may know as the makers of Fortnite and Unreal Engine, and champions for a fair and open internet”.
“You’ll still have the same control over how you offer your music, Bandcamp Fridays will continue as planned, and the Daily will keep highlighting the diverse, amazing music on the site”, Diamond added.
Although, in many ways, a lot of that popularity is as much down to the Bandcamp model as the Bandcamp brand.

While SNOW stock offers stellar revenue growth, it trades at a high multiple despite a recent correction in software stocks.
Snowflake stock does not break out adjusted earnings in its earnings releases.

     While strong business execution is evident in Snowflake's commercial results, slowing revenue growth puts up challenges for the firm's valuation.
Before I dig into the outlook, I would like to discuss Snowflake's fourth-quarter earnings because they proved that the company is doing a great execution job.
The net revenue retention rate in the fourth-quarter was 178%, showing a 10 PP improvement year over year.
The dollar-based net revenue retention rate shows how efficiently companies convert existing clients and Snowflake is doing great in this metric.
In the fourth-quarter, Snowflake generated $70.7M in free cash flow, four times as much as in the four previous quarters combined.
