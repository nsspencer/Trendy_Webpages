     Why Snowflake Stock Is Down By 16% Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What’s Next For Snowflake Stock?
Snowflake stock reached its all-time high levels back in December 2020, when it made an attempt to settle above the $430 level.
The stock market has become more cautious with growth stocks in recent months, and traders want to see that growth companies continue to grow at a fast pace.
In this light, it remains to be seen whether speculative traders will rush to buy Snowflake stock after the disappointing guidance.
The stock remains richly valued, so the company must prove that it can maintain aggressive growth rates in the next few years.

     Disappointing Forecast Sends Snowflake Stock Lower
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cloud-based software name Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) is down 16.9% at $220.64 at last glance -- brushing off upbeat fourth-quarter results after a dismal fiscal 2023 revenue forecast.
To follow, no fewer than 12 analysts slashed their price targets, with one coming from J.P. Morgan Securities to $270 from $340.
This negative price action has SNOW trading at its lowest levels since May of 2021.
The security has been moving lower since its mid-February rally was rejected by the 80-day moving average.
It's also worth noting that today's volatility has put SNOW on the Short Sale Restricted (SSR) list today.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cloud company Snowflake delivered a fiscal Q4 2022 earnings beat that did not please investors.

     Snowflake Stock Takes Beating Following Projections for Slower Revenue Growth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After releasing a forecast that put its product sales growth under 70% for the fiscal year, Snowflake stock crashed 30%.
Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) stock recently plummeted 30% due to slowing revenue growth.
For its next fiscal first quarter, the cloud software company anticipates a product revenue growth of 79% to 81%.
By comparison, analysts’ expectations for Snowflake’s product revenue growth for the same period was 78%.
Snowflake management is forecasting a 65% to 67% product revenue growth rate for the 2023 fiscal year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While strong business execution is evident in Snowflake's commercial results, slowing revenue growth puts up challenges for the firm's valuation.
Before I dig into the outlook, I would like to discuss Snowflake's fourth-quarter earnings because they proved that the company is doing a great execution job.
The net revenue retention rate in the fourth-quarter was 178%, showing a 10 PP improvement year over year.
The dollar-based net revenue retention rate shows how efficiently companies convert existing clients and Snowflake is doing great in this metric.
In the fourth-quarter, Snowflake generated $70.7M in free cash flow, four times as much as in the four previous quarters combined.

In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Snowflake stock retreated 15.4% to close at 224.02.
While SNOW stock offers stellar revenue growth, it trades at a high multiple despite a recent correction in software stocks.
