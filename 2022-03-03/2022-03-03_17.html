     Jaguars owner Tony Khan to buy Ring of Honor wrestling from Sinclair Broadcast

     Ring of Honor had said in October that it would be shutting down this year for at least three months while the company reevaluated the business.
Ring of Honor said then that the loss of live events during the pandemic made it necessary to “reimagine ROH.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was a power move that allowed WWE to become the top entity in pro wrestling.
On this past Wednesday’s AEW Dynamite, founder Tony Khan started the show by announcing he had purchased Ring of Honor from Sinclair Broadcast Group.

The promotion has been home to several wrestlers over the years, with many on the AEW and WWE roster.
Along with action in the ring, ROH recently announced the debut of the ROH Hall of Fame.

     AEW Owner Tony Khan Buys Ring Of Honor Wrestling Promotion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tony Khan has shaken the world of professional wrestling once again.
The owner of All Elite Wrestling has formally announced his purchase of Ring of Honor (ROH), a groundbreaking, influential independent wrestling promotion in which many of AEW's current wrestlers plied their in-ring craft during their formative years and saw their careers take off to unforeseen heights in the wrestling world.
There are no ends to the possibilities with Khan as ROH's new figurehead.
The hours upon hours of video content means that AEW's inaugural event in 2018, ALL IN, could finally find its way to the public eye.
There's also the chance for underutilized AEW stars to find their niche on AEW shows like Dark and Dark: Elevation, but rebranded under the ROH name to pave the way for new TV deals.

     AEW boss Tony Khan buys legendary independent promotion Ring of Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s hard not to see last night’s announcement as the mic-drop moment to officially end the Wednesday night standoff between AEW and WWE NXT.
Three years after the launch of AEW, Khan’s promotion halted NXT as we knew it, signed its top talent and bought ROH.
And what about using said company to help scout future talent or help wrestlers get back in shape from injuries?
One thing WWE did brilliantly, for at least one show per talent, was how they introduced top NXT wrestlers onto the main roster.
That’s how primarily ROH talent could be introduced into AEW.

     AEW buying Ring of Honor is good for everyone in wrestling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AEW owner Tony Khan stood in the middle of the ring on Wednesday night to deliver a “huge announcement” he’d teased for over a week.
However, the twist came with the revelation that AEW was buying everything, the library, the brand, trademarks, heck, even the ring and production equipment would come under his ownership.
It’s resulted in the release of brilliant wrestlers, huge names, all in service of saving money.
Now we can see a proud return of a wrestling company with a legacy, and history that deserves celebration.
Tony Khan and AEW didn’t just throw a lifeline, they gained the ability to bring back a legendary wrestling brand.
