     ‘Our Flag Means Death,’ Starring Taika Waititi and Rhys Darby, Brings Surprising Introspection to the High Seas: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A few episodes into “Our Flag Means Death,” aristocrat turned pirate ship captain Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) admires his spoils with a frisson of glee.
“Why can’t one be a gentleman and a pirate?” he muses aloud to no one in particular, before deciding to embrace that inherent contradiction as his new moniker.
And lo, “The Gentleman Pirate” is born, and the logline of “Our Flag Means Death” stated as clearly as can be.
Every decision Stede makes is met with derision by his crew, made up of would-be baddies like “Black Pete” (Matthew Maher), a disguised stowaway (Vico Ortiz), Stede’s confused assistant Lucius (Nathan Foad), and hulking softie Jeffrey (Dominic Burgess).
“Our Flag Means Death” premiered Thursday, Mar.

     HBO Max’s ‘Our Flag Means Death’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Faced with the prospect of a proper bloody battle in the first episode of HBO Max’s Our Flag Means Death, pirate captain Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) has a horrifying realization.
But if Our Flag Means Death has a single defining quality, it’s “cute” — and, yes, that’s a compliment.
Our Flag Means Death The Bottom Line A cute comedy about not-so-bloodthirsty pirates.
But Our Flag Means Death handles the darker aspects of its story with a light touch.
Such restraint keeps Our Flag Means Death from saying anything truly novel or profound about trauma or class or masculinity or any of the other larger ideas it invokes.

     Our Flag Means Death review: a terrific pirate comedy to binge — eventually
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s not that there’s anything actually wrong with the opening episodes of the show, which introduce “gentleman pirate” Stede Bonnet and his crew, and set all the crucial gears in motion.
And the kickoff doesn’t do much to suggest what’s coming later, when Stede meets the legendary pirate Blackbeard (Waititi, in a striking, standout performance).
Once that process starts, Our Flag Means Death fully finds its footing, its heart, and the drama underlying all the wacky characters and straight-faced comic banter.
Obviously, it’s possible to watch the opening episodes of Our Flag Means Death at launch, and then come back later for more.
Maybe give Our Flag Means Death a pass this week.

OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
Our Flag Means Death, created by David Jenkins (People Of Earth) and directed by Taika Waititi, certainly has a bit of the feel of Waititi’s What We Do In The Shadows.
Essentially, Our Flag Means Death is a workplace comedy, and all workplace comedies come down to the fact that the group you’re working with is a substitute family.
Although Our Flag Means Death isn’t laugh-a-minute, it’s got a good-enough story to set up a unique workplace comedy.
