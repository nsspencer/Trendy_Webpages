     Government announces sanctions against Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton.
This expert group will coordinate cross-government work to sanction oligarchs, helping build cases against the list of oligarchs it has identified as targets.
Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
These latest sanctions are part of a tough package against Russia, including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK.
In coordination with the US and other allies, these measures amount to the largest set of financial sanctions in history.

     Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s $600M yacht seized in Germany: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities in Germany this week seized a lavish $600 million yacht belonging to a Russian oligarch, according to reports.
The Dilbar, a 512-foot vessel belonging to billionaire Alisher Usmanov, was taken over by authorities while it was being refitted in a German shipyard, Forbes reported.
30 October 2021, Hamburg: The luxury yacht Dilbar has moored at the quay wall of the Blohm+Voss shipyard.
The 156-metre-long yacht, which weighs almost 16,000 tonnes, was delivered by the Lürssen shipyard in Bremen to a Russian billionaire in 2016.
President Biden and other Western leaders have made Russian oligarchs a target of their efforts to put economic pressure on Putin as he continues the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Alisher Usmanov, who had commercial ties to Everton, has had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Usmanov had already been hit with sanctions by the European Union.
UK foreign secretary Liz Truss announced on Thursday that Usmanov would be sanctioned, along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
USM Holdings, in which Usmanov has a 49 per cent stake, had sponsored the club’s training ground.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Russian billionaire had his yacht seized by German authorities on Wednesday, Forbes reported.
In the past, Alisher Usmanov has spoken highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Usmanov bought the custom-built yacht for an estimated $600 million, and it took 52 months to build, Forbes reported.
The US State Department was unable to confirm to Insider whether the yacht was indeed seized.
After the European Union announced sanctions against Usmanov and other Russian oligarchs, he stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation.

     Dilbar, Alisher Usmanov’s $600m superyacht that may – or may not – have been seized in Germany.
The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

     Everton owner Farhad Moshiri has severed business links with Alisher Usmanov in an an attempt to put more distance between the club and the sanctioned billionaire.
The Telegraph report that Moshiri stepped down from the board of USM, a Russian holding company that Usmanov founded, within hours of suspending the club's multiple sponsorship ties on Thursday.
Earlier in the day Everton suspended with immediate effect all commercial and sponsorship arrangements with Russian companies following the invasion of Ukraine.
This included USM as well as Megafon and Yota, which are also linked to Alisher Usmanov.

     Sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs including Alisher Usmanov over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.
