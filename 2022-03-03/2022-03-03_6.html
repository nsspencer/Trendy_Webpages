He joked, ‚ÄúNot the fat face and braids smh lol,‚Äù after the team put up a picture of Thomas welcoming him to Buzz City.
Charlotte Needs ThomasThomas comes to the Hornets at a point when the team needs more than a little assist.
There was a lot of hope for this young team when the season began and, sure enough, for a while, the team was doing quite well.
If he does, perhaps Thomas will remain in Charlotte a lot longer.

     Isaiah Thomas Scores in 10 Points In His Charlotte Hornets Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There‚Äôs something that goes off in the mind of Isaiah Thomas when he plays after signing 10-day contracts.
In his debut as a Charlotte Hornet, Thomas contributed 10 points, five rebounds, and three assists in only 14 minutes of action off the bench to help lead Charlotte to a much-needed 119-98 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

In December, Thomas led the Los Angeles Lakers in scoring with 19 points in a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

     Isaiah Thomas Returned To The NBA Last Night And Immediately Started Getting Buckets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Hornets went from 6 games over .500 to 3 games under .500 heading into Wednesday.
You know, the man that just had like 120 points in three G-League games or some shit arrived with one job and one job only.
Based on this very large sample of 14 minutes in a blowout, it looks like the Hornets are going to let Isaiah be Isaiah whenever he's on the floor.
A team slightly below .500 who is flirting with the postseason brings in Isaiah who immediately gets buckets and changes their whole vibe.
I mean that's what the end of the third quarter was last night and it was awesome to see.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Charlotte got big-time contributions from their bench unit, including newcomer Isaiah Thomas.
The Hornets signed Thomas to a 10-day contract on Tuesday and he just joined the team at shootaround the morning before their tilt against the Cavs.
Terry Rozier, who was teammates with Thomas on the Boston Celtics, commented on everything Thomas brings to the team.
It‚Äôs his leadership, him being a vet, his voice in the huddles, in the locker room, already making an impact.
Despite Thomas not being able to hold down an NBA job in recent years, Rozier still thinks very highly of his former teammate.

Although Thomas‚Äô stint with the Hornets most likely won‚Äôt go beyond this season, his resiliency is impressive to see.

But these are the Charlotte Hornets we‚Äôre talking about.
Just when you think you have them pegged, they pull something akin to what transpired in Wednesday night‚Äôs impressive 119-98 win over Cleveland at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.
