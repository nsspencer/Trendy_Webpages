     Rory McIlroy cards blistering 65 to take lead at Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     McIlroy’s superb opening round of 65 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida suggested he remains of a mind to right that Emirates Club wrong.
“Regardless of when it comes in the season, it’s nice to win,” McIlroy said.
I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.
“I did all the hard stuff right,” he said.
There’s been a lot of really, really good stuff happening in my game.”Adam Scott, playing in McIlroy’s company, signed for the same score as McDowell.

DeChambeau frequently sports a white belt in tournament play and former fashion director at Golf Digest (now retired) Marty Hackel explained his stance on white belts.
“Unless you are helping schoolchildren cross the street or a drum major on a high school marching band, no white belts.
“If you are older than 36 or your waist is over 36 inches, no white belts.

     McIlroy, the 32-year-old Northern Irishman, shot a scorching 7-under 65 Thursday to take a two-shot lead entering Friday’s second round.
I think the last couple of years I’ve opened up the tournament really well with scores similar to what I shot today.’’Rory McIlroy is once again rolling at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational.
Getty ImagesIndeed, McIlroy shot 66 in the opening round last year and in 2020, but both of those weeks ended in disappointing finishes after final-round 76s.
If he feeds off me, I certainly think I feed off him a little bit too.’’Adam Scott got an up-close look at Rory McIlory’s Arnold Palmer Invitiational confidence.
I thought, ‘Of course, he’s 6.’ He’s just good, isn’t he?’’

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The second-best field of the year (to date) produced one of the best first-round leaders of the season as Rory McIlroy raced out in front at the Arnold Palmer Invitational with a 7-under 65 in the first round.
Rick Gehman and Kyle Porter discuss Thursday's first round action at the 2022 Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Quote of the dayThe mutual admiration society between McIlroy and Scott (combined -11 on Thursday) was fun to see.
Rory McIlroy: +225Billy Horschel: 11-1Viktor Hovland: 12-1Sungjae Im: 12-1Will Zalatoris: 14-1Jon Rahm: 20-1I was surprised to see Rory this long and Rahm this short.
It shows how much folks (myself included) believe in the level of golf he's playing right now and what he could do if the putter gets hot over the final 54.

     Rory McIlroy continues Bay Hill mastery, leads Arnold Palmer Invitational early Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO – Rory McIlroy followed his game plan for Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge perfectly.
“It felt as good as it has for a long time,” he said of his game.
“It’s one of these courses that I don’t feel like I have to do anything special to compete,” McIlroy explained on Wednesday.
You play conservatively the rest of the way, especially how the golf course here has been set up the past few years.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.
