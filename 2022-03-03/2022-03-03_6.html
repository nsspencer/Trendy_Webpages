     Rory McIlroy cards blistering 65 to take lead at Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     McIlroy’s superb opening round of 65 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida suggested he remains of a mind to right that Emirates Club wrong.
“Regardless of when it comes in the season, it’s nice to win,” McIlroy said.
I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance.
“I did all the hard stuff right,” he said.
There’s been a lot of really, really good stuff happening in my game.”Adam Scott, playing in McIlroy’s company, signed for the same score as McDowell.

     Government announces sanctions against Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton.
This expert group will coordinate cross-government work to sanction oligarchs, helping build cases against the list of oligarchs it has identified as targets.
Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
These latest sanctions are part of a tough package against Russia, including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK.
In coordination with the US and other allies, these measures amount to the largest set of financial sanctions in history.

     Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s $600M yacht seized in Germany: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities in Germany this week seized a lavish $600 million yacht belonging to a Russian oligarch, according to reports.
The Dilbar, a 512-foot vessel belonging to billionaire Alisher Usmanov, was taken over by authorities while it was being refitted in a German shipyard, Forbes reported.
30 October 2021, Hamburg: The luxury yacht Dilbar has moored at the quay wall of the Blohm+Voss shipyard.
The 156-metre-long yacht, which weighs almost 16,000 tonnes, was delivered by the Lürssen shipyard in Bremen to a Russian billionaire in 2016.
President Biden and other Western leaders have made Russian oligarchs a target of their efforts to put economic pressure on Putin as he continues the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Alisher Usmanov hit by UK government sanctions over Russia’s Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Alisher Usmanov, who had commercial ties to Everton, has had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Usmanov had already been hit with sanctions by the European Union.
UK foreign secretary Liz Truss announced on Thursday that Usmanov would be sanctioned, along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
USM Holdings, in which Usmanov has a 49 per cent stake, had sponsored the club’s training ground.

     A Russian billionaire had his yacht seized by German authorities on Wednesday, Forbes reported.
In the past, Alisher Usmanov has spoken highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Usmanov bought the custom-built yacht for an estimated $600 million, and it took 52 months to build, Forbes reported.
The US State Department was unable to confirm to Insider whether the yacht was indeed seized.
After the European Union announced sanctions against Usmanov and other Russian oligarchs, he stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation.

The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

     ORLANDO – Rory McIlroy followed his game plan for Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge perfectly.
“It felt as good as it has for a long time,” he said of his game.
“It’s one of these courses that I don’t feel like I have to do anything special to compete,” McIlroy explained on Wednesday.
You play conservatively the rest of the way, especially how the golf course here has been set up the past few years.
“When I start hitting long irons like that, I know my swing is in a pretty good place.”While Bay Hill certainly rewards goods driving, Scott said McIlroy’s game was hitting on all keys.

     "Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.

NEW RUSSIA SANCTIONS: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs.
"Those reports are inaccurate," said Lampard when asked if Usmanov played a role in his hiring.
"My interview was with the board, with Mr (Farhad) Moshiri, the chairman (Bill Kenwright), Denise (Barrett-Baxendale) the CEO and others - but not Mr Usmanov.

     Sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs including Alisher Usmanov over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.
