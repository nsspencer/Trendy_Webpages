     Evan Rachel Wood Transforms Into 1980s Madonna in New "Weird Al" Movie — Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No, still no word on the new season — but one of its biggest stars, Evan Rachel Wood, has been keeping busy doing something extremely awesome: looking exactly like Madonna.
Wood posted a photo of herself to Instagram on Wednesday, March 2, in which she's dressed and made up to uncannily resemble Madonna circa 1984.
The still is from Roku's upcoming Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a film about "Weird Al" Yankovic's unusual and award-winning career, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the curly-haired king of parody songs.
"I am having WAY TOO MUCH FUN playing the iconic Madonna in @therokuchannel's WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story with Daniel Radcliffe.
So I definitely can't wait to see the other Madonna looks — not to mention how Radcliffe looks as Yankovic — when the movie premieres.

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment WriterRocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancee, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.”Manson was dropped by his record label.
“Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco and Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters have sued him based on their sexual abuse allegations.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‘Phoenix Rising’ on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account”.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner”.

     Marilyn Manson Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Evan Rachel Wood, Calls Claims of Abuse a “Malicious Falsehood”
    </h2>

     Marilyn Manson has filed a defamation lawsuit in a Los Angeles Superior Court against ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood over her allegations of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred during the course of the relationship from 2007 to 2010.
“I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him before he ruins any more lives,” said Wood.
His complaint comes two weeks before the release of the Amy Berg-directed two-part documentary about Wood’s allegations, Phoenix Rising, which is set to premiere on HBO.
In an Instagram post on March 2, Warner said, “There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year.

     Manson’s suit, which asks for a jury trial, accuses Wood and Gore of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
“That same day, several other women, assisted and coordinated by Wood and/or Gore, sought media attention with remarkably similar public abuse allegations against Warner,” the lawsuit says.
“Those claims, like Wood’s, were false.”Manson has not been charged with any crime connected to Wood’s allegations.
And in June, the model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson alleging sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking.
Manson has repeatedly denied any and all allegations of sexual assault and abuse.

"I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria," Aurora said.
"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary "one-sided" and "premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation."

     Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood, alleging that she and her partner defamed him in order to destroy his career.
Manson, real name Brian Warner, filed his complaint to the Los Angeles Superior Court and is seeking a jury trial, US media reports.
In Wood’s forthcoming documentary, Phoenix Rising, she alleges that Manson “essentially raped” her while filming the music video for his 2007 single “Heart-Shaped Glasses”.
King also alleges that Wood and Gore “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse” for profit.
