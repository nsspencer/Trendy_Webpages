     Why Hasn't Leighton Meester Had the Career She Deserves?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This weekend, Netflix will release the Leighton Meester vehicle The Weekend Away, a vaguely tawdry thriller that's just shy of being a good "Saturday night bottle of wine" movie.
The Weekend Away, while solid, is not going to launch the Leighton Meesterssance, disappointing news for all of us who have been rooting for her ever since she was popping off Blair Waldorf bon mots.
It's not like Meester hasn't been working since Blair married Chuck in the 2012 Gossip Girl finale.
By the time Meester was cast as Blair Waldorf she had been working for years, racking up TV guest stars and recurring roles on shows like 24 and Veronica Mars.
(When picking our favorite television characters of the 21st Century, we here at Thrillist put Blair in the top 10.)

     The Weekend Away movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the opening shot deflates much of the tension here as we know Kate’s fate long before Beth does.
In the more emotional sequences, Farrant does not shy away from a classic close-up, allowing Meester to showcase her expressive eyes.
Beth trusts Kate, even when she gets her to do things outside her comfort zone.
Beth trusts Zain.
“The Weekend Away” is the best kind of purposely preposterous potboiler.

     They decide to take a girls' trip to Croatia for the weekend and have some fun.
What "The Weekend Away" does well is it quite literally makes every person in the movie a suspect.
Lastly, we have Sebastian (Adrian Pezdirc), the landlord of the apartment Beth and Kate are staying in.
So naturally, after what happened in Croatia, Beth breaks things off.
But Rob turns up to confront her about the affair.

     ‘The Weekend Away’ Review: A Croatian Vacay Turns Hazardous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Current B-grade thrillers so frequently have too little plot — often not much more than a starting premise — that it’s almost refreshing to see something like “The Weekend Away,” which has many more narrative complications than it can pull off.
Director Kim Farrant’s last two features (2015’s “Strangerland,” 2019’s “Angel of Mine”) both involved suspicions cast on unstable adults over missing children.
Whereas in “Weekend’s” missing person scenario, our protagonist is pretty much the sole character who doesn’t end up looking guilty of something or other.
Deprived the more complicated psychological dimensions of her prior thrillers to lean on, “Away” requires a more mysterious, threatening mood than she seems interested in summoning.
Rather like the kind of airport-bookstore potboiler it’s duly based on, “The Weekend Away” holds attention sufficient to pass the time.
