     Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     During the throwing drills, it was notable how the ball popped out of Willis' hand.
He showed that with the right development, he could be a successful NFL quarterback for years to come.
Video Play Button Videos you might likeWillis' hand size didn't raise any eyebrows as he measured in at nine-and-a-half inches, which is fairly average.
Comparatively, that is the same size as NFL quarterbacks Kyler Murray, Lamar Jackson and Matt Ryan.

     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.

     Liberty’s Malik Willis turning heads with NFL Scouting Combine approach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     INDIANAPOLIS — Liberty quarterback Malik Willis — a projected first-round pick — was seen in a viral video stopping on the streets of town to give unidentified items from his suitcase to a man in need on the street.
ESPN analysts Matt Miller and Todd McShay both reported that Willis has been doing “very well” in his private 15-minute-long formal interviews with teams at the NFL combine.
Malik Willis has impressed teams at the NFL combine with his on- and off-the-field actions.
Willis told at least one team that already has a young quarterback in the mix, “I know you aren’t drafting me,” a source said.
Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett’s hands measured 8.5 inches from pinky to thumb, meaning he has the smallest hands of any first-round quarterback since Michael Vick recorded that same measurement in 2001.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The quarterback class in the 2022 NFL Draft may not seem strong in relation to other years, and for some it might lack true star power.
Liberty's Malik Willis, Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Cincinnati's Desmond Ridder did their best to change that during their work on and off the field at the NFL Combine.
When he was throwing, Pickett showed off strong touch and accuracy as he completed passes at different levels of the field.
Ridder didn't have the same "Wow" moments with his arm that Willis did, and he wasn't as accurate in making all the throws the way Pickett was.
Given the high number of QB-needy teams, Willis, Pickett and Ridder should all be gone by No.

That man, of course, is Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera—who spoke with CBS Sports at the NFL Scouting Combine on Wednesday.
“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
“This young man has a tremendous skill set,” he added.
But I can tell you I’ve had the opportunity to interview him—he’s a heck of a young man.

     Ron Rivera’s shocking comparison between Malik Willis and MVP QB ahead of NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The comments made by both head coach Ron Rivera and general manager Martin Mayhew indicate that the team has been doing their due diligence on all available QBs, including those in the NFL Draft.
Speaking to reporters, Rivera heaped praise on Liberty’s Malik Willis, shockingly comparing him to this former MVP quarterback, as reported by NBC Sports.
“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”Commanders head coach Ron Rivera compared Malik Willis to former Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, who won the league MVP in 2015 under Rivera’s tutelage.
That is quite the comparison to make ahead of an NFL Draft that hasn’t been viewed as the greatest for its quarterback play.
However, Willis does share some similarities with Newton, as both are viewed as dual threat quarterbacks, though Rivera also commended the NFL Draft prospect’s football IQ as well.
