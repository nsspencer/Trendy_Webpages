However, on Thursday the Russian entrepreneur clarified in a LinkedIn post that he never intended to pay for Putin’s assassination.
He encouraged others to take a stand against Russian aggression and Putin specifically.
Fridman, who divides his time between London and Moscow, was the first oligarch to speak out against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine,” he said.

     Bounty on Putin? Russian Businessman Puts Up $1M for Putin’s Arrest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin posted a message on social media offering a $1 million bounty for the arrest of Vladimir Putin.
While the text of Konanykhin's message merely called for Putin's arrest, a since-deleted version featured Putin's face on a "Dead or Alive" poster, and many on social media referred to the message as a "bounty on Putin's head."
As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia.
After posts about a “bounty on Putin’s head” went viral, Konanykhin shared another message on Facebook calling these reports incorrect.
Konanykhin was frequently described as a “Russian entrepreneur” in social media posts about his bounty on Putin.
