     James Earl Jones To Have Historic Broadway Theater Renamed In His Honor

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nothing could be better than having an historic Broadway Theater named after you.
The Shubert Organization announced Wednesday it will rename the Cort Theater on Broadway after legendary actor James Earl Jones, according to The New York Times.
Jones also received a lifetime achievement Tony in 2017.
Besides winning three Tony awards, Jones has also won a Grammy, two Emmys and an honorary Academy Award.
Now seeing his name on a Broadway Theater should be the motivation needed for all to do so.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian businessman Alex Konanykhin has placed a $1 million bounty on the head of Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging Russian officers to arrest their president as a “war criminal.”“I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws,” Konanykhin wrote in a Facebook post earlier this week.
However, on Thursday the Russian entrepreneur clarified in a LinkedIn post that he never intended to pay for Putin’s assassination.
He encouraged others to take a stand against Russian aggression and Putin specifically.
Fridman, who divides his time between London and Moscow, was the first oligarch to speak out against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine,” he said.

"The Shubert Organization is so incredibly honored to put James — an icon in the theatre community, the Black community, and the American community — forever in Broadway's lights," Robert E. Wankel, Shubert Organization CEO and board chair, said in the statement.
Jones, 91, got his Broadway start in 1957, making his Cort Theatre debut in the 1958 play Sunrise at Campobello.
The Cort Theatre (138 West 48th Street) has been under construction during the coronavirus pandemic, with the work set to be completed this summer.
