     Evan Rachel Wood Transforms Into 1980s Madonna in New "Weird Al" Movie ‚Äî Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No, still no word on the new season ‚Äî but one of its biggest stars, Evan Rachel Wood, has been keeping busy doing something extremely awesome: looking exactly like Madonna.
Wood posted a photo of herself to Instagram on Wednesday, March 2, in which she's dressed and made up to uncannily resemble Madonna circa 1984.
The still is from Roku's upcoming Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a film about "Weird Al" Yankovic's unusual and award-winning career, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the curly-haired king of parody songs.
"I am having WAY TOO MUCH FUN playing the iconic Madonna in @therokuchannel's WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story with Daniel Radcliffe.
So I definitely can't wait to see the other Madonna looks ‚Äî not to mention how Radcliffe looks as Yankovic ‚Äî when the movie premieres.

"I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria," Aurora said.
"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary "one-sided" and "premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation."

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‚ÄòPhoenix Rising‚Äô on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable ‚Äì and this legal action will hold them to account‚Äù.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore ‚Äúprovided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner‚Äù.
