The $600 million vessel Dilbar has been seized while at the Hamburg shipyard of Germany's Blohm + Voss for repairs, news provider Forbes reported on Wednesday.
The vessel is the world's largest motor yacht by tonnage, and Usmanov bought it in 2016.
The case may prompt other authorities around the world to attempt similar actions against the yachts of wealthy Russians.

     Alisher Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton.
This expert group will coordinate cross-government work to sanction oligarchs, helping build cases against the list of oligarchs it has identified as targets.
Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
These latest sanctions are part of a tough package against Russia, including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK.
In coordination with the US and other allies, these measures amount to the largest set of financial sanctions in history.

     Alisher Usmanov, who had commercial ties to Everton, has had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Usmanov had already been hit with sanctions by the European Union.

“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.

     Dilbar, Alisher Usmanov’s $600m superyacht that may – or may not – have been seized in Germany.
The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov.
In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges.
Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alisher Usmanov during an awarding ceremony at the Kremlin in 2018.
Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”.

     Sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs including Alisher Usmanov over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The UK has imposed sanctions on billionaire sports and mining mogul Alisher Usmanov along with former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, as part of the international reaction to the invasion of Ukraine.
He is a core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 football World Cup.
“Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one – invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences,” she said.
“Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.
The naming of the pair brings the total number of oligarchs sanctioned since the invasion began a week ago to 13.
