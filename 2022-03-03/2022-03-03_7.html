     Snowflake Stock Falls as Software Tweak Hits Revenue. Analysts Remain Bullish.

     Disappointing Forecast Sends Snowflake Stock Lower
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cloud-based software name Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) is down 16.9% at $220.64 at last glance -- brushing off upbeat fourth-quarter results after a dismal fiscal 2023 revenue forecast.
To follow, no fewer than 12 analysts slashed their price targets, with one coming from J.P. Morgan Securities to $270 from $340.
This negative price action has SNOW trading at its lowest levels since May of 2021.
The security has been moving lower since its mid-February rally was rejected by the 80-day moving average.
It's also worth noting that today's volatility has put SNOW on the Short Sale Restricted (SSR) list today.
