     Actor James Earl Jones to get Broadway theatre named after him
    </h2>

     The Shubert Organization’s Cort Theatre on Broadway will be renamed after James Earl JonesThe Shubert Organization’s Cort Theatre on Broadway will be renamed after James Earl Jones, fulfilling a promise by the theatre giant to honour a Black artist in such a way, reported The Associated Press.
The James Earl Jones Theatre renaming is “in recognition of Mr. Jones’ lifetime of immense contributions to Broadway and the entire artistic community,” according to a statement by the Shuberts.
“Let my journey from then to now be an inspiration for all aspiring actors.”Jones has appeared in 21 Broadway productions, including two at the Cort Theatre.
The Cort Theatre — at 138 W. 48th St. — is 110 years old and was built by and named for John Cort, general manager of the Northwestern Theatrical Association, who died in 1929.
There are 41 Broadway theatres — four are named for women and now two for Black artists.

     A Broadway Theatre Will Be Renamed After James Earl Jones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Shubert Organization, the largest theatre owner on Broadway, will rename one of its 17 theatres after two-time Tony Award winner James Earl Jones.
Jones began his Broadway career in 1957 as an understudy in The Egghead.
Jones got his first starring role a year later in Sunrise at Campobello, which ran for over a year at the Cort Theatre.
The Shubert Organization pledged last summer to name one of its theatres after a Black artist in an agreement with Black Theatre United.
Robert E. Wankel, chairman and chief executive of the Shubert Organization praised Jones for an amazing career on Broadway.

     James Earl Jones To Have Historic Broadway Theater Renamed In His Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nothing could be better than having an historic Broadway Theater named after you.
The Shubert Organization announced Wednesday it will rename the Cort Theater on Broadway after legendary actor James Earl Jones, according to The New York Times.
Jones also received a lifetime achievement Tony in 2017.
Besides winning three Tony awards, Jones has also won a Grammy, two Emmys and an honorary Academy Award.
Now seeing his name on a Broadway Theater should be the motivation needed for all to do so.
