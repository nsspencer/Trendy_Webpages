     The Weekend Away review – Leighton Meester anchors taut but thin Netflix thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An American wakes up in a cozy hotel in Croatia, violently hungover and dazed from the night before.
An unexpected blackout has rendered Beth’s (Leighton Meester) memory of the previous few hours into a few incoherent shards, ones she fears putting together.
Relatable content for many women at some point in their lives, and thus a compelling starting point for The Weekend Away, a brisk and absorbing if increasingly thin thriller about a girls’ holiday weekend gone wrong.
At 90 minutes, The Weekend Away is not much longer than some streaming TV episodes, and accomplishes much more plot in its swift runtime.
It’s a thriller by name but less edge-of-your-seat than lounging on the couch, absorbing beats of plot like the ocean tide.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘The Weekend Away’ On Netflix, A Vacation Murder Mystery Starring Leighton Meester
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In whodunnit The Weekend Away, now streaming on Netflix, Gossip Girl vet Leighton Meester stars as Beth, a new mother who gets convinced to go on a girls’ weekend with her BFF in dreamy Croatia.
THE WEEKEND AWAY: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
: The Weekend Away might remind you a little of A Bigger Splash, The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Gone, A Simple Favor, and The Roommate.
Even if you’re tired of thrillers with unremarkable, familiar stories and underbaked characterization, Leighton Meester is reason enough to watch The Weekend Away.
Predictable and clunky as it may be, The Weekend Away is watchable as hell, serving as a suspenseful showcase for a strong performance from Leighton Meester.

     ‘The Weekend Away’ Review: A Croatian Vacay Turns Hazardous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Current B-grade thrillers so frequently have too little plot — often not much more than a starting premise — that it’s almost refreshing to see something like “The Weekend Away,” which has many more narrative complications than it can pull off.
Director Kim Farrant’s last two features (2015’s “Strangerland,” 2019’s “Angel of Mine”) both involved suspicions cast on unstable adults over missing children.
Whereas in “Weekend’s” missing person scenario, our protagonist is pretty much the sole character who doesn’t end up looking guilty of something or other.
Deprived the more complicated psychological dimensions of her prior thrillers to lean on, “Away” requires a more mysterious, threatening mood than she seems interested in summoning.
Rather like the kind of airport-bookstore potboiler it’s duly based on, “The Weekend Away” holds attention sufficient to pass the time.

Rather like the kind of airport-bookstore potboiler it’s duly based on, “The Weekend Away” holds attention sufficient to pass the time.
