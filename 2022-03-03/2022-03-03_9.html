     Malik Willis, one of top QB prospects at NFL Combine, goes viral for helping Indy woman in need

     Malik Willis, the Liberty quarterback considered to be among the best at his position in this year's NFL Draft, went viral in Indianapolis at the NFL Combine.
A video of Willis giving his gear to a woman sitting outside St. Elmo Steakhouse made the rounds on social media Thursday afternoon.

     NFL Draft Rumors: Malik Willis Blowing Away Coaches, Execs During Combine Meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michael Hickey/Getty ImagesMany around the NFL believe that the top quarterback prospects in this year's draft are Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Liberty's Malik Willis.
But according to The Athletic's Jeff Howe, Willis might be setting himself apart with how he's impressed league personnel during this week's NFL combine.
"The overwhelming majority of those evaluators also believe Willis has the highest ceiling of the signal-callers, but he’ll need at least a season to develop," Howe wrote.
"Willis has continued to blow away coaches and executives during his meetings, which was also the case at the Senior Bowl."
Some draft prognosticators believe it's possible that a QB isn't chosen at all in the first round.

     Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

That was the case for quarterback Malik Willis, the Liberty star who’s looking to establish himself as the top quarterback in this draft class.

     And during an interview with the Washington Football Talk podcast at the NFL Combine, one draft expert recommended that the Commanders go with Willis over Pickett if they end up facing that decision next month.
Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
“This young man has a tremendous skill set,” he added.
But I can tell you I’ve had the opportunity to interview him—he’s a heck of a young man.
