     The Weekend Away movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the opening shot deflates much of the tension here as we know Kate’s fate long before Beth does.
In the more emotional sequences, Farrant does not shy away from a classic close-up, allowing Meester to showcase her expressive eyes.
Beth trusts Kate, even when she gets her to do things outside her comfort zone.
Beth trusts Zain.
“The Weekend Away” is the best kind of purposely preposterous potboiler.

     Evan Rachel Wood Transforms Into 1980s Madonna in New "Weird Al" Movie — Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No, still no word on the new season — but one of its biggest stars, Evan Rachel Wood, has been keeping busy doing something extremely awesome: looking exactly like Madonna.
Wood posted a photo of herself to Instagram on Wednesday, March 2, in which she's dressed and made up to uncannily resemble Madonna circa 1984.
The still is from Roku's upcoming Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a film about "Weird Al" Yankovic's unusual and award-winning career, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the curly-haired king of parody songs.
"I am having WAY TOO MUCH FUN playing the iconic Madonna in @therokuchannel's WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story with Daniel Radcliffe.
So I definitely can't wait to see the other Madonna looks — not to mention how Radcliffe looks as Yankovic — when the movie premieres.

     The Weekend Away Ending Proves You Should Keep Buying Cheap Crap Online

     Suspecting Kate has been murdered (she has), Beth sort of stands around wringing her hands and weeping for help as the list of suspects potentially involved in Kate’s disappearance gets longer.
Rob has been banging his wife’s bestie on the dl for months and doesn’t want Beth to find out about the affair.
She isn’t quite dead, however, and Rob has a chance to save her during the incident, but he doesn’t take it.
Beth doesn’t find out that Rob is behind the murder until she gets home and breaks up with the disloyal weasel.
She discovers a bead from the cheap black onyx necklace she bought online for Kate hidden in Rob’s jacket pocket, which causes him to admit everything.

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment WriterRocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancee, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.”Manson was dropped by his record label.
“Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco and Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters have sued him based on their sexual abuse allegations.

     The Weekend Away review – Leighton Meester anchors taut but thin Netflix thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An American wakes up in a cozy hotel in Croatia, violently hungover and dazed from the night before.
An unexpected blackout has rendered Beth’s (Leighton Meester) memory of the previous few hours into a few incoherent shards, ones she fears putting together.
Relatable content for many women at some point in their lives, and thus a compelling starting point for The Weekend Away, a brisk and absorbing if increasingly thin thriller about a girls’ holiday weekend gone wrong.
At 90 minutes, The Weekend Away is not much longer than some streaming TV episodes, and accomplishes much more plot in its swift runtime.
It’s a thriller by name but less edge-of-your-seat than lounging on the couch, absorbing beats of plot like the ocean tide.

     ‘The Weekend Away’ Review: A Croatian Vacay Turns Hazardous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Current B-grade thrillers so frequently have too little plot — often not much more than a starting premise — that it’s almost refreshing to see something like “The Weekend Away,” which has many more narrative complications than it can pull off.
Director Kim Farrant’s last two features (2015’s “Strangerland,” 2019’s “Angel of Mine”) both involved suspicions cast on unstable adults over missing children.
Whereas in “Weekend’s” missing person scenario, our protagonist is pretty much the sole character who doesn’t end up looking guilty of something or other.
Deprived the more complicated psychological dimensions of her prior thrillers to lean on, “Away” requires a more mysterious, threatening mood than she seems interested in summoning.
Rather like the kind of airport-bookstore potboiler it’s duly based on, “The Weekend Away” holds attention sufficient to pass the time.

     Marilyn Manson Files Evan Rachel Wood Defamation Lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the newest development in ongoing sexual abuse and assault allegations, Marilyn Manson is suing former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood for defamation.
"Wood’s claims may resonate because of the intentionally ‘shocking’ character of ‘Marilyn Manson’ but they simply do not reflect the truth.
"I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses," she says in the documentary.
Representatives for Wood and Gore have yet to comment on Manson's lawsuit.

     Marilyn Manson files defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood over rape and abuse allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manson’s suit, which asks for a jury trial, accuses Wood and Gore of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
“That same day, several other women, assisted and coordinated by Wood and/or Gore, sought media attention with remarkably similar public abuse allegations against Warner,” the lawsuit says.
“Those claims, like Wood’s, were false.”Manson has not been charged with any crime connected to Wood’s allegations.
And in June, the model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson alleging sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking.
Manson has repeatedly denied any and all allegations of sexual assault and abuse.

     Marilyn Manson's Ex-Lover Says Evan Rachel Wood's Accusers Group Tried to Recruit Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aurora told Newsweek she met Manson in Vienna, Austria, in January 2011, where Manson was attending an art exhibit.
"I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria," Aurora said.
"She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary "one-sided" and "premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation."
"But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable—and this legal action will hold them to account."

     Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse claims ahead of documentary premiereBy Andy Malt | Published on Thursday 3 March 2022Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood, accusing his former partner of defamation.
The legal action comes ahead of the TV premiere of new documentary ‘Phoenix Rising’ on HBO, in which Wood makes various allegations of sexual abuse against the musician.
As well as this, he accuses Gore of trying to hack into his computer, phone and email, and that she created fake email addresses to make claims against the musician.
But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account”.
In the new lawsuit, Manson alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner”.
