     TSMC checking the effects of Taiwan power outages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".
Evertiq will keep investigating the effects of the power outages.

     Power outage in Taiwan affects main iPhone chipmaker TSMC factory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taiwan was hit by widespread power outages this Thursday.
As reported by Nikkei Asia, Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, and Kaoshiung, the second biggest city in the country, were affected by this power outage.
Taiwan Power Co. said in a brief statement that its southern power grid system encountered a malfunction causing blackouts in southern Taiwan.
Knock-on effects from the outage triggered power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well.
The malfunction took place at Kaohsiung’s Hsinta Power Plant, the biggest power plant in southern Taiwan, according to the company.

     Taiwan president pledges 'infrastructure check-up' after mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen seen delivering a speech during the celebrations of the National Day in front of the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan on October 10, 2021.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday vowed to scrutinize power infrastructure and accelerate ongoing efforts to improve grid reliability after a mass outage that left one-third of the island without electricity.
Tsai said supply was sufficient at the time of the incident and the mass outage was triggered "simply by operational negligence...which highlighted problems in the country's power grid and the resilience of its key infrastructure."
"We must do a complete power infrastructure check-up and accelerate works on systematic improvement," Tsai said, who is set to visit the coal-fired station in the southern city of Kaohsiung at noon.
The outages have also fanned criticism of Tsai's plan to boost the island's renewable energy target to 20% and phase out nuclear power by 2025.

     Taiwan blames negligence for mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, March 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday blamed negligence during annual maintenance at a major power plant for a mass outage across the island that caused the lights to go off for more than 5 million households, though the crucial semiconductor sector was largely unaffected.
The power cut began shortly after 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) after a problem at the Hsinta power plant and while it impacted all parts of Taiwan the most extensive problems were in the south, especially the major port city of Kaohsiung.
Power has now mostly been restored, at least in northern Taiwan, and efforts are continuing in the south to reconnect those still without electricity.
The cut affected about a third of Taiwan's power supply, hitting some 5 million households, Wang said.
TSMC said "power dips" at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.

     Massive power blackout in Taiwan after accident at major plant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taiwan is gradually restoring power supply, the state-run power operator said on Thursday, after much of the island’s south and five million households were hit by an outage caused by a malfunction at a major power generation plant.
Hydro and other power plants were brought on line to provide electricity, said Taipower, which blamed a problem with a transformer at the Hsinta power plant in the southern city of Kaohsiung for a trip at an ultra-high voltage substation.
The major coal-fired station provides about a seventh of Taiwan’s power.
TSMC said “power dips” at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.
After last year’s two major outages brought criticism for the government, President Tsai has vowed to scrutinise electricity management.

     Human error likely cause of nationwide blackout; Taipower executives offer to resignTaipei, March 3 (CNA) Executives at the state-run utility Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) have offered to resign, while the country's economics minister has vowed to take full responsibility after human error was found to be the most likely cause of a power outage that hit over 5 million households in Taiwan on Thursday morning.
An initial investigation by Taipower showed that human error at Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung was the reason for the nationwide blackout, according to Lo.
Wang apologized and said the government plans to compensate household and industrial users affected by the outage.
Affected users would receive a 5 percent discount on their bills, and a 10 percent discount if they were affected by power outage for over six hours, she said.
By 3 p.m., power supplies were restored to 4.42 million, or over 80 percent, of households affected, according to Taipower.
