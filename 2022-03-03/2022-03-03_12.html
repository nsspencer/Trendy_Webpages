    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     © TSMCAccording to a report from Nikkei, over five million households went dark as a result of the power outage, which hit Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Taiwan's southern power grid system experienced a malfunction which then led to the blackouts in southern Taiwan.
This then led to a domino effect triggering power outages in some parts of northern and central Taiwan as well, the report continues.
According to a Reuters report, TSMC stated on Thursday that a number of its plants did experienced "power dips", and that the company was still checking if there was "any actual impact".
Evertiq will keep investigating the effects of the power outages.

     NFL Draft Rumors: Malik Willis Blowing Away Coaches, Execs During Combine Meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michael Hickey/Getty ImagesMany around the NFL believe that the top quarterback prospects in this year's draft are Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Liberty's Malik Willis.
But according to The Athletic's Jeff Howe, Willis might be setting himself apart with how he's impressed league personnel during this week's NFL combine.
"The overwhelming majority of those evaluators also believe Willis has the highest ceiling of the signal-callers, but he’ll need at least a season to develop," Howe wrote.
"Willis has continued to blow away coaches and executives during his meetings, which was also the case at the Senior Bowl."
Some draft prognosticators believe it's possible that a QB isn't chosen at all in the first round.

     It has been said that greatness is truly defined by the things you do when nobody’s looking — or, at least when you think nobody’s looking.
That was the case for quarterback Malik Willis, the Liberty star who’s looking to establish himself as the top quarterback in this draft class.
Was having lunch yesterday and saw one of the Combine guys helping out someone on some hard times…@malikwillis being great even when nobody is watching.
How can you not be a fan of this guy?
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022It looks as if Willis is taking something out of a bag — perhaps a warm hat — to give to someone in need.

     Taiwan president pledges 'infrastructure check-up' after mass power outage

     Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen seen delivering a speech during the celebrations of the National Day in front of the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan on October 10, 2021.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday vowed to scrutinize power infrastructure and accelerate ongoing efforts to improve grid reliability after a mass outage that left one-third of the island without electricity.
Tsai said supply was sufficient at the time of the incident and the mass outage was triggered "simply by operational negligence...which highlighted problems in the country's power grid and the resilience of its key infrastructure."
"We must do a complete power infrastructure check-up and accelerate works on systematic improvement," Tsai said, who is set to visit the coal-fired station in the southern city of Kaohsiung at noon.
The outages have also fanned criticism of Tsai's plan to boost the island's renewable energy target to 20% and phase out nuclear power by 2025.

     Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

     Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     Taiwan blames negligence for mass power outage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAIPEI, March 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday blamed negligence during annual maintenance at a major power plant for a mass outage across the island that caused the lights to go off for more than 5 million households, though the crucial semiconductor sector was largely unaffected.
The power cut began shortly after 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) after a problem at the Hsinta power plant and while it impacted all parts of Taiwan the most extensive problems were in the south, especially the major port city of Kaohsiung.
Power has now mostly been restored, at least in northern Taiwan, and efforts are continuing in the south to reconnect those still without electricity.
The cut affected about a third of Taiwan's power supply, hitting some 5 million households, Wang said.
TSMC said "power dips" at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.

     Who is most likely to select QB Malik Willis in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft? Ranking seven contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     Massive power blackout in Taiwan after accident at major plant

     Taiwan is gradually restoring power supply, the state-run power operator said on Thursday, after much of the island’s south and five million households were hit by an outage caused by a malfunction at a major power generation plant.
Hydro and other power plants were brought on line to provide electricity, said Taipower, which blamed a problem with a transformer at the Hsinta power plant in the southern city of Kaohsiung for a trip at an ultra-high voltage substation.
The major coal-fired station provides about a seventh of Taiwan’s power.
TSMC said “power dips” at some of its wafer fabrication plants ran from about 400 milliseconds to more than a second.
After last year’s two major outages brought criticism for the government, President Tsai has vowed to scrutinise electricity management.

     Human error likely cause of nationwide blackout; Taipower executives offer to resignTaipei, March 3 (CNA) Executives at the state-run utility Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) have offered to resign, while the country's economics minister has vowed to take full responsibility after human error was found to be the most likely cause of a power outage that hit over 5 million households in Taiwan on Thursday morning.
An initial investigation by Taipower showed that human error at Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung was the reason for the nationwide blackout, according to Lo.
Wang apologized and said the government plans to compensate household and industrial users affected by the outage.
Affected users would receive a 5 percent discount on their bills, and a 10 percent discount if they were affected by power outage for over six hours, she said.
By 3 p.m., power supplies were restored to 4.42 million, or over 80 percent, of households affected, according to Taipower.

“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
“This young man has a tremendous skill set,” he added.
But I can tell you I’ve had the opportunity to interview him—he’s a heck of a young man.

     Who is most likely to select QB Malik Willis in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft? Ranking seven contenders
    </h2>

     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.
