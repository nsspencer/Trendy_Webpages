     Malik Willis, one of top QB prospects at NFL Combine, goes viral for helping Indy woman in need
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Malik Willis, the Liberty quarterback considered to be among the best at his position in this year's NFL Draft, went viral in Indianapolis at the NFL Combine.
A video of Willis giving his gear to a woman sitting outside St. Elmo Steakhouse made the rounds on social media Thursday afternoon.
More:Senior Bowl 2022: Seven players for the Colts to watch, from Malik Willis to Sam Howell"(Teams) always are going to let you know how big your position is," he said during Combine availability on Wednesday.

     And during that long period in the locker room, no players stood up and spoke while Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats was in the room.
24 Crimson Tide entered as a favorite in the final home game of the season.
He mentioned past Alabama players such as Herb Jones and how much the Crimson Tide misses their leadership.
Other guys, it seems like maybe sometimes their leadership … when they’re playing well, it’s easier to be a better leader.
Jaden Shackelford, who led Alabama with 16 points, said the Crimson Tide needs to be tougher.

     NFL Draft Rumors: Malik Willis Blowing Away Coaches, Execs During Combine Meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michael Hickey/Getty ImagesMany around the NFL believe that the top quarterback prospects in this year's draft are Pitt's Kenny Pickett and Liberty's Malik Willis.
But according to The Athletic's Jeff Howe, Willis might be setting himself apart with how he's impressed league personnel during this week's NFL combine.
"The overwhelming majority of those evaluators also believe Willis has the highest ceiling of the signal-callers, but he’ll need at least a season to develop," Howe wrote.
"Willis has continued to blow away coaches and executives during his meetings, which was also the case at the Senior Bowl."
Some draft prognosticators believe it's possible that a QB isn't chosen at all in the first round.

     Alabama Basketball: What blowout loss to Aggies means to the Tide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Aggies outplayed the Crimson Tide.
Nate Oats recently said some of his guys were playing “their best” of any point in the season.
After seeing the Aggies destroy the Tide, some Alabama fans wonder who Oats was referring to.
Even when Crimson Tide players were clearly trying hard to guard Jackson, they often could not keep a body on him.
Even a loss on Saturday to LSU, followed by an opening game loss in the SEC Tournament would probably not drop the Tide below a 7-seed.

     NFL QB prospect Malik Willis caught on video in random act of kindness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Liberty University quarterback Malik Willis, who is projected to be one of the first three QBs selected in the 2022 draft, was caught on video performing a random act of kindness.
From the distance of the video, it’s hard to tell exactly what Willis is giving to the man, but it appears to be new clothing wrapped in plastic.
The heartwarming video has made the rounds on social media, with some users predictably skeptical about whether the shot was strategically set up or not, but with most applauding Willis for his kindness.
In the background of the video, you can hear a man’s voice say, “That is Malik.” The man behind the video, Ryan Lacey, also tagged Willis’ former college team in the replies.
So, you’ve got to understand everything that comes with that and making sure you’re doing all the right things and making sure you’re doing your job,” Willis said in his combine media interview, Per ESPN.

     Malik Willis is helping others during the biggest week of his life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It has been said that greatness is truly defined by the things you do when nobody’s looking — or, at least when you think nobody’s looking.
That was the case for quarterback Malik Willis, the Liberty star who’s looking to establish himself as the top quarterback in this draft class.
Was having lunch yesterday and saw one of the Combine guys helping out someone on some hard times…@malikwillis being great even when nobody is watching.
How can you not be a fan of this guy?
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022It looks as if Willis is taking something out of a bag — perhaps a warm hat — to give to someone in need.

     Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Newton is the only quarterback Ron Rivera has drafted in the first round.
As the Commanders ponder using the 11th overall pick in this year's draft on a signal-caller, Rivera has noticed a few similarities between Newton and one of the top quarterback prospects: Liberty's Malik Willis.
Newton went on to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, MVP and helped lead Carolina to a Super Bowl.
That isn't the easiest reputation to live up to if you're Willis, but Rivera appears to like the young quarterback's combination of physical tools and football IQ.
Plenty of mock drafts have had Willis going to the Commanders at No.

     Liberty QB Malik Willis spotted helping homeless on streets of Indy [VIDEO]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest bit of viral news coming out of the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine circles back to the quarterback position.
A video posted by Twitter user Ryan Lacey showed footage of Liberty QB Malik Willis handing out supplies to the homeless in the streets of Indianapolis, where the Combine is currently being held.
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022Willis has been gaining traction as a likely first-round selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
He totaled just 2,857 passing yards, 27 TDs and 12 INTs in 2021, with at least 875 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in each of his last two seasons.
To complement the hype, Willis had an engaging interview session at the NFL Combine that highlighted a bit of low-key humor and ability to have fun with the media.

     Who is most likely to select QB Malik Willis in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft? Ranking seven contenders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First-round picks: No.
2 and 32 overallI've always believed that teams with multiple first-round picks are more able -- and likely -- to take a big swing with one of them.
It's hard to imagine that the Lions are locked in on Jared Goff at quarterback, and they'll have the ability to get away from his contract after the 2022 season.
Taking Willis 32nd overall, with one of the selections acquired from the Rams in last year's Goff-Matthew Stafford swap, could be a wise investment with one of their two first-round picks -- but if they really want him, they may need to maneuver up the board rather than sit back and wait for Willis to fall to them.

     This draft expert thinks the Commanders and Malik Willis are an ideal match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And during an interview with the Washington Football Talk podcast at the NFL Combine, one draft expert recommended that the Commanders go with Willis over Pickett if they end up facing that decision next month.
Reid isn't claiming that Heinicke is anything truly special, something he made sure to elaborate on at another point of the interview.
If you're a Commanders fan who, after reading the above five paragraphs, is wondering when the compliments for Willis will begin, that's understandable.
As for Pickett, Reid views him as a quarterback who could potentially start for a squad to open up his career.
"Kenny Pickett, he's going to be a better player right away.

     Malik Willis did a random act of kindness before the NFL Draft Combine

     However, everything is pointing to Malik Willis being a good dude.
The Liberty QB didn’t open up his wallet, but instead cracked open his suitcase to hand over clothes to help the needy individual.
Was having lunch yesterday and saw one of the Combine guys helping out someone on some hard times…@malikwillis being great even when nobody is watching.
pic.twitter.com/BmFzUM66NU — Ryan Lacey (@rlacey23) March 3, 2022It would have been easy to just walk by, hell, hundreds of people probably did that day — but Willis didn’t.
This wasn’t an effort to earn brownie points, or have people notice him being a good guy, it just came naturally.

     Commanders HC Ron Rivera compares Malik Willis to Cam Newton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Considering his unparalleled mix of talent, skill and physical profile—Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton really shouldn’t draw many, if any, comparisons.
That man, of course, is Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera—who spoke with CBS Sports at the NFL Scouting Combine on Wednesday.
“And I was fortunate enough to have drafted one of them in Cam Newton, who’s a very special player.”The traits Rivera is referring to, obviously, are Willis’ dual-threat abilities as a passer and rusher.
“This young man has a tremendous skill set,” he added.
But I can tell you I’ve had the opportunity to interview him—he’s a heck of a young man.

     The Crimson Tide has won five of its last six games and looks to begin March on a strong note heading into the postseason.
At the final media timeout with 3:21 to go, Aggies lead Alabama 77-66 and will be heading to the line out of the break.
It's going to take a huge effort over these final few minutes for the Crimson Tide to come back and win.
Alabama leads A&amp;M 32-30 at the final media timeout.
The intensity ramped up on defense and shots started falling again as the Crimson Tide held on to beat South Carolina 90-71.
