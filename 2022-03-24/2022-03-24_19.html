     Devin Booker Had A Furious Response To A Heckling Fan: “Shut Up P*ssy.”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SportsDevin Booker and the Phoenix Suns continue to be the best team in the NBA, as they had another emphatic win last night.
And during the game, Devin Booker took a quick break from his offensive onslaught to shut down a heckling fan in the crowd.
During the game, Devin Booker was bringing the ball down the court for the Suns.
In a split second, Booker turned to the fan and told him to shut up, while also using some unsavory language toward him.
Devin Booker also made history, becoming the 4th youngest NBA player to reach 11,000 points, behind Kevin Durant, Lebron James, and Kobe Bryant.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first and likely only team to get 60 wins this season, the Suns have been absolutely dominant all year.
The biggest reason why, is the play of Devin Booker, who went off for 49 points and 10 assists in the win over Denver.
After the game, Ja Morant shared his thoughts:The Memphis Grizzlies star believes Devin Booker deserves more respect for what he's done this season.
Often times overlooked by the media's obsession with Chris Paul, Booker has been the clear best player on the Phoenix Suns this season.
The team is poised for a deep run, and according to Ja Morant, Booker needs more respect for that.

Devin Booker told a Minnesota heckler to “shut up, p—y” Screengrab / @skolbrosBooker is at least the third NBA player in recent weeks to go after a heckler.
Last week, also in Minneapolis, Russell Westbrook approached a fan who appeared to call him “Westbrick.”When Westbrook heard the fan taunting him during pre-game warm-ups, he quickly turned around, walked over to the fan, and asked, “What did you call me?”The heckler recanted saying, “Westbrook, Russell Westbrook.
It was later reported that the heckler had told Nurkic that his mother is trash and grandmother is a b—h.

     Summary: As special as Phoenix guard Devin Booker was, the Nuggets only had themselves to blame.
Costly turnovers and mental lapses dogged the Nuggets in the fourth quarter of Thursday’s thriller against Phoenix, and the Suns escaped with an impressive 140-130 win.
“Against the best team in the NBA, you can’t beat yourself and them in the same night,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
The Nuggets, 43-31, hung with the Suns’ blistering offense until three devastating turnovers in under a minute stunted their fourth-quarter momentum.
For the game, the Nuggets turned it over 17 times which led to 30 Phoenix points.

Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker had one of the more savage moments of the season during Wednesday’s game against the Timberwolves in Minnesota.
As he brought the ball up the floor, Booker turned to a fan sitting courtside and casually said, “Shut up p—y” before running the play for the Suns.
You can’t really tell from the video what the fan said to elicit such a response from Booker.
