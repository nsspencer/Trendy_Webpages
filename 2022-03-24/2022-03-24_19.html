     Summary: BOSTON -- Hampus Lindholm stepped right into the Bruins lineup Thursday night and looked very much at home during his debut against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
That's why you play the game," Lindholm said after the victory.
-- Hampus Lindholm on his #NHLBruins debut pic.twitter.com/VEnQlO5uw2 — Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) March 25, 2022The Bruins' defensive system is a little different than what Lindholm was used to with the Anaheim Ducks, but he actually thinks Boston's style is a better fit for him.
The way we play is better for me in a way, of course there will be some adjusting.
It's going to take some time for Lindholm to feel totally comfortable in the Bruins' system and develop strong chemistry with McAvoy.

     Talking Points: Pastrnak’s Hat Trick Paces Boston Bruins To Big ‘W’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are the Talking Points from the Boston Bruins 3-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning at TD Garden on Thursday night that saw the B’s leap frog the Bolts in the Atlantic Division standings.
It took perfect plays for the Boston Bruins to get pucks past Andrei Vasilevskiy on a night when he was really good, and that’s exactly what they executed on each of the three Boston Bruins goals in a playoff-like win.
It’s tough not to give it to Hampus Lindholm on a night when he was really good in his Boston Bruins debut, but Pastrnak finished with all three Boston Bruins goals to pace them to a massive Atlantic Division victory over the Lightning.
BY THE NUMBERS: 12 – the number of career hat tricks for David Pastrnak, which pulls him into a tie with the legendary Johnny Bucyk on the Boston Bruins all-time list behind just Cam Neely and Phil Esposito.
