     Ginni Thomas Pressed Trump’s Chief of Staff to Overturn 2020 Vote, Texts Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The text traffic also suggests that Ms. Thomas was in contact with Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser.
Sidney Powell, the lawyer advising Trump’s campaign team known for unleashing wild theories about voting fraud, comes up repeatedly.
On Nov. 13, for instance, Mr. Trump included Ms. Powell in a tweeted list of his team’s lawyers.
While Ms. Thomas already had access to the president, White House aides said her influence increased after Mr. Trump named Mr. Meadows chief of staff in March 2020.
Mr. Meadows is no longer cooperating with the committee; a lawyer for Mr. Meadows, George J. Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

     Summary: Among Thomas' stated goals in the messages was for lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted incendiary and unsupported claims about the election, to become "the lead and the face" of Trump's legal team.
The messages were among the 2,320 text messages that Meadows provided the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The existence of messages between Thomas and Meadows — 21 sent by her; eight by him — have not previously been reported and were reviewed by CBS News and The Post.
They were then confirmed by five people who have seen the committee's documents.

     Washington Post And CBS News Reveal Texts Ginni Thomas Sent To Mark Meadows About Overturning 2020 Election: “Greatest Heist Of Our History”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Post‘s Bob Woodward and CBS News’ Robert Costa landed one of the week’s bigger D.C. scoops with a report that Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, texted then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows urging him to contest the 2020 presidential election results.
!…You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice.
In the days that followed, Thomas advanced a number of conspiracy theories about the election while pushing for attorney Sidney Powell to take the lead in the Trump campaign’s challenge of the election results.
Clarence Thomas did not recuse when the Supreme Court weighed in on the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s election challenge.
At the time, the network said that he would continue to do joint special projects with the Post.

     Summary: The text messages, reviewed by CNN, show Thomas pleading with Meadows to continue the fight to overturn the election results.
CNN first reported that the text messages were in the committee's possession.
On November 24, 2020, Meadows promised he wasn't done battling on then-President Donald Trump's behalf and evoked his faith as a source of strength.
