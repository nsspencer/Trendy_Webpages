     Summary: Diogo Jota finishes off Otavio's cross with a lovely header to go up 2-0 vs. Turkey.
"I wasn't upset with the team but we played with fire today," Santos told reporters.
Obviously the players are not machines, we didn't manage to score for 3-0 and those things can happen in football.
"We need to show the same respect to North Macedonia that we would to Italy," Santos said.
"We can't think it will be easy against North Macedonia," Nunes said.

     Cristiano Ronaldo Odds-On For One Last World Cup After Portugal Survive Turkey Scare
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo Odds-On For One Last World Cup After Portugal Survive Turkey ScareObituaries for Cristiano Ronaldo's glittering international career were being drafted earlier this week.
The thought was that if Portugal failed to qualify for this year's World Cup then soccer's all-time leading scorer might just call it a day.
All of a sudden, Portugal were clear odds-on favorites to qualify for the World Cup draw on April 1 and the Ronaldo tributes were shelved for now.
Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates with Joao Felix and Bernardo Silva after Portugal beat Turkey 3-1 in a World Cup qualifying play-off semi-final IMAGO/NurPhoto/Pedro FiuzaOf course, Portugal are not there yet.
If Portugal beat North Macedonia, Ronaldo will be all set for his fifth World Cup.
