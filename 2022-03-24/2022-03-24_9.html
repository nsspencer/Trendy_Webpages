     With Sweet 16 berth, UA senior class relishes finally having a winning men's team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In February 2018, a now-debunked report came out of ESPN that alleged previous Arizona men's basketball head coach Sean Miller was heard on wiretap offering $100,000 for Arizona’s star at the time, Deandre Ayton.
If you are a senior now, you’ve experienced the worst media coverage and fallout of Arizona basketball in its history, and that is finally changing.
On Sunday, the men’s team beat TCU in overtime to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017.
This year’s men’s team is what Arizona has been in the past, but it’s also what the UA's current seniors are finally seeing for the first time.
Arizona men’s basketball is finally back on the national stage and is joined by the women’s basketball team’s ascension over the past three seasons, making Arizona a premier basketball school.

     3 keys for Arizona Wildcats in Sweet 16 matchup with Houston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The top-seeded Arizona Wildcats were not given a fortuitous draw in their quest for the program’s first Final Four appearance since 2001.
5 seed Houston is one of America’s best teams, ranking second overall on KenPom.com coming into Thursday night’s Sweet 16 showdown with Arizona.
It’s a matchup that follows a pair of underwhelming performances for Arizona in the NCAA Tournament’s first two rounds.
It offensive rebounds a whopping 37.8%, an even better mark than TCU mustered before facing Arizona, and good for 13.3 offensive rebounds per game.
It would be shocking to see Houston become fazed by the moment like the Wildcats have been so far.
