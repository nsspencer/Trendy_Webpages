     'RRR' movie review: A big-screen spectacle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RRRTelugu (Theatres)Director: S S RajamouliCast: NTR Jr, Ram Charan, Alia Bhatt, Ajay DevgnRating: 3.5/5If there is a director who keeps the old-school masala film template alive, it is S S Rajamouli.
The movie is filled with whistle-worthy elevation scenes, jaw-dropping set pieces and emotional moments that hit the roof.
Like in all Rajamouli films, bigness has no limit in RRR.
Ram Charan and NTR Jr are a fire and ice combo in their performances, though the latter wins it by a decent margin.
Rajamouli promised to bring the roar back with RRR and he has done it in a way only he can.

     Does RRR Have Reason To Be Scared Of Kashmir Files?-Entertainment News , Firstpost
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Bachchhan Paandey which was totally trounced by The Kashmir Files typhoon, it is now time for S S Rajamouli’s RRR to run scared.
Let alone rival the success of Baahubali Rajamouli’s RRR seems have generated shockingly low advance-booking interest in North India.
The main factor for this lackluster welcome to RRR is of course The Kashmir Files which continues to mow down all competition.
Producer Sajid Nadiadwala paid no heed to warnings about the growing force of Typhoon Kashmir.
Ditto Rajamouli who knows in his heart of hearts that every Telugu film can’t be Baahubali.
