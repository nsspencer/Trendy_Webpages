It doesn’t deviate for the sake of heroism until the last half an hour in the second half.
Compare this to Bheem, Jr NTR’s intro is more cinematic and hence seems better.
If the first half is reserved for Jr NTR, the second half of the second half is reserved for Charan.
Overall, RRR has a fabulous first half and a slightly underwhelming, but thoroughly engaging second half.

     Covid-hit exhibition industry hopes RRR will be a roaring hit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 300 crore budget thanks to distribution, satellite and digital sales touching Rs.
600 crore, it will be a challenge for distributors and exhibitors to make the same back from ticket sales.
100 crore gross is on the cards on day one in Telugu-speaking states but in north India, sleeper hit The Kashmir Files will provide stiff competition.
“Though originally shot in Telugu, RRR is being seen as a pan-Indian film and its language of production is of no consequence.
Given that RRR is a standalone release for the week, we believe that it will shore up significant box office collections.
