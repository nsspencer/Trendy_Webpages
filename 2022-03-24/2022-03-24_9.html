     Supreme Court weighs in on ‘cancel culture’ with community college case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In fact, no one before us has cited any evidence suggesting that a purely verbal censure analogous to Mr. Wilson’s has ever been widely considered offensive to the First Amendment,” Gorsuch wrote.
Hearkening back to opinions from late Justice Antonin Scalia exhorting Americans to show “civic courage” in public debates, Gorsuch said Wilson assumed the risk of public criticism when he ran for the college’s board.
“The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy.
“Government officials who reprimand or censure students, employees, or licensees may in some circumstances materially impair First Amendment freedoms,” Gorsuch wrote.
“When the government interacts with private individuals as sovereign, employer, educator, or licensor, its threat of a censure could raise First Amendment questions.

     Summary: Supreme Court upholds right to censure in case of obstreperous school board memberEnlarge this image Paolo Koch /Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Paolo Koch /Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesWith schools boards all over the country finding themselves embroiled in controversy, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the right of a community college board to censure one of its own members.
He even hired a private investigator to see if a fellow board member really lived in the district she represented.
A federal district court dismissed the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reinstated the suit.
On Thursday the Supreme Court unanimously reversed that judgment.
Members of Congress have long been censured by their fellow members for matters ranging from unethical conduct to "insulting...the Speaker."

     Summary: HOUSTON – The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously ruled against David Wilson, a member of Houston Community College’s board.
Wilson had sued the board in for a First Amendment violation after the board publicly censured him.
The Supreme Court rejected Wilson’s claim that the censure was unconstitutional retaliation for his speech.
The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy.
As it comes to us, too, the censure did not prevent Mr. Wilson from doing his job, it did not deny him any privilege of office, and Mr. Wilson does not allege it was defamatory.

     College board’s censure of one of its members didn’t violate First Amendment, justices rule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OPINION ANALYSISCollege board’s censure of one of its members didn’t violate First Amendment, justices ruleBy Amy Howeat 3:12 pmThe Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that a community college board did not violate the First Amendment when it censured one of its trustees.
The unanimous ruling was the latest episode in a long-running drama that pitted the Houston Community College System against David Wilson, a trustee and outspoken critic of the board.
Wilson was elected to the board in 2013 and almost immediately began to speak out against what he describes as the board’s “pay to play” culture.
Wilson appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which agreed with him that the First Amendment limited the board’s ability to censure him.
But in Wilson’s case, Gorsuch concluded, there is no “viable First Amendment claim on these facts.”This article was originally published at Howe on the Court.

     The Court Upholds a College Board’s Censure of One of Its Members, and Delays an Execution on Religious Grounds: SCOTUS Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Gorsuch, the Court concluded that David Wilson lacked standing to do so.
Wilson’s position contradicted the long-standing constitutional history of elected bodies, including the Congress, exercising the power to censure their members.
Ramirez v. Collier resolved the issue of whether a brutal convicted murderer was entitled to have his long-time pastor “lay hands” on him and audibly “pray over” him during his execution.
Justice Thomas, who argued that Ramirez was engaging in a continuous pattern of misconduct merely to forestall his execution, dissented.
This likely shows that, irrespective of their potential support for capital punishment in other circumstances, their views as to religious freedom predominated here.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Wilson charged the Board in various media outlets with violating its bylaws and ethical rules,” the opinion explains.
So, Gorsuch says, the Supreme Court could only consider whether a censure rises to the level of a First Amendment violation.
“The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy.
Again the opinion at length:The censure at issue before us was a form of speech by elected representatives.
As it comes to us, too, the censure did not prevent Mr. Wilson from doing his job, it did not deny him any privilege of office, and Mr. Wilson does not allege it was defamatory.

     A School Board Has the Right to Censure a Rogue Member, U.S. Supreme Court Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The lawyer for Houston community college system replied that the public board might have such authority.)
And after the community college board voted to open a campus in Qatar, over Wilson’s opposition, he orchestrated robocalls to the constituents of other board members and hired private investigators to check a fellow board member’s residency, court papers say.
The Houston community college board was supported in its appeal by the National School Boards Association and its state affiliate, the Texas Association of School Boards.
President Joe Biden’s administration had also filed a brief and argued in support of the college board.
Volokh said censures of outside parties, such as a private citizen speaking at a school board meeting, would likely pass muster under the First Amendment.
