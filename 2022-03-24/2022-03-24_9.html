     Violence to spur more migration from Mexico, Central America -Red Cross
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Lizbeth DiazMEXICO CITY (Reuters) – Waves of migration through Mexico and Central America, and people who go missing will increase in 2022 due to high levels of violence in the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.
“In many countries, violence is wreaking more and more havoc, and that’s why there are more and more migrants,” ICRC representative Jordi Raich told Reuters in an interview Wednesday.
Shelters in Mexico were completely overwhelmed last year, filled with frustrated migrants unable to continue their journey to the United States, Raich said.
Disappearances in the region have not slowed either, the Red Cross said in a report released Thursday.
In El Salvador, 488 missing person cases remain unsolved, and in Guatemala, the number of missing women rose to six a day, the Red Cross report said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US men’s national team are still winless in World Cup qualifiers at Estadio Azteca but picked up a valuable point Thursday night in a 0-0 draw with Mexico.
The pivotal moment of the scoreless first half came in the 35th minute when Timothy Weah picked out a wide-open Christian Pulisic in front of goal.
But the Chelsea attacker had his attempt from just outside the six-yard box saved by Memo Ochoa.
Pulisic put another attempt on frame four minutes into the second half after being played through by Kellyn Acosta, but Ochoa parried that away.
Reyna played a first-time pass across goal to Jordan Pefok, yet the striker's attempt was scuffed.

     Summary: Waves of migration through Mexico and Central America, and people who go missing, will increase in 2022 due to high levels of violence in the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.
Shelters in Mexico were completely overwhelmed last year, filled with frustrated migrants unable to continue their journey to the United States, Raich said.
The administration of Joe Biden has faced record numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border and has implored Mexico and Central American countries to do more to stem the wave.
Raich said it will be difficult to respond to the root causes of migration immediately.
The asylum overhaul could provide a faster way to process border crossers if the Covid order is ended.

     Summary: The result ended the U.S.’s three-game winning streak against Mexico, but serves both teams well after Panama’s draw vs. Honduras earlier in the night.
It also marks the third straight World Cup qualifier at the Azteca in which the U.S. has taken a point off Mexico.
His free kick—taken from a similar spot as his free kick that led to the Gold Cup-winning goal—sailed harmlessly through the Mexico box, though, letting El Tri off easy.
Yedlin countered with a hard tackle of his own a few minutes later, and it came at a big price.
Minutes later, Pulisic came off for Jordan Morris, with Berhalter staying true to his pregame word that he would use all five substitutes.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEXICO CITY (AP) — Christian Pulisic pounded the ground three times just past Mexico’s goal line after his point-blank shot was blocked in the 35th minute.
The point earned put the Americans into position to all but clinch a World Cup berth with a victory against Panama on Sunday night at Orlando, Florida.
“We put ourselves in a position to play on Sunday and win and go to the World Cup,” Pulisic said.
Berhalter thought of Diego Maradona’s second goal against England in a 1986 World Cup quarterfinal played on the same field.
Palmer-Brown became the 114th U.S. player of the World Cup cycle, the 88th since Berhalter became coach in December 2018.
