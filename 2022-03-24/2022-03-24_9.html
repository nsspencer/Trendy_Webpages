     Report: Several teams showing interest in trade for DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They drafted Jaylen Waddle in the first round last spring; they signed Cedrick Wilson in free agency; and they traded for Tyreek Hill.
Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports several teams, including the Eagles, have shown interest in a trade for DeVante Parker.
Jackson adds that it’s unclear what the Dolphins will do with Parker.
If he stays, Parker will be the third receiver along with Waddle and Hill, but Wilson also is a capable third receiver.
Parker has spent all seven seasons in Miami, and he made 40 receptions for 515 yards and two touchdowns in 10 games in 2021.

     Report: DeVante Parker drawing trade interest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins just upgraded their wide receiver room in a big way with the acquisition of Tyreek Hill from the Kansas City Chiefs.
Add Hill to their first round draft pick Jaylen Waddle and there isn’t much room for DeVante Parker and his contract worth $6.4 million for this season.
There is interest in Parker though, as the Philadelphia Eagles and others have shown interest, per Miami Herlad’s Barry Jackson.
It seems like the Dolphins will be able to trade Parker instead of just releasing him, but they likely won’’t get much in return.
But, if he can stay healthy, a team could land a viable starting receiver for the next few years.

     Could the wide receiver carousel end with the Eagles getting DeVante Parker?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, the wide receivers could be classified in the same manner.
The latest example happened Wednesday after the Kansas City Chiefs sent wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for a package of draft picks, including a first-round selection.
The Dolphins have an excess of wide receivers.
That leaves the most likely scenario being wide receiver DeVante Parker heading to the trade block.
In 10 games last season, Parker caught 40 passes for 515 yards and two touchdowns.

     Summary: Jan 9, 2022; Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker (11) watches from the field during the second quarter of the game against the New England Patriots at Hard Rock Stadium.
by Jaleel GrandberryThe Indianapolis Colts could have a new receiver target in DeVante Parker after the recent blockbuster moves around the NFL.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Miami Dolphins traded for six-time Pro Bowler Tyreek Hill, sending a haul of picks to the Kansas City Chiefs.
There’s a possibility that Devante Parker gets shaken loose by this Hill trade.
Indy can’t afford to sit back and watch another receiver traded without trying to land them.

     Could Packers Replace Davante with DeVante?

     Summary: The 14th overall pick in 2015, Parker has career totals of 338 receptions for 4,727 yards (14.0 average) and 24 touchdowns.
Limited to 10 games in 2021 due to a hamstring injury, Parker caught 40 balls for 515 yards and two scores.
Parker caught 5-of-9 deep targets (55.6 percent) last season.
During his career season of 2019, Parker caught 14-of-29 deep balls (48.3 percent) with five touchdowns.
Contractually, Parker signed a front-loaded extension late in the 2019 season, which would help the Packers handle his contract.

     Tennessee Titans should trade for Miami Dolphins receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are strong rumors that the Miami Dolphins are going to trade DeVante Parker after the Tyreek Hill acquisition, and the Tennessee Titans need to be in on these trade talks.
Compare the Parker situation to the Robert Woods situation.
By the time the Tennessee Titans officially traded for Woods, he only counted $10 million against the cap compared to the $16 million that people originally assumed.
Why would a trade make sense for Parker and the Tennessee Titans?
In their first two seasons together, Parker had 9.9 yards per target in 2015 and 8.6 yards per target in 2016.

     Let’s Turn That Facemask Green: DeVante Parker Edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aside from the obvious comparisons that will be drawn between what the Kansas City Chiefs received for Hill and what the Green Bay Packers received for Adams (for which different trade charts will tell you different things), why does this matter for Green Bay?
These three additions leave a productive receiver as surplus to requirements though, and that receiver is DeVante Parker.
Before I dive into Parker the player, it’s necessary to dive into DeVante Parker’s contract because of Green Bay’s cap situation.
Because quarterback play matters for receiver production, especially a receiver like DeVante Parker.
If we go back to 2019, we will find a much more productive DeVante Parker.
