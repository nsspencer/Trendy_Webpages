     Shams drops optimism on Ben Simmons’ Nets’ debut amid Kyrie Irving saga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Irving is now allowed to play in home games at Barclays Center despite not being vaccinated for COVID and its variants.
Then the team got some more positive news from Shams Charania of The Athletic regarding another Australian-born player on the team.
Per his appearance on the Pat McAfee show, here’s what Shams Charania had to say on the Ben front:“His goal is to play.
[Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant] those two guys are so lethal offensively it’s like Ben Simmons is the missing piece on this team, really… Ben Simmons is literally exactly what the Nets need.
I think they’re gonna be cautious with it, but there’s an expectation on the Nets that Ben Simmons will play this year.

     Summary: Adams said the decision was not driven by external pressure but because of the desire to improve New York’s economy.
Adams again encouraged Irving and all other New York athletes to get vaccinated and boosted, saying his feelings had not changed on that subject despite the exemption.
NYC Mayor Eric Adams has officially expanded the city's vaccine mandate exemption for athletes and performers:"We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams?
Earlier this month, he lifted a vaccine mandate for citizens attending entertainment venues, eating indoors at restaurants and using fitness centers.
In New York City, 86 percent of the citywide population has received at least one vaccine dose and 78 percent is fully vaccinated.

     Summary: The announcement Brooklyn Nets fans — as well as New York Mets and Yankee fans — have been waiting for became a reality Thursday morning.
The Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, officially lifted the private sector vaccination mandate for professional athletes and performers in local venues.
This is about putting New York City base performers on a level playing field,” said Adams at the press conference held at Citi Field Thursday morning.
We’re expanding it to residents of New York City.
On Tuesday, the mayor suggested that the Nets, Mets and Yankees and their fans would “have to wait” till the science supported any change.

     Summary: National Basketball Association Kyrie Irving cleared to play home games after vaccine mandate is lifted 11 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThe wait to see Kyrie Irving play at Barclays Center is coming to an end.
After being barred from playing in home games this season due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19, the New York City private-sector mandate is being lifted, clearing the way for Irving to play in games in Brooklyn.
Due to the vaccine mandate, the seven-time NBA All-Star guard has only appeared in 19 games this year, all of them coming on the road.
"It certainly changes my opinion of the Nets, because without Kyrie playing home games, they had absolutely no chance of getting out of the East.
Irving is not the only athlete who would benefit from the private sector vaccine mandate being lifted.

     Summary: Kyrie Irving never changed his mind.
The question now: How large a role can Kyrie play in getting the Nets out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves?
He’s shooting just under 53 percent on 2-pointers, on one of the toughest diets of interior shots you’ll ever see from a guard.
The most frequently used five-man lineup on the Nets that features Irving also featured the now-departed Harden; no.
After months of drama, it’s still all about Kyrie Irving.
