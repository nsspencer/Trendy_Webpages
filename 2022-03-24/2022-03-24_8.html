It doesn’t deviate for the sake of heroism until the last half an hour in the second half.
Compare this to Bheem, Jr NTR’s intro is more cinematic and hence seems better.
If the first half is reserved for Jr NTR, the second half of the second half is reserved for Charan.
Overall, RRR has a fabulous first half and a slightly underwhelming, but thoroughly engaging second half.

     RRR Movie Review: SS Rajamouli creates a Revolution with Roaring Action &amp; Riveting Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first frame of the film establishes the plot, which is followed by lavish introductions of the two protagonists – Ram Charan and Jr. NTR.
The relatively weak conflict starts to reflect in the second half, and even the sequences tend to get repetitive.
As the first half rests on plenty of moments to cheer that even evoke goosebumps, they slow down a little in the second half.
Be assured, despite some flaws in the second half, you will be invested in this big canvas world of Rajamouli in the times when India was a “Sone Ki Chidiya”.

     The Lion's Roar: Ram Charan and NTR Jr talk about RRR
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rise, Roar, Revolt... RRR by SS Rajamouli is one of the most awaited pan-India epic.
The film picks two historical figures, Komaram Bheem played by Jr NTR and Alluri Sitarama Raju played by Ram Charan from the Indian Independence movement and tells a fictional story about the revolutionaries.
Known as the megastar and power star across India, Jr NTR and Ram Charan carry an air of calm and humility with them despite their crazy fan following and the impeccable body of work.
When you walk into the set of a Rajamouli film, do you have some sense of inhibition or is it game face from shot one?
He makes sure you're at your peak in all aspects.
