     Chiefs Signing WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling To Three-Year, $30M Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Tom Pelissero, the Chiefs have agreed to terms on a deal for WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling for three years and $30 million.
Last week, the Packers were reportedly “very interested” in re-signing Valdes-Scantling and have asked him to wait on a decision.
The Chiefs, Patriots, Lions, Raiders, Bears, 49ers, Colts, and Texans had all been linked to Valdes-Scantling since the start of free agency.
He signed a four-year, $2,677,553 rookie deal with the Packers that included a $217,553 signing bonus.
In 2021, Valdes-Scantling appeared in 11 games for the Packers and caught 26 passes for 430 yards receiving and three touchdowns.

     Kansas City Chiefs add a WR, reach three-year deal with Marquez Valdes-Scantling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robert Griffin III explains why he still wants the Chiefs to draft a receiver after signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling and specifically mentions North Dakota State's Christian Watson.
(0:57)Wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling is signing a three-year, $30 million deal worth up to $36 million with the Kansas City Chiefs, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The agreement comes a day after the Chiefs traded star wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins.
For the Packers, it's another wide receiver the team will have to replace after trading star wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders last week.
After playing in every game over his first three seasons, Valdes-Scantling missed six games last season -- five because of a hamstring injury and one because of COVID-19.

     Chiefs To Sign WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barely a day after they traded Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins, the Chiefs will sign one of the top wide receivers remaining on the market.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling is committing to Kansas City on a three-year deal, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Chiefs will save quite a bit of money with this receiver commitment, compared to what they would have paid Hill.
The difference in the Chiefs and Dolphins’ offers was notable, Drew Rosenhaus said (via the Miami Herald’s Barry Jackson, on Twitter).
Valdes-Scantling visited Kansas City on Wednesday, shortly after the news broke Hill was being granted permission to seek a trade.

     Summary: On the same day when Tyreek Hill was introduced as a Miami Dolphin, the Kansas City Chiefs are bringing in a reinforcement to help replace him.
The Chiefs are signing former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling to a three-year, $30 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday.
MVS will receive $18 million in the first two years of the contract, and the deal has incentives to reach a max of $36 million.
Valdes-Scantling doesn't have the accolades and statistics that Hill does, but he does have the wheels.
Hill, 28, departs Kansas City having earned six Pro Bowl selections, a Super Bowl title and four 1,000-yard seasons.
