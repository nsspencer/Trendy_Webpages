     RRR release live updates: Jr NTR thanks fans for 'unwavering love'; Ram Charan's fans dress up like his character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SS Rajamouli's follow-up to his Baahubali duology, RRR is out on Friday.
The film stars Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn.
RRR is a fictional story inspired by Telugu freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem.
The film has explored a blind spot in history for a cinematic spectacle, as there seem to be no records about what happened in the lives of these freedom fighters when they were away from their homes.

     'RRR' movie review: Jr NTR delivers career-best performance in S S Rajamouli's masterpiece
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cast: Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia BhattDirector: S S RajamouliRating: 4/5Ace filmmaker S S Rajamouli redefined the tenets of Indian cinema with the 2017 release Baahubali 2, which created history at the box office while offering fans a bonafide big screen experience.
With his latest movie, RRR, the ace storyteller has once again delivered a masterpiece that caters to the mass audience.
Also read | 'RRR' movie review: A big-screen spectacleCertain portions of the first half feel a bit slow but this has no impact on the overall experience as there are plenty of elevation sequences, which cater to the fans.
Even the recently-released Radhe Shyam featured an intense intermission block, that set the stage for the clash between love and destiny, despite the fact that it was not really a mass movie.
RRR raises the bar even further on this front as the pre-interval showdown between Jr NTR and Charan is as 'seetimar' as it gets.

     RRR movie review: SS Rajamouli delivers an epic mythological action superhero bromance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RRR is a roaring, rearing, rousing mix of genres — epic-mythological-action-superhero-bromance, that very SS Rajamouli concoction, which we are invited to swallow in one humungous gulp.
The three hours plus film, a patriotic saga set in British India in the 1920s, proves several things in one go.
That, if you want to be really safe, you cast not just one super-star, but two of them.
And the love of Ram’s life is called, what else, Sita (Alia Bhatt).
Alia Bhatt has just a bit more screen space, but manages to look her part.

     RRR review: SS Rajamouli film is a visual treat that takes several creative liberties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RRR review: SS Rajamouli film is a visual treat that takes several creative libertiesThere are two ways to approach RRR, unquestioningly buy into the spectacle that it offers, and two, to read it with the real-life characters who inspired it and examine if the film pays homage to them or destroys their legacy.
The second was an Adivasi man from the Gond tribe who was born around 1900 and fought against the exploitation by the Nizams of Hyderabad and British rule.
Bheem of RRR worships the Shiva lingam and Rama, speaks only Telugu and Hindi, and has no understanding of activism.
Further, Alluri Sitarama Raju was not an Adivasi man but he was deeply engaged with Adivasi rights, particularly around land and agriculture.
RRR is just the kind of visual treat that will bring people back to theatres.
