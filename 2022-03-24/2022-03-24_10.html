     March Madness news: Arkansas HC Eric Musselman fires back at haters after Sweet 16 upset of Gonzaga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Arkansas Razorbacks went ahead and knocked off the tournament favorite Gonzaga in a tense 74 – 68 match.
In a post-game interview, Musselman clapped back at the people that doubted his team, saying thank you to them.
It was a defensive masterclass from Musselman’s team, who continues to surprise their opponents in their March Madness run.
On Arkansas side, it was once again JD Notae who led the Razorbacks, as he’s done all March Madness long.
However, unlike Timme, Notae got help from his big men duo of Trey Wade and Jaylin Williams with 15 points apiece.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – Eric Musselman’s message to his team before they boarded the plane to the Bay Area left no room for misinterpretation.
Naturally, Gonzaga’s defense bit hard on movement by 3 Arkansas guards moving toward Williams.
You could almost see the surprise Williams had when Au’Diese Toney broke free, streaking down the court like Treylon Burks.
But, as has been the story in recent Arkansas games, it was the defense that ruled the day.
… We set the standard for ourselves to keep going up, so that’s what we’re going to do.”Next up?

     Summary: Fast forward seven years, and Musselman arrived here with his Arkansas Razorbacks for a date with March Madness destiny.
Not only did a lot of old Bay Area friends see the biggest win of Musselman’s career, so did his mother, Kris.
“Au’Diese just owned Nembhard,” Arkansas guard JD Notae said.
For Gonzaga, the belief that last year’s journey to the championship game could be replicated—and ultimately exceeded—died hard Thursday night.
In the first half, Gonzaga kept flirting with landing a heavy blow and applying some game pressure to Arkansas, but failed to connect.
