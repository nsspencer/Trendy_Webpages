     Summary: North Korea fires suspected long-range missile toward seaEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/APSEOUL, South Korea — The U.S., South Korea and Japan all condemned what they say was a North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.
It would be the 12th missile launch the North has conducted so far this year.
That would appear to be an upgrade over the last ICBM North Korea tested in 2017, the Hwasong-15, which is believed capable of reaching all of the continental U.S.
Fewer missiles with multiple warheads could be easier for North Korea to launch, and harder for the U.S. to intercept.
North Korea imposed the moratorium on itself in 2017, ahead of a period of summit diplomacy.

     What We Know About North Korea’s Missile Launch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Image News coverage in Seoul on Thursday, after North Korea carried out its latest missile launch.
Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated PressSEOUL — North Korea on Thursday launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, dramatically escalating tensions with the Biden administration at a moment when the world has been gripped by the devastation in Ukraine.
Instead, North Korea has spent the intervening years building a more and more sophisticated arsenal, working on nuclear and missile advances even as Mr. Kim wrote flowery letters to Mr. Trump and proposed new meetings and peace initiatives.
The North and South have engaged in a quiet arms race on the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea has rarely been as busy with missile tests as it has in the last three months.
The Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest known ICBM, was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020, and components were tested in recent weeks, but the launch on Thursday appears to be the first test of the full missile.

     Dialing up pressure, North Korea tests long-range missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.
The administration’s actions on North Korea have so far been limited to largely symbolic sanctions imposed over its recent tests and offers of open-ended talks that were rejected by Pyongyang.
It was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and came after it fired suspected artillery pieces into the sea on Sunday.
North Korea’s official media insisted that the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite.
Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

     North Korea confirms test of its largest intercontinental ballistic missile yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: State media said on Friday that leader Kim Jong-un had directly guided the test of the Hwasong-17 – a “new type” of intercontinental ballistic missile that is North Korea’s biggest to date.
Show • North Korea unveiled the previously unseen ICBM at a predawn military parade in October 2020.
Analysts noted it appeared "considerably larger" than North Korea's last new ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which was test-fired in November 2017.
The US state department later announced sanctions on entities and people in Russia and North Korea, with the targeted persons and organisations accused of “transferring sensitive items to North Korea’s missile program”.
North Korea’s launch missile was a jarring reminder that Kim will not be ignored even as the world’s attention is gripped by the Ukraine crisis.

“The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions.”For weeks, officials had warned that North Korea may test its new Hwasong-17, which North Korea revealed at a Workers’ Party of Korea military parade in 2020.

     North Korea fires first suspected ICBM since 2017
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea has fired what is believed to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in more than four years as Western leaders gather in Brussels for a security summit.
Analysts said the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, exceeding its last ICBM launch in November 2017.
The US joined allies South Korea and Japan in strongly condemning the launch Thursday and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.
"North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Provocative actAnalysts said North Korea appeared to have conducted a so-called lofted missile test Thursday.
