     Jaylin Williams throws down thunderous dunk in Arkansas vs. Gonzaga men's basketball contest
    </h2>

     Summary: Jaylin Williams came to play against the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the NCAA tournament.
The Arkansas Razorbacks forward threw down an absolutely spectacular dunk in his squad's Sweet 16 matchup against Gonzaga on Thursday night.
JD Notae managed to draw two defenders on a pass, leaving Williams free to dash toward the rim.
While Gonzaga was down 32-29 going into the second half, it's familiar territory for the Bulldogs in this tournament.
It remains to be seen whether they can keep up that second half surge against Arkansas.
