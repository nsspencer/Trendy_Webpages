     Eagles Among Teams Interested in DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles added free agent wide receiver Zach Pascal earlier this week in free agency and might be looking to add another pass catcher.
According to Barry Jackson from the Miami Herald, the Eagles have are among several teams that have shown interest in wide receiver DeVante Parker.
The former first-round pick had 40 catches for 515 yards and two touchdowns in 10 games in 2021.
Most Eagles fans would remember Parker for his seven grabs for 159 yards and two scores in their 2019 game against Miami.
His best season came in 2019, when he caught 72 passes for 1,202 yards and nine acores showing his potential, as the No.

     Report: Several teams showing interest in trade for DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They drafted Jaylen Waddle in the first round last spring; they signed Cedrick Wilson in free agency; and they traded for Tyreek Hill.
Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports several teams, including the Eagles, have shown interest in a trade for DeVante Parker.
Jackson adds that it’s unclear what the Dolphins will do with Parker.
If he stays, Parker will be the third receiver along with Waddle and Hill, but Wilson also is a capable third receiver.
Parker has spent all seven seasons in Miami, and he made 40 receptions for 515 yards and two touchdowns in 10 games in 2021.

     Dolphins WR DeVante Parker Drawing Trade Interest, Including From Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Barry Jackson, Dolphins WR DeVante Parker is drawing some trade interest from teams, including the Eagles.
3 on the depth chart with the arrival of Tyreek Hill and Miami also signed WR Cedrick Wilson to a sizable deal.
He played out the final year of a four-year, $10.876 million rookie contract when the Dolphins picked up his fifth-year option.
Miami later signed Parker to a two-year contract worth up to $13 million with incentives in 2019.
Parker is set to make base salaries of $5.65 million and $5.7 million in the final two years of his deal.

     Tennessee Titans should trade for Miami Dolphins receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are strong rumors that the Miami Dolphins are going to trade DeVante Parker after the Tyreek Hill acquisition, and the Tennessee Titans need to be in on these trade talks.
Compare the Parker situation to the Robert Woods situation.
By the time the Tennessee Titans officially traded for Woods, he only counted $10 million against the cap compared to the $16 million that people originally assumed.
Why would a trade make sense for Parker and the Tennessee Titans?
In their first two seasons together, Parker had 9.9 yards per target in 2015 and 8.6 yards per target in 2016.

     Eagles Among Teams Interested In Dolphins’ DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Several teams have expressed interest in Dolphins receiver DeVante Parker, according to the Miami Herald’s Barry Jackson, who notes the Eagles are one of those clubs (Twitter link).
The Dolphins’ receiver situation changed Wednesday, when the team traded for Tyreek Hill and gave the All-Pro a record-setting extension.
A Parker trade before June 1 would cost the Dolphins $5MM-plus in dead money while adding $3.3MM in cap room.
A trade candidate in the past, Parker stabilized his career with a 1,202-yard, nine-touchdown season for an undermanned Dolphins team in 2019.
A Parker addition would make it less likely Philly devotes one of its first-rounders to the receiver position.

     DeVante Parker a Risk Worth Taking Only if Price is Right
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adding Parker would make some sense, but Miami’s asking price may be too high.
Pascal is 27 and has had some success, so maybe the Eagles feel they are fine with his veteran presence.
In 10 games last season, he had just 40 catches for 515 yards and two touchdowns.
A fifth-round pick for that risk is well worth it.

     Let’s Turn That Facemask Green: DeVante Parker Edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aside from the obvious comparisons that will be drawn between what the Kansas City Chiefs received for Hill and what the Green Bay Packers received for Adams (for which different trade charts will tell you different things), why does this matter for Green Bay?
These three additions leave a productive receiver as surplus to requirements though, and that receiver is DeVante Parker.
Before I dive into Parker the player, it’s necessary to dive into DeVante Parker’s contract because of Green Bay’s cap situation.
Because quarterback play matters for receiver production, especially a receiver like DeVante Parker.
If we go back to 2019, we will find a much more productive DeVante Parker.
