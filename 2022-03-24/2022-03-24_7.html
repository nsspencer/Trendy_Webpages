    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The USMNT currently lead Mexico on goal differential (equal on points with 21) heading into the final three matches of the Octagonal campaign.
The Yanks are underdogs according to the oddsmakers against El Tri Thursday night (10 pm ET | Paramount+, Univision) and by a substantial margin, according to numbers from BetMGM.
But bettors are backing the USMNT with the belief that they can record a third-straight victory over their southern border rival and earn a first-ever win in a competitive match at Estadio Azteca.
They can officially stamp their ticket to Qatar 2022 with a win against Costa Rica on Thursday night.
They could also clinch their spot with a draw combined with a Panama loss or draw with Honduras and a USMNT loss or draw against Mexico.

     Summary: His free kick—taken from a similar spot as his free kick that led to the Gold Cup-winning goal—sailed harmlessly through the Mexico box, though, letting El Tri off easy.
Yedlin countered with a hard tackle of his own a few minutes later, and it came at a big price.
Things got worse for the U.S. a few minutes later, when Weah was cautioned.
The U.S. blew its best chance of the match a couple of minutes later.
Minutes later, Pulisic came off for Jordan Morris, with Berhalter staying true to his pregame word that he would use all five substitutes.
