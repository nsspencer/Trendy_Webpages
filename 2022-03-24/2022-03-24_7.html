     Dolphins WR DeVante Parker Drawing Trade Interest, Including From Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Barry Jackson, Dolphins WR DeVante Parker is drawing some trade interest from teams, including the Eagles.
3 on the depth chart with the arrival of Tyreek Hill and Miami also signed WR Cedrick Wilson to a sizable deal.
He played out the final year of a four-year, $10.876 million rookie contract when the Dolphins picked up his fifth-year option.
Miami later signed Parker to a two-year contract worth up to $13 million with incentives in 2019.
Parker is set to make base salaries of $5.65 million and $5.7 million in the final two years of his deal.

     Report: Several teams showing interest in trade for DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They drafted Jaylen Waddle in the first round last spring; they signed Cedrick Wilson in free agency; and they traded for Tyreek Hill.
Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports several teams, including the Eagles, have shown interest in a trade for DeVante Parker.
Jackson adds that it’s unclear what the Dolphins will do with Parker.
If he stays, Parker will be the third receiver along with Waddle and Hill, but Wilson also is a capable third receiver.
Parker has spent all seven seasons in Miami, and he made 40 receptions for 515 yards and two touchdowns in 10 games in 2021.

     NFL trade rumors: Eagles among teams interested in Miami WR DeVante Parker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is a trade for a receiver in the works?
Another name to keep an eye on is DeVante Parker.
Parker might well be on the trade block after the Dolphins went for broke, trading five draft picks for Hill earlier this week.
Last season in eight starts, Parker had 515 receiving yards and a pair of touchdowns.
His acquisition would in theory move Quez Watkins to the slot, and put Pascal and/or Reagor in the No.

     Could the wide receiver carousel end with the Eagles getting DeVante Parker?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, the wide receivers could be classified in the same manner.
The latest example happened Wednesday after the Kansas City Chiefs sent wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for a package of draft picks, including a first-round selection.
The Dolphins have an excess of wide receivers.
That leaves the most likely scenario being wide receiver DeVante Parker heading to the trade block.
In 10 games last season, Parker caught 40 passes for 515 yards and two touchdowns.

     Summary: Jan 9, 2022; Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker (11) watches from the field during the second quarter of the game against the New England Patriots at Hard Rock Stadium.
by Jaleel GrandberryThe Indianapolis Colts could have a new receiver target in DeVante Parker after the recent blockbuster moves around the NFL.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Miami Dolphins traded for six-time Pro Bowler Tyreek Hill, sending a haul of picks to the Kansas City Chiefs.
There’s a possibility that Devante Parker gets shaken loose by this Hill trade.
Indy can’t afford to sit back and watch another receiver traded without trying to land them.

     Summary: The 14th overall pick in 2015, Parker has career totals of 338 receptions for 4,727 yards (14.0 average) and 24 touchdowns.
Limited to 10 games in 2021 due to a hamstring injury, Parker caught 40 balls for 515 yards and two scores.
Parker caught 5-of-9 deep targets (55.6 percent) last season.
During his career season of 2019, Parker caught 14-of-29 deep balls (48.3 percent) with five touchdowns.
Contractually, Parker signed a front-loaded extension late in the 2019 season, which would help the Packers handle his contract.

     Let’s Turn That Facemask Green: DeVante Parker Edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aside from the obvious comparisons that will be drawn between what the Kansas City Chiefs received for Hill and what the Green Bay Packers received for Adams (for which different trade charts will tell you different things), why does this matter for Green Bay?
These three additions leave a productive receiver as surplus to requirements though, and that receiver is DeVante Parker.
Before I dive into Parker the player, it’s necessary to dive into DeVante Parker’s contract because of Green Bay’s cap situation.
Because quarterback play matters for receiver production, especially a receiver like DeVante Parker.
If we go back to 2019, we will find a much more productive DeVante Parker.
