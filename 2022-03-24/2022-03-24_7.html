     Male contraceptive pill one step closer after trials in mice prevent 99 per cent of pregnancies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They have created an oral, non-hormone-based pill that is 99 per cent effective in preventing pregnancies in mice.
They gave male mice one dose of YCT529 every day for four weeks.
“We are trying to make a newer second-generation compound that would be effective in a lower dose,” said Noman.
“Sometimes a lower dose could mean higher toxicity, I have to give that caveat, but in most cases a lower dose is better.
“Now we are trying to make a compound that will hit two targets at the same time – retinoic acid receptor alpha and retinoic acid receptor gamma.

     Male Birth Control Pill 99% Effective on Mice Looks Set for Human Trials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scientists at the University of Minnesota have found a male birth control pill safe and effective in mice.
Advertisement“Most female birth control pills work on the female sex hormones,” said Abdullah al Noman, one of the researchers, noting the lack of approved male oral contraceptive on the market.
“Men are less willing to take a birth control pill that has significant side effects.
The researchers found that knocking out the RAR-α gene in male mice made them infertile.
Crucially, the male mice became fertile again after four to six weeks of being taken off YCT529.

     Male contraceptive pill could be ready for humans in five years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Specifically, the contraceptive called YCT529 (which is the name of the compound) made male mice temporarily impotent.
During the trial, the male mice were given the pill everyday.
Four weeks after the male mice stopped receiving YCT529, they were able to impregnate the female mice again.
But the scientists are cautiously optimistic about how this might translate into a real male contraceptive pill in the not-so-distant future.
This isn't the first time a male contraceptive has been touted and tested.

     Summary: “Most female birth control pills work on the female sex hormones,” said Abdullah al Noman, a graduate student and researcher on the project.
“Targeting the male sex hormone leads to a lot of side effects such as weight gain, depression and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases,” he said.
“Men are less willing to take a birth control pill that has significant side effects.
That’s why we are targeting a non-hormonal pathway to developing a male birth control pill.”Story continues below advertisementTo develop the male contraceptive, researchers targeted a protein called the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-α).
By removing the RAR-α receptor in male mice, scientists could make male mice sterile.

     Male contraceptive pill found 99% effective in mice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When administered orally to male mice for four weeks, YCT529 drastically reduced sperm counts and was 99-percent effective in preventing pregnancy in a mating trial.
The female pill uses hormones to disrupt the menstrual cycle, and historic efforts to develop a male equivalent targeted the male sex hormone testosterone.
When administered orally to male mice for four weeks, YCT529 drastically reduced sperm counts and was 99-percent effective in preventing pregnancy in a mating trial.
A persistent question about future male contraceptive pills has been whether women will trust men to use them.
"Male contraceptives will add to the method mix, providing new options that allow men and women to contribute in whatever way they deem appropriate to contraceptive use," argues the nonprofit Male Contraceptive Initiative, which engages in fundraising and advocacy.
