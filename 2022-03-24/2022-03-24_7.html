     Houston we have a problem! Cougars too much for Arizona Basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS - MARCH 24: Kyler Edwards #11 of the Houston Cougars reacts during the second half of the game against the Arizona Wildcats in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament Sweet 16 Round at AT&amp;T Center on March 24, 2022 in San Antonio, Texas.
After all, Houston had been playing well and was just a year removed from their stellar Final Four run last season.
Holding Arizona Basketball to just 28 first-half points on 7-25 shooting from the field, the Wildcats would have their work cut out for them in the second half.
Coming out more focused in the second half, Arizona was able to battle back somewhat, pulling within two points at 37-35 with 16:52 to play, and again 42-40 with 13:33 left in the game.
Unfortunately for Arizona, that would be the closest that the Wildcats would get in this one, as for every run the Wildcats tried to make, the Cougars had a response.

     NCAA Tournament: Perfect storm of flaws ends Arizona’s season in Sweet 16 loss to Houston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having all those flaws resurface during the Sweet 16 spelled doom for the Wildcats, who never led in a 72-60 loss to Houston on Thursday night at AT&amp;T Center.
But Arizona’s big men, such a source of dominant play all season, combined for 14 points on 3-of-17 shooting.
After being outscored 18-4 in the paint in the first half, the Wildcats devoted their offense to getting it inside early and often in the second half.
Houston, which came in shooting only 66.7 percent from the line, made 12 of 16 free throws in the second half to keep Arizona from catching up.
Arizona’s 33 wins tie it for third-most in school history, while Houston will try to make a second consecutive Final Four when it takes on No.

     Pac-12 in NCAA Tournament: Coaching the Difference in Arizona's Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 5 seed Houston on Thursday night in San Antonio in a Sweet 16 game of the NCAA Tournament.
Sampson is in his 30th season as a college head coach, all with power conference teams, and this is 19th NCAA tournament as a head coach.
Lloyd was the Pac-12 coach of the year for good reason, and he did not make any glaring coaching errors Thursday; his team just wasn't as prepared to win an NCAA tournament game as Houston was.
2 overall seed in this NCAA tournament and figured to have a chance to win it all.
Guard Kerr Kriisa made his first start of the NCAA tournament after being slowed by an ankle injury, but was just 1-for-7 from the field for three points and one assist.

     Houston Cougars into Elite Eight of NCAA tournament after upset of No. 1 Arizona Wildcats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cougars are annually one of the best defensive teams in the country, but they're also an elite offensive rebounding unit.
Houston imposed its style and physicality on the Wildcats, taking them out of their comfort zone on nearly every possession.
Late free throws from Koloko cut the deficit to six points going into the break.
Houston responded with a 10-2 run highlighted by 3-pointers from Shead and Edwards, and Arizona looked deflated.
In three NCAA tournament games, Shead is averaging 17.0 points and 5.3 assists while shooting 45.5% from 3-point range.

     Summary: Of course Lloyd wanted the Zags to win, because of his connections, the deep bonds he had developed, what that place meant to him.
And he did, transforming from pillar assistant to first-time head coach in roughly a week.
But as Lloyd likes to remind his young and talented Arizona team, the mission is not over.
But those questions are the ones the head coach must answer, too.
But these are things a head coach must not only worry about but address and overcome in order to advance.
