     Mark Pomerantz Is Furious About Trump’s Latest Escape From Justice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pomerantz’s letter, which appears to have been written for public consumption, says the investigation is now moribund.
Special counsel Robert Mueller outlined multiple instances where Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation.
Then he effectively declined to prosecute him because of the Justice Department’s quasi-policy against indicting a sitting president.
You need to attack your investigators and prosecutors relentlessly to delegitimize them in the eyes of your supporters.
And it helps if you can get roughly half of the nation’s political infrastructure to actively or passively support your attempts to evade justice.

     Manhattan DA Bragg is drawing flak from a diverse set of critics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in a mere three months has become a political lightning rod far beyond his jurisdiction.
Under the public light that shines brightly on the office, District Attorney Alvin Bragg in a mere three months has become a political lightning rod far beyond his jurisdiction.
So far Bragg’s most sensational impact comes from his reluctance to pursue both low-level offenders and a former president, Donald Trump.
The optics are no less problematic when it comes to the Trump probe that Bragg inherited from his predecessor, Cy Vance.
Bragg reportedly wasn’t convinced he could prove Trump intentionally inflated the value of his properties to get loans.

     Alvin Bragg Not Indicting Donald Trump 'Shameful'—Legal Experts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pomerantz begins the resignation by stating he believes Trump is "guilty of numerous felony violations" with regards to his submitted financial statements.
"The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes—he did."
Attorney Robert J. DeNault said that New York is going to "demand an explanation" over Bragg's decision not to move forward with prosecuting Trump.
In a follow-up tweet, Conway quoted Pomerantz's line from his resignation letter about not prosecuting Trump being a "grave failure of justice," before writing "indeed."
In a statement to The Times, Danielle Filson, a spokesperson for Bragg, said the investigation into Trump was continuing.

     New York Prosecutor Who Investigated Trump: Indict This Crook Immediately
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the greatest mysteries of the 21st century is why Donald Trump has never once been held accountable for a lifetime of wildly corrupt behavior.
And according to one of those prosecutor’s resignation letters, he feels the same way!
In a letter dated February 23 and obtained by The New York Times, attorney Mark Pomerantz wrote that Trump is “guilty of numerous felony violations” and that it was a major “failure of justice” not to hold him accountable.
Last month, New York attorney general Letitia James wrote that she has “significant evidence” the Trump Organization engaged in such activity.
She is currently attempting to question the former president, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump under oath, but for some reason they’ve refused to do so thus far.

     Is Alvin Bragg Too Soft on Donald Trump?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Almost exactly a month ago, I asked in this space whether the criminal case in New York against ex-president Donald Trump was on the verge of falling apart.
Because after years of work, Bragg stepped in and halted interviews before the grand jury that will ultimately decide whether or not Trump is charged.
Trump, Pomerantz says, is absolutely guilty of multiple felonies, and his investigation unearthed more than enough evidence to prove it at trial.
“The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did,” Mr. Pomerantz wrote.
Bragg may be right in thinking that Trump wouldn’t be convicted at trial.

     Summary: At the time, Bragg said he was getting up to speed on the Trump investigation and vowed to "follow the facts."
But while Pomerantz and his team were prepared to move forward with charges against Trump, Bragg was not.
"It is a great tribute to the system that Alvin Bragg came in and stopped the unfairness against Trump," a source close to the investigation told Fox News.
"A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law," the spokesperson told Fox News.
"A lot of it is legal, some of it is illegal, but it is almost never prosecuted," McCarthy told Fox News.
