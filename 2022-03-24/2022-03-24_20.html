     Summary: Devin Booker casually told off fan during live playEven the best team in the NBA still gets hecklers.
Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker had one of the more savage moments of the season during Wednesday’s game against the Timberwolves in Minnesota.
As he brought the ball up the floor, Booker turned to a fan sitting courtside and casually said, “Shut up p—y” before running the play for the Suns.
You can’t really tell from the video what the fan said to elicit such a response from Booker.

     ‘Shut Up Pu**y!’ Watch Devin Booker Taunt a Heckler in the Middle of a Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker had enough of a courtside heckler Wednesday when his team faced the Minnesota Timberwolves and decided to snap back.
In a video posted by the account HoopCentral, Booker is seen dribbling the ball up the court before a Timberwolevs fan begins to heckle him.
To which the Suns guard replied simply, “Shut up pu**y.”The fan was left in disbelief as they didn’t expect Booker to respond so aggressively.
The game featured two former college teammates in Booker and Karl Anthony-Towns as they both took the game personally and it showed in their intensity levels.
It is unclear if Booker will face a similar punishment from the league as his fellow NBA counterparts.
