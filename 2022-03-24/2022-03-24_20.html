     Metsa, Quinnipiac defense face St. Cloud in NCAA men’s hockey tournament opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quinnipiac senior Zach Metsa leads a Bobcats defense corps that, going into the first round of the NCAA tournament, has allowed only 1.1 goals a game.
“(The Bobcats are) a really good team, and they go north quick,” Huskies grad-student defenseman Seamus Donohue said.
“They’ve got a really good group of forwards, and their D are good at getting the puck up to them.
Their power play leads the nation by over four points, a good match for Quinnipiac’s nation-leading penalty kill.
“The power play, obviously, the numbers, it’s hard to argue with a 31% power play,” Pecknold said.
