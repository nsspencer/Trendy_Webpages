     Supreme Court silent on Justice Clarence Thomas hospitalization
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is seen in his chambers at the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S. June 6, 2016.
The Supreme Court has remained silent on the condition of 73-year-old Justice Clarence Thomas since it announced his hospitalization earlier this week and said he was on the mend.
Confirmed in 1991, Thomas is currently the longest-serving justice on the high court, and the second-oldest, behind 83-year-old Breyer, who is retiring.
Thomas, a conservative darling, was the second Black man to ever ascend to the Supreme Court.
He succeeded Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice.
