     What We Know About North Korea’s Missile Launch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Image News coverage in Seoul on Thursday, after North Korea carried out its latest missile launch.
Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated PressSEOUL — North Korea on Thursday launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, dramatically escalating tensions with the Biden administration at a moment when the world has been gripped by the devastation in Ukraine.
Instead, North Korea has spent the intervening years building a more and more sophisticated arsenal, working on nuclear and missile advances even as Mr. Kim wrote flowery letters to Mr. Trump and proposed new meetings and peace initiatives.
The North and South have engaged in a quiet arms race on the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea has rarely been as busy with missile tests as it has in the last three months.
The Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest known ICBM, was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020, and components were tested in recent weeks, but the launch on Thursday appears to be the first test of the full missile.

     North Korea Test-Fires Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday, Seoul’s military said, its most significant weapons test in more than four years.
Initial flight data suggested the missile had soared higher and longer than North Korea’s last intercontinental ballistic missile test in November 2017—a launch that demonstrated that Kim Jong Un ’s regime, for the first time, had the capability to strike the U.S. mainland.

     Dialing up pressure, North Korea tests long-range missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.
The administration’s actions on North Korea have so far been limited to largely symbolic sanctions imposed over its recent tests and offers of open-ended talks that were rejected by Pyongyang.
It was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and came after it fired suspected artillery pieces into the sea on Sunday.
North Korea’s official media insisted that the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite.
Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

     Summary: North Korea has launched what is thought to be its largest intercontinental ballistic missile to date, in a dramatic return to long-range testing that marks the regime’s most serious provocation for years.
US and South Korean officials recently said that North Korea had been preparing to test-fire the Hwasong-17.
Show • North Korea unveiled the previously unseen ICBM at a predawn military parade in October 2020.
Analysts noted it appeared "considerably larger" than North Korea's last new ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which was test-fired in November 2017.
