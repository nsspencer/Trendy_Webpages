     Taylor Hawkins, Foo Fighters’ Drummer, Dies at 50
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Foo Fighters’ most recent album, “Medicine at Midnight,” arrived last year as the group was celebrating its 25th anniversary, and in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Hawkins was direct about his hopes for its future.
Mr. Hawkins was born in Fort Worth on Feb. 17, 1972, and raised in Southern California.
He started to play drums at age 10, and said that his mother gave him the confidence to dream big: “When I first got drums, she was the one who would watch me play.
She was a big supporter and told me I’d make it,” he said in an interview last year.
“After that concert, I don’t think I slept for three days,” he said in a 2021 interview with the metal magazine Kerrang.
