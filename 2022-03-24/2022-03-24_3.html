     Could the wide receiver carousel end with the Eagles getting DeVante Parker?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, the wide receivers could be classified in the same manner.
The latest example happened Wednesday after the Kansas City Chiefs sent wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for a package of draft picks, including a first-round selection.
The Dolphins have an excess of wide receivers.
That leaves the most likely scenario being wide receiver DeVante Parker heading to the trade block.
In 10 games last season, Parker caught 40 passes for 515 yards and two touchdowns.

     DeVante Parker on outs in Miami, should Eagles remain patient at WR? – Philly Sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 receiver over DeVante Parker,who has lost significant explosiveness due to injuries since being selected in the first round in 2015.
The Eagles still have openings at receiver even with the signing of slot receiver Zach Pascal, but DeVante Parker could offer what the team so desperately needs.
At his best, the former 14th overall pick out of Louisville is a big-play wide receiver that can go up and consistently make contested catches.
Last season, Parker only played in eight games, and caught only 40 passes for 515 yards and two scores.
So should the Eagles take a flier on Parker if and when he gets cut by Miami?

     Will Dolphins adding Tyreek Hill make DeVante Parker a trade candidate for Colts?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 9, 2022; Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker (11) watches from the field during the second quarter of the game against the New England Patriots at Hard Rock Stadium.
by Jaleel GrandberryThe Indianapolis Colts could have a new receiver target in DeVante Parker after the recent blockbuster moves around the NFL.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Miami Dolphins traded for six-time Pro Bowler Tyreek Hill, sending a haul of picks to the Kansas City Chiefs.
There’s a possibility that Devante Parker gets shaken loose by this Hill trade.
Indy can’t afford to sit back and watch another receiver traded without trying to land them.

     Could Packers Replace Davante with DeVante?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 14th overall pick in 2015, Parker has career totals of 338 receptions for 4,727 yards (14.0 average) and 24 touchdowns.
Limited to 10 games in 2021 due to a hamstring injury, Parker caught 40 balls for 515 yards and two scores.
Parker caught 5-of-9 deep targets (55.6 percent) last season.
During his career season of 2019, Parker caught 14-of-29 deep balls (48.3 percent) with five touchdowns.
Contractually, Parker signed a front-loaded extension late in the 2019 season, which would help the Packers handle his contract.

     Let’s Turn That Facemask Green: DeVante Parker Edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aside from the obvious comparisons that will be drawn between what the Kansas City Chiefs received for Hill and what the Green Bay Packers received for Adams (for which different trade charts will tell you different things), why does this matter for Green Bay?
These three additions leave a productive receiver as surplus to requirements though, and that receiver is DeVante Parker.
Before I dive into Parker the player, it’s necessary to dive into DeVante Parker’s contract because of Green Bay’s cap situation.
Because quarterback play matters for receiver production, especially a receiver like DeVante Parker.
If we go back to 2019, we will find a much more productive DeVante Parker.
