     Summary: 1 team in the nation in the Gonzaga Bulldogs has been shockingly upset out of the 2022 March Madness tournament.
1 Gonzaga 74-68 in a stunning Sweet 16 upset.
Given that Holmgren has been billed as the top prospect in the upcoming NBA draft, it’s a real tough way to go out and end your college career that way.
The last time Gonzaga was stalled at the Sweet 16 was during the 2017–18 season after going 32–5 on the year.
College basketball fans were shocked at the result, given Gonzaga was ranked No.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Top-ranked Gonzaga, which hoped to ride its high-flying offense to its first national championship, was stopped short of that goal with a 74-68 loss to No.
4 Arkansas on Thursday night in a West Regional semifinal.
As their struggles intensified, the Zags pressed — fumbling passes, hurrying shots and wearing the frustration on their faces.
Andrew Nembhard knocked in a 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left to bring Gonzaga within 68-65, the closest the Zags had been since early in the second half.
But Arkansas made its free throws and Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.

“Au’Diese just owned Nembhard,” Arkansas guard JD Notae said.
For Gonzaga, the belief that last year’s journey to the championship game could be replicated—and ultimately exceeded—died hard Thursday night.
In the first half, Gonzaga kept flirting with landing a heavy blow and applying some game pressure to Arkansas, but failed to connect.

     Summary: Thursday night, however, Musselman found success in the Bay Area when he led his Arkansas squad to a 74-68 upset of Gonzaga, the top overall seed in the NCAA tournament and last year's national runner-up.
Arkansas is headed to the Elite Eight for the second year in a row but just the third time since 1995.
After ousting Gonzaga, Musselman kept the focus on his players, praising them for grinding out a tough, physical game plan for all 40 minutes.
Coach Mark Few's squad was undefeated last year before falling to Baylor in the national title game.
A pump-fake 3-pointer with 6:33 to play in the game extended Arkansas' lead to nine points.
