     THE BATMAN Deleted Scene Fully Reveals Barry Keoghan’s Joker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And now, the site’s led to a deleted scene from the movie.
This deleted The Batman scene fully reveals Barry Keoghan’s Joker.
While we only got a glimpse of the actor’s heavily shielded face inside an Arkham Asylum cell for a single scene, this deleted scene treats us to a whole lot more.
And this clip gives us five whole minutes of Robert Pattinson’s Batman going toe-to-toe with Keoghan’s Joker.
But in this deleted scene we get a better look at the Joker, even if it’s still a bit blurred and shadowed.

AdvertisementOf the scene Reeves previously was reported saying, “It’s a really creepy, cool scene,” he says.
If anything we’re excited to see more of Keoghan’s take on the character, who serves as a Hannibal Lecter for Bats here.
We’re definitely getting a bit of Lee Bermejo Joker in the look, by way of New 52's face mutilation.
