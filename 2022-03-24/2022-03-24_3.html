     Kyrie Irving Won
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving’s part-time status with the Brooklyn Nets is almost certainly coming to a close this week.
The mandate, which was first issued in December 2021, will remain in place for all other local businesses, but athletes like Irving and several Mets and Yankees are in the clear.
But those two incredible outings were separated by more than a week, sandwiched around a three-game homestand that, due to his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19, necessarily excluded Irving.
Yet another scrapped version of this blog grappled with how abstracted COVID posturing and policy has become, to the point that I am no longer even all that sure why I care whether or not Kyrie Irving has been jabbed.
The mandate could’ve been stronger, enforcement could’ve been better, it could’ve come alongside a whole range of other helpful measures, but its fatal flaw was ultimately that antivax morons could defeat it simply by waiting a little while.

     Kyrie Irving cleared to play in Nets home games as New York mayor Eric Adams alters vaccine mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams," Adams said.
We applaud the Mayor for listening to the concerns of our New York teams, players, fans and communities and for leveling the playing field for home teams and their opponents."
"I said we have to wait," Adams said Thursday.
Adams' administration had already lifted the Key2NYC mandate; it is now making Irving and other unvaccinated performers exempt from a different mandate, which covers private businesses.
Toronto is the one NBA city where Irving remains ineligible to play.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adams said the decision was not driven by external pressures, but because of the desire to improve New York’s economy.
Adams again encouraged Irving and all other New York athletes to get vaccinated and get boosted, saying that his feelings had not changed on that subject despite the exemption.
NYC Mayor Eric Adams has officially expanded the city's vaccine mandate exemption for athletes and performers:"We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams?
Earlier this month, he lifted a vaccine mandate for citizens attending entertainment venues, eating indoors at restaurants and using fitness centers.

     Summary: We're doing it because the city has to function," Adams said at a news conference at the New York Mets' Citi Field.
The city already had allowed an exception for non-New York City resident entertainers and professional athletes.
The announcement also comes before the start of Major League Baseball's season, allowing unvaccinated Mets and Yankees players to play upcoming home games as well.
At Thursday's news conference, Yankees president Randy Levine said a "few" of his team's players were unvaccinated.
We applaud the mayor for listening to the concerns of our New York teams, players, fans and communities and for leveling the playing field for home teams and their opponents."

     Summary: Kyrie Irving never changed his mind.
The question now: How large a role can Kyrie play in getting the Nets out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves?
He’s shooting just under 53 percent on 2-pointers, on one of the toughest diets of interior shots you’ll ever see from a guard.
The most frequently used five-man lineup on the Nets that features Irving also featured the now-departed Harden; no.
After months of drama, it’s still all about Kyrie Irving.
