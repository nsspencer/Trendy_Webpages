     Italy misses World Cup again after loss to North Macedonia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Italy will miss the World Cup for the second straight time after a massive qualifying playoff round upset at the hands of North Macedonia.
Just nine months removed from winning the Euros, Italy suffered yet another national disgrace on the World Cup stage after missing out in 2018.
The defeat was Italy’s first World Cup qualifying loss on home soil ever after previously going 48-0-11.
Yet despite outshooting North Macedonia 32–4, Italy only managed five shots on target in Palermo against a stalwart defensive effort from the visitors.
North Macedonia made headlines a year ago by handing Germany its first World Cup qualifying defeat since 2001, breaking the 2014 world champion’s 35-match unbeaten streak in World Cup qualifiers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US men’s national team are still winless in World Cup qualifiers at Estadio Azteca but picked up a valuable point Thursday night in a 0-0 draw with Mexico.
The pivotal moment of the scoreless first half came in the 35th minute when Timothy Weah picked out a wide-open Christian Pulisic in front of goal.
But the Chelsea attacker had his attempt from just outside the six-yard box saved by Memo Ochoa.
Pulisic put another attempt on frame four minutes into the second half after being played through by Kellyn Acosta, but Ochoa parried that away.
Reyna played a first-time pass across goal to Jordan Pefok, yet the striker's attempt was scuffed.

Italy became arrogant, thinking that after winning Euros qualifying for the World Cup would take care of itself.

Sadly, the new cycle the World Cup cycle that started in 2017 after the last failure, concluded with the same result, Euro glory notwithstanding.
Italy won't play in a World Cup for at least twelve years and we are talking about the country with the second most World Cup wins in the world with four.

     World Cup roundup: Italy knocked out by North Macedonia in dramatic finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.
Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.
Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance.
But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.
