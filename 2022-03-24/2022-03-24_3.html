     Summary: North Korea fires suspected long-range missile toward seaEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/APSEOUL, South Korea — The U.S., South Korea and Japan all condemned what they say was a North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.
That would appear to be an upgrade over the last ICBM North Korea tested in 2017, the Hwasong-15, which is believed capable of reaching all of the continental U.S.
Fewer missiles with multiple warheads could be easier for North Korea to launch, and harder for the U.S. to intercept.
North Korea imposed the moratorium on itself in 2017, ahead of a period of summit diplomacy.
After talks ended without a deal to satisfy either Washington or Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signaled his intention to resume testing.

     What We Know About North Korea’s Missile Launch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Image News coverage in Seoul on Thursday, after North Korea carried out its latest missile launch.
Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated PressSEOUL — North Korea on Thursday launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, dramatically escalating tensions with the Biden administration at a moment when the world has been gripped by the devastation in Ukraine.
Instead, North Korea has spent the intervening years building a more and more sophisticated arsenal, working on nuclear and missile advances even as Mr. Kim wrote flowery letters to Mr. Trump and proposed new meetings and peace initiatives.
The North and South have engaged in a quiet arms race on the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea has rarely been as busy with missile tests as it has in the last three months.
The Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest known ICBM, was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020, and components were tested in recent weeks, but the launch on Thursday appears to be the first test of the full missile.

     Summary: The White House on Thursday condemned North Korea over the totalitarian nation’s latest long-range ballistic missile test, calling it “a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions.”“The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its test of a long-range ballistic missile,” press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement, using the Hermit Kingdom’s official name.
“This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,” Psaki added.

     Dialing up pressure, North Korea tests long-range missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.
The administration’s actions on North Korea have so far been limited to largely symbolic sanctions imposed over its recent tests and offers of open-ended talks that were rejected by Pyongyang.
It was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and came after it fired suspected artillery pieces into the sea on Sunday.
North Korea’s official media insisted that the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite.
Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

     Summary: North Korea has launched what is thought to be its largest intercontinental ballistic missile to date, in a dramatic return to long-range testing that marks the regime’s most serious provocation for years.
US and South Korean officials recently said that North Korea had been preparing to test-fire the Hwasong-17.
Show • North Korea unveiled the previously unseen ICBM at a predawn military parade in October 2020.
Analysts noted it appeared "considerably larger" than North Korea's last new ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which was test-fired in November 2017.

“North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In response to Thursday’s suspected ICBM test, South Korea’s military launched several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text sent to reporters.
