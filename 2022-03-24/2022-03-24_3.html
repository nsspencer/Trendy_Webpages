     Shaq Moore to join USMNT roster for final World Cup qualifiers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares 6 EmailU.S. men’s national team head coach Gregg Berhalter has already been forced to make one defensive addition in this final World Cup Qualifying window and COVID-19 has led to a second roster move in the past week.
Shaq Moore will join the USMNT roster for upcoming matches against Panama and Costa Rica, Berhalter confirmed postmatch after Thursday’s scoreless draw with Mexico.
“Shaq Moore is in Orlando as we speak and he’ll be joining the group,” Berhalter said postmatch.
Moore has totaled 15 league appearances in Spain’s second division this season, registering two assists.
The USMNT sits in second place on 22 points and would clinch a World Cup berth on Sunday with a victory over Panama paired with a Costa Rica draw or loss against El Salvador.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US men’s national team are still winless in World Cup qualifiers at Estadio Azteca but picked up a valuable point Thursday night in a 0-0 draw with Mexico.
The pivotal moment of the scoreless first half came in the 35th minute when Timothy Weah picked out a wide-open Christian Pulisic in front of goal.
But the Chelsea attacker had his attempt from just outside the six-yard box saved by Memo Ochoa.
Pulisic put another attempt on frame four minutes into the second half after being played through by Kellyn Acosta, but Ochoa parried that away.
Reyna played a first-time pass across goal to Jordan Pefok, yet the striker's attempt was scuffed.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was much discussion in the days and weeks prior to the match about the best options for lining up the team.
Gregg Berhalter went with the approach that mid-week games are also worth three points and put out an aggressive lineup.
The inclusion of Chucky Lozano meant that Jedi Robinson would have a clear task ahead of him defensively on the night.
The USA had two brilliant chances go wanting while they largely kept Mexico from finding the final ball, though El Tri did have their moments.
As a result, the game ended 0-0 with the USA taking a point back home before facing Panama in Orlando.

“We need to show the same respect to North Macedonia that we would to Italy,” Santos told a news conference.

     Summary: For the second time in a row Italy won't be part of the World Cup.
Italy became arrogant, thinking that after winning Euros qualifying for the World Cup would take care of itself.
Roberto Mancini even after all his good work still failed to bring Italy back to the World Cup.
Sadly, the new cycle the World Cup cycle that started in 2017 after the last failure, concluded with the same result, Euro glory notwithstanding.
