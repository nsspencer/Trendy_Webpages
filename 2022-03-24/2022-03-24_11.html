     Broncos' Mile High Stadium catches fire; heavy smoke and flames seen inside complex, among suite seats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Empower Field at Mile High Stadium, home of the Denver Broncos, caught fire Thursday afternoon, with numerous videos on social media capturing billows of smoke coming from inside the complex.
Video shared by CBS Denver suggested the source of the smoke may have come from the suite level of the Broncos' stadium, which opened in 2001 and was re-branded in 2019.
The Denver Fire Department has since confirmed a fire inside the stadium, announcing that crews have begun extinguishing flames on the suite and third levels among stadium seats.
It's unclear if any stadium personnel were on hand at or near the site of the fire, or what caused the incident.
Fans in the area, however, shared dozens of photos and videos from outside Mile High Stadium, showing the smoke arising from within.
