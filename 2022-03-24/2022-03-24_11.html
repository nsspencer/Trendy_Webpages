     Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, exchanged texts with Mark Meadows about efforts to overturn the 2020 election

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Among Thomas' stated goals in the messages was for lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted incendiary and unsupported claims about the election, to become "the lead and the face" of Trump's legal team.
The messages were among the 2,320 text messages that Meadows provided the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The existence of messages between Thomas and Meadows — 21 sent by her; eight by him — have not previously been reported and were reviewed by CBS News and The Post.
They were then confirmed by five people who have seen the committee's documents.

     Ginni Thomas Pressed Trump’s Chief of Staff to Overturn 2020 Vote, Texts Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The text traffic also suggests that Ms. Thomas was in contact with Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser.
Sidney Powell, the lawyer advising Trump’s campaign team known for unleashing wild theories about voting fraud, comes up repeatedly.
On Nov. 13, for instance, Mr. Trump included Ms. Powell in a tweeted list of his team’s lawyers.
While Ms. Thomas already had access to the president, White House aides said her influence increased after Mr. Trump named Mr. Meadows chief of staff in March 2020.
Mr. Meadows is no longer cooperating with the committee; a lawyer for Mr. Meadows, George J. Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, played an active role in pushing then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to take measures to help overturn the 2020 election results, according to texts obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News.
Thomas and an attorney for Meadows did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
A message to the public information officer at the Supreme Court also was not immediately answered.
What happened: On Nov. 10, after President Biden was projected the winner, Ginni Thomas texted Meadows, "Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!
The 29 messages reported by the Post and CBS News show that both Thomas and Meadows believed the election was stolen.

     Jan. 6 panel has text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows about keeping Trump in office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas and Meadows exchanged the messages came as Trump allies were discussing a legal challenge to the results of the 2020 election.
The Supreme Court, in an unsigned opinion in December 2020, dismissed a challenge from Republican state attorneys general to overturn the results.
The text messages were in a trove of documents and messages that Meadows turned over to the Jan. 6 committee before he stopped cooperating with the investigation.
The Post and CBS News reported that none of the messages directly referred to Clarence Thomas or the Supreme Court.
“I played no role with those who were planning and leading the Jan. 6 events,” Thomas said.

     January 6 committee has text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The text messages, reviewed by CNN, show Thomas pleading with Meadows to continue the fight to overturn the election results.
CNN first reported that the text messages were in the committee's possession.
On November 24, 2020, Meadows promised he wasn't done battling on then-President Donald Trump's behalf and evoked his faith as a source of strength.
Thomas' messages reflected a belief that the legal challenges presented by a group of conservative lawyers helping the campaign were valid.
Meadows turned over thousands of text messages before he stopped cooperating with the committee.
