     Summary: North Korea fires suspected long-range missile toward seaEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/APSEOUL, South Korea — The U.S., South Korea and Japan all condemned what they say was a North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.
It would be the 12th missile launch the North has conducted so far this year.
That would appear to be an upgrade over the last ICBM North Korea tested in 2017, the Hwasong-15, which is believed capable of reaching all of the continental U.S.
Fewer missiles with multiple warheads could be easier for North Korea to launch, and harder for the U.S. to intercept.
North Korea imposed the moratorium on itself in 2017, ahead of a period of summit diplomacy.

     North Korea confirms test-firing of biggest ICBM
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agency claimed the test met desired technical objectives and proved that the ICBM system would be promptly operated during wartime conditions.
It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.
The launch was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and represented the most provocative test since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.
Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

     What We Know About North Korea’s Missile Launch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Image News coverage in Seoul on Thursday, after North Korea carried out its latest missile launch.
Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated PressSEOUL — North Korea on Thursday launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, dramatically escalating tensions with the Biden administration at a moment when the world has been gripped by the devastation in Ukraine.
Instead, North Korea has spent the intervening years building a more and more sophisticated arsenal, working on nuclear and missile advances even as Mr. Kim wrote flowery letters to Mr. Trump and proposed new meetings and peace initiatives.
The North and South have engaged in a quiet arms race on the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea has rarely been as busy with missile tests as it has in the last three months.
The Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest known ICBM, was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020, and components were tested in recent weeks, but the launch on Thursday appears to be the first test of the full missile.

     Summary: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts Thursday and agreed to coordinate on a response, including potential new sanctions, according to the Japanese and South Korean governments.
“The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions.”For weeks, officials had warned that North Korea may test its new Hwasong-17, which North Korea revealed at a Workers’ Party of Korea military parade in 2020.

North Korea had recently warned it may lift its own moratorium after talks bogged down, and Thursday’s launch did just that.

     North Korea confirms test of its largest intercontinental ballistic missile yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Korea has confirmed that it tested a new, powerful type of intercontinental ballistic missile, marking an end to a self-imposed moratorium on long-range testing in place since 2017 and drawing international condemnation.
Show • North Korea unveiled the previously unseen ICBM at a predawn military parade in October 2020.
Analysts noted it appeared "considerably larger" than North Korea's last new ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which was test-fired in November 2017.
The US state department later announced sanctions on entities and people in Russia and North Korea, with the targeted persons and organisations accused of “transferring sensitive items to North Korea’s missile program”.
North Korea’s launch missile was a jarring reminder that Kim will not be ignored even as the world’s attention is gripped by the Ukraine crisis.
