     What We Know About North Korea’s Missile Launch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Image News coverage in Seoul on Thursday, after North Korea carried out its latest missile launch.
Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated PressSEOUL — North Korea on Thursday launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, dramatically escalating tensions with the Biden administration at a moment when the world has been gripped by the devastation in Ukraine.
Instead, North Korea has spent the intervening years building a more and more sophisticated arsenal, working on nuclear and missile advances even as Mr. Kim wrote flowery letters to Mr. Trump and proposed new meetings and peace initiatives.
The North and South have engaged in a quiet arms race on the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea has rarely been as busy with missile tests as it has in the last three months.
The Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest known ICBM, was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020, and components were tested in recent weeks, but the launch on Thursday appears to be the first test of the full missile.

     North Korea confirms test-firing of biggest ICBM
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agency claimed the test met desired technical objectives and proved that the ICBM system would be promptly operated during wartime conditions.
It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities.
The launch was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and represented the most provocative test since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.
Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.

     North Korea Test-Fires Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile under the supervision of Kim Jong Un, who called it a new strategic weapon that makes the whole world clearly aware of the country’s military power once again.
Known as the Hwasong-17, the North Korean ICBM was launched Thursday from near the country’s international airport on the outskirts of Pyongyang.
North Korea’s state media reported that it met all the test parameters and that the missile’s use “can be guaranteed scientifically, technically and practically under wartime.”

     Summary: North Korea fires suspected long-range missile toward seaEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/APSEOUL, South Korea — The U.S., South Korea and Japan all condemned what they say was a North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.
It would be the 12th missile launch the North has conducted so far this year.
That would appear to be an upgrade over the last ICBM North Korea tested in 2017, the Hwasong-15, which is believed capable of reaching all of the continental U.S.
Fewer missiles with multiple warheads could be easier for North Korea to launch, and harder for the U.S. to intercept.
North Korea imposed the moratorium on itself in 2017, ahead of a period of summit diplomacy.

     Summary: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea has fired what is believed to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in more than four years as Western leaders gather in Brussels for a security summit.
Analysts said the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, exceeding its last ICBM launch in November 2017.
The US joined allies South Korea and Japan in strongly condemning the launch Thursday and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.
"North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Provocative actAnalysts said North Korea appeared to have conducted a so-called lofted missile test Thursday.
