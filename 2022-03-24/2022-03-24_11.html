     Mayor Eric Adams officially changes vaccine mandate, Kyrie Irving to play home games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement Brooklyn Nets fans — as well as New York Mets and Yankee fans — have been waiting for became a reality Thursday morning.
The Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, officially lifted the private sector vaccination mandate for professional athletes and performers in local venues.
This is about putting New York City base performers on a level playing field,” said Adams at the press conference held at Citi Field Thursday morning.
We’re expanding it to residents of New York City.
On Tuesday, the mayor suggested that the Nets, Mets and Yankees and their fans would “have to wait” till the science supported any change.

     Summary: Adams said the decision was not driven by external pressure but because of the desire to improve New York’s economy.
Adams again encouraged Irving and all other New York athletes to get vaccinated and boosted, saying his feelings had not changed on that subject despite the exemption.
NYC Mayor Eric Adams has officially expanded the city's vaccine mandate exemption for athletes and performers:"We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams?
Earlier this month, he lifted a vaccine mandate for citizens attending entertainment venues, eating indoors at restaurants and using fitness centers.
In New York City, 86 percent of the citywide population has received at least one vaccine dose and 78 percent is fully vaccinated.

"I said we have to wait," Adams said Thursday.
Adams' administration had already lifted the Key2NYC mandate; it is now making Irving and other unvaccinated performers exempt from a different mandate, which covers private businesses.
Toronto is the one NBA city where Irving remains ineligible to play.

     Summary: We're doing it because the city has to function," Adams said at a news conference at the New York Mets' Citi Field.
The city already had allowed an exception for non-New York City resident entertainers and professional athletes.
The announcement also comes before the start of Major League Baseball's season, allowing unvaccinated Mets and Yankees players to play upcoming home games as well.
At Thursday's news conference, Yankees president Randy Levine said a "few" of his team's players were unvaccinated.
We applaud the mayor for listening to the concerns of our New York teams, players, fans and communities and for leveling the playing field for home teams and their opponents."

     Summary: National Basketball Association Kyrie Irving cleared to play home games after vaccine mandate is lifted 16 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThe wait to see Kyrie Irving play at Barclays Center is coming to an end.
After being barred from playing in home games this season due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19, the New York City private-sector mandate is being lifted, clearing the way for Irving to play in games in Brooklyn.
Due to the vaccine mandate, the seven-time NBA All-Star guard has only appeared in 19 games this year, all of them coming on the road.
"It certainly changes my opinion of the Nets, because without Kyrie playing home games, they had absolutely no chance of getting out of the East.
Irving is not the only athlete who would benefit from the private sector vaccine mandate being lifted.

     Summary: Kyrie Irving never changed his mind.
The question now: How large a role can Kyrie play in getting the Nets out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves?
He’s shooting just under 53 percent on 2-pointers, on one of the toughest diets of interior shots you’ll ever see from a guard.
The most frequently used five-man lineup on the Nets that features Irving also featured the now-departed Harden; no.
After months of drama, it’s still all about Kyrie Irving.
