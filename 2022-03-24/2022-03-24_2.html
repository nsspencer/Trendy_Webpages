He followed that up by putting the exclamation point on the 2-0 qualifying win on Nov. 16, 2021 in Cincinnati.

     USA vs Mexico: Looking at One of Soccer's Biggest Rivalries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Contentious HistoryGames between Mexico and the USA date back to World Cup qualifying in 1934, when the first international soccer match was played between the two countries.
While Donovan retired from the national team in 2014, the heat from the incident can still be felt when Mexico hosts the USA.
The game is not just a soccer match, but a microcosm for the tensions between the neighboring countries.
They have only won one friendly at the stadium and have never won a major qualifying match there.
The odds are against us getting something out of this game,” USA head coach Greg Berhalter said.

     USA vs. Mexico: Who won the last match in World Cup qualifying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Men’s National Team will face off against Mexico for the second time in 2022 World Cup qualifying play, as the Americans will travel to Mexico City for a tough match at Estadio Azteca.
This match kicks off the last set of qualifiers for both sides, with just three left to play in order to secure a berth into the World Cup in Qatar this November.
Thursday’s match should be an interesting one, considering that the Americans have never won a WCQ match at Estadio Azteca.
It’ll be their first trip to that stadium since June of 2017 when they earned a 1-1 draw in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.
Ultimately, the Americans missed out on the 2018 World Cup, but they’ll hope to be singing a different tune after these final matches are complete.

     USA 0, Mexico 0: USMNT holds on for draw despite Pefok miss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The result ended the U.S.’s three-game winning streak against Mexico, but serves both teams well after Panama’s draw vs. Honduras earlier in the night.
It also marks the third straight World Cup qualifier at the Azteca in which the U.S. has taken a point off Mexico.
His free kick—taken from a similar spot as his free kick that led to the Gold Cup-winning goal—sailed harmlessly through the Mexico box, though, letting El Tri off easy.
Yedlin countered with a hard tackle of his own a few minutes later, and it came at a big price.
Minutes later, Pulisic came off for Jordan Morris, with Berhalter staying true to his pregame word that he would use all five substitutes.

     Summary: It was a sloppy, tense and physical match, one where both teams had quality chances.
Mexico had 63 percent of the ball but recorded an xG of just 0.40 on 11 shots.
His positioning was superb, often applying pressure at the top of the box when Mexico were overly patient.
He made the Mexican defenders look silly, broke ankles along the way and produced a highlight USMNT fans will watch for years to come.
Here is that moment:On top of that, he should have had an assist for that smart pass to Pefok that was just butchered.
