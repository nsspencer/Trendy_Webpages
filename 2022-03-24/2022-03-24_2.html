     Portugal 3-1 Turkey LIVE! Nunes goal - World Cup play-off result, match stream and latest updates today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: P ortugal vs Turkey LIVE!
Portugal moved one step closer to reaching the World Cup with a 3-1 win over Turkey, whose striker Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full-time that would have drawn the sides level in their playoff semi-final.
But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counter attack.
After missing out on automatic qualification in November, they will now host North Macedonia on Tuesday with the winner qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
