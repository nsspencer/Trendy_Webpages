     Duke downs Texas Tech, sends Coach K's farewell tour to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rugged Texas Tech Red Raiders had dictated the tempo throughout the first half of their NCAA Tournament West Regional semifinal and were continuing to impose their will.
The Blue Devils were fortunate the deficit wasn’t bigger, but it would surely grow if something didn’t change.
On Saturday, the second-seeded Blue Devils will face No.
The Blue Devils played zone for only about seven minutes, and it wasn’t all that effective until they tightened it enough to keep third-seeded Texas Tech from beating them with cuts to the basket.
Duke shot 71% in the final 20 minutes, the highest this season against Texas Tech.

     Duke Blue Devils outlast Texas Tech as Mike Krzyzewski returns to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late in the second half, Duke freshman Paolo Banchero (22 points) countered Texas Tech guard Kevin McCullar's 3-pointer with a shot from beyond the arc that gave the Blue Devils a 69-68 lead with 2:57 to play.
Mark Williams (16 points, eight rebounds) played above the rim in the second half.
On top of that, Texas Tech was a trendy pick to stop Duke.
When Duke went to a zone defense in the second half, it seemed to slow Texas Tech, making it more timid as it tried to process the change.
Texas Tech shot 33% from the field against the zone Thursday compared with 44% against man-to-man defense.

     Duke, Coach K on brink of Final Four after gutsy win vs Texas Tech

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke 78, Texas Tech 73, was Coach K’s 100th NCAA tournament win—by far the most in history—and it was some of his better work.
One line on the Duke scouting report against Texas Tech read thusly: “12 defense if necessary.”“And it was necessary,” Krzyzewski said afterward.
The player empowerment piece came with 2:54 remaining and Texas Tech beginning to figure out the Duke zone for the second time.
They all said it, and they said it with enthusiasm.”Thursday’s win over Texas Tech showed off what’s made Coach K so good in his career.
He followed a 15-point performance against the Tigers with another one against Texas Tech, making three big baskets in the final four minutes—none of them easy.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Mike Krzyzewski has spent more than four decades at Duke telling his players what to do, with championship-level results.
Duke played from behind for much of the first half but was much sharper offensively in the second half.
Griffin tied the game at 47 with his third 3-pointer and Banchero followed with a jumper that gave Duke the lead.
Bryson Williams scored 21 points to lead Texas Tech and McCullar added 17.
The official ruled for the ball to go back to Texas Tech but Krzyzewski jokingly signaledfor a block on the referee instead.

But Texas Tech adjusted during a timeout and began working the ball around and through the zone to score.
McCullar scored seven consecutive Texas Tech points as the Red Raiders built a 56-52 lead with 9:24 left.
