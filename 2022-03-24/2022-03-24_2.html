     Italy misses World Cup again after loss to North Macedonia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Italy will miss the World Cup for the second straight time after a massive qualifying playoff round upset at the hands of North Macedonia.
Just nine months removed from winning the Euros, Italy suffered yet another national disgrace on the World Cup stage after missing out in 2018.
The defeat was Italy’s first World Cup qualifying loss on home soil ever after previously going 48-0-11.
Yet despite outshooting North Macedonia 32–4, Italy only managed five shots on target in Palermo against a stalwart defensive effort from the visitors.
North Macedonia made headlines a year ago by handing Germany its first World Cup qualifying defeat since 2001, breaking the 2014 world champion’s 35-match unbeaten streak in World Cup qualifiers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aleksandar Trajkovski nets the breakaway goal in stoppage time as North Macedonia goes on to defeat Italy 1-0 in their World Cup qualifying match.
(1:00)Italy will miss out on the World Cup for the second successive tournament after the Euro 2020 winners were stunned by a stoppage-time winner from North Macedonia in Thursday's playoff semifinal in Palermo.
The victory means North Macedonia, ranked 60 places below Italy in the FIFA rankings, will now take on Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo in the playoff final on Tuesday with a place in Qatar on the line.
After 30 minutes of dominating without seriously threatening the North Macedonian goal, Italy were gifted a glorious chance to take the lead.
And some inspired North Macedonia defending thwarted the hosts with a series of blocks and clearances.

     World Cup roundup: Italy knocked out by North Macedonia in dramatic finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.
Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.
Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance.
But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.

     Live updates: U.S., Mexico scoreless early in World Cup qualifier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S., Mexico soccer to play World Cup qualifier at Azteca, possibly for last timeMEXICO CITY — There is no more difficult place for the U.S. national team to play than Estadio Azteca, Mexico’s iconic fortress home and the largest soccer stadium in Latin America.
“The last time we played, we had players very ill after the game,” said Bruce Arena, who coached the U.S. in three World Cup qualifiers at Azteca without winning a game.
The duel could soon lose some of its luster if that game proves to be the last one the teams play in Mexico City during World Cup qualifying.
Both countries, along with Canada, are expected to get automatic berths in the 2026 tournament since they’re hosting it, precluding a qualifying tournament.
And by 2030, with the World Cup field at 48 teams and the number of guaranteed CONCACAF entrants doubling to six, the current qualifying format will have to change.
