     USA Earns Draw Versus Mexico in WC Qualifiers at Estadio Azteca
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The USMNT were denied their first win at Estadio Azteca in a World Cup Qualifier, drawing 0-0 with Mexico and stepping closer to qualification for Qatar 2022.
The draw means USA and Mexico remain in second and third place respectively behind Canada for the World Cup Qualifiers, placing extra pressure on each nation's next matches.
USA’s trip to face Mexico at Estadio Azteca started in a typically tense fashion, as both teams were locked in a 0-0 struggle for the entirety of the first half.
Pulisic, who famously dissed Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa with his famous ‘man in the mirror’ goal, scuffed the ball into Ochoa as the match stayed level.
Ochoa’s success in stopping Pulisic continued into the second half when he parried another shot from the Chelsea forward in the 49th minute.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US men’s national team are still winless in World Cup qualifiers at Estadio Azteca but picked up a valuable point Thursday night in a 0-0 draw with Mexico.
The pivotal moment of the scoreless first half came in the 35th minute when Timothy Weah picked out a wide-open Christian Pulisic in front of goal.
But the Chelsea attacker had his attempt from just outside the six-yard box saved by Memo Ochoa.
Pulisic put another attempt on frame four minutes into the second half after being played through by Kellyn Acosta, but Ochoa parried that away.
Reyna played a first-time pass across goal to Jordan Pefok, yet the striker's attempt was scuffed.

    </h2>

     Summary: For the second time in a row Italy won't be part of the World Cup.
Italy became arrogant, thinking that after winning Euros qualifying for the World Cup would take care of itself.
Roberto Mancini even after all his good work still failed to bring Italy back to the World Cup.
Sadly, the new cycle the World Cup cycle that started in 2017 after the last failure, concluded with the same result, Euro glory notwithstanding.
Italy won't play in a World Cup for at least twelve years and we are talking about the country with the second most World Cup wins in the world with four.
