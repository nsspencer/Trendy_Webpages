     The Batman deleted scene with Barry Keoghan’s Joker has been released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Batman deleted scene featuring Barry Keoghan’s Joker has finally been released.
The five-minute scene sees Robert Pattinson’s Batman, in desperate need of help in catching Paul Dano’s Riddler, going to visit the Joker in Arkham.
In case you needed convincing, Keoghan’s Joker is as menacing and creepy as you could imagine – and has us hoping he’ll be at least one of The Batman 2’s villains.
Director Matt Reeves previously revealed to Total Film why the scene was left on the cutting room floor.
But as a standalone, that scene is very eerie and creepy and cool," Reeves explained.

If anything we’re excited to see more of Keoghan’s take on the character, who serves as a Hannibal Lecter for Bats here.
We’re definitely getting a bit of Lee Bermejo Joker in the look, by way of New 52's face mutilation.
