     Duke basketball: Jayson Tatum predicts how far Blue Devils will advance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke basketball: Keys to victory in Sweet 16 against Texas Tech by Kevin ConnellyJayson Tatum predicted how far the Duke basketball team will advance in the NCAA Tournament.
March Madness brackets aren’t for everyone, but former Duke basketball forward Jayson Tatum already knows who his champion is.
We’re gonna keep them waiting,” Tatum told Jason Jordan of Sports Illustrated.
“That is why you go to Duke,” Tatum said.
Tipoff between Duke and Texas Tech is slated for approximately 9:39 p.m. EST from the Chase Center in San Francisco, California.

     Duke downs Texas Tech, sends Coach K's farewell tour to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday, the second-seeded Blue Devils will face No.
Banchero and Williams combined for 38 points, imposing their size against a Red Raiders team that had allowed an opponent as many as 70 points only twice this season.
Only one of Duke’s starters, junior forward Wendell Moore, has played more than two seasons of college basketball.
The Red Raiders promptly launched a 7-0 run from that point but failed to capitalize on holding the Blue Devils to 2-for-12 shooting the rest of the half.
A renewed emphasis on taking advantage of their superior size, especially the combination of Banchero and Williams, fueled the comeback victory.

     Prop bets for Duke men's basketball vs. Texas Tech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blue Devils and Krzyzewski said that they started at 0-0 when they began play in the NCAA tournament.
The Blue Devils may have fallen during critical games this year, but the match against Texas Tech and its mighty defense will bring something different.
The second-seeded Blue Devils can’t run their typical gameplan—instead, watch out for a lot of strategy and longer offensive possessions coming from these Blue Devils.
The Blue Devils' defense will also have to keep the Red Raiders on their toes to prevent any extended scoring runs.
If Duke can control the pace and ignite the offense in the Chase Center Thursday, it's likely that Duke can push Texas Tech toward the over.

     Summary: There’s no guarantee that Duke will win Saturday, let alone win it all.
But what we saw in this 78-73 win over Texas Tech is a team growing up in real time and reaching for championship form.
Let’s go back to Texas Tech.
Because Texas Tech is that good.
And of course, Coach K’s career will last at least one more game as Duke advances to the Elite Eight to take on the Razorbacks Saturday.

"Adams' defense is most known for its switching and not allowing teams to get the ball into the paint.
The same might be said for Texas Tech.
