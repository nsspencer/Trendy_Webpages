     Duke Blue Devils outlast Texas Tech as Mike Krzyzewski returns to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late in the second half, Duke freshman Paolo Banchero (22 points) countered Texas Tech guard Kevin McCullar's 3-pointer with a shot from beyond the arc that gave the Blue Devils a 69-68 lead with 2:57 to play.
Mark Williams (16 points, eight rebounds) played above the rim in the second half.
On top of that, Texas Tech was a trendy pick to stop Duke.
When Duke went to a zone defense in the second half, it seemed to slow Texas Tech, making it more timid as it tried to process the change.
Texas Tech shot 33% from the field against the zone Thursday compared with 44% against man-to-man defense.

     Summary: The rugged Texas Tech Red Raiders had dictated the tempo throughout the first half of their NCAA Tournament West Regional semifinal and were continuing to impose their will.
The Blue Devils were fortunate the deficit wasn’t bigger, but it would surely grow if something didn’t change.
On Saturday, the second-seeded Blue Devils will face No.
The Blue Devils played zone for only about seven minutes, and it wasn’t all that effective until they tightened it enough to keep third-seeded Texas Tech from beating them with cuts to the basket.
Duke shot 71% in the final 20 minutes, the highest this season against Texas Tech.

     Summary: The victory marks Krzyzewski's 100th career NCAA Tournament win, and Saturday will mark his 17th Elite Eight appearance.
But no one scored more points against Texas Tech in a regulation game this season than Duke just did.
He's reached double figures in all three NCAA Tournament games and emerged as a go-to option for the Blue Devils in late-game situations.
The Razorbacks don't have quite the defensive reputation of Texas Tech, but they are getting pretty close.
If the Blue Devils can answer the bell offensively once again, they will have earned their trip to the Final Four.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here was the situation Thursday night, the minutes growing more precious: Texas Tech, the No.
2 seed but an underdog on this night, nonetheless, kept taking the lead and Texas Tech kept taking it back — tug-of-war or a prizefight or a pick-your-cliche descriptor.
Texas Tech went ahead and then Duke went back ahead, on a Paolo Banchero 3-pointer that was as cold as any either team made.
Duke shot better than 70 percent from the field during the final 20 minutes and the Blue Devils made their final eight shots from the field.
To hear Banchero tell it after the Blue Devils emerged victorious, he and his teammates never lost faith in Roach.
