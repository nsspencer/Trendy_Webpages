     Duke downs Texas Tech, sends Coach K's farewell tour to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday, the second-seeded Blue Devils will face No.
Banchero and Williams combined for 38 points, imposing their size against a Red Raiders team that had allowed an opponent as many as 70 points only twice this season.
Only one of Duke’s starters, junior forward Wendell Moore, has played more than two seasons of college basketball.
The Red Raiders promptly launched a 7-0 run from that point but failed to capitalize on holding the Blue Devils to 2-for-12 shooting the rest of the half.
A renewed emphasis on taking advantage of their superior size, especially the combination of Banchero and Williams, fueled the comeback victory.

     Summary: Duke defeated Texas Tech 78-73 Thursday night to advance to the Elite Eight, where they’ll play Arkansas Saturday.
Duke shot lights out down the stretch, making big shot after big shot and they needed every single one of them.
After a brief Duke lead the Red Raiders methodically built their lead back to 33-26, with a minute left in the half as Duke again went cold from the field.
When you’re out there, you’re not even thinking, you’re just playing to win and you’re playing extremely hard.
When you’re doing that and you’re not afraid of the moment as a team you’re going to do stuff like that.”Duke went back to man-to-man for the final few minutes.

     How Duke fans took over this San Francisco sports bar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both found themselves facing a similar problem: There wasn’t a consistent and enjoyable way to watch Duke men’s basketball.
The reputation of the bar grew in such a way that planned Facebook events weren’t needed to get alumni over there.
It even made its way to each new wave of grads who moved out to San Francisco.
It was that game specifically that made Stokes realize that Northstar’s reputation as The Duke Bar of San Francisco was here to stay.
The organization has already done its part in sending swag over to the bar and giving it the air of legitimacy to truly cement its name as San Francisco’s Duke Bar.

     Duke vs. Texas Tech score, takeaways: Blue Devils advance to Elite Eight to extend Coach K's career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The victory marks Krzyzewski's 100th career NCAA Tournament win, and Saturday will mark his 17th Elite Eight appearance.
But no one scored more points against Texas Tech in a regulation game this season than Duke just did.
He's reached double figures in all three NCAA Tournament games and emerged as a go-to option for the Blue Devils in late-game situations.
The Razorbacks don't have quite the defensive reputation of Texas Tech, but they are getting pretty close.
If the Blue Devils can answer the bell offensively once again, they will have earned their trip to the Final Four.
