     The Batman deleted scene with Barry Keoghan’s Joker has been released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Batman deleted scene featuring Barry Keoghan’s Joker has finally been released.
The five-minute scene sees Robert Pattinson’s Batman, in desperate need of help in catching Paul Dano’s Riddler, going to visit the Joker in Arkham.
In case you needed convincing, Keoghan’s Joker is as menacing and creepy as you could imagine – and has us hoping he’ll be at least one of The Batman 2’s villains.
Director Matt Reeves previously revealed to Total Film why the scene was left on the cutting room floor.
But as a standalone, that scene is very eerie and creepy and cool," Reeves explained.

     THE BATMAN Deleted Scene Fully Reveals Barry Keoghan’s Joker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And now, the site’s led to a deleted scene from the movie.
This deleted The Batman scene fully reveals Barry Keoghan’s Joker.
While we only got a glimpse of the actor’s heavily shielded face inside an Arkham Asylum cell for a single scene, this deleted scene treats us to a whole lot more.
And this clip gives us five whole minutes of Robert Pattinson’s Batman going toe-to-toe with Keoghan’s Joker.
But in this deleted scene we get a better look at the Joker, even if it’s still a bit blurred and shadowed.

Playing as Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, Robert Pattinson’s Batman approaches the Joker for some assistance with Gotham foe The Riddler (Paul Dano).

     ‘The Batman’ Releases Deleted Joker Scene With Barry Keoghan and Robert Pattinson
    </h2>

     Summary: “The Batman” director Matt Reeves released a deleted scene from his superhero epic on Thursday featuring Robert Pattinson’s Caped Crusader facing off against his classic nemesis, the Joker, played by Barry Keoghan.
Unnerved by the Riddler’s interest in him, Batman decides to seek out insight into what makes the Riddler tick.
“Almost our anniversary, isn’t it?” Joker tells Batman in the scene.
“I think somewhere, deep down, you’re just terrified, because you’re not sure he’s wrong,” Joker says, dissolving into cackles.
