     Duke downs Texas Tech, sends Coach K's farewell tour to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rugged Texas Tech Red Raiders had dictated the tempo throughout the first half of their NCAA Tournament West Regional semifinal and were continuing to impose their will.
The Blue Devils were fortunate the deficit wasn’t bigger, but it would surely grow if something didn’t change.
On Saturday, the second-seeded Blue Devils will face No.
The Blue Devils played zone for only about seven minutes, and it wasn’t all that effective until they tightened it enough to keep third-seeded Texas Tech from beating them with cuts to the basket.
Duke shot 71% in the final 20 minutes, the highest this season against Texas Tech.

     Duke Blue Devils outlast Texas Tech as Mike Krzyzewski returns to Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Duke vs. Texas Tech score, takeaways: Blue Devils advance to Elite Eight to extend Coach K's career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The victory marks Krzyzewski's 100th career NCAA Tournament win, and Saturday will mark his 17th Elite Eight appearance.
But no one scored more points against Texas Tech in a regulation game this season than Duke just did.
He's reached double figures in all three NCAA Tournament games and emerged as a go-to option for the Blue Devils in late-game situations.
The Razorbacks don't have quite the defensive reputation of Texas Tech, but they are getting pretty close.
If the Blue Devils can answer the bell offensively once again, they will have earned their trip to the Final Four.
