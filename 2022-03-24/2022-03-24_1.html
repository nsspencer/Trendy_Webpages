    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aleksandar Trajkovski nets the breakaway goal in stoppage time as North Macedonia goes on to defeat Italy 1-0 in their World Cup qualifying match.
(1:00)Italy will miss out on the World Cup for the second successive tournament after the Euro 2020 winners were stunned by a stoppage-time winner from North Macedonia in Thursday's playoff semifinal in Palermo.
The victory means North Macedonia, ranked 60 places below Italy in the FIFA rankings, will now take on Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo in the playoff final on Tuesday with a place in Qatar on the line.
After 30 minutes of dominating without seriously threatening the North Macedonian goal, Italy were gifted a glorious chance to take the lead.
And some inspired North Macedonia defending thwarted the hosts with a series of blocks and clearances.

     Summary: With the 2022 FIFA World Cup just around the corner in Qatar, CONCACAF’s final round of qualifying is coming to a close with one last window of matches for each team.
Panama sits with 17 points in fourth place, followed closely by USA’s final opponent Costa Rica, in fifth place with 16 points.
It’s far from an easy place to play, as the USMNT has never won a World Cup Qualifier there.
USA hasn’t been there since June 2017, when they earned a draw in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign.
The final matches get underway with USMNT v. Mexico on Thursday, March 24 at 10:00 p.m.
