     Male Birth Control Explained As New Pill 99 Percent Effective in Mice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A team of scientists has made headlines after stating that an in-development male birth control compound has been 99 percent effective in animal tests.
The search for a male birth control pill has been going on for decades but none have been made available yet.
One type of hormonal male birth control pill, 11-beta-methyl-19-nortestosterone dodecylcarbonate, works by reducing levels of hormones required for sperm production.
Another type of pill called DMA undecanoate, which also works by suppressing male hormones to decrease production of sperm, is also under investigation.
ADAM is a birth control method being investigated by medical device company Contraline.

     Scientists close to producing male contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy in women
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), contraceptive pills, patches are available to women who do not want pregnancy, men have been limited to condoms and an irreversible vasectomy.
The male birth control pill will enable men to share the burden of contraception with their partners without causing permanent damage.
Devising a new method with reduced risks, Mr Noman developed a non-hormonal pill, YCT529, to temporarily attack sperm cells in males.
“We wanted to develop a non-hormonal male contraceptive to avoid these side effects,” explained Mr Noman.
Four to six weeks after being taken off the pill, the mice were again able to father mouse pups.

     Male Contraceptive Pill Found 99% Effective In Mice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A team of scientists said Wednesday they had developed a male oral contraceptive that was 99 percent effective in mice and didn't cause observable side effects, with the drug expected to enter human trials by the end of this year.
The female pill uses hormones to disrupt the menstrual cycle, and historic efforts to develop a male equivalent targeted the male sex hormone testosterone.
When administered orally to male mice for four weeks, YCT529 drastically reduced sperm counts and was 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy in a mating trial.
A persistent question about future male contraceptive pills has been whether women will trust men to use them.
"Male contraceptives will add to the method mix, providing new options that allow men and women to contribute in whatever way they deem appropriate to contraceptive use," argues the nonprofit Male Contraceptive Initiative, which engages in fundraising and advocacy.

     Male Birth Control Pill 99% Effective on Mice Looks Set for Human Trials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scientists at the University of Minnesota have found a male birth control pill safe and effective in mice.
Advertisement“Most female birth control pills work on the female sex hormones,” said Abdullah al Noman, one of the researchers, noting the lack of approved male oral contraceptive on the market.
“Men are less willing to take a birth control pill that has significant side effects.
The researchers found that knocking out the RAR-α gene in male mice made them infertile.
Crucially, the male mice became fertile again after four to six weeks of being taken off YCT529.

     Summary: Male contraceptive pill won't replace female pill says expertSUBSCRIBE Invalid email Sign up HERE for science breakthroughs in health, business and more that matter We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
More infoAt present, the burden of birth control typically falls on women — a societal imbalance that is arguably reinforced by the fact that they have more available forms of birth control.
Accordingly, there is much interest in an effective, long-lasting yet reversible contraceptive for men that is analogous to the birth control pill available to women.
Previous studies have shown that “knocking out” the gene which encodes for RAR-α in male mice renders them sterile, with no obvious side effects.
Other research teams have successfully developed an orally-administered compound that inhibits all three retinoic acid receptors (RAR-α, -β and -γ) and thereby causes reversible sterility in male mice.
