     World Cup Qualifiers: Portugal and Italy can write off Turkey and North Macedonia at their peril
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Portugal boss Fernando Santos did not mince his words when describing the undoubted magnitude of their World Cup play-off semi-final against Turkey.
We must be in the World Cup for our people,' he said.
The wins demonstrate they are not a goal-shy side, having netted in every one of their World Cup 2022 qualifiers to date.
They have lost just one of their last seven World Cup qualifying matches, and have kept four clean sheets in that period too.
Even their last match on Italian soil went well in a 1-1 draw during qualification for the World Cup in Russia four years ago.
