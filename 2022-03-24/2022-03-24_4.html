We’re gonna keep them waiting,” Tatum told Jason Jordan of Sports Illustrated.
“That is why you go to Duke,” Tatum said.
Tipoff between Duke and Texas Tech is slated for approximately 9:39 p.m. EST from the Chase Center in San Francisco, California.

     Prop bets for Duke men's basketball vs. Texas Tech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blue Devils and Krzyzewski said that they started at 0-0 when they began play in the NCAA tournament.
The Blue Devils may have fallen during critical games this year, but the match against Texas Tech and its mighty defense will bring something different.
The second-seeded Blue Devils can’t run their typical gameplan—instead, watch out for a lot of strategy and longer offensive possessions coming from these Blue Devils.
The Blue Devils' defense will also have to keep the Red Raiders on their toes to prevent any extended scoring runs.
If Duke can control the pace and ignite the offense in the Chase Center Thursday, it's likely that Duke can push Texas Tech toward the over.
