     Halo Star Pablo Schreiber Wants To Play This Iconic Character In The MCU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview with the Bingeworthy podcast (via The Playlist), Pablo Schreiber revealed that he'd jump at the chance to play Wolverine.
But when it comes to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Schreiber revealed that he's met with the studio a few times over the years.
I've had a long, long flirtation with that guy."
Obviously, this isn't confirmation that Schreiber is all set to play Wolverine in the MCU, though his enthusiasm will definitely go a long way with fans.
"Halo" proves the star can handle an iconic, action-heavy role, so he may well be in the running to play Wolverine, even though it'll probably be quite some time before Kevin Feige reveals his plans for the X-Men.

     Halo Star And Proud Canadian Pablo Schreiber Wants To Play Wolverine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, being Canadian, Schreiber did talk about the famous Canadian mutant Wolverine, a role he seems enthusiastic about.
While Schreiber seems like a good enough choice — he is fit, looks rough and grizzled, plus he is indeed Canadian — he faces the same problem Jackman did: he is just too darn tall!
Schreiber is even taller than Jackman, who was already way taller than how most fans see the character.
Sure, Jackman was able to make the role his own despite the height difference, and Schreiber could very well do the same, but maybe it's best to look for someone a bit more screen accurate?
In the meantime, you can catch Schreiber as Master Chief in the "Halo" show, now streaming on Paramount+.

     Summary: The Halo TV show is out on Paramount+ today (24 March), but we in the UK will have to wait until the summer to receive the streaming service.
If you've not seen the trailer for the new Halo TV show you can catch your first glimpse here.
In particular Schreiber seems set on the role of regenerative, metal skeleton owner, Wolverine, saying that him and Marvel "flirted with that one for a while."
We've never been able to find the right thing at the right time, but I'd certainly be open to that.
He's actually my favorite hero, from a child he was always my favorite comic book.

     Halo Star Pablo Schreiber Really Wants To Be MCU's Wolverine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to cast its Wolverine and Halo star Pablo Schreiber really wants to play the famous mutant.
This reverted the X-Men movie rights to Marvel Studios in 2019, setting up an MCU reboot of these characters, Wolverine included.
Marvel Studios hasn't officially confirmed what their plans look like for their X-Men franchise.
In doing so, the MCU will have a younger actor who can play Wolverine for the next decade or so.
However, Schreiber is also taller than Jackman, so those who want a short Wolverine in the MCU could be slightly disappointed.
