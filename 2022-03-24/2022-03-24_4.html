     Summary: Jaylin Williams came to play against the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the NCAA tournament.
The Arkansas Razorbacks forward threw down an absolutely spectacular dunk in his squad's Sweet 16 matchup against Gonzaga on Thursday night.
JD Notae managed to draw two defenders on a pass, leaving Williams free to dash toward the rim.
While Gonzaga was down 32-29 going into the second half, it's familiar territory for the Bulldogs in this tournament.
It remains to be seen whether they can keep up that second half surge against Arkansas.

     Summary: Arkansas defeated the Gonzaga Bulldogs 74-68 in Thursday's Sweet 16 showdown in the 2022 NCAA men's basketball tournament at the Chase Center in San Francisco.
It was quite the statement from the underdogs, who were in control throughout the second half and never faltered in the face of pressure.
1 overall seed with plenty of star power in Timme, Holmgren and Nembhard.
Perhaps sensing the moment, Holmgren wasted little time making his presence felt in the second half with soft touch from beyond the arc and the mid-range.
While a desperation three from Nembhard temporarily cut the lead to three, the Bulldogs were outplayed the entire second half.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Top-ranked Gonzaga, which hoped to ride its high-flying offense to its first national championship, was stopped short of that goal with a 74-68 loss to No.
4 Arkansas on Thursday night in a West Regional semifinal.
As their struggles intensified, the Zags pressed — fumbling passes, hurrying shots and wearing the frustration on their faces.
Andrew Nembhard knocked in a 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left to bring Gonzaga within 68-65, the closest the Zags had been since early in the second half.
But Arkansas made its free throws and Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.

     Summary: Thursday night, however, Musselman found success in the Bay Area when he led his Arkansas squad to a 74-68 upset of Gonzaga, the top overall seed in the NCAA tournament and last year's national runner-up.
Arkansas is headed to the Elite Eight for the second year in a row but just the third time since 1995.
After ousting Gonzaga, Musselman kept the focus on his players, praising them for grinding out a tough, physical game plan for all 40 minutes.
Gonzaga made things interesting late, getting within three when Andrew Nembhard hit a 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds to play.
A pump-fake 3-pointer with 6:33 to play in the game extended Arkansas' lead to nine points.
