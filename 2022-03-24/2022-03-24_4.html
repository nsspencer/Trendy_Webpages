     Soccer – Portugal survive late drama to beat Turkey in World Cup playoff semi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Burak Yilmaz goal in 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
Defender Jose Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty but Yilmaz fired his effort high over the bar.
Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes then relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counter attack.
Portugal started strongly, scoring twice in the first half with the result looking like a foregone conclusion going into the break.
But Portugal took their foot off the gas in the second half and allowed the visitors to get into the game.

     Summary: Think North Macedonia will be easy?
Ask Italy, who will now miss a second consecutive World Cup after losing 1-0 to the rank outsiders in Palermo on Thursday.
Portugal made it through to their date with World Cup destiny without Ronaldo adding to his world-record tally of 115 international goals.
Cristiano Ronaldo was kept off the score sheet, yet Portugal still found a way to beat Turkey in their World Cup qualifying semifinal playoff.
Ronaldo is now part of a team rather than the heartbeat of it, and Portugal are a stronger unit as a result.
