     Italy out of World Cup 2022, Portugal to face North Macedonia: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Macedonia will play Portugal for a place in the 2022 World Cup after beating Italy 1-0.
Roberto Mancini's side dominated the game and registered 32 shots but they ultimately could not find the back of the net.
