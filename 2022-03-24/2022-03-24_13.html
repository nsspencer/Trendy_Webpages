     Marquez Valdes-Scantling Inks three-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chiefs have signed Valdes-Scantling to a three-year deal, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.
Per the report, the speedster's three-year pact is worth up to $36 million.
Following the trade of Tyreek Hill, it was clear that the Chiefs needed to fortify their wideout corps, and adding Valdes-Scantling to the mix is a step in the right direction.
The 27-year-old, who caught 26 of his 55 targets for 430 yards and three TDs in 11 games with Green Bay last season, will bring a field-stretching element to a Kansas City wide receiver depth chart that also includes JuJu Smith-Schuster and Mecole Hardman, with further depth likely to arrive via free agency and/or the 2022 NFL Draft.

     Summary: GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers made a last-minute run at re-signing free agent receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling, but he decided to accept a better offer.
Valdes-Scantling will be signing a three-year, $30 million deal with the Kansas City Chiefs, a source confirmed Thursday.
The move will help the Chiefs offset the loss of Tyreek Hill in a trade with the Miami Dolphins.
The Packers were just barely under the cap and would have had trouble signing anyone before the Adams deal surfaced.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Chiefs have started their work to replace receiver Tyreek Hill.
According to multiple reports, former Green Bay receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling is signing with Kansas City on a three-year $30 million contract that can escalate to $36 million.
Valdes-Scantling took a free-agent visit with the Chiefs on Wednesday and apparently liked what he heard.
It will be practically impossible for the Chiefs to replace Hill, one of the league’s best receivers, with just one player.
But Valdes-Scantling at least has a track record of performance with one of the game’s other elite quarterbacks.

     Summary: Robert Griffin III explains why he still wants the Chiefs to draft a receiver after signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling and specifically mentions North Dakota State's Christian Watson.
(0:57)The Kansas City Chiefs added a veteran wide receiver to their roster on Thursday, a day after trading star wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling signed a contract with the Chiefs, the team announced.
For the Packers, it's another wide receiver the team will have to replace after trading star wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders last week.
After playing in every game over his first three seasons, Valdes-Scantling missed six games last season: five because of a hamstring injury and one because of COVID-19.

     Chiefs To Sign WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling

     Summary: Barely a day after they traded Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins, the Chiefs will sign one of the top wide receivers remaining on the market.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling is committing to Kansas City on a three-year deal, Tom Pelissero of NFL.com tweets.
The Chiefs will save quite a bit of money with this receiver commitment, compared to what they would have paid Hill.
The difference in the Chiefs and Dolphins’ offers was notable, Drew Rosenhaus said (via the Miami Herald’s Barry Jackson, on Twitter).
Valdes-Scantling visited Kansas City on Wednesday, shortly after the news broke Hill was being granted permission to seek a trade.

     Going deep: 10 potential replacements for Marquez Valdes-Scantling in 2022 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Marquez Valdes-Scantling signing a new deal with the Kansas City Chiefs, the Green Bay Packers will be in the market for a new vertical threat.
It was clear that the Packers missed Valdes-Scantling’s speed and big-play ability on offense this past season.
Due to injuries, the man they call MVS played in just seven games.
A year removed from averaging 20.9 yards per catch, the Packers missed that world-class speed that helped open things up underneath for his teammates.
Luckily for Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst, the 2022 NFL draft has plenty of speed merchants that could help replace the former fifth-round pick in Green Bay’s offense.

     Summary: On the same day when Tyreek Hill was introduced as a Miami Dolphin, the Kansas City Chiefs are bringing in a reinforcement to help replace him.
The Chiefs are signing former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling to a three-year, $30 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday.
MVS will receive $18 million in the first two years of the contract, and the deal has incentives to reach a max of $36 million.
Valdes-Scantling doesn't have the accolades and statistics that Hill does, but he does have the wheels.
Hill, 28, departs Kansas City having earned six Pro Bowl selections, a Super Bowl title and four 1,000-yard seasons.
