     U.S. Faces Mexico With Simple Goal: ‘We Just Have to Qualify’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEXICO CITY — There is a tendency among professional athletes and coaches, when faced with the hype of high-stakes competition, to undersell the sense of occasion.
A big game, they might say, is in fact just another game.
Looking ahead at a stretch of daunting contests is futile; better to go one day at a time.
But when the United States men’s soccer team gathered this week in preparation for its final three qualification games for the 2022 World Cup, Coach Gregg Berhalter was uncharacteristically blunt with his staff.
“This is probably the biggest week of our lives as professional coaches,” Berhalter said he told them.

     Summary: The USMNT and Mexico national football team (El Tri) have had a number of now-iconic battles over the past few months.
But ahead of tonight’s massive World Cup qualifier, the excitement is at a boiling point.
With both teams automatically qualifying for the 2026 World Cup as host nations, this may be the last time the two arch-rivals play in a World Cup match.

Will the USMNT get a win over Mexico and get that much closer to World Cup qualification?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S., Mexico soccer to play World Cup qualifier at Azteca, possibly for last timeMEXICO CITY — There is no more difficult place for the U.S. national team to play than Estadio Azteca, Mexico’s iconic fortress home and the largest soccer stadium in Latin America.
“The last time we played, we had players very ill after the game,” said Bruce Arena, who coached the U.S. in three World Cup qualifiers at Azteca without winning a game.
The duel could soon lose some of its luster if that game proves to be the last one the teams play in Mexico City during World Cup qualifying.
Both countries, along with Canada, are expected to get automatic berths in the 2026 tournament since they’re hosting it, precluding a qualifying tournament.
And by 2030, with the World Cup field at 48 teams and the number of guaranteed CONCACAF entrants doubling to six, the current qualifying format will have to change.

     USA vs Mexico: Looking at One of Soccer's Biggest Rivalries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Contentious HistoryGames between Mexico and the USA date back to World Cup qualifying in 1934, when the first international soccer match was played between the two countries.
While Donovan retired from the national team in 2014, the heat from the incident can still be felt when Mexico hosts the USA.
The game is not just a soccer match, but a microcosm for the tensions between the neighboring countries.
They have only won one friendly at the stadium and have never won a major qualifying match there.
The odds are against us getting something out of this game,” USA head coach Greg Berhalter said.
