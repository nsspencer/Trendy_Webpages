During a March 23 appearance on The Late Late Show, the Lost City co-stars revealed that they first met in the principal's office of their daughters' preschool.
When host James Corden inquired about what took place, Channing said, "We have two very, very strong-willed little girls, you know, that at that young age were very much buttin' heads."
However, the principal said that they would give the girls a "challenge" to see who could be the nicest to the other person.
As part of one of their tasks, the Unforgivable star said the two girls were "bringing each other little Dixie cups of water."

     Review: Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum go enjoyably neo-screwball in ‘The Lost City’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Midway through the tomb-raiding, car-crashing, butt-baring shenanigans of “The Lost City,” Channing Tatum pauses to remind Sandra Bullock not to judge a book by its cover.
To Loretta, Alan is an incompetent himbo with delusions of grandeur and certainly the last fool she’d want to be stuck with on a wild and crazy jungle adventure.
I should note, however, that I may have committed an equivalent offense when I opted to check out “The Lost City”: The poster made it look kind of fun, and lo and behold, it is.

It also nudges “The Lost City” into a more pleasurably laid-back groove than you might expect.

     The Lost City review: Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum revive a near-dead genre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lost City doesn’t have the most exciting or novel plot, and it doesn’t push action filmmaking forward.
But the cast makes The Lost City stand out.
The Lost City gets a lot of mileage out of placing Bullock and Tatum in awkward but funny situations, as when she has to pull leeches off his butt.
And The Lost City does include one unfortunate stereotype: a sex-crazed Latin-lover character, who’s played for laughs without adding anything to the story.
The Lost City opens in theaters on March 24.
