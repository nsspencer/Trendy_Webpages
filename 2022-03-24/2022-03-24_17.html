     Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, exchanged texts with Mark Meadows about efforts to overturn the 2020 election

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Among Thomas' stated goals in the messages was for lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted incendiary and unsupported claims about the election, to become "the lead and the face" of Trump's legal team.
The messages were among the 2,320 text messages that Meadows provided the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The existence of messages between Thomas and Meadows — 21 sent by her; eight by him — have not previously been reported and were reviewed by CBS News and The Post.
They were then confirmed by five people who have seen the committee's documents.

     Ginni Thomas Pressed Trump’s Chief of Staff to Overturn 2020 Vote, Texts Show
    </h2>

     Summary: The text traffic also suggests that Ms. Thomas was in contact with Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser.
Sidney Powell, the lawyer advising Trump’s campaign team known for unleashing wild theories about voting fraud, comes up repeatedly.
On Nov. 13, for instance, Mr. Trump included Ms. Powell in a tweeted list of his team’s lawyers.
While Ms. Thomas already had access to the president, White House aides said her influence increased after Mr. Trump named Mr. Meadows chief of staff in March 2020.
Mr. Meadows is no longer cooperating with the committee; a lawyer for Mr. Meadows, George J. Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

CNN first reported that the panel was in possession of the text messages.
NBC News has not reviewed the text messages.
The Post and CBS reported that none of the messages directly referenced Clarence Thomas or the Supreme Court.

Is it possible that Ginni Thomas’ best friend might be seriously ill and incommunicado at the moment?
The first of the 29 messages between Ginni Thomas and Meadows was sent on Nov. 5, two days after the election.
But Thomas wrote to Meadows, “I hope this is true; never heard anything like this before, or even a hint of it.
