     Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, exchanged texts with Mark Meadows about efforts to overturn the 2020 election

     Summary: Among Thomas' stated goals in the messages was for lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted incendiary and unsupported claims about the election, to become "the lead and the face" of Trump's legal team.
The messages were among the 2,320 text messages that Meadows provided the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The existence of messages between Thomas and Meadows — 21 sent by her; eight by him — have not previously been reported and were reviewed by CBS News and The Post.
They were then confirmed by five people who have seen the committee's documents.

     Ginni Thomas Pressed Trump’s Chief of Staff to Overturn 2020 Vote, Texts Show

     Summary: The text traffic also suggests that Ms. Thomas was in contact with Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser.
Sidney Powell, the lawyer advising Trump’s campaign team known for unleashing wild theories about voting fraud, comes up repeatedly.
On Nov. 13, for instance, Mr. Trump included Ms. Powell in a tweeted list of his team’s lawyers.
While Ms. Thomas already had access to the president, White House aides said her influence increased after Mr. Trump named Mr. Meadows chief of staff in March 2020.
Mr. Meadows is no longer cooperating with the committee; a lawyer for Mr. Meadows, George J. Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The first of the 29 messages between Ginni Thomas and Meadows was sent on Nov. 5, two days after the election.
But Thomas wrote to Meadows, “I hope this is true; never heard anything like this before, or even a hint of it.

Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesDays after the 2020 election, conservative activist Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was sending White House chief of staff Mark Meadows some weird stuff.
They also show the extent to which the Supreme Court Justice’s wife has adopted the language of the far-right and the QAnon conspiracy.
For his part, Meadows — who reportedly coordinated many White House efforts to try and overturn the election — was receptive to the conspiracy-laden missives.
“This is a fight of good versus evil,” Meadows wrote back.
