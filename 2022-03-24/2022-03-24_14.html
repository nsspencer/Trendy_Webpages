     Fire breaks out at Jeddah oil depot before Saudi Arabia grand prix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The blaze – not immediately acknowledged by Saudi Arabia or its state-run oil company Saudi Aramco – was centred on the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days.
The attacks came as Saudi Arabia still leads a coalition battling the Iran-backed Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital of Sana’a in September 2014.
Another attack targeted an electrical substation in an area of southwestern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border, state TV said.
A cloud of smoke rises from a burning oil depot in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Cruise missiles and drones remain difficult to defend against, though the US recently sent a significant number of Patriot anti-missile interceptors to Saudi Arabia to resupply the kingdom amid the Houthi attacks.

     Summary: While Saudi Arabia and state-run Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, it appeared to be centred on a fuel depot that the Houthis have previously targeted.
The attacks targeted “Aramco facilities in Jeddah and vital facilities in the capital of the Saudi enemy, Riyadh”, tweeted Saree.
Following the Jeddah attack, people on the F1 track could see the large black smoke cloud in the distance.
Saudi state television acknowledged attacks in the town of Dhahran that hit water tanks and damaged vehicles and houses.

     Saudi Arabia: Houthis strike Jeddah oil depot ahead of F1 race weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yemen's Houthi rebels struck an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday in a missile attack that caused a large fire and left clouds of black smoke hanging over the port city.
The Yemeni group acknowledged they had launched a series of attacks on the kingdom ahead of the F1 Grand Prix race scheduled to take place there.
Saudi Arabia and the state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, though it appeared to be on the same fuel depot that the Houthis attacked in recent days.
The Saudi-led coalition early Saturday launched air strikes "against sources of threat in Sanaa and Hodeida" following the Jeddah attack, the official Saudi news agency SPA tweeted.
The North Jeddah Bulk Plant stores diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel for use in Jeddah, the kingdom's second-largest city.
