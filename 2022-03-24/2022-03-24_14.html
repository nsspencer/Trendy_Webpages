     Summary: LIV Golf last week announced an eight-event invitational series that begins in June with a tournament in London.
On Thursday, invitations were sent to potential players for that opening event.
The invitation was sent to numerous PGA Tour players with a link to register “for the opportunity to be considered.” Applicants will be confirmed based on qualification criteria, and formal invitations will be sent in May.
LIV Golf Invitational Series set to launch in JuneIt remains to be seen if any Tour players agree to be a part of the Saudi-backed series, which according to various sources is a scaled down version of LIV Golf’s original super league plans.
Two weeks ago at TPC Sawgrass, Tour commissioner Jay Monahan doubled down on the notion that players would not be allowed to play both the Tour and LIV Golf events.

Woods is signed up with Take-Two as the Electronic Arts PGA Tour series lies fallow.

EA Sports has been without a golf game since 2015's Rory McIlroy's PGA Tour.
As well as the PGA Tour, the game will include LPGA players and tournaments so male and female golfers will both be represented.
Those looking to tee up virtually this year meanwhile may have the chance with 2K's rival golf game: PGA Tour 2K.
Unfortunately, confirmed details about the next entry in the PGA Tour 2K series has been pretty thin, so it remains to be seen if PGA Tour 2K(22) will definitely show up in 2022.

     Summary: The LIV Golf Invitational Series is the official name of what the golf industry had been calling the Saudi Golf League in recent months.
It remains to be seen exactly which PGA Tour players have been targeted, especially when the majority of the world's top 50 have committed themselves to the PGA Tour, including Bryson DeChambeau, who many felt would be signing up for it.
Lee Westwood has been strongly linked and even admitted to having signed an NDA with partners of the LIV Golf Invitational Series.
"The 2022 LIV Golf Invitational series will unfold over seven regular season events that crown an Individual Champion and culminates in a Team Championship match-play event for $50,000,000."
Following the first event in London, the LIV Golf Invitational Series then moves to Portland in early July followed by New Jersey later in the month.

     Premier Golf League Rebuffed in Attempts to Meet with PGA Tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union/USA TodayOnce a rival and now hoping to be become a part of the PGA Tour, the Premier Golf League has so far been rebuffed in its efforts to get a face-to-face meeting with Tour representatives.
Andy Gardiner, the CEO of the Premier Golf League, said a letter sent to the PGA Tour Policy Board in February outlining a plan that would include PGL events within the PGA Tour structure was studied by the Players Advisory Council as well as the Tour’s Policy Board.
According to the plan, it would generate significant equity value for all voting PGA Tour members, as well as those on the DP World Tour and Korn Ferry Tour.
The idea is to incorporate PGL’s 18-tournament, 48-player, 54-hole events with a team concept into the PGA Tour schedule.
He believes the Policy Board is not fulfilling its duty to the membership without talking to the World Golf Group.
