     Receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling signing 3-year deal with Kansas City Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers made a last-minute run at re-signing free agent receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling, but he decided to accept a better offer.
Valdes-Scantling will be signing a three-year, $30 million deal with the Kansas City Chiefs, a source confirmed Thursday.
The move will help the Chiefs offset the loss of Tyreek Hill in a trade with the Miami Dolphins.
The Packers were just barely under the cap and would have had trouble signing anyone before the Adams deal surfaced.
22 and 28), so there’s a good chance they will be able to address their receiver need in the draft.

     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Chiefs have started their work to replace receiver Tyreek Hill.
According to multiple reports, former Green Bay receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling is signing with Kansas City on a three-year $30 million contract that can escalate to $36 million.
Valdes-Scantling took a free-agent visit with the Chiefs on Wednesday and apparently liked what he heard.
It will be practically impossible for the Chiefs to replace Hill, one of the league’s best receivers, with just one player.
But Valdes-Scantling at least has a track record of performance with one of the game’s other elite quarterbacks.

     Chiefs sign ex-Packers receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling to $30M deal after trading Tyreek Hill, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chiefs lost a lot of speed on Wednesday when they traded All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins.
A day later, they've gained at least a little bit back, signing former Packers deep threat Marquez Valdes-Scantling to a three-year, $30 million deal, as reported by ESPN and NFL Media.
Valdes-Scantling will make $18 million over the first two years of the deal, per Tom Pelissero, all of which is fully guaranteed.
He can make up to $36 million over the life of the deal, thanks to potential incentives.
The Chiefs recently added several other notable names to their receiving corps, likely in preparation of moving Hill.

     Summary: Robert Griffin III explains why he still wants the Chiefs to draft a receiver after signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling and specifically mentions North Dakota State's Christian Watson.
(0:57)The Kansas City Chiefs added a veteran wide receiver to their roster on Thursday, a day after trading star wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling signed a contract with the Chiefs, the team announced.
For the Packers, it's another wide receiver the team will have to replace after trading star wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders last week.
After playing in every game over his first three seasons, Valdes-Scantling missed six games last season: five because of a hamstring injury and one because of COVID-19.

     Summary: On the same day when Tyreek Hill was introduced as a Miami Dolphin, the Kansas City Chiefs are bringing in a reinforcement to help replace him.
The Chiefs are signing former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling to a three-year, $30 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Thursday.
MVS will receive $18 million in the first two years of the contract, and the deal has incentives to reach a max of $36 million.
Valdes-Scantling doesn't have the accolades and statistics that Hill does, but he does have the wheels.
Hill, 28, departs Kansas City having earned six Pro Bowl selections, a Super Bowl title and four 1,000-yard seasons.
