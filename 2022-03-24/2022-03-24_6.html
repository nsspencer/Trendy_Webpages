     Summary: The USMNT currently lead Mexico on goal differential (equal on points with 21) heading into the final three matches of the Octagonal campaign.
The Yanks are underdogs according to the oddsmakers against El Tri Thursday night (10 pm ET | Paramount+, Univision) and by a substantial margin, according to numbers from BetMGM.
But bettors are backing the USMNT with the belief that they can record a third-straight victory over their southern border rival and earn a first-ever win in a competitive match at Estadio Azteca.
They can officially stamp their ticket to Qatar 2022 with a win against Costa Rica on Thursday night.
They could also clinch their spot with a draw combined with a Panama loss or draw with Honduras and a USMNT loss or draw against Mexico.

With the USMNT facing Mexico, Panama, and Costa Rica, Reyna couldn't be returning to the fold at a better time.
But as there are reasons to be concerned with the team's performance as well as reasons to expect them to finish the job and qualify for the World Cup.
Both have had strong performances in Champions League play that they'll look to build on to help Mexico qualify for the World Cup.
I'm not pressing the panic button yet because at the time of writing the USMNT are in a strong position to qualify for the World Cup.
