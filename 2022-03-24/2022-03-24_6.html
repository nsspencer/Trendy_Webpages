     Samuels Powers Villanova Over Michigan 63-55 in Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jermaine Samuels scored 22 points and Villanova controlled Michigan and center Hunter Dickinson to earn a 63-55 Sweet 16 victory over the Wolverines on Thursday night in the NCAA Tournament.
Samuels' 8-of-13 shooting performance, much of it coming on tough drives through Michigan defenders and around Dickinson, carried a Wildcats offense that had long stretches of misfiring on 3-pointers.
That was the cushion the Wildcats needed, as Michigan closed within six points before Samuels made four three throws over the final 13 seconds to put it away.
Justin Moore scored 15 points and Gillespie scored 12 for Villanova.
The Wildcats were 9 of 30 from long range — their ninth game this season with at least 30 attempts.

     Summary: Michigan found itself playing in the Sweet-16 for the fifth-straight time on Thursday evening against the Villanova Wildcats.
The game is a rematch from the 2018 national championship game when the Wildcats defeated the Wolverines, 79-62.
The Wolverines trailed for the entire second half, but Michigan continued to battle with ferocious defense which kept the Wolverines in the game.
But, the Wolverines had too many self-inflicted wounds to win the game with missed shots, missed free throws, and untimely turnovers.
The Wildcats defeated Michigan, 63-55 — the Wolverines season is officially over.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And with their season on the line against Villanova, it was everything inside the arc that crumbled.
A team that shot 52.7% on 2-pointers throughout the year deflated to 34.9% in San Antonio.
Dickinson needed 16 shots to score 15 points and had nearly twice as many wayward field goal attempts (10) as made baskets (six).
Michigan won the rebounding battle (41-38), committed only eight turnovers and held Villanova stars Collin Gillespie (12 points) and Justin Moore (15 points) to 9-for-27 shooting.
He snagged the rebound after a Villanova missed shot and accelerated into the open floor for a coast-to-coast layup that bolstered his confidence.
