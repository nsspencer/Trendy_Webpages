     Summary: UNC Basketball: Everything You Need to Know About the Tar Heels’ Brady ManekUNC basketball’s Brady Manek has become the talk of the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
The fifth-year senior has been one of the Tar Heels’ best players this seasonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCqCOuapws4Carolina was up by 25 points when Manek was ejected against Baylor.
It’s no coincidence that the 23-year-old is playing his best basketball as the Tar Heels play theirs.
It’s not a bad matchup for the Tar Heels’ forward — the biggest issue will be defending Jaquez on the perimeter.
But the former Sooner has been arguably the Tar Heels’ best player over the past two months.
