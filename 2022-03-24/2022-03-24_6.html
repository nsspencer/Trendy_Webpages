View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jr NTR (@jrntr)Once an actor stars in a SS Rajamouli film, the tag ‘Rajamouli’s hero’ stays with them for a long time.
If tomorrow there is another film in which an actor has excelled, then people will associate the actor with that role or film.

     Covid-hit exhibition industry hopes RRR will be a roaring hit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 300 crore budget thanks to distribution, satellite and digital sales touching Rs.
600 crore, it will be a challenge for distributors and exhibitors to make the same back from ticket sales.
100 crore gross is on the cards on day one in Telugu-speaking states but in north India, sleeper hit The Kashmir Files will provide stiff competition.
“Though originally shot in Telugu, RRR is being seen as a pan-Indian film and its language of production is of no consequence.
Given that RRR is a standalone release for the week, we believe that it will shore up significant box office collections.
