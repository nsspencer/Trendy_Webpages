     Atlanta Season 3: Inside That Spooky First Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Because I wanted to do some stuff that other people don’t do, and I just wanted to be brash, honestly,” Glover told Den of Geek prior to the season airing.
Though the moment is indeed brash and bold, it also serves as a helpful appetizer of one of season 3’s big themes: curses, specifically the “curse of whiteness”.
“(He) was saying it was freeing white people of the burden of having to be white, which we thought was really interesting,” Glover says.
The white man responds that that makes sense as there’s a whole town underneath them.
As his Black friend grows silent, the white fisherman delves into a lengthy, haunting monologue about the lost town and the curse of whiteness.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Season 3 of Atlanta debuts more than four years after Season 2 did, and it'll be exciting to see audiences fall right back into the one-of-a-kind tone that the show sets.
FXAll of which is to say: there's 10 episodes of Atlanta on the way, and then 10 more later in 2022 for Season 4, which will be the final season of the show.
Atlanta is like a treat, and we'll likely treat Season 3 just like that.
FXHow many episodes of Atlanta are left in Season 3?
After a 10 episode Season 1 and an 11 episode Season 2, Atlanta is back to 10 episodes for Season 3.

     ‘Atlanta’ Season 3 Opens With a White Lesbian Couple’s House of Horrors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atlanta’s sophomore season (or Robbin’ Season, as it was titled) saw Donald Glover’s Emmy-winning FX comedy push its well-established penchant for genre-bending satirical humor and avant-garde storytelling to new boundaries.
In the cold open, a white man tells a Black man about the history of a lake they’re both fishing on from a small boat at night.
The next time we see Loquareeous, he’s being dropped off at a smelly, disheveled home of two kombucha-making white women who’ve already adopted three other Black children.
Practically every joke made about white women on Twitter or their association with the term “Karen” is stuffed into this half-hour.
Overall, it seems like the show is trying to correct some criticism it’s received in the past for its sometimes stereotypical portrayal of Black women.

     ‘Atlanta’ Kicks Off Season 3 With a Dark and Twisted Doubleheader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The episodes are connected by more than Earn waking up at the end of the first and the start of the second.
As Al tells Earn during that second installment, “Same ratchet-ass hoes, different city.” Wherever Atlanta goes, there it is.
Coco Olakunle/FXDespite the new locale, “Sinterklaas” is an episode reminiscent of a variety of previous Atlanta tales.
(This is yet another separate adventure they’ve gone on, along with the Drake house party episode from Season Two.)
Even more than the blackface running gag, it is a proclamation about how little Atlanta has changed despite traveling so far from Atlanta itself.

     Summary: As the two men look out into the murky waters, the Black man suggests they call it a night.
“Yeah, it might be,” the white man responds, agreeing to head out once he finishes his beer.
“It’s a whole town underneath us,” the white man tells him.
“Town was Black, dude … a self-governing Black town.” The Black man pauses as the information washes over him.
“We’re cursed too,” the white man says as an array of dark-skinned arms ascends from the water, dragging the Black man into its depths.
