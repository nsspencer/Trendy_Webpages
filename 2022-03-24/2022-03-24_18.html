     Summary: The 36-year-old mother of two has stirred her fair share of pots in the past.
During her time on LAHH, she uncovered a major family secret and severed ties with her father after a DNA test gone wrong.
Following the show’s hiatus, she came under fire after going live on Instagram while seemingly under the influence.
But on March 24, she made headlines for a very different and very scary reason.
News outlets reported that the reality star had been severely injured and could potentially be on life support.

     Summary: Apple Watts, a former cast member of VH1’s reality series “Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood,” has been hospitalized after suffering severe injuries in a car accident in Baker, California, on Wednesday morning, People reported late Thursday.
She was pulled to safety by a passenger in the pickup truck and air-lifted to a University Medical Center in Las Vegas with “major injuries,” Duran said.
Officials do not believe drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident at this time.
Representatives for the California Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for Watts.
With mentor and friend Yolanda ‘YoYo’ Whittaker behind her, Apple’s striving to get on the straight and narrow — but with her unpredictability, only time will tell.”
