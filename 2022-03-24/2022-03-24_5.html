     Trade Tutor: With RRR, will SS Rajamouli do what James Cameron did in Hollywood?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The other Cinema of the town was so adamant to screen that he screened the English version as he was denied the hindi version.
It took James Cameron 12 years to come up with another feature and that film was Avatar.
Rajamouli, like Cameron, has this knack of breaking language and cultural barriers with his films.
For a telugu film to be the highest grossing hindi film is a testament to the prowess.
Cameron took 12 years to come up with his new feature film Avatar but thankfully Rajamouli is taking only 5 years to come up with RRR.

     Summary: 300 crore budget thanks to distribution, satellite and digital sales touching Rs.
600 crore, it will be a challenge for distributors and exhibitors to make the same back from ticket sales.
100 crore gross is on the cards on day one in Telugu-speaking states but in north India, sleeper hit The Kashmir Files will provide stiff competition.
“Though originally shot in Telugu, RRR is being seen as a pan-Indian film and its language of production is of no consequence.
Given that RRR is a standalone release for the week, we believe that it will shore up significant box office collections.
