     NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 Preview: No. 2 Villanova vs. No. 11 Michigan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Either way, the Michigan Wolverines are back in the Sweet 16 — as is becoming tradition — while Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Illinois all sit at home.
Michigan’s rough regular season means its NCAA Tournament path is not going to be easy.
2 seed Villanova in a rematch of the 2018 National Championship Game, coincidentally also played in San Antonio.
Letting mistakes add up against Villanova is not going to work, and the Wolverines cannot keep hoping to escape like this.
Michigan needs to force Villanova to earn its baskets, starting with contesting threes and not giving up open looks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And with their season on the line against Villanova, it was everything inside the arc that crumbled.
A team that shot 52.7% on 2-pointers throughout the year deflated to 34.9% in San Antonio.
Dickinson needed 16 shots to score 15 points and had nearly twice as many wayward field goal attempts (10) as made baskets (six).
Michigan won the rebounding battle (41-38), committed only eight turnovers and held Villanova stars Collin Gillespie (12 points) and Justin Moore (15 points) to 9-for-27 shooting.
He snagged the rebound after a Villanova missed shot and accelerated into the open floor for a coast-to-coast layup that bolstered his confidence.
