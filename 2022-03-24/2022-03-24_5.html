     Samuels Powers Villanova Over Michigan 63-55 in Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jermaine Samuels scored 22 points and Villanova controlled Michigan and center Hunter Dickinson to earn a 63-55 Sweet 16 victory over the Wolverines on Thursday night in the NCAA Tournament.
Samuels' 8-of-13 shooting performance, much of it coming on tough drives through Michigan defenders and around Dickinson, carried a Wildcats offense that had long stretches of misfiring on 3-pointers.
That was the cushion the Wildcats needed, as Michigan closed within six points before Samuels made four three throws over the final 13 seconds to put it away.
Justin Moore scored 15 points and Gillespie scored 12 for Villanova.
The Wildcats were 9 of 30 from long range — their ninth game this season with at least 30 attempts.

     Michigan basketball comes up short in Sweet 16, losing to Villanova, 63-55
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And with their season on the line against Villanova, it was everything inside the arc that crumbled.
A team that shot 52.7% on 2-pointers throughout the year deflated to 34.9% in San Antonio.
Dickinson needed 16 shots to score 15 points and had nearly twice as many wayward field goal attempts (10) as made baskets (six).
Michigan won the rebounding battle (41-38), committed only eight turnovers and held Villanova stars Collin Gillespie (12 points) and Justin Moore (15 points) to 9-for-27 shooting.
He snagged the rebound after a Villanova missed shot and accelerated into the open floor for a coast-to-coast layup that bolstered his confidence.

     Summary: In five games this post-season, Samuels is averaging 13 points, 9 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal per game.
He’s been named KenPom’s player of the game twice during this stretch (UConn and Ohio State), the most of any Villanova player.
In today’s game Villanova will need not just Samuels but everyone to step up against a Michigan team that’s good on the offensive glass, and even better on defense.

     Summary: 2 seed Villanova is advancing back to the Elite Eight for the first time since winning the NCAA Tournament title in 2018 after beating No.

But the run came to an end against a Wildcats team that has been far more consistent over the course of the season.
