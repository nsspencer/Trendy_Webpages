     Summary: The final window for 2022 World Cup Qualifying begins Thursday for the U.S. men's national team against Mexico.
The USMNT makes its return to Estadio Azteca in Mexico City (9 p.m., CBS Sports Network, Paramount+) for the first time since June 2017, when it tied 1-1 in 2018 World Cup Qualifying.
The U.S. is 0-6-3 at the Azteca in qualifying.
Ahead of Thursday's qualifier, U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter has been forced to strategize without starting right back Sergiño Dest (hamstring) and workhorse winger Brenden Aaronson (knee).

     The USMNT Players to Score vs. Mexico at Estadio Azteca
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wins at Estadio Azteca are rare for the U.S. men’s national team, but merely scoring goals itself has been difficult for U.S. players away from home throughout their rivalry with Mexico.
Entering the match, only six U.S. players had ever scored at the Azteca, starting with Willy Roy in 1972.
From there, it’s been Rick Davis (1980), Eddie Lewis (2005), Charlie Davies (2009), Michael Orozco (2012) and Michael Bradley (2017).
While Orozco’s improbable goal led to the only win the U.S. has ever had in Mexico City (in a friendly), Bradley’s goal was particularly memorable.
Bradley took his chance and took it well, stunning the partisan crowd with one of the best U.S. goals ever.

     Summary: It was a sloppy, tense and physical match, one where both teams had quality chances.
Mexico had 63 percent of the ball but recorded an xG of just 0.40 on 11 shots.
His positioning was superb, often applying pressure at the top of the box when Mexico were overly patient.
He made the Mexican defenders look silly, broke ankles along the way and produced a highlight USMNT fans will watch for years to come.
Here is that moment:On top of that, he should have had an assist for that smart pass to Pefok that was just butchered.

More than four years after the shocking and disastrous loss in Trinidad that cost the U.S. a trip to the 2018 World Cup, the long wait for redemption is ending.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Men’s National Team will face off against Mexico for the second time in 2022 World Cup qualifying play, as the Americans will travel to Mexico City for a tough match at Estadio Azteca.
This match kicks off the last set of qualifiers for both sides, with just three left to play in order to secure a berth into the World Cup in Qatar this November.
Thursday’s match should be an interesting one, considering that the Americans have never won a WCQ match at Estadio Azteca.
It’ll be their first trip to that stadium since June of 2017 when they earned a 1-1 draw in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.
Ultimately, the Americans missed out on the 2018 World Cup, but they’ll hope to be singing a different tune after these final matches are complete.
