     The USMNT Players to Score vs. Mexico at Estadio Azteca
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wins at Estadio Azteca are rare for the U.S. men’s national team, but merely scoring goals itself has been difficult for U.S. players away from home throughout their rivalry with Mexico.
Entering the match, only six U.S. players had ever scored at the Azteca, starting with Willy Roy in 1972.
From there, it’s been Rick Davis (1980), Eddie Lewis (2005), Charlie Davies (2009), Michael Orozco (2012) and Michael Bradley (2017).
While Orozco’s improbable goal led to the only win the U.S. has ever had in Mexico City (in a friendly), Bradley’s goal was particularly memorable.
Bradley took his chance and took it well, stunning the partisan crowd with one of the best U.S. goals ever.

     USA vs Mexico: Looking at One of Soccer's Biggest Rivalries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Contentious HistoryGames between Mexico and the USA date back to World Cup qualifying in 1934, when the first international soccer match was played between the two countries.
While Donovan retired from the national team in 2014, the heat from the incident can still be felt when Mexico hosts the USA.
The game is not just a soccer match, but a microcosm for the tensions between the neighboring countries.
They have only won one friendly at the stadium and have never won a major qualifying match there.
The odds are against us getting something out of this game,” USA head coach Greg Berhalter said.
