     'The Staircase' adds dramatic new levels to Michael Peterson's murder trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) There are many levels to "The Staircase," a drama as much about the making of the docuseries chronicling Michael Peterson's murder trial as the salacious case itself.
(Netflix, notably, revisited the original 2004 series in 2018 , revealing the toll of the intervening years on "The Staircase's" protagonist.)
There's also the issue of how prosecutors leveraged that information, recognizing how it might play to a jury in 2003.
With "The Staircase," though, there's method to the madness, as it seeks to capture the story with all its intricacies, and the sometimes elusive pursuit of putting the truth in true crime.
"The Staircase" premieres May 5 on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

     The Staircase: Unraveling Michael Peterson’s Real-Life Relationship With the Docuseries Filmmakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In real life, it was de Lestrade and Poncet who first sniffed out the dramatic potential of Michael Peterson’s murder trial in Durham, North Carolina.
They embedded themselves with Peterson for about two years and created 2004’s original The Staircase, one of the first and all-time-great true-crime docuseries.
He began work on an adaptation about 13 years ago, attended Peterson’s second trial as a spectator, and built a relationship with the real de Lestrade.
So everybody in the house was looking for it.”While the original filmmakers spent hundreds of hours with Michael, Campos and Cohn took the opposite approach—purposefully limiting the amount of time they spoke to him.
And the problem with Michael Peterson is, even in real life, there’s a performative quality to him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO Max's The Staircase is like staring into an infinity mirror of true crime.
It's as navel-gazey as this new crop of "elevated" true crime subgenres gets, with a puzzlingly pseudo-intellectual tagline that proclaims "There is No Truth Without Lies."
It's as navel-gazey as this new crop of "elevated" true crime subgenres gets.
More often than not, it comes across as the most disturbing live-action dramatization of Clue: The Real True Crime Story Edition.
But when it comes to true crime fodder, it's a retelling sure to feed other murder-loving goblins like myself.

     Summary: Michael Peterson was first convicted of her murder in 2003 and sentenced to life in prison.
In 1997, Michael and Kathleen married; by 2001, it seemed Michael Peterson, then 58 years old, had acquired the perfect life.
Michael Peterson.
In the years since The Staircase, Peterson has written his own book, Behind the Staircase.
Michael Peterson appears to be a modern-day Don Draper, skilled at lying, self-aggrandizement, and performing importance without actually being important.

     ‘The Staircase’ Writers on Michael Peterson’s Queerness and Expanding on the Infamous Owl Theory
    </h2>

     Summary: “Michael Peterson as a central figure was really strong.
CAMPOS: Well, it’s so much a part of who Michael Peterson is and the central conflict in him.
The question is whether or not Kathleen knew, and there is obviously a marriage between Michael Peterson and Kathleen Peterson where she embraced Michael’s queerness.
The world that the story starts off with in 2001 is very different from the world that Michael Peterson is in in 2017.
So my final question for you is, do you think Michael Peterson killed Kathleen?
