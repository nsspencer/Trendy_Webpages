     Dolly Parton Contemplating Collaboration With the Rolling Stones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton, who was recently voted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame's latest class, is considering ideas for an album of rock music.
In a new interview with Billboard, Parton said the record may have to include a collaboration with a band that knows a thing or two about the subject: the Rolling Stones.
"I didn’t follow rock music that much, but my husband is a rock ‘n’ roll freak.
I may do up a version of something like [Lynyrd Skynyrd’s] “Free Bird” and do my own versions of some classic things that I think would make good rock ‘n’ roll songs."
Parton also mentioned that she's still unsure about whether or not she will attend the upcoming Rock Hall induction ceremony in the fall.

     Summary: It looks like Dolly Parton is a rock star now.
At least that’s the joke she shared with her manager Danny Nozell when she found out she had been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame on Wednesday.
And I appreciate the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame people for staying there with me.
Yet, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and Brenda Lee - among others - are in both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.
“People usually (say) ‘Dolly rocks’ or ‘you rock’ or ‘you’re a rock star,’” she said.

     Summary: Typical of Parton's fearless creativity, she didn't just approach the song for a straight cover, but added a choir, bluegrass instrumentation and - the audacity!
"I was scared to death to send it to Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.
In fact, Robert Plant said he'd always thought of it as a spiritual song, and he was thrilled we'd used a choir on it, because he thought about that, too.
And this, ladies and gentleman, is just one more reason to treasure country music's new rock 'n' roll superstar.

In addition to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Parton is an honorary member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, making her the second woman to be in both after singer Brenda Lee.
I even have a lot of my rock 'n' roll friends and people that are, you know, to the point of being bitter about the fact that they're not being nominated or in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame," Parton explained.
She added: "So it's like, 'If they're not able to be recognized in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, where do they go?'
