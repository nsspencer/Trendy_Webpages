     ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ writer falsely claimed to have lost a friend in Tree of Life shooting

     Summary: People pay their respects at a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2018.
(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File/AP)(JTA) Elisabeth Finch claimed to have survived a rare and fatal form of cancer.
According to Vanity Fair, Finch had entered an Arizona mental health treatment center shortly after the 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
The Tree of Life shooting wasn’t the only time Finch claimed to have been directly affected by antisemitism.
As a “Grey’s” writer, she was outspoken about her own supposed trauma and penned pieces for Elle and The Hollywood Reporter about her personal life.

     Summary: Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight But we’ve gone badly off the rails when “lived experience” becomes the stand-in for authenticity.
