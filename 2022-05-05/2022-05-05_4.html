     Summary: He's shooting 34.8% from deep, a respectable number, on nearly six attempts per game and his assist numbers could be higher if his teammates hit their shots.
But... what if he's willing to take less?
"[...]"SAM AMICK: When the Sixers got [Harden], their intel was that he would be potentially willing to take less.
Because Harden isn't going to surrender a ton of money just to help an organization he joined months prior.
Hopefully Harden can help Morey and the Sixers out, return on a below-max deal (still lots of money!)

     Stephen A. Smith Hits James Harden With A Harsh Reality
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James Harden was not very good with the Brooklyn Nets to start the NBA season.
Harden was not fond of the environment in Brooklyn, and it made sense for him to have a bit of a scenery change.
In fact, Harden has been so bad that Stephen A. Smith is hitting the star with a huge dose of reality.
Harden used to be one of the most prolific scorers in the entire NBA, but over the course of the last couple of seasons, he has been anything but that, to the detriment of his teams.
Needless to say, it is a bad time to be Harden right now, and it is an even worse time to be a Sixers fan.

     So the James Harden-Ben Simmons trade looks like a dud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Upon hearing the news of any trade, the first reaction is to think about which team won the trade initially.
With Ben Simmons (and others) being traded for James Harden, it depends on which talking head you cared to listen to.
Simmons never touched the court for Brooklyn and now needs back surgery after an “attempted” return one week earlier.
The Nets also got Seth Curry and Andre Drummond in the trade with Simmons, but they weren’t enough to help to get them past the Boston Celtics.
The way Harden played this year, I don’t even know if Mr. Morey still sees that type of value in him.

    </h2>

     Summary: With the Sixers constantly denying Ben Simmons trade rumors and the Nets all of a sudden having to deal with a disgruntled James Harden, the two teams joined forces for a massive trade that swapped their stars.
The Harden-Simmons trade is becoming a lose-lose scenario for the Nets and Sixers.
*3 reasons the James Harden-Ben Simmons trade is turning into a lose-lose debacle for Sixers and Nets3.
James Harden is not the superstar that was promised for the SixersUpon his arrival to the Sixers, Harden was seen as the best player Embiid would get to play with.
The lasting image of Simmons’ season is him in a bright outfit with the dimmest facial expression as he watches the Nets’ season end.

     Houston Rockets: Ex-teammates Ex-Rockets Chris Paul, James Harden in different NBA worlds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second-best era in franchise history was never the same, and it was soon over for Paul and Harden together in Houston.
For Paul and especially for Harden, who is currently a shell of his best Rockets self and has obviously lost a step (or two) in the past couple years.
I’ve written a ton about Harden, Paul and the 2015-20 Rockets, so I’m not going to look back again this time.
At this moment, the reality is that the 36-year-old Paul is a better player and leader than the 32-year-old Harden.
But this used to be an easy debate and it wasn't close: Who was the Rockets’ best player, Harden or Paul?
