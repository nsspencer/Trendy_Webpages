     Taylor Swift Debuts ‘This Love (Taylor’s Version),’ From ‘1989’ Redo, in Amazon’s ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’ Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans have a lot of trailer action to take in on the Swift front recently.
There’s just one thing that makes many not too quick to leap to any assumptions: Swift already released one track from the “1989” remake sessions, “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version),” leading fans then to imagine that “1989” would be on deck next, only to have hr put out “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” instead.
In this case, releasing “This Love” would seem less reactive and more part of a master plan.
If it is “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” that will be coming out next, it will represent the possible jewel in the crown of the series, as a fresh look at the biggest album Swift put out in her career.
Han recently signed an exclusive development deal with Prime Video and is the showrunner for the series with Gabrielle Stanton.
