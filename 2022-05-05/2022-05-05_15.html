     The Staircase: The riveting tale of an unsolved mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the allure of the French documentary The Staircase, one of the first big successes in the genre.
Still engrossing today, the series had astonishing access to Michael Peterson, accused of killing his wife, Kathleen, in their home in an upscale area of Durham, North Carolina.
Fortunately, viewers are carried along by the first-rate cast and the intrigue of the unsolved mystery.
Even now, 21 years later, no one can definitively say how Kathleen Peterson died.
The defence said they had a lovely marriage and she died in a fall down a sharply-angled staircase.

     'The Staircase' adds dramatic new levels to Michael Peterson's murder trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) There are many levels to "The Staircase," a drama as much about the making of the docuseries chronicling Michael Peterson's murder trial as the salacious case itself.
(Netflix, notably, revisited the original 2004 series in 2018 , revealing the toll of the intervening years on "The Staircase's" protagonist.)
There's also the issue of how prosecutors leveraged that information, recognizing how it might play to a jury in 2003.
With "The Staircase," though, there's method to the madness, as it seeks to capture the story with all its intricacies, and the sometimes elusive pursuit of putting the truth in true crime.
"The Staircase" premieres May 5 on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

     ‘The Staircase’ Explores a New, Meta Dimension of the True Crime Boom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We are in the midst of a true crime boom within a true crime boom.
But if you’re anything less than a true crime diehard, you also may be well past the point of (justified) fatigue.
Thanks to its unique, extended history, the original series straddles two distinct eras in the history of true crime.
In its first iteration, The Staircase condensed thousands of hours of footage into an exhaustive survey of the Peterson case and its many inconsistencies.
In its initial episodes, the emphasis on the Petersons’ inner strife is The Staircase’s primary differentiator from its source material, if not its peers in the scripted true crime space.

     ‘The Staircase’ Writers on Michael Peterson’s Queerness and Expanding on the Infamous Owl Theory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Michael Peterson as a central figure was really strong.
CAMPOS: Well, it’s so much a part of who Michael Peterson is and the central conflict in him.
The question is whether or not Kathleen knew, and there is obviously a marriage between Michael Peterson and Kathleen Peterson where she embraced Michael’s queerness.
The world that the story starts off with in 2001 is very different from the world that Michael Peterson is in in 2017.
So my final question for you is, do you think Michael Peterson killed Kathleen?
