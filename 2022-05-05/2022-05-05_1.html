     Dolly Parton on Rock Hall Induction: ‚ÄúI Guess I‚Äôm a Rock Star Now‚Äù

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton made headlines when she bowed out of the running for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, claiming she didn‚Äôt feel she had earned the nomination.
But when the Rock Hall stood its ground, officially inducting Parton into the 2022 class alongside Eminem, Duran Duran, Eurythmics, Carly Simon, Lionel Richie, and Pat Benatar, the beloved artist accepted her fate, proclaiming, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm a rock star now.‚Äù‚ÄúI feel honored that all the people that voted for me did,‚Äù Parton told Billboard.
Yet, despite her indisputable impact as a country artist, Parton said she now plans to record a proper rock album ‚Äî and she might even enlist her friends in The Rolling Stones to help out.
A Dolly-Stones collaboration sounds great and all, but here‚Äôs hoping the artist takes up Steve Albini on his offer to produce her rock debut.
The 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 5th.
