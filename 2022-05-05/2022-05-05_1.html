     Summary: Parton had previously gone on social media to “respectfully bow out” of the process, saying she did not want to take votes away from the remaining nominees and had not “earned that right.” The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation responded by saying ballots had already been sent and it was up to the voters to decide if Parton was elected.
Parton later said she would accept an induction.

     Summary: The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame will always love Dolly Parton, even if she has cold feet.
What happened next: Parton learned what rock fans have known for some time — the Cleveland-based Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame has expanded beyond the genre.
"[W]hen I said that, it was always my belief that the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame was for the people in rock music, and I have found out lately that it's not necessarily that," Parton later said in an interview with NPR.
Now she'll take her place among "rock &amp; roll" royalty.
💭 Nate's second thought bubble: Adam would also approve of Dolly in the hip-hop, jazz, baseball and underwater welding Halls of Fame.

     Dolly Parton on Rock Hall Induction: “I Guess I’m a Rock Star Now”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton made headlines when she bowed out of the running for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, claiming she didn’t feel she had earned the nomination.
But when the Rock Hall stood its ground, officially inducting Parton into the 2022 class alongside Eminem, Duran Duran, Eurythmics, Carly Simon, Lionel Richie, and Pat Benatar, the beloved artist accepted her fate, proclaiming, “I guess I’m a rock star now.”“I feel honored that all the people that voted for me did,” Parton told Billboard.
Yet, despite her indisputable impact as a country artist, Parton said she now plans to record a proper rock album — and she might even enlist her friends in The Rolling Stones to help out.
A Dolly-Stones collaboration sounds great and all, but here’s hoping the artist takes up Steve Albini on his offer to produce her rock debut.
The 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 5th.
