     The Pentaverate Review: Mike Myers At His Most Unrestrained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The Pentaverate" is a comedy series led by Myers, who plays many characters: not just the lead Ken Scarborough, but also five Pentaverate members, the conspiracy theorist Anthony, Rex Smith (an Alex Jones parody), and more.
It's a lot to handle, especially in the scenes where there are several versions of Myers acting with himself.
Easily the standout though was Ken Scarborough, who is clearly inspired by the real-life local news anchors Myers grew up watching.
Myers is at his best when he has something to (lovingly) mock — that's what made "Austin Powers" so good.
The series feels less sexist and more inclusive than his other notable works, and there's a sense that Myers really wants to promote being nice and good.

     Mike Myers Attempts Comeback with Inconsistent The Pentaverate on Netflix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the death of Pentaverate member Jason Eccleston (yes, Myers), they recruit a nuclear physicist named Dr. Hobart Clark (Keegan-Michael Key), the man who they believe can stop climate change.
Myers isn’t remotely altering or hiding his sense of humor in “The Pentaverate” with several scenes of power players at big tables that recall Dr.
It’s not quite fair to call it a “Mike Myers Greatest Hits,” but it’s undeniably a product of its creator’s comedic history.
Comedy is about pacing and timing, and these elongated Netflix projects most often falter in that department.
And Myers’ filler is more aggressive than some other comedian’s, built on silly accents and wordplay that goes on forever.

     The Pentaverate review – Mike Myers is back, and he’s still an accomplished idiot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My great auntie’s definition of a good book – probably a lot of great aunties’, maybe all great aunties’ – was “one that takes you out of yourself”.
Those who feel the same will fall like ravening beasts on The Pentaverate (Netflix).
This is a six-episode piece of accomplished idiocy by Mike Myers, who has been specialising in such since the early 90s via Saturday Night Live, Wayne’s World, Austin Powers, the Shrek franchise and assorted other ventures.
Like Austin Powers, The Pentaverate has Myers playing multiple roles – so many, in fact, that, unless I say otherwise, you can assume all the characters mentioned here are played by him.
This includes most of the Pentaverate, a secret society that is, unlike most secret societies, benevolent.

     Mike Myers’ ‘The Pentaverate’ Is Just the Latest Example of Netflix’s Blank-Check Bloat: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Making sense of “The Pentaverate” simply isn’t the point of “The Pentaverate,” which exists to let Mike Myers do whatever he wants almost 15 years after he last starred in a project of his own.
With “The Pentaverate,” which dropped its six episodes on May 5, Myers gets to play as many characters as he likes in a story about a centuries-old cabal resisting discovery.
At first glance, it’s kind of interesting that “The Pentaverate” is a limited series.
Upon watching it, however, it’s clear that this television show is actually just an overlong movie chopped into six pieces.
It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough.

     Summary: The idea for The Pentaverate dates back to 1993—and so too does its humor.
Regardless of this puzzling discrepancy, the Pentaverate are notable for being “nice,” as is explained in credit introductions narrated by an ever-more-irritated Jeremy Irons.
Quite a few elements strewn throughout The Pentaverate recall Myers’ shagadelic spy films, but a lack of originality is a less pressing problem than a wholesale absence of inspiration.
There’s a cornball moment in which Myers rehashes his performance of (and simultaneously reunites with) Shrek.

     Review: Mike Myers’s ‘The Pentaverate’ Netflix Comedy Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This certainty is not the sole basis for Mike Myers’s new Netflix series, The Pentaverate, but it’s a central pillar.
Twenty years ago, Myers’s career was at its peak, thanks to his SNL characters, his Austin Powers movies, and his voice performance as Shrek.
The show wantsto wallow in humorous pigsties, in poop jokes and sex jokes as far as the eye can see.
Beyond that, the guiding principles of The Pentaverate’s humor are a little timid.
There are some Netflix jokes in this Netflix show, about as spicy as a mayonnaise sandwich.
