     Summary: This article contains minor spoilers for Star Trek: Strange New Worlds episode 1.
Star Trek is a franchise with a massive legacy, one the newer series on Paramount+ are gleeful to explore.
A classic example was in Star Trek: Enterprise’s use of the Romulans.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is seemingly trying to do the same thing with the Gorn.
This would seem to preclude the idea that Strange New Worlds, set before the time of TOS, could encounter everyone’s favorite reptilian baddies.

     'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' beams back to the original show's mission
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Paramount+ keeps beaming up "Star Treks" whether needed or not, but its latest, "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds," draws more heavily on the original series than perhaps anything in the fleet.
The series is built around previous USS Enterprise captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount), who of course would meet an unfortunate fate during the original series (the actual product of a passed-over TV pilot , but never mind).
From that perspective, "Strange New Worlds" is basically mistitled.
Because while it offers a credible and polished extension of this venerable brand and greater exposure to different parts of the "Trek" universe, because its mission relies so heavily on building off of the original series, there's not much that's strange or new about it.
"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" premieres May 5 on Paramount+.

     Star Trek Strange New Worlds: Boldly Going Back to the Beginning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We seem to be inundated with Star Trek lately, with several live action and animated series rotating through episodes congruently and sometimes simultaneously.
The latest being Strange New Worlds a prequel to the original 1960s Star Trek series and spinoff of Star Trek: Discovery.
Of all the current Star Trek series, this one feels the most like something Gene Roddenberry would have created (and technically he did).
Melissa Navia as helmsman Erica Ortegas, which is a nod to the original Star Trek pitch which included a navigator named Jose Ortegas,.
I believe this is exactly what the original series did with themes such as racism and is in keeping with Roddenberry’s original concept.

     Summary: And I think it has that sense of adventure like the original series, where you wouldn’t even know where you were going to be at the beginning of the episode, much less the end.
That is clearly demonstrated in multiple points of “Strange New Worlds,” in particular in Pike’s grappling with the knowledge of his impending paralysis.
At multiple points in “Strange New Worlds,” that knowledge causes him considerable stress.
That means that they have been connected to the “Star Trek” universe as long as the cast of the original series was at first, considering the original show only aired for three years.
I’m so grateful to be a part of it even though it has come with all of these strange effects of being scared to screw it up and not to meet fans’ expectations.”“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” debuts on Paramount+ on May 5.

     Summary: Anyone who thinks that there might be too many Star Trek shows out there these days would have a point.
Between Star Trek: Picard as well as Star Trek: Discovery and the animated comedy programs that are all getting new episodes these days, it could be an awful lot of Star Trek to absorb.
On the other hand, that just means that these days, there is a different kind of Star Trek for everyone.
At least when not counting all the many, many callbacks and winks to the original Star Trek.
Strange New Worlds really does feel like it's trying quite hard to remind people what the franchise used to be.

     'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Is the Best 'Trek' in Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since Star Trek: Discovery premiered in the fall of 2017, Paramount has treated us to a veritable wealth of Star Trek stories on our small screens, from Disco's epic that took us through the Klingon war and beyond, to the hilarious animated comedy Star Trek: Lower Decks, to catching up with a fan-favorite retired captain in Star Trek: Picard.
As the title of Paramount+'s fantastic new Star Trek: Strange New Worlds suggests, we're finally going back to basics.
It also takes place a few years before Star Trek: The Original Series, and chronicles Pike's captainship of the Enterprise before the show that started it all turned the job over to one Captain James T. Kirk.
Pike has shown up in various Star Trek properties since then, but has never gotten his own show until now.
In a way, Strange New Worlds is Star Trek finally making the show they had planned from the beginning.

     ‘Strange New Worlds’ Finds the Old-School ‘Star Trek’ Sweet Spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the closing seconds of the premiere of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Anson Mount’s Captain Pike gets to say the lines.
They come right after the phrase “to explore strange new worlds,” which means they were always bound to be the big finish of an episode called “Strange New Worlds” that launches a series called Strange New Worlds.
We boldly go where no one has gone before.” Cooool, every Star Trek fan thinks.
Strange New Worlds, which joins Discovery, Picard, Lower Decks, and the kid-oriented Prodigy, is the fifth Star Trek series active today, one short of the sum of all Star Trek series that preceded Discovery.
Slashing its seasonal episode count to 10, rather than the 26 or more that used to be the Star Trek standard, should help it steer clear of the quality dips and repetition that plagued even the best Star Trek series at times.
