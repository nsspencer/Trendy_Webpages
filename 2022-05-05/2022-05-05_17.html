     Tammy Abraham Fires Jose Mourinho's Roma Into First Ever Europa Conference League Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jose Mourinho remains on course to become the first manager to win the UEFA Europa Conference League after his Roma side beat Leicester City in their semi-final.
He has already won the UEFA Europa League and two Champions League titles.
He said last week that Roma vs Leicester was a fixture that was "too good to be Conference League".
Most of those fans were jumping for joy in the 11th minute when Tammy Abraham headed in his 25th club goal of the season.
That proved to be enough to give Roma a 1-0 win on the night and a 2-1 victory on aggregate.

Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, urged Leicester to pick out the positives from their Europa Conference League campaign even if it has not ended how they wanted it to.

     Roma to meet Feyenoord in Europa Conference League final
    </h2>

     Summary: Soccer Football - Europa Conference League - Semi Final - Second Leg - AS Roma v Leicester City - Stadio Olimpico, Rome, Italy - May 5, 2022 AS Roma's Tammy Abraham in action REUTERS/Alberto LingriaMay 5 (Reuters) - Tammy Abraham’s first-half header earned Italian Serie A side AS Roma a place in the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League, where they will meet Dutch club Feyenoord following two tight semi-finals on Thursday.
Roma edged Leicester City 1-0 to win their tie 2-1 on aggregate, while Feyenoord held home side Olympique Marseille to a scrappy 0-0 draw on the French south coast and advanced 3-2.
The final will be played in Tirana, Albania on May 25, where the winners will automatically qualify for the 2022/23 Europa League group stage, unless they reach the Champions League pool stages next season.
Marseille pressed for the goal they needed to equalise on aggregate, but Feyenoord held on to reach their first European final since they lifted the UEFA Cup for the second time in 2002.

     Summary: Leicester City lost to A.S. Roma by a score of 1-0 on Thursday night in Roma, ending the Foxes’ trophy hopes and, for all intents and purposes, their season.
The former Norwich City man took it, but it eluded all players and went out for a goal kick.
VAR took a look at it but decided that wrapping your arm around a player and holding them is perfectly fine.
Roma won three corners in a row and, with the third, the ball found the head of Tammy Abraham.
As I may have mentioned, the defeat ends our run in the Europa Conference League.
