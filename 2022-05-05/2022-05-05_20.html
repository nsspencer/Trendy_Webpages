     Summary: DALLAS – When former Arkansas Razorback Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys and brought former teammate Jimmy Johnson in to replace legendary coach Tom Landry, the gauntlet was laid down.
'But here’s the rub: if it benefits all of the stakeholders I just mentioned except Jerry Jones, does that mean a deal couldn’t/shouldn’t happen?"

Third, other NFL team owners also do not work for Jerry Jones, but themselves."
