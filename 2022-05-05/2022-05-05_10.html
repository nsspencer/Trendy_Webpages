     Amber Heard Testifies She Felt 'Protective' Over Lily-Rose Depp Because Of Johnny Depp's Parenting Decisions
    </h2>

     Summary: JOHNNY DEPP TESTIFIES DAUGHTER LILY-ROSE DEPP SKIPPED HIS WEDDING TO AMBER HEARD — SEE WHY!
"My daughter was 13-years-old and, as we all know, at 11, 12, 13-years-old, when you go to high school parties you are approached by people who will want to give you drink because they’re drinking," Johnny previously explained to the court during his 2020 libel lawsuit against The Sun.
The Hollywood A-Lister also noted his concern had solely been her safety, and that he had warned her to never experiment with drugs with people she doesn't know.
He shared his advice he had given her to the court, saying: "Please do me the honor of coming to me when you are ready, when you really feel you are ready, because I don’t want your first experience in this world to be with people you don’t know, taking things you don’t know that I can’t trust, so it’s a safety issue."
