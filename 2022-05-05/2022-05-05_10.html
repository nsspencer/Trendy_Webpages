     Grey's Anatomy: Addison Returns To Seattle, But How Long Will She Stay After Surgery Setback?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Addison may have saved the episode with her quippy one-liners, but after a tragedy in the operating room, how much longer will she stick around Seattle?
Addison (Kate Walsh) returned to check on her uterine transplant patient , who we found out was 11 weeks pregnant with her late husband’s baby.
When Kate Walsh announced she was returning to Grey’s Anatomy in its 18th season, she was confirmed for “multiple episodes,” but an exact number was never divulged.
Meredith in the end decided to stay in Seattle — for now — because she could never really leave her hospital family in the lurch like that.
Hopefully Grey’s Anatomy will allow Addison to make the same choice.

     Grey's Anatomy: Meredith Reconsiders Leaving Grey Sloan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I've made my decision," Meredith Grey said during Thursday's episode of Grey's AnatomyThis post contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Grey's Anatomy.
"Meredith Grey, back in neuro, pissing people off," Addison responded.
"​Meredith's plans to leave Grey Sloan didn't exactly sit well with mentors, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.).
Meanwhile, Addison is back at Grey Sloan; tensions rise between Meredith and Richard, and Owen returns to work on a new episode of “Grey’s Anatomy,” THURSDAY, MAY 5 (9:00-10:01 p.m. EDT), on ABC.
If you leave right now your people won't be okay," he said, referring to the hospital potentially losing its ability to have surgical residents.

     Summary: ‘IF THAT’S HOW YOU SPEAK TO YOUR RESIDENTS, NO WONDER WE ARE ON PROBATION’ | As the hour began, Catherine arrived at Grey Sloan with smoke coming out of her ears.
And no way in hell was Catherine going to let her legacy shrivel up and die just because Grey Sloan couldn’t get its act together.
Later, Bailey informed Jordan — in front of Catherine — that she was transferring him back to the clinic in Minnesota.
Meanwhile, Bailey informed Catherine that, hospital be damned, she was taking a vacation day.
Instead, he’d get a place in Seattle, take some time off from the clinic and work at Grey Sloan.

Grey's Anatomy S 18 E 16 Close this dialog window Streaming OptionsThe entire staff at Grey Sloan Memorial is in a horrible mood.
It's his only shot at survival if the residency program is pulled, and Bailey doesn't want that on her head.
Owen doesn't see anything wrong with Leo's declaration.
What's not healthy is the OR where Tova is being worked on by Richard, Meredith, Addison, Schmitt (Jake Borelli), and Bokhee (Bokhee An).

     Summary: She walks into Grey Sloan and very quickly assesses that it is currently a “giant dumpster fire” of a hospital!
Why is Grey Sloan in such disarray, you ask?
After spending the day being told she’s disloyal and ungrateful for leaving Grey Sloan when it is in trouble, she’s had enough.
She’s right about most of it — she has earned every right to leave Grey Sloan.
The tech he’s trying to sell to Grey Sloan?

     Summary: To the contrary, actually: He’s such a good surgeon that Bailey wants to protect his future at a point when the Grey Sloan residency program is in jeopardy.
And at the end of the episode, Bailey tells Catherine she’s taking a vacation day or two.
Meanwhile, Addison (Kate Walsh) is back at Grey Sloan in this episode with Tovah (Meryl Hathaway), her uterine transplant patient.
On the second, he simply tells Nico that he was in pain during his self-exile from the hospital.
So this is all very patronizing.”But Nick contends that he was only suggesting that they stay long enough to save the residency program.
