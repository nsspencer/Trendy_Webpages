     ‘Sheryl’ Review: The High Highs and Low Lows of Pop Stardom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The early trajectory of Sheryl Crow’s career is not entirely unfamiliar.
Born and raised in the Missouri Bootheel, she grew up loving and learning music.
After a fortuitous break — a vocal in a McDonald’s ad — she lit out for more showbiz-friendly environs and got an instant dose of reality.
Crow’s tale of finding a boot on her parked car and being unable to pay the ticket seems inevitable.
In time she found a place in Michael Jackson’s band and its attendant glitz, glam and eccentricity.

     ‘Sheryl’ Documentary Lets Sheryl Crow Fans Soak Up Her Life Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I’ve always had real high highs and real low lows,” says Sheryl Crow early on in this documentary about her decades-spanning music career.
Where the film falls short is when, at times, it feels rushed.
A line from actress Laura Dern about how she and Crow used to be roommates will have you salivating for details, but none follow.
Regardless, Crow fans will soak up her story, just like the sun.

     Sheryl Crow: A Musical Life with ‘My Best Work in Front of Me’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sheryl Crow’s earliest musical memory begins in the backseat of a powder blue Plymouth Station Wagon.
Young Sheryl sang at the top of her lungs the whole way home.
When Crow speaks about those formative years now, it’s with affection for her hearth and kin, her parents’ musical tastes, and their encouragement for her to play piano for friends.
The film is a passion project from filmmaker Amy Scott, who along with her producer Brian Morrow previously put out the superb Hal Ashby documentary, Hal.
Now with Sheryl, they’re able to similarly highlight the elusive qualities and quirks of fame, and what talent can both bring and take away from a life.
