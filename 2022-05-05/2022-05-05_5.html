     Stock Market Today: Dow Keeps Sliding After Thursday’s Tumble. U.S. Adds 428,000 Jobs in April.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks continued falling Friday, after the April jobs report revealed that the U.S. economy added more jobs than expected.
It wasn’t necessarily the jobs report that hurt the market, which just remains in a bad way over broader economic concerns.
In late morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 232 points, or 0.7%.
The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.9%.
This continues a Thursday drop that featured losses of more than 3% for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow and about 5% for the Nasdaq.

     Jim Cramer says to buy selectively and be curious to beat the current market turmoil
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday said that investors looking to successfully navigate a market roiled by inflation, geopolitical concerns and Covid should do two things: buy discriminately and be inquisitive.
Right now, I think a curious mind would be buying stocks selectively, not selling them indiscriminately," the "Mad Money" host said.
He added that curious investors should ask themselves several questions to gauge the state and future of the market.
That means you should buy stocks that do well … in a high-inflation slowdown," he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Base case remains equity lows, yield highs yet to be reached,” Bank of America analysts led by Michael Hartnett said in a note to investors obtained by Bloomberg.
The Nasdaq lost more than 5% of its value on Thursday, marking its worst day in nearly two years.
Getty ImagesThe bond market, which is considered a refuge for investors during periods of volatility, is also under pressure.
Still, the current mood on the market is “paralysis rather than panic,” as investors assess how the Fed’s long-term road map for rate hikes will impact their holdings, according to the Bank of America analysts.
Getty ImagesSo far, the risk of an economic slowdown hasn’t impacted a historically strong US labor market.

     Summary: Not even U.S. Treasurys were safe, with the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.104% climbing above 3% as prices fall.
Indeed, MarketWatch’s Bill Watts wrote that, with the exception of 2020, the S&amp;P 500 has already topped or is on track to exceed annual totals of 2%-or-greater moves for every year stretching back to 2011.

Is this time to jump into stocks, or should investors wait for a better entry point?
The slump in bonds, with yields rising as prices fall, is complicating matters for some investors.
