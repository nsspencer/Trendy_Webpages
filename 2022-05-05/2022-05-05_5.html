     Dolly Parton Contemplating Collaboration With the Rolling Stones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton, who was recently voted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame's latest class, is considering ideas for an album of rock music.
In a new interview with Billboard, Parton said the record may have to include a collaboration with a band that knows a thing or two about the subject: the Rolling Stones.
"I didn’t follow rock music that much, but my husband is a rock ‘n’ roll freak.
I may do up a version of something like [Lynyrd Skynyrd’s] “Free Bird” and do my own versions of some classic things that I think would make good rock ‘n’ roll songs."
Parton also mentioned that she's still unsure about whether or not she will attend the upcoming Rock Hall induction ceremony in the fall.
