     Amber Heard Says She And Johnny Depp Fought Over Lily-Rose, Male Costars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She said that she's always been "really independent" and had a hard time with Depp supposedly pushing her to work less.
Heard also detailed an alleged fight she got into with Depp involving his daughter, Lily-Rose, in November 2013.
Despite those alleged incidents, Heard started to believe Depp was getting back on track and he even re-proposed to her in front of their respective families.
He said if you ever brought one up to me, I'd tear it up," claimed Heard, who said Depp told her the "only way out of this is death."
Depp is seeking $50 million in damages after Heard claimed she was a survivor of domestic abuse in an op-ed in the Washington Post in 2018.

     Summary: JOHNNY DEPP TESTIFIES DAUGHTER LILY-ROSE DEPP SKIPPED HIS WEDDING TO AMBER HEARD — SEE WHY!
"My daughter was 13-years-old and, as we all know, at 11, 12, 13-years-old, when you go to high school parties you are approached by people who will want to give you drink because they’re drinking," Johnny previously explained to the court during his 2020 libel lawsuit against The Sun.
The Hollywood A-Lister also noted his concern had solely been her safety, and that he had warned her to never experiment with drugs with people she doesn't know.
He shared his advice he had given her to the court, saying: "Please do me the honor of coming to me when you are ready, when you really feel you are ready, because I don’t want your first experience in this world to be with people you don’t know, taking things you don’t know that I can’t trust, so it’s a safety issue."
