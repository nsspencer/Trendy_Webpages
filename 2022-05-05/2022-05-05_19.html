     Summary: Just as Toronto had dominated Game 1, the Tampa Bay Lightning asserted itself in a relatively easy 5-3 victory.
The Toronto Maple Leafs, Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames are back in the NHL playoffs.
“They have world-class players at all positions,” Sheldon Keefe, the Maple Leafs coach, said late Wednesday.
For the Maple Leafs to win, they have to reel those penalties in.
The Maple Leafs have stars, too, and so far they have performed well.

     Morning After Thoughts: Tampa Bay evens the series, but they can be better
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After getting dominated in Game One of their first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Tampa Bay Lightning pushed back and tied the series with a good Game Two performance.
“We made it personal.”Spearheaded by a dominant performance by Victor Hedman (a four-point night), Tampa Bay righted the ship.
On the other side of the ice, Hedman got Tampa Bay’s scoring juices going at the conclusion of the first period, and Tampa Bay never looked back.
Toronto is similar to Tampa Bay, a fast and aggressive forechecking team that creates something out of nothing.
Nonetheless, Tampa Bay accomplished what they needed to do.
