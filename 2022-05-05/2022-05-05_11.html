     Kaprizov gets hat trick as Wild thump Blues 6-2, even series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kirill Kaprizov had a hat trick and Eriksson Ek scored twice for the Wild, who snapped back at the St. Louis Blues with a 6-2 victory to even their first-round playoff series at one game apiece Wednesday night.
“It’s for sure helping to build confidence, knowing you can take the lead and run with it,” Eriksson Ek said.
Eriksson Ek broke Blues goalie Ville Husso’s shutout streak at 69:33 when he scored on Minnesota’s first on-target shot.
In between Kaprizov’s scores, Eriksson Ek thought he had a hat trick himself.
A little later on that power play, Eriksson Ek’s redirect resulted in a rebound that Kaprizov tipped off the post.

     Minnesota Wild’s offense comes alive in Game 2 to tie playoff series. Now what?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marc-Andre Fleur makes a save against Vladimir Tarasenko during the Minnesota Wild's win over St. Louis on Wednesday in Game 2 of a first round Stanley Cup playoff series.
While Ville Husso deserves some recognition for his performance in Game 1, the high-octane Wild lit him up on Wednesday and powered their way to a tie series.
Heading to St. Louis it should be no surprise if Fleury continues being the starter while CamTalbot will have to wait to continue his recent dominance.
But in St. Louis, the Wild need to be even better.
The Wild D need to step up their game and limit the Blues scoring chances after allowing 29 last night.
