     House of the Dragon: What Rickard Stark Means for the Game of Thrones Spinoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whatever he’s called, this Rickard Stark in House of the Dragon fulfills the same role that just about every Stark did before Ned rode south in Game of Thrones: he’s the Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North.
If a Stark Lord is to visit King’s Landing, he’ll need a very compelling reason to do so.
And yet, here in this trailer we see Lord Rickard in the Iron Throne room alongside fellow major lords like Corlys Velaryon of Driftmark and Boremund Baratheon of Storm’s End.
And that is the moment we see in this House of the Dragon trailer.
Rickard Stark, Corlys Velaryon, and Boremund Baratheon all promise to be faithful to King Viserys AND to his named heir Princess Rhaenyra.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The dragons are back this summer in the latest trailer for HBO’s “Game of Thrones” prequel series “House of the Dragon.”And things are about to get very Targaryen.
The series, whose cast is populated by a fair number of platinum blonds, is based on the 2018 Martin book “Fire &amp; Blood,” a history of House Targaryen.
So here, we get to see House Targaryen in all its glory, dragons included (see trailer below).
Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, played by Emma D’Arcy (“Hanna”; Milly Alcock plays young Rhaenyra), is the king’s firstborn child and also a dragonrider.
Velaryon, who commands a navy, hails from House Velaryon, “a Valyrian bloodline as old as House Targaryen,” and is the most famous seafarer in the history of Westeros.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We deep dive on the new House of the Dragon trailer.
The other day, HBO dropped a new trailer for House of the Dragon, its hotly anticipated prequel series to Game of Thrones.
This is our first really good look at the series since way back in October of last year, when we got a shorter, less complete trailer; now, House of the Dragon actually has dragons in it!
King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine) names his eldest child Rhaenyra Targaryen as his heir, even if naming a woman goes against precedent.
Like Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon is an ensemble show, but if we had to name one character as the lead, it would probably by Rhaenyra.

     Summary: Have you been as starved for Westerosi content as a dragon chained in the Meereenese catacombs?
HBO has just released character posters of the House of the Dragon cast to get us [even more] hyped for the show.
The character poster I was most excited for after Daemon: Steve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon, the Sea Snake.
As does Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno) aka Lady Misery aka mistress of whispers (and also, like, maybe confidante to Daemon Targaryen … whatever).
Earlier today, House of the Dragon also tweeted a screen cap from an episode of the show.
