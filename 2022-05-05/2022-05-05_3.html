     Jen Psaki is leaving the White House, to be replaced by Karine Jean-Pierre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Psaki has widely been seen by members of the White House press corps as a cool-headed spokesperson with a knack for explaining complicated policy issues.
She entered the job intent on restoring White House credibility with the press corps, following years of hostile battles with the media under the Trump administration.
She also brought back daily White House press briefings that had all but disappeared in the second half of the former administration.
Psaki’s departure from the White House has been expected for months.
Psaki’s departure is the latest departure from the White House communications office to head for broadcast or cable networks.

     WATCH: Jen Psaki holds briefing after announcement Karine Jean-Pierre will become new White House press secretary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday named Karine Jean-Pierre to be the next White House press secretary, with incumbent Jen Psaki set to leave the role next week.
She had served in the Biden White House last year for several months after Biden was sworn into office.

She also worked in political affairs in the Obama White House and on his reelection campaign.
The White House said she is returning to “assist in advancing the President’s policy and communications objectives.”

     Fox News’ Peter Doocy Throws A Curve Ball At Jen Psaki After She Announces She’s Leaving The White House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the hallmarks of Biden Administration press conferences has been the ongoing repartee between Fox News White House Correspondent/gadfly Peter Doocy and press secretary Jen Psaki.
Doocy’s carefully-crafted questions often take surprising turns and seek to frame events in a politically-disadvantageous way for the administration.
Psaki has made her mark in the briefing room with replies that are fact-filled, succinct and sometimes — especially to Doocy — a little cutting.
When the press secretary called on him, Doocy started with, “Sorry to see you go.”Psaki shot back with a sideways glance and a biting, “Are you?” which elicited laughter across the briefing room, even from Doocy.
On behalf of everybody,” he continued, waving his hand around the room, “thank you.”“Thank you.

     Joe Rogan 'Feels Bad' for Jen Psaki in White House Press Secretary Job
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Rogan expressed sympathy for Jen Psaki on the Thursday episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, saying he "feels bad" for the outgoing White House press secretary and what she had to go through in the role.
On Thursday, Psaki announced that she will be stepping down as White House press secretary on May 13 after assuming the role with the Biden administration in January 2021.
Speaking about the high profile position on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on Thursday, Rogan said: "The whole thing is 'gotcha.'

     ‘Are you?’: Jen Psaki raises laugh as Fox News’ Peter Doocy says he’s ‘sorry to see you go’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But that wasn’t the only historic exchange to be documented in the Brady press briefing room on Thursday.
“Are you?” responded a smiling Ms Psaki, while the spectators watching this uncharacteristically cool exchange erupted into laughter.
“And so on behalf of everybody thank you for everything,” he added, while Ms Psaki cut-in that she too believed he’d been a good sport.
As recently as last month, Ms Psaki was sparring with the Fox News reporter, discussed on a podcast whether his questions made him “sound like a stupid son of a b****”.
Ms Psaki is thought to be starting a position with MSNBC’s streaming service, Peacock, after her departure from the White House.
