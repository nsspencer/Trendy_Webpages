     Toronto Maple Leafs Tampa Bay Lightning penalties Game 2 Wayne Simmonds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leafs rue undisciplined penalties in Game 2 loss: 'We've got to be more responsible'The Toronto Maple Leafs handed the Tampa Bay Lightning seven power-play opportunities in Game 2 on Wednesday and were made to pay for it in the 5-3 loss.
"Too many penalties," Leafs winger Mitch Marner said when reflecting on the loss.
Leafs veteran Wayne Simmonds was penalized twice in Game 2, with his post-whistle roughing minor leading to Kucherov's goal in the second period.
"Just being short-handed as much as we were, especially when we got down, it was hard to really get our game going."
Having handed the Lightning 12 power plays through two games, discipline will be a focus for the Maple Leafs as they head to Tampa with the series tied 1-1.
