     Taylor Swift Debuts Snippet of Re-Recorded Song "This Love"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Swift woke up today and chose peace, happiness, and love as we are getting some new music after what seems like forever (but in reality has only been since late March when we heard a snippet of the new song "Carolina").
In an Instagram post, Miss Swift revealed that she has re-recorded the song "This Love" from her hit 2014 pop album 1989 and that it will be featured in the highly-anticipated summer Amazon Prime series The Summer I Turned Pretty.
If that doesn't sound like a Swift type of story, then we don't know what does!
Interjecting short clips of Taylor's newly re-recorded song in between clips of summer fun and dreamy beach scenery, the teaser makes us long for summertime and June 17, when the series debuts.
So join us in counting down the hours and staring at the clock until the hands strike midnight because it's about to be Taylor time!

     Taylor Swift Debuts ‘This Love (Taylor’s Version),’ From ‘1989’ Redo, in Amazon’s ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’ Trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans have a lot of trailer action to take in on the Swift front recently.
There’s just one thing that makes many not too quick to leap to any assumptions: Swift already released one track from the “1989” remake sessions, “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version),” leading fans then to imagine that “1989” would be on deck next, only to have hr put out “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” instead.
In this case, releasing “This Love” would seem less reactive and more part of a master plan.
If it is “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” that will be coming out next, it will represent the possible jewel in the crown of the series, as a fresh look at the biggest album Swift put out in her career.
Han recently signed an exclusive development deal with Prime Video and is the showrunner for the series with Gabrielle Stanton.
