     Dolly Parton Contemplating Collaboration With the Rolling Stones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton, who was recently voted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame's latest class, is considering ideas for an album of rock music.
In a new interview with Billboard, Parton said the record may have to include a collaboration with a band that knows a thing or two about the subject: the Rolling Stones.
"I didn‚Äôt follow rock music that much, but my husband is a rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll freak.
I may do up a version of something like [Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs] ‚ÄúFree Bird‚Äù and do my own versions of some classic things that I think would make good rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll songs."
Parton also mentioned that she's still unsure about whether or not she will attend the upcoming Rock Hall induction ceremony in the fall.

Now she'll take her place among "rock &amp; roll" royalty.

"I was scared to death to send it to Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.
In fact, Robert Plant said he'd always thought of it as a spiritual song, and he was thrilled we'd used a choir on it, because he thought about that, too.
And this, ladies and gentleman, is just one more reason to treasure country music's new rock 'n' roll superstar.
