     Elizabeth Olsen Explains How Her Sisters’ Fame Impacted Her Acting Career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elizabeth Olsen has been making a name for herself as an actor for over a decade, but it wasn’t always easy.
The younger sister of The Row designers and former child actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Elizabeth says she’s learned a lot about the entertainment industry after watching her sisters experience trauma at the hands of the media.
In a recent cover interview with Harper’s Bazar U.K., Elizabeth discussed her loving relationship with her sisters and why she’s protective of her privacy.
“I felt very clear about how I was going to navigate lots of things because of watching them,” she said.
Since then, she’s starred in numerous award-winning films and TV series, even earning an Emmy nomination in 2021 for her role as Wanda Maximoff in the popular Disney+ series WandaVision.

     Summary: Released yesterday, the final Doctor Strange 2 trailer opens with a flashback montage to scenes from the past of both Benedict Cumberbatch’s many appearances as Doctor Strange and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda.
It shouldn’t be too surprising that the Elizabeth Olsen character could potentially fall from grace.
In scenes in which she appears to be acting as a villain, Elizabeth Olsen could be playing a variant of Wanda.
We’re certain to know more tomorrow when Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness finally sees its wide theatrical release.
Doctor Strange 2 is directed by horror legend Sam Raimi, from a script by Loki writer and producer Michael Waldron.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness star Elizabeth Olsen reveals why she thought Avengers: Endgame would be the MCU's first flop.
I do watch myself, I just decided I can't watch these Marvel movies at a premiere anymore...
[...] I saw Avengers: Endgame and I looked around me and I said, "Is this our first flop?"
Given that Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing movie ever up to that point, and is currently sitting comfortably at #2, this is certainly an unexpected admission from Olsen.

     Elizabeth Olsen on Being "Spoiled" and "Protected" by Mary-Kate and Ashley Growing Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elizabeth Olsen may amply protect herself as the Scarlet Witch on Disney+'s "WandaVision," but in real life, her older sisters were a source of refuge from the evil forces of the universe.
During a recent interview with Harper's Bazaar UK, the 33-year-old actor reflected on the benefits of growing up under the wings of her famous twin siblings, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
"I always felt that having older twin sisters was an advantage," she told the publication.
Although all three Olsen sisters were inherently close due to their mere two-and-half-year age difference, Elizabeth acknowledged that her older sisters had an unbeatable bond as fraternal twins.
Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth didn't only look to her sisters for career inspiration; she also garnered fashion inspiration from them growing up.
