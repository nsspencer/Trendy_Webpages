     Minnesota Wild’s offense comes alive in Game 2 to tie playoff series. Now what?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marc-Andre Fleur makes a save against Vladimir Tarasenko during the Minnesota Wild's win over St. Louis on Wednesday in Game 2 of a first round Stanley Cup playoff series.
While Ville Husso deserves some recognition for his performance in Game 1, the high-octane Wild lit him up on Wednesday and powered their way to a tie series.
Heading to St. Louis it should be no surprise if Fleury continues being the starter while CamTalbot will have to wait to continue his recent dominance.
But in St. Louis, the Wild need to be even better.
The Wild D need to step up their game and limit the Blues scoring chances after allowing 29 last night.

     Kaprizov’s Hat Trick Spurs Wild’s 6-2 Win Over Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It’s for sure helping to build confidence, knowing you can take the lead and run with it,” Eriksson Ek said.
Eriksson Ek broke Blues goalie Ville Husso’s shutout streak at 69:33 when he scored on Minnesota’s first on-target shot.
In between Kaprizov’s scores, Eriksson Ek thought he had a hat trick himself.
“I think Moose should buy some new hats for all those people,” Eriksson Ek said.
A little later on that power play, Eriksson Ek’s redirect resulted in a rebound that Kaprizov tipped off the post.

     Summary: Wild Improve ComposureThe Wild weren’t perfect and still have some areas to fix, but they greatly improved their composure from Game 1 to Game 2.
They took shots and set up plays without wasting time, because of this, they were able to score twice out of three power-play chances.
Wild’s Whole Roster Improves DefenseDuring Game 1, the Wild struggled to keep the Blues away from their net.
In Game 2, the Blues took plenty of shots but the Wild’s defense stepped up big.
The Wild will face a tough Blues team heading into Game 3, but after their victory in Game 2, they now know what they have to do to win.

     Summary: After dropping Game 1 of the Stanley Cup playoffs on home ice to the St. Louis Blues, the Minnesota Wild needed a strong response.
With the series tied 1-1 and the teams traveling to St. Louis, here’s a few observations from the second game of the series.
And Minnesota’s penalty killers were better: the Wild successfully nullified four of five St. Louis power-play opportunities.
When a team has as much skill as St. Louis does, I understand the desire to utilize it.
