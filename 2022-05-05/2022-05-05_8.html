     Dolly Parton Contemplating Collaboration With the Rolling Stones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton, who was recently voted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame's latest class, is considering ideas for an album of rock music.
In a new interview with Billboard, Parton said the record may have to include a collaboration with a band that knows a thing or two about the subject: the Rolling Stones.
"I didn’t follow rock music that much, but my husband is a rock ‘n’ roll freak.
I may do up a version of something like [Lynyrd Skynyrd’s] “Free Bird” and do my own versions of some classic things that I think would make good rock ‘n’ roll songs."
Parton also mentioned that she's still unsure about whether or not she will attend the upcoming Rock Hall induction ceremony in the fall.

In fact, Robert Plant said he'd always thought of it as a spiritual song, and he was thrilled we'd used a choir on it, because he thought about that, too.

     Summary: The beginning of a new year often has us all feeling like starting off fresh by taking on better habits, getting rid of old ones, and—most commonly—changing up our look.
While others are hitting the squats and going into the salon for a pixie cut, why not start slow and steady with a cozy winter manicure in a color that feels new to you?
It takes only a little courage to step outside your usual OPI Lincoln Park After Dark or Essie Bordeaux, which is all you need to kick 2022 off on a fanciful foot.
From new wintry takes on classic dark nail colors to unique pops of color that'll have you feeling the opposite of boring, these are the best nail colors to try this January and tick off all the way into spring.

     Dolly Parton on Rock Hall Induction: “I Guess I’m a Rock Star Now”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dolly Parton made headlines when she bowed out of the running for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, claiming she didn’t feel she had earned the nomination.
But when the Rock Hall stood its ground, officially inducting Parton into the 2022 class alongside Eminem, Duran Duran, Eurythmics, Carly Simon, Lionel Richie, and Pat Benatar, the beloved artist accepted her fate, proclaiming, “I guess I’m a rock star now.”“I feel honored that all the people that voted for me did,” Parton told Billboard.
Yet, despite her indisputable impact as a country artist, Parton said she now plans to record a proper rock album — and she might even enlist her friends in The Rolling Stones to help out.
A Dolly-Stones collaboration sounds great and all, but here’s hoping the artist takes up Steve Albini on his offer to produce her rock debut.
The 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 5th.
