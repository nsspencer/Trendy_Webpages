    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a year and a half at the podium, White House press secretary Jen Psaki is planning to leave the White House on May 13, and her current deputy, Karine Jean-Pierre, will be her replacement, President Joe Biden announced Thursday.
In a historic pick, Jean-Pierre will be the first Black, and first openly gay person to hold the position of White House press secretary.
Almost one year ago to the day, Jean-Pierre anchored her first White House briefing, where ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked her about making history at the podium.
"Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House Briefing Room.
She also offered kind words about her replacement as Jean-Pierre prepares to become the new face of the White House.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House press secretary Jen Psaki introduces incoming press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre during a press briefing at the White House on May 5, 2022, in Washington.
Psaki has widely been seen by members of the White House press corps as a cool-headed spokesperson with a knack for explaining complicated policy issues.
She also brought back daily White House press briefings that had all but disappeared in the second half of the former administration.
Psaki’s departure from the White House has been expected for months.
Psaki’s departure is the latest departure from the White House communications office to head for broadcast or cable networks.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he has named Karine Jean-Pierre to be the next White House press secretary.

     Summary: Karine Jean-Pierre will become the 1st Black White House press secretaryEnlarge this image toggle caption SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biden has named Karine Jean-Pierre as his second White House press secretary, replacing Jen Psaki later this month.
She will be the first Black press secretary in White House history and the first openly gay person in this high-profile role, speaking for both the president and the U.S. government in press briefings that are watched by the world.
Jean-Pierre has already led several White House press briefings, including when Psaki was out with COVID.
Jean-Pierre has had a few rough briefings, winding up in the hot seat on days when there were headlines the White House didn't have great answers for.
She is generally well liked among reporters and will provide continuity as significant turnover is expected in White House press operations in the coming weeks.

     Karine Jean-Pierre to become White House press secretary, the first Black and out LGBTQ person in the role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Karine Jean-Pierre will become the new White House press secretary when Jen Psaki departs her role next week, President Joe Biden announced in a statement Thursday, becoming the first Black and out LGBTQ person to hold the position.
Jean-Pierre currently serves as the White House’s principal deputy press secretary.
Last May, Jean-Pierre became the second Black woman in history to hold the daily press briefing.
“I just want to take the opportunity to celebrate and congratulate my friend, my colleague, my partner in truth, Karine Jean-Pierre, the next White House press secretary,” Psaki told reporters at the White House.
But given the new role at the White House, people familiar with the matter say, she is severing ties with the firm.
