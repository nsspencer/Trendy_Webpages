     Does Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Require Homework?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One hallmark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the way the movies and TV shows weave together, enhancing and strengthening each other.
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a.k.a.
(Spoilers ahead—not for Doctor Strange 2, but for the other movies and shows that factor into it.)
You should go into Doctor Strange 2 knowing that the title character has recently tangled with alt-universes.
When you see Doctor Strange in this new movie, it's important to remember that it may simply be a Doctor Strange, not the Doctor Strange.

     After 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,' Read These 5 Comics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sure, last year’s Spider-Man: No Way Home gave audiences a bit of a primer on multiverse-hopping superhero shenanigans, but truly nothing could have prepared them for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
As with all things in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there are many unknowns, but if you’re looking for some possible answers, read on.
The Death of Doctor Strange #1-5 (2021-2022)Marvel’s most recent comic book outing for Stephen Strange kills off the character—and immediately brings an alternate version of him in to investigate the murder.
Writer Jed MacKay and artist Lee Garbett give the murder mystery a magical makeover in this miniseries, creating an unlikely but ideal introduction to Doctor Strange and the weird world around him … even though he is, technically, dead.
When Strange is visited by a mystery man wearing an object of vast and unknowable power, it launches a journey beyond the origins of the Marvel Universe and into realities existing before reality.

     Summary: Photo: Courtesy of Marvel StudiosPotential spoilers for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness follow.
And now, in Multiverse of Madness, our heroes Strange, Wong, and the Scarlet Witch are all poised to face variants of themselves across the multiverse.
All of which basically means one thing for the Doctor Strange sequel: Buckle up for an unprecedented number of fan-gratifying cameos from both within the established MCU and beyond.
The character whiles away eons observing the multiverse — and has partnered with a variant of Doctor Strange before, in the animated series.
Naturally, then, speculation about the film’s reshoots has led to rumors that a few Lokis might magic their way into Doctor Strange and Wanda’s orbit.
