     Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Is Pure Fanfic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One scene in Marvel’s latest offering, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, will surely dominate the conversation about the movie for weeks.
Doctor Strange meeting the Illuminati is just the beginning.
But that’s not the only way Multiverse of Madness feels like fanfic.
Add in a Danny Elfman score that moves delightfully close to Trent Reznor’s territory and it all feels like, well, watching a Marvel movie in another universe.
This is the point, of course, and it definitely makes Madness fun in a way that, say, Eternals wasn’t.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WARNING: Major spoilers below for “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”Benedict Cumberbatch is back in his wizard cape and costume for “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”The sequel to the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 2016 superhero flick reunites Cumberbatch, 45, with stars Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chiwetel Ejiofor, with Elizabeth Olsen and Xochitl Gomez rounding out the main cast.
However, some of the actors who play them made their official live-action debut in the “Doctor Strange” sequel.
Lashana Lynch reprises her notable role from 2019’s “Captain Marvel,” when she played an Air Force pilot and one of the best friends of Carol Danvers (the original Captain Marvel).
Lynch stepped into the “Doctor Strange” role as another version of the superhero.
Alongside Captain Carter, Captain Marvel and Black Bolt, he is also a member of the secret Illuminati.

     ‘Doctor Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness’ Is The 6th Worst-Reviewed MCU Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness MarvelDoctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is being described as “very Sam Raimi,” its director that gave us Evil Dead and Tobey Maguire Spider-Man.
And while reviews overall are positive, and audience scores are high, Doctor Strange 2 is not reviewing well for an MCU movie, in the overall context of generally very well-reviewed universe.
Currently, with well over 200 reviews in, Doctor Strange has a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes.
The Doctor Strange scores are a bit of a surprise, however, given that the trailers looked impressive.
But it’s 12% lower than the original Doctor Strange, and worse-reviewed than Wanda’s WandaVision Disney Plus series, certainly.

     Summary: This article contains spoilers for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
First of all, what was up with the last scene, where Doctor Strange grows the third eye?
The premise of that episode is that, instead of injuring his hands in the fateful car crash depicted in the first Doctor Strange movie, Strange loses Christine (Rachel McAdams).
Was that all in the first Doctor Strange movie?
He is also, according to one primer on the character, “hyper-intelligent and immensely physically capable.”AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementWhy isn’t Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme?
