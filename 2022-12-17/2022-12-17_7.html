     Sharon Osbourne hospitalized after “medical emergency”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Multiple sources (with one of them obviously being TMZ) are reporting today that Sharon Osbourne was taken to a hospital on Friday evening in Santa Paula, California.
Osbourne was also accused of saying former The Talk co-host Holly Robinson Peete was “too ghetto” and allegedly had her fired from the show.
Since leaving The Talk, she’s been working on Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back, a documentary series on the Fox Nation streaming service about her departure from The Talk.
Ozzy Osbourne—who has been married to Sharon Osbourne since the ‘80s, save for a temporary split in 2016— was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2019, but as of a year or so later, he was reportedly doing alright.
In addition to working on the Fox Nation series, which premiered back in September and also features interviews with Osbourne children Jack and Kelly plus Meghan McCain and Piers Morgan, TMZ says that Sharon Osbourne has been spending her time taking care of her husband.
