     Summary: “If they make moves that are going to help us win baseball games, that’s not going to be a huge issue around here,” Hoerner said in August.
“Obviously, I believe in myself as a shortstop, and I’ve said that for a while, and people believe that now.
But [my focus is just to] continue on.
And if we have the issue of having too many good players, then I’ll like that problem."

     AP sources: Cubs, SS Dansby Swanson agree to 7-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO — (AP) — The Chicago Cubs and Dansby Swanson agreed to a $177 million, seven-year contract on Saturday, adding the All-Star shortstop to their rebuilding project.
The addition of Swanson is the biggest of three major moves by the Cubs since the end of the season.
The Cubs also bolstered their bullpen when they agreed to a $2.8 million, one-year contract with Brad Boxberger this week.
The shortstop made the NL All-Star team for the first time and also won his first Gold Glove.
After the team was eliminated by Philadelphia in the NL Division Series, the Braves gave Swanson a $19.65 million qualifying offer.

     Cubs Finalizing Contract With Dansby Swanson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cubs are “very close” to a deal with shortstop Dansby Swanson, and are expected to finalize the deal shortly, NBC Sports Chicago’s David Kaplan reports (via Twitter).
It is the second-biggest free agent deal in Cubs history, second only to Jason Heyward’s eight-year, $184MM pact from the 2015-16 offseason.
Rumors have swirled since the summer that the Cubs were planning to sign one of the “big four” shortstops of the 2022-23 offseason — Swanson, Carlos Correa, Trea Turner, or Xander Bogaerts.
As it turned out, all of the big four shortstops ended up switching teams, with Swanson the last one to land his next contract.
The Cubs already had a good defensive shortstop in Nico Hoerner, of course, and yet Hoerner’s versatility allowed Chicago to explore multiple options around the diamond.
