     Snowfall rates as high as 2 inches per hour could hit Buffalo during Dolphins-Bills game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesTonight’s Dolphins-Bills game could be among the snowiest in NFL history.
According to the Buffalo News, the latest forecast calls for heavy snow Saturday evening in the most impacted areas, which are near Lake Erie south of Buffalo, with snowfall rates as high as 2 inches per hour possible.
Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park is south of Buffalo and about five miles from Lake Erie.
The NFL would surely see delaying the game as a last resort.
And there’s certainly no time to move the game to another location, as the NFL did in November when a Buffalo blizzard moved a Bills home game to Detroit.

Ahead of the matchup, we offer our weekly ranking and analysis of the five biggest storylines:1.
Or maybe Highmark Stadium will be spared heavy snow and it will be just another December game in Buffalo.
The Dolphins need that same kind of effort against Josh Allen, who has been really tough on him since entering the league in 2018.
Hard as it might be, the Dolphins need that kind of effort for the full game.

     Bills vs. Dolphins weather: Miami arrives in snowy Orchard Park with trunks of gear for the cold, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Dolphins are going to feel very much like the road team during their Saturday night matchup against the rival Buffalo Bills.
Orchard Park got a break from the snow in the morning, but things are expected to ramp up again later today.
The Dolphins are doing their best to come prepared for the bleak conditions as they've brought 1,400 pounds of trunks with cold weather gear to Orchard Park, per NFL Media.
In those games, Tagovailoa has scored just three total touchdowns while turning the ball over six times, according to CBS Sports senior research editor Doug Clawson.
Tagovailoa's other two cold weather losses came against superior teams in Buffalo and Tennessee.

     Scenes from a snowy Saturday in Buffalo: Joy, Bills adrenaline and dreams of a white Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, the city's streets and sidewalks remained passable, with no need for driving bans like those issued during the massive snow storm last month.
Residents met this more moderate storm with childlike joy, giddy anticipation for a snowy Bills game and dreams of a white Christmas.
Nick LaMendola and Taylor Hough ventured outside their Anderson Place home to take their dog Woody for a walk.
Between 4 and 8 inches of snow was expected between late afternoon and midnight for much of the Buffalo metro.
"I can remember not having a white Christmas as a kid and being devastated," said Hough, who moved back to Buffalo in June.
