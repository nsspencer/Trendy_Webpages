     Report: Lakers' Anthony Davis Likely to Have MRI on Foot Injury Suffered vs. Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Miller/Getty ImagesLos Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis is expected to undergo an MRI after experiencing discomfort in his right foot in Friday's game against the Denver Nuggets, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
Davis appeared to suffer an injury to his foot in the first quarter of the game when his leg collided with Nuggets star Nikola Jokic.
He didn't return to the game after halftime, finishing with 10 points in 17 minutes as the Lakers went on to win 126-108.
He appeared in just 40 games last season and 36 in 2020-21.
While the Lakers can't realistically expect to replicate Davis' production while he is sidelined, look for Thomas Bryant to see more playing time.

     Anthony Davis Expected To Undergo MRI On Injured Foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers big man Anthony Davis will likely undergo an MRI after leaving Friday’s win over Denver due to a right foot injury, according to Dave McMenamin of ESPN.
A source told ESPN on Friday night that Davis was experiencing discomfort in his foot, but the team is hoping the injury isn’t severe.
Head coach Darvin Ham said that Davis had X-rays performed on the foot before leaving the arena.
Lakers center Thomas Bryant would be in line for a larger role if Davis is forced to the sidelines.
Bryant started the third quarter in Davis’ place on Friday and finished the night with a season-high 21 points on 9-of-11 shooting.
