     Finding Browns Fits in the 2023 NFL Draft: Derick Hall, EDGE Auburn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reasonably agile with good body control and balance, he's able to get skinny while powering his way to ball carriers.
He's able to set the edge effectively as well whether that's separating from the block or working wider, hovering in the flat.
Hall largely operates as a standup edge and is usually lined up over the tight end if there is one.
He's able to collapse the pocket and take away the quarterback's ability to step up as well.
Why the Browns Could Like HimIf the Browns want a standup edge rusher that can also function as a power player, Hall is an excellent candidate.

     The Winning Mix: 3 keys to a victory over the Ravens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They haven't allowed a single 100-yard rusher this season, and Nick Chubb's 91 yards in Week 7 are the most anyone has produced against the Ravens in 2022.
The Ravens are 26th against the pass this year, allowing 250 yards and nearly 1.5 passing touchdowns passing per game.
In the first meeting, Jacoby Brissett was 22-for-27 (81 percent) for 258 yards and a 106.5 quarterback rating.
Averaging nearly 10 yards per attempt should help the Browns move the ball and get points on a Ravens secondary that has had its struggles at cornerback.
If they can play the run well, especially on early downs, they will get the Ravens into obvious passing situations, and that's not where their offense thrives.
