     Colts, Vikings Announce Inactives Ahead of Saturday's Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts and the Minnesota Vikings have announced their inactives ahead of Saturday's week 15 match-up.
There aren't many surprises here for the Colts, as three of the inactive players were announced earlier in the week.
Brandon Facyson was initially listed as doubtful due to an illness, but he was downgraded on Friday afternoon to out.
Patrick Jones II was listed as Questionable due to an illness and has been downgraded to Out.
Every other Vikings' player that was listed as Questionable is active for this game against the Indianapolis Colts.

     Vikings-Colts: 5 things you can count on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The game will also be televised on ABC, so no worries if you don't have NFL Network.
Here's what you can count in in today's game...1.
There's no way Matt Ryan carves up the Vikings when throwing to Michael Pittman Jr. Alec Pierce and Parris Campbell, right?
Indy is allowing 126.2 rushing yards per game, which ranks 21st in the NFL.
If the Vikings can apply pressure and hit Ryan, there's a pretty good chance he fumbles the ball.

     Clinch-chasing Vikings put rebound ability to test vs. Colts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Matt Ryan remains the Colts starter despite three interceptions and a lost fumble in a 54-19 loss to the Cowboys.
The NFC North crown will be theirs with a win, or a loss by the Lions.
I think you’ve got to strap it up every week,” quarterback Kirk Cousins said.
Sam Ehlinger was on the Colts list of ineligible players for the game, along with cornerback Kenny Moore and wide receiver Mike Strachan.
With 125 more yards, Ryan — who was in the same 2008 draft class as fellow quarterback O'Connell — will be the eighth player in history with 3,000 passing yards in 13 straight seasons.

     Vikings-Colts inactives: Garrett Bradbury to miss second game with back tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Vikings (10-3) will have to try to clinch the NFC North on Saturday without center Garrett Bradbury against the Colts.
Bradbury misses a second straight game due to back spasms and tightness that he described on Thursday as a new issue in his playing career.
He said scans have shown no structural damage and that he had hoped to play against the Colts.
Edge rusher Danielle Hunter (neck), nose tackle Harrison Phillips (back) and cornerback Cameron Dantzler (illness) will play after being listed as questionable.
Left tackle Christian Darrisaw returns from a three-game absence following two concussions last month.
