     Vikings-Colts: 5 things you can count on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The game will also be televised on ABC, so no worries if you don't have NFL Network.
Here's what you can count in in today's game...1.
There's no way Matt Ryan carves up the Vikings when throwing to Michael Pittman Jr. Alec Pierce and Parris Campbell, right?
Indy is allowing 126.2 rushing yards per game, which ranks 21st in the NFL.
If the Vikings can apply pressure and hit Ryan, there's a pretty good chance he fumbles the ball.

     Vikings-Colts inactives: Garrett Bradbury to miss second game with back tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Vikings (10-3) will have to try to clinch the NFC North on Saturday without center Garrett Bradbury against the Colts.
Bradbury misses a second straight game due to back spasms and tightness that he described on Thursday as a new issue in his playing career.
He said scans have shown no structural damage and that he had hoped to play against the Colts.
Edge rusher Danielle Hunter (neck), nose tackle Harrison Phillips (back) and cornerback Cameron Dantzler (illness) will play after being listed as questionable.
Left tackle Christian Darrisaw returns from a three-game absence following two concussions last month.
