     Summary: December 17, 2022 at 7:03 AM ESTThere were huge doubts over whether Croatia would even come close to matching the success they enjoyed at the 2018 World Cup.
Mario Mandzukic retired internationally and the players who were in their prime in Russia had moved well into their 30s.
But, led by a 37-year-old Luka Modric, Zlakto Dalic’s side showed that age is just a number.
Dejan Lovren is 33, Modric is 37, Marcelo Brozovic is 30 and Ivan Perisic is 33.
There are, of course, younger players around them like Mateo Kovacic and Dominic Livakovic but those four represent their nation’s core.
