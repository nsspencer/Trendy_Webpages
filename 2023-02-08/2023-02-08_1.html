     League OKs Mavericks’ Request To Remove Tyrell Terry From Team Salary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA has approved the Mavericks‘ request to have Tyrell Terry‘s contract removed from their team salary, tweets Bobby Marks of ESPN.
The 31st pick in the 2020 draft, Terry surprised the league in December when he announced his retirement, citing mental health issues.
Terry played 11 games for Dallas as a rookie and was waived prior to the start of the 2021/22 season, despite having guaranteed money left on his contract.
The Mavericks were on the hook for $1.8MM to Terry this season, but they petitioned the league to have the effect on their cap erased under a career ending injury exclusion.
According to Marks, the league’s decision means Dallas’ projected tax bill will fall from $60.4MM to $53.7MM.
