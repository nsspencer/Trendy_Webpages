     Asensio the seventh Real Madrid player to miss Club World Cup semis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RABAT, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Marco Asensio is the latest Real Madrid player to be unavailable for their Club World Cup semi-final against Egypt's Al Ahly on Wednesday after the midfielder hurt his hamstring.
Asensio suffered the injury in the surprise defeat by Mallorca and, during Tuesday's training session in Morocco, was still feeling discomfort that will lead him to miss the last-four clash.
Forwards Karim Benzema and Eden Hazard and defenders Eder Militao, Lucas Vazquez and Ferland Mendy also stayed in Madrid for treatment.
The winners of Wednesday's match will face Al Hilal in the Club World Cup final.

     How Real Madrid beat Al Ahly 4-1 to reach the Club World Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Real Madrid are through to the Club World Cup final after overcoming Egyptian side Al Ahly 4-1 at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco.
Similarly, Hussein El Shahat was Al Ahly's main outlet going forward, twice testing the gloves of Real goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.
Al Ahly found a lifeline, however, when they were awarded a penalty at the hour mark.
Al Ahly pressed for an equaliser but, with five minutes remaining, Real were also handed a penalty when Vinicius Jr was fouled.
Substitute Sergio Arribas added a fourth against the resilient Al Ahly in the dying embers of the game after slotting home from a Real free-kick.
