     Aaron Rodgers to Broncos? The odds are strong and improving, according to one sportsbook.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The already strong odds are improving, according to one sportsbook.
Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers has +200 odds — meaning a $100 bet would win $200 — to be a part of the Broncos’ roster in Week 1, according to MaximBet.
The latest odds are an improvement over last week when MaximBet put Rodgers at +400 to go to the Broncos.
Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay (both at +600) have the next best odds, followed by San San Francisco (+700), Indianapolis (+1,000) and Minnesota (+1,200).
Wilson, meanwhile, has +900 odds to join the Broncos in Week 1 — the sixth-best odds among the 31 teams listed.

     Dalvin Cook has a hilarious request for Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As the Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers figures out his future, Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook has a request for the reigning NFL MVP.
During each of the last three seasons, Dalvin Cook and the Minnesota Vikings have been forced to watch Aaron Rodgers lead the Green Bay Packers to the top of the NFC North.
With rumors about Rodgers possibly being done with the Packers and joining another NFL team this year, Cook can see the light at end of the divisional tunnel.
I don’t care where he goes, just get out of the [NFC North].
If Minnesota sticks with Cousins for at least one more year, then sure, pencil them in as the favorites to win the NFC North next season.

     Aaron Rodgers and Panchakarma, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After sending Twitter into a frenzy with a cryptic Instagram post Monday night, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday to offer some clarity on his future plans—sort of.
What began as an inquiry into the reigning MVP’s thinking turned into a discussion on the benefits of an alternative cleansing and healing method called Panchakarma.
“I just came out of a 12-day cleanse where you're eating a specific diet and you're going through these treatments everyday,” Rodgers said.
But beyond what Rodgers detailed in his conversation with McAfee, what exactly is Panchakarma?
Whatever the future holds for his playing career, it’s a safe bet that Panchakarma will remain in a central role.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aaron Rodgers is doing a big Ariana Grande–style “Thank U, Next” to his former fiancée, Shailene Woodley.
This is the post Rodgers added to his Stories on Sunday:Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
Woodley has not posted about their breakup yet, but she did post a tribute to the author bell hooks after she died this December.
It’s also weird because Rodgers can, under every circumstance, talk about the conspiracy theories he’s just asking questions about.
Going to the Kentucky Derby and posing alongside other couples is very zig where they have been zagging.

     Aaron Rodgers says there's nothing cryptic about his Instagram post and it's just him expressing gratitude for others that have helped him this season.
"There's nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said.
"When I got that photo from Randall and Davante, it brought tears to my eyes because that's my guys standing before the game," Rodgers said.
Actress Shailene Woodley was a big part of not only Rodgers' Instagram post but also the Tuesday show.
I think that living a life of gratitude is such an important way to keep that joy in your life.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Everything remains on the table for Rodgers: retire, remain in Green Bay or demand a trade.
"There is nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said of his social media post after emerging from a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse his body, if not clear his mind.
Last offseason, Rodgers exhibited passive aggressive behavior during an acrimonious offseason with the Packers.
The timing of Rodgers' gratitude post aligns with the NFL calendar.
The window is open from Tuesday until March 8 with Green Bay expected to tag receiver Davante Adams.
