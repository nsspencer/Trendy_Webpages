     "Let me just put this disclaimer out there right away for the few people watching that are tuning in just for a specific, maybe news, and decision," Rodgers said.
"There will be no news today, no decision on my future.
But no decision about my future today."
"I understand also today, I believe, might be the first day to tag players," Rodgers said.
While he puts off any announcement, Rodgers noted that he's not fretting his future one way or another.

     Aaron Rodgers and Panchakarma, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After sending Twitter into a frenzy with a cryptic Instagram post Monday night, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday to offer some clarity on his future plans—sort of.
What began as an inquiry into the reigning MVP’s thinking turned into a discussion on the benefits of an alternative cleansing and healing method called Panchakarma.
“I just came out of a 12-day cleanse where you're eating a specific diet and you're going through these treatments everyday,” Rodgers said.
But beyond what Rodgers detailed in his conversation with McAfee, what exactly is Panchakarma?
Whatever the future holds for his playing career, it’s a safe bet that Panchakarma will remain in a central role.

     Aaron Rodgers explains Instagram post: ‘There’s nothing cryptic about gratitude’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aaron Rodgers made headlines when he tested positive for COVID-19 and admitted he had “misled people” about his vaccination status.
So it had been at least several hours since Rodgers had been a trending topic when he took to Instagram on Monday night.
Rodgers did not take part in any of the Packers’ offseason activities last season amid reports he wanted out of Green Bay.
Or maybe, just maybe, he simply wants all the attention the cryptic post has generated (you’re welcome, Aaron Rodgers).
During an appearance Tuesday on “The Pat McAfee Show,” Rodgers addressed the post and said there really was nothing cryptic about it.

     Aaron Rodgers' Instagram posts heightens speculation about his future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Everything remains on the table for Rodgers: retire, remain in Green Bay or demand a trade.
"There is nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said of his social media post after emerging from a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse his body, if not clear his mind.
Last offseason, Rodgers exhibited passive aggressive behavior during an acrimonious offseason with the Packers.
The timing of Rodgers' gratitude post aligns with the NFL calendar.
The window is open from Tuesday until March 8 with Green Bay expected to tag receiver Davante Adams.
