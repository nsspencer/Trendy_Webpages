     Aaron Rodgers and Panchakarma, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After sending Twitter into a frenzy with a cryptic Instagram post Monday night, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday to offer some clarity on his future plans—sort of.
What began as an inquiry into the reigning MVP’s thinking turned into a discussion on the benefits of an alternative cleansing and healing method called Panchakarma.
“I just came out of a 12-day cleanse where you're eating a specific diet and you're going through these treatments everyday,” Rodgers said.
But beyond what Rodgers detailed in his conversation with McAfee, what exactly is Panchakarma?
Whatever the future holds for his playing career, it’s a safe bet that Panchakarma will remain in a central role.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “There’s nothing cryptic about gratitude,” Rodgers said.
“You just kind of turn everything else off and so you’re not working out, you’re not straining or anything.
So, when I come out, my first thought is just intense gratitude for the people in my life.”Rodgers’ Instagram post started with a quote: “Gratitude is the wine for the soul.
When I got that photo from Randall and Davante, it brought tears to my eyes because that’s my guys standing before the game, right,” Rodgers said.
Rodgers said he is still contemplating his future and isn’t yet sure of his plans for 2022.

     Aaron Rodgers Agrees to Disagree on His Relationship Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shailene Woodley and Aaron Rodgers.
It was the news that Shailene Woodley and NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers had reportedly broken up and called off their engagement.
All we can do is respect their decision as two autonomous adults …… Unless one of those celebrities is real-life Hoodwinked-level unreliable narrator Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers also said that Woodley makes his life “more enjoyable and tasteful and exciting.” All of this sure sounds like Rodgers thinks he is currently dating and/or engaged to Woodley.
But then again, you can’t really believe anything Rodgers says on The Pat McAfee Show; it’s where he said ivermectin would give him the “best immunity possible.”

"There will be no news today, no decision on my future.
But no decision about my future today."
"I understand also today, I believe, might be the first day to tag players," Rodgers said.
While he puts off any announcement, Rodgers noted that he's not fretting his future one way or another.

     Aaron Rodgers says there's nothing cryptic about his Instagram post and it's just him expressing gratitude for others that have helped him this season.
"There's nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said.
"When I got that photo from Randall and Davante, it brought tears to my eyes because that's my guys standing before the game," Rodgers said.
Actress Shailene Woodley was a big part of not only Rodgers' Instagram post but also the Tuesday show.
I think that living a life of gratitude is such an important way to keep that joy in your life.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aaron Rodgers is doing a big Ariana Grande–style “Thank U, Next” to his former fiancée, Shailene Woodley.
This is the post Rodgers added to his Stories on Sunday:Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
Woodley has not posted about their breakup yet, but she did post a tribute to the author bell hooks after she died this December.
It’s also weird because Rodgers can, under every circumstance, talk about the conspiracy theories he’s just asking questions about.
Going to the Kentucky Derby and posing alongside other couples is very zig where they have been zagging.
