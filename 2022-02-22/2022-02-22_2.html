     Aaron Rodgers offers ‘no news’ on future after '12-day cleanse'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Is the four-time MVP ditching the Green Bay Packers once and for all?
The quarterback’s future remains up in the air after Rodgers’ latest sit down on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday.
Woodley did not attend the 2022 NFL Awards Ceremony where Rodgers collected his fourth MVP trophy.
Despite the individual award, the 2021 NFL season did not end on a high note for the Rodgers as Green Bay lost again in the playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rodgers, the NFL MVP who has made it no secret he prefers unproven, alternative treatments (hello, vaccine controversy) says he completed a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse that typically involves vomiting, laxatives and a whole bunch of other uncomfortable stuff.
"Look that up," Rodgers said Tuesday of the Panchakarma cleanse, during an appearance with Pat McAfee.
The cleanse then moves onto the Shodana stage, which includes therapeutic vomiting to help cleanse the lungs and remove mucus from body.
Bloodletting through this cleanse can include placing leeches on the body to remove a small amount of blood from the veins.
For the record, experts on the subject say you shouldn't do the Panchakarma cleanse without a professional leading the way.

"There will be no news today, no decision on my future.
But no decision about my future today."
"I understand also today, I believe, might be the first day to tag players," Rodgers said.
While he puts off any announcement, Rodgers noted that he's not fretting his future one way or another.

     Aaron Rodgers and Panchakarma, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After sending Twitter into a frenzy with a cryptic Instagram post Monday night, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday to offer some clarity on his future plans—sort of.
What began as an inquiry into the reigning MVP’s thinking turned into a discussion on the benefits of an alternative cleansing and healing method called Panchakarma.
“I just came out of a 12-day cleanse where you're eating a specific diet and you're going through these treatments everyday,” Rodgers said.
But beyond what Rodgers detailed in his conversation with McAfee, what exactly is Panchakarma?
Whatever the future holds for his playing career, it’s a safe bet that Panchakarma will remain in a central role.

     Everything remains on the table for Rodgers: retire, remain in Green Bay or demand a trade.
"There is nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said of his social media post after emerging from a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse his body, if not clear his mind.
Last offseason, Rodgers exhibited passive aggressive behavior during an acrimonious offseason with the Packers.
The timing of Rodgers' gratitude post aligns with the NFL calendar.
The window is open from Tuesday until March 8 with Green Bay expected to tag receiver Davante Adams.

     Aaron Rodgers says there's nothing cryptic about his Instagram post and it's just him expressing gratitude for others that have helped him this season.
"There's nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said.
"When I got that photo from Randall and Davante, it brought tears to my eyes because that's my guys standing before the game," Rodgers said.
Actress Shailene Woodley was a big part of not only Rodgers' Instagram post but also the Tuesday show.
I think that living a life of gratitude is such an important way to keep that joy in your life.

So, when I come out, my first thought is just intense gratitude for the people in my life.”Rodgers’ Instagram post started with a quote: “Gratitude is the wine for the soul.

Rodgers said he is still contemplating his future and isn’t yet sure of his plans for 2022.
