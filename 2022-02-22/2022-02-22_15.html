     In Georgia, Feb. 23 is now Ahmaud Arbery Day.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The state of Georgia will formally memorialize Ahmaud Arbery on Wednesday, the second anniversary of his death.
The Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution this month declaring Feb. 23 to be Ahmaud Arbery Day in perpetuity.
Lawmakers called Mr. Arbery one of the state’s “most distinguished citizens” and declared that he suffered a “senseless loss of his life because of the color of his skin.”The resolution noted two significant legislative changes in response to Mr. Arbery’s killing in 2020 outside of the South Georgia community of Brunswick: a new state hate crimes law and the dismantling of Georgia’s 19th-century citizen’s arrest law, a statute that was initially cited as justification for the actions of Mr. Arbery’s pursuers.
In Brunswick, several events are planned to mark the anniversary, including a march, a 2.23-mile run in honor of Mr. Arbery and a walk through the Satilla Shores neighborhood where he was killed.

They knew what they were going to do," Perras told jurors.
Copeland declined to call any witnesses to testify for Travis McMichael during the trial.

     Federal Jury Finds Three Men Guilty of Hate Crimes in Connection with the Pursuit and Killing of Ahmaud Arbery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Although we welcome the jury’s verdict, the only acceptable outcome in this matter would have been Mr. Arbery returning safely to his loved ones two years ago.
The pursuit passed by the home of defendant William “Roddie” Bryan, who did not know Mr. Arbery, but decided to get into his own truck to join the McMichaels in their pursuit of Mr. Arbery.
For four to five minutes, the three defendants pursued Mr. Arbery through the neighborhood and tried to box in Mr. Arbery with their trucks.
During the chase, Mr. Arbery was running with his hands empty and in plain view.
Ultimately, after Mr. Arbery had already changed direction multiple times, trying to escape from the defendants, Travis McMichael got out of his truck and pointed a shotgun directly at Mr. Arbery.

The murder “was driven by their pent-up racial anger and [Travis McMichael] was just looking for a reason,” Perras insisted.
Trial testimony from FBI intelligence analyst Amy Vaughan revealed a host of racist remarks from Travis McMichael.
Vaughn testified that Travis McMichael and his friends routinely used racist slurs directed at African Americans.
“She was a large Black woman who did not pay her rent very well,” Ballesteros told the court.
