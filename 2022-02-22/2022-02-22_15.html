     Dušan Vlahović video: Juventus star's goal 32 seconds in UCL debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dušan Vlahović didn't waste any time in his long-awaited Champions League debut, scoring just 32 seconds into the first leg of the round of 16 against Villarreal.
According to Squawka, Vlahovič's strike was the fastest debut Champions League goal, edging Andreas Moller's mark of 37 seconds in 1995.
It's not the first rapid-fire debut goal in the competition this season.
Ajax's Sébastien Haller scored just 67 seconds into his Champions League debut this season, the first of his four goals in his debut.
With his goal, Vlahović also joined esteemed company in David Trezeguet and Alessandro Piero by scoring in his Champions League debut for Juventus.

     Juventus vs. Villarreal line, prediction: The Old Lady a vulnerable favorite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Juventus has seen its Champions League tournament end in the Round of 16 in each of the last three seasons despite being favorites in each.
Once again, Juventus is a favorite to advance against a team with much less of a European pedigree.
And based on my projections, Juventus is once again a vulnerable and overvalued favorite.
My own projections make Villarreal a -110 favorite to advance (52 percent) and yet the Yellow Submarine is lined as +135 to advance and is barely a favorite at home.
The plays: Villarreal Draw No Bet (-135); Villarreal to advance (+140).

     Dusan Vlahovic makes his Champions League mark as Juventus held by Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dusan Vlahovic scored 31 seconds into his Champions League debut as Juventus drew 1-1 at Villarreal in the first leg of their last-16 tie on Tuesday.
Dani Parejo scored for Villarreal in the 66th minute, leaving the tie poised for the decider in Italy with the away-goal rule scrapped this season.
Juventus suffered a further blow when midfielder Weston McKennie was forced off in the 8oth minute with a fractured left foot.
Following Albiol’s challenge to win the ball from Juventus’s new striker, the Italians betrayed their defensive pedigree when they gave Étienne Capoue time to pick out a run forward by fellow midfielder Parejo.
The USA midfielder McKennie was substituted after he received a hard tackle into his lower left leg by the substitute Pervis Estupiñán.

     Antonio Conte has no problem with Harry Kane's "great ambition" yet hopes he can be the man to convince the striker to stay at Tottenham.
Kane's wish to win trophies fits with Conte's own plans, though, having been appointed at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium having lifted five league titles across his previous three club jobs with Inter, Chelsea and Juventus.
For sure, for a player and for a striker, it's very important to improve, to beat records.
"For sure, to improve a player to stay in this level is not easy because the space [to improve] is not so much.
We have to train for these three or four months to try to improve and then continue to build something important.

When kickoff game, De Winter took the pitch at fullback, playing on the right alongside alongside Leonardo Bonucci and Daniele Rugani.

     Juventus: Weston McKennie 'suffers double metatarsal fracture in his left foot'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Juventus have been handed a huge setback with reports suggesting that Weston McKennie has suffered a double fracture to his left foot.
Now, Fabrizio Romano reports that the midfielder has fractured his second and third metatarsals, in a serious blow to the Italian giants.
McKennie has made 28 appearances for the Turin outfit this season, contributing four goals under returning boss Max Allegri.
Relegation-threatened Leeds had also been linked with a swoop for the 23-year-old, but no transfer materialised for Marcelo Bielsa's side.
Dusan Vlahovic scored just 31 seconds into his Champions League debut for new club Juventus as the spoils were shared in Spain on Tuesday night.
