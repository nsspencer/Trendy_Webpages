     Going down: AWS may be struggling and yes, Slack and Github are down [Updated]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Update, February 23 (05:00 ET): Things are looking much better for Slack and AWS didn't actually suffer an outage according to its monitoring.
It isn't just you — Slack and Github are having problems and it could be related to a potential — but not confirmed — Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage.
As remote workers come to terms with not having Slack beeping away at them it seems that Github, a service used by app developers as a place to hold code and more, is also suffering.
Downdetector points to both seeing a sharp increase in reported issues of late, while AWS isn't doing too great, either.

“Slack is down which means work is canceled,” one Twitter user joked Tuesday.
