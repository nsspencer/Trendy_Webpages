     In Georgia, Feb. 23 is now Ahmaud Arbery Day.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The state of Georgia will formally memorialize Ahmaud Arbery on Wednesday, the second anniversary of his death.
The Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution this month declaring Feb. 23 to be Ahmaud Arbery Day in perpetuity.
Lawmakers called Mr. Arbery one of the state’s “most distinguished citizens” and declared that he suffered a “senseless loss of his life because of the color of his skin.”The resolution noted two significant legislative changes in response to Mr. Arbery’s killing in 2020 outside of the South Georgia community of Brunswick: a new state hate crimes law and the dismantling of Georgia’s 19th-century citizen’s arrest law, a statute that was initially cited as justification for the actions of Mr. Arbery’s pursuers.
In Brunswick, several events are planned to mark the anniversary, including a march, a 2.23-mile run in honor of Mr. Arbery and a walk through the Satilla Shores neighborhood where he was killed.

     A jury finds Ahmaud Arbery's 3 killers guilty of federal hate crimesEnlarge this image toggle caption AP/Pool, File AP/Pool, FileA jury in Brunswick, Ga., found defendants Travis McMichael, his father Greg McMichael, and their neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan guilty on all counts in a federal hate crimes trial.
Perras said they acted on racial assumptions, racial resentment and racial anger that had been building for years.
They knew what they were going to do," Perras told jurors.
Copeland declined to call any witnesses to testify for Travis McMichael during the trial.
Feb. 23 is now officially known as Ahmaud Arbery Day in the state of Georgia.

     Ahmaud Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, and father, Marcus Arbery, joined hands outside the federal courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia, minutes after hearing the three men convicted of killing their son were found guilty of hate crimes.
"We as a family will never get victory because Ahmaud is gone forever," she said.
While Cooper-Jones was pleased to hear the guilty verdicts, she expressed anger that the family was almost denied a trial.
WHO WAS AHMAUD ARBERY?
The state of Georgia declared Feb. 23 Ahmaud Arbery Day to mark gravity of his death and the subsequent criminal and federal cases.

     Federal Jury Finds Three Men Guilty of Hate Crimes in Connection with the Pursuit and Killing of Ahmaud Arbery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Although we welcome the jury’s verdict, the only acceptable outcome in this matter would have been Mr. Arbery returning safely to his loved ones two years ago.
The pursuit passed by the home of defendant William “Roddie” Bryan, who did not know Mr. Arbery, but decided to get into his own truck to join the McMichaels in their pursuit of Mr. Arbery.
For four to five minutes, the three defendants pursued Mr. Arbery through the neighborhood and tried to box in Mr. Arbery with their trucks.
During the chase, Mr. Arbery was running with his hands empty and in plain view.
Ultimately, after Mr. Arbery had already changed direction multiple times, trying to escape from the defendants, Travis McMichael got out of his truck and pointed a shotgun directly at Mr. Arbery.

     3 men convicted in Ahmaud Arbery's murder found guilty of federal hate crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Three men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery were found guilty in a federal hate crimes trial Tuesday.
Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael and their neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan were all convicted of felony murder and other charges in November.
The two men cornered the 25-year-old with their pickup truck before Travis McMichael shot Arbery with a shotgun.
At their state trial last fall, Travis McMichael was convicted of the highest count, malice murder, and all three were convicted of felony murder and other charges.
However, an FBI witness testified in court last week that records from Travis McMichael's and Bryan's phones revealed the repeated use of racial slurs.
