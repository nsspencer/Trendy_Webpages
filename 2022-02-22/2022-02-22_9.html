    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CJ McCollum, who was recently traded by the Portland Trail Blazers to the New Orleans Pelicans, revealed in a an interview that he has not yet talked to the team‚Äôs young star Zion Williamson.
According to former NBA player and Zion‚Äôs teammate JJ Redick, Williamson is a detached teammate and this episode with McCollum is another example of that.
I was his teammate, I can describe him as a detached teammate.
And the Pelicans yesterday sent out an email for season‚Äôs tickets for next year guess whose name was not in the email.
@jj_redick is concerned with how "detached" Zion Williamson has been from the team.

     5 questions for the remainder of the New Orleans Pelicans‚Äô season5 questions for the remainder of the New Orleans Pelicans‚Äô season by Aaron KellerstrassThe drama with Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans never seems to end and has taken a weird turn in recent days.
This, and his absence from the team during his injury, have led to widespread speculation about his future in New Orleans, which Zion has not helped by staying completely silent for months.
QUICK report:The Pelicans are no longer marketing Zion Williamsonüò¨ pic.twitter.com/6y9Tq8zp2o ‚Äî Fletcher Mackel (@FletcherWDSU) February 22, 2022So what does this mean for Zion Williamson‚Äôs future with the New Orleans Pelicans?
Why the New Orleans Pelicans aren‚Äôt marketing Zion WilliamsonBecause Zion Williamson has been invisible and silent all season, these types of things carry extra meaning and weight with fans.
Like the McCollum debacle, I don‚Äôt think we can make too much of the Pelicans not including Zion on their marketing materials, but I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a great sign either.

     JJ Redick slams Zion Williamson for not reaching out to CJ McCollum upon his arrival in New Orleans.
(1:23)New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson has been absent from the court this season because of a foot injury, but according to JJ Redick, Williamson has been absent as a teammate his entire time in the NBA.
"There's a responsibility that you have as an athlete when you play a team sport to be fully invested," Redick said Tuesday on First Take.
"You're fully invested in your body, you're fully invested in your work and you're fully invested in your teammates.
"This is something I addressed with Zion in front of the team," Redick said.

That is the view of JJ Redick, a former Pelicans team-mate.
"This is a pattern of behaviour with Zion that we are seeing again and again.
I was his team-mate; I can describe him as a detached team-mate ‚Äì that is an accurate statement."

     Zion Williamson‚Äôs ‚Äòdetached‚Äô behavior from Pelicans ripped by former teammate JJ Redick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zion Williamson has not played a game this season for the New Orleans Pelicans.
While Williamson has been rehabbing his injury, there have been reports that he‚Äôs been detached from the team.
Former Pelicans teammate J.J. Redick, now of ESPN, used McCollum‚Äôs comments as a jumping off point to rip Williamson‚Äôs behavior all season.
This is a pattern of behavior we‚Äôre seeing with Zion.‚ÄùRedick described Williamson as a detached teammate when they were together on the Pelicans during the 2019-2020 season.
Is Zion trying to force his way out of New Orleans with the way he‚Äôs acting?
