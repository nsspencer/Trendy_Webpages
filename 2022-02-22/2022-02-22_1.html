     Queen Elizabeth II will miss all virtual engagements on Tuesday because of mild symptoms from the coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
“As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the palace said in a statement.
“Further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.”The 95-year-old monarch tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday.
In a previous statement published on Sunday, the palace did not address whether Charles was the source of the infection.
The palace had previously said that the queen was “experiencing mild coldlike symptoms,” and that she would “continue light duties” over the coming week.

     Queen Elizabeth Cancels Virtual Engagements After COVID Diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Sunday, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had tested positive for COVID but that she would continue to carry out light duties at Windsor Castle.
Today, aides issued an update that the monarch has "decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements" today but said that her symptoms were still mild and that she would continue with other light work.
The update, issued just after 10:30 a.m. UK time, read, "As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties."
A source added that decisions on further engagements this week will be decided in due course, but the announcement may cause some concern as it does suggest that the 95-year-old Queen did not feel well enough to carry out today's virtual engagements.
Since her diagnosis was announced, two messages have been issued on the Queen's behalf, signaling business as usual for the royal household.

     Queen cancels virtual engagements after positive Covid test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled her planned virtual engagements and is still suffering from mild cold-like symptoms after a positive Covid-19 test over the weekend, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said in a statement over email.
She will continue with "light duties" on Tuesday, although the statement did not specify what those would be.
On Sunday, the palace announced that the 95-year-old queen had tested positive for the virus and that she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms.”She is currently residing at Windsor Castle, located just west of London.
The queen recently marked 70 years on the throne, and official celebrations are planned for early June, including a large parade with soldiers, horses and musicians.
Elizabeth’s son Prince Charles also tested positive for a second time on Feb. 10 and his wife Camilla received a positive test several days later.

     London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II canceled her planned virtual engagements on Tuesday as she continues to suffer from mild Covid-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace has said.
The palace announced Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch had contracted the virus.
"As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties," the palace said.
Light duties likely refer to her head of state responsibilities such as reading and answering documents and letters, which she receives daily in her famous red despatch boxes.
A source close to the palace told CNN that the Queen's further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.

     Destiny 2’s long-awaited Witch Queen expansion is finally here and players are starting to dig in.
Unlike players on PS5, Xbox, and PC, those on PS4 weren’t able to pre-load any of the roughly 72 GB update.
Today after Witch Queen officially went live, they realized they still couldn’t download it until they were inside the game itself.
“UPDATE: PS4 players must log into the game to start the rest of their Witch Queen download,” Bungie revealed shortly after the 12:00 p.m. EST launch.
“Sorry to my PS5 friends who will be waiting for me to get on so we can start the campaign,” wrote one PS4 player on the Destiny subreddit.

     After testing positive for COVID-19 over the weekend, Queen Elizabeth is taking things easy and canceling all of her virtual meetings scheduled for Tuesday as she continues to recover from her “mild” symptoms.
While the queen is currently in isolation, according to the outlet, several additional household members based at Windsor Castle have now also tested positive.
The royal is reportedly fully vaccinated and all visitors to Windsor Castle are expected to take a COVID test upon entry.
Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.
Days after the Prince of Wales went into self-isolation, his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall also tested positive despite being triple vaccinated.

     Destiny 2: The Witch Queen Power Caps Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Destiny 2 players who are confused about The Witch Queen's new Power Level caps can use this quick guide to learn more about them.
As customary with yearly releases, The Witch Queen also comes with plenty of new Power Level caps, and it makes it so every player starts at the same base Power Level in order to even out the playing field.
Because there are a few different caps, Destiny 2 players can use this quick guide for reference to better navigate The Witch Queen expansion and Season of the Risen.
The Witch Queen Power Level CapsFor starters, all players begin their journey at a Power Level of 1350 in The Witch Queen regardless of their Power Level in Season of the Lost, and their existing gear prior to logging into the game is automatically brought up to 1350.
This is what Bungie calls Power Level floor, and it is the minimum Power Level one can have in The Witch Queen with regular gear.

     Destiny 2: The Witch Queen’s launch morning: expect queue times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Destiny 2’s The Witch Queen expansion is hours away — or it may even be out by the time you’re reading this — but that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy to log into.
Over one million Destiny players pre-ordered the new expansion, which will inevitably cause some difficulties for players trying to get into the game for the first few hours — or even days.
Senior Destiny community manager, Dylan “dmg04” Gafner, tweeted earlier this month that players should expect a wait when trying to get into the game.
Gafner mentioned that Bungie is attempting to prepare for the massive influx of players on Feb. 22 by stress testing servers.
Bungie’s customer support Twitter account, Bungie Help, will keep players updated on the status of Destiny 2’s servers and any ongoing issues.

     Queen Elizabeth II Tests Positive for COVID-19: Everything We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement cited by the BBC.
She's lived an extraordinary healthy life, with few known medical issues, and her mother, Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived to be 101.
At least one Twitter account reported the queen's death on Tuesday, but that looks to be untrue.
Elizabeth and Philip were on a royal tour in Kenya, and she flew back to England as its new queen.
But in a recent statement marking her platinum jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II made it clear she wants Camilla to be known as queen consort when Charles takes the throne.
