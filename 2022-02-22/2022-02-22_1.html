     Queen Elizabeth II will miss all virtual engagements on Tuesday because of mild symptoms from the coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
“As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the palace said in a statement.
“Further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.”The 95-year-old monarch tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday.
In a previous statement published on Sunday, the palace did not address whether Charles was the source of the infection.
The palace had previously said that the queen was “experiencing mild coldlike symptoms,” and that she would “continue light duties” over the coming week.

     Queen cancels virtual engagements after positive Covid test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled her planned virtual engagements and is still suffering from mild cold-like symptoms after a positive Covid-19 test over the weekend, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said in a statement over email.
She will continue with "light duties" on Tuesday, although the statement did not specify what those would be.
On Sunday, the palace announced that the 95-year-old queen had tested positive for the virus and that she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms.”She is currently residing at Windsor Castle, located just west of London.
The queen recently marked 70 years on the throne, and official celebrations are planned for early June, including a large parade with soldiers, horses and musicians.
Elizabeth’s son Prince Charles also tested positive for a second time on Feb. 10 and his wife Camilla received a positive test several days later.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II canceled her planned virtual engagements on Tuesday as she continues to suffer from mild Covid-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace has said.
The palace announced Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch had contracted the virus.
"As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties," the palace said.
Light duties likely refer to her head of state responsibilities such as reading and answering documents and letters, which she receives daily in her famous red despatch boxes.
A source close to the palace told CNN that the Queen's further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.
