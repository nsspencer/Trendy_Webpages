     Queen Elizabeth II will miss all virtual engagements on Tuesday because of mild symptoms from the coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
“As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the palace said in a statement.
“Further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.”The 95-year-old monarch tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday.
In a previous statement published on Sunday, the palace did not address whether Charles was the source of the infection.
The palace had previously said that the queen was “experiencing mild coldlike symptoms,” and that she would “continue light duties” over the coming week.

     Queen cancels virtual engagements after positive Covid test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled her planned virtual engagements and is still suffering from mild cold-like symptoms after a positive Covid-19 test over the weekend, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said in a statement over email.
She will continue with "light duties" on Tuesday, although the statement did not specify what those would be.
On Sunday, the palace announced that the 95-year-old queen had tested positive for the virus and that she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms.”She is currently residing at Windsor Castle, located just west of London.
The queen recently marked 70 years on the throne, and official celebrations are planned for early June, including a large parade with soldiers, horses and musicians.
Elizabeth’s son Prince Charles also tested positive for a second time on Feb. 10 and his wife Camilla received a positive test several days later.

     Queen Elizabeth Cancels Virtual Engagements After COVID Diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Sunday, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had tested positive for COVID but that she would continue to carry out light duties at Windsor Castle.
Today, aides issued an update that the monarch has "decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements" today but said that her symptoms were still mild and that she would continue with other light work.
The update, issued just after 10:30 a.m. UK time, read, "As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties."
A source added that decisions on further engagements this week will be decided in due course, but the announcement may cause some concern as it does suggest that the 95-year-old Queen did not feel well enough to carry out today's virtual engagements.
Since her diagnosis was announced, two messages have been issued on the Queen's behalf, signaling business as usual for the royal household.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After testing positive for COVID-19 over the weekend, Queen Elizabeth is taking things easy and canceling all of her virtual meetings scheduled for Tuesday as she continues to recover from her “mild” symptoms.
While the queen is currently in isolation, according to the outlet, several additional household members based at Windsor Castle have now also tested positive.
The royal is reportedly fully vaccinated and all visitors to Windsor Castle are expected to take a COVID test upon entry.
Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.
Days after the Prince of Wales went into self-isolation, his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall also tested positive despite being triple vaccinated.

I’m going to get high and watch Euphoria until I remember what it’s like to taste food again.

     Queen Elizabeth II Tests Positive for COVID-19: Everything We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement cited by the BBC.
She's lived an extraordinary healthy life, with few known medical issues, and her mother, Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived to be 101.
At least one Twitter account reported the queen's death on Tuesday, but that looks to be untrue.
Elizabeth and Philip were on a royal tour in Kenya, and she flew back to England as its new queen.
But in a recent statement marking her platinum jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II made it clear she wants Camilla to be known as queen consort when Charles takes the throne.
