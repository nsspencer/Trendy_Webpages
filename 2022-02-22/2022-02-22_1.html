     Queen Elizabeth II will miss all virtual engagements on Tuesday because of mild symptoms from the coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
“As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the palace said in a statement.
“Further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.”The 95-year-old monarch tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday.
In a previous statement published on Sunday, the palace did not address whether Charles was the source of the infection.
The palace had previously said that the queen was “experiencing mild coldlike symptoms,” and that she would “continue light duties” over the coming week.

     Queen Elizabeth II canceled her online engagements Tuesday due to “mild” COVID-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace announced.
Officials confirmed Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch — who has been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot — had tested positive for COVID.
The announcement comes after the Queen tested positive for COVID-19.

     Queen Elizabeth II Tests Positive for COVID-19: Everything We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement cited by the BBC.
She's lived an extraordinary healthy life, with few known medical issues, and her mother, Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived to be 101.
At least one Twitter account reported the queen's death on Tuesday, but that looks to be untrue.
Elizabeth and Philip were on a royal tour in Kenya, and she flew back to England as its new queen.
But in a recent statement marking her platinum jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II made it clear she wants Camilla to be known as queen consort when Charles takes the throne.
