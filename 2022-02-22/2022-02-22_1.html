     Queen cancels virtual engagements after positive Covid test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled her planned virtual engagements and is still suffering from mild cold-like symptoms after a positive Covid-19 test over the weekend, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said in a statement over email.
She will continue with "light duties" on Tuesday, although the statement did not specify what those would be.
On Sunday, the palace announced that the 95-year-old queen had tested positive for the virus and that she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms.”She is currently residing at Windsor Castle, located just west of London.
The queen recently marked 70 years on the throne, and official celebrations are planned for early June, including a large parade with soldiers, horses and musicians.
Elizabeth’s son Prince Charles also tested positive for a second time on Feb. 10 and his wife Camilla received a positive test several days later.

     On Sunday, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had tested positive for COVID but that she would continue to carry out light duties at Windsor Castle.
Today, aides issued an update that the monarch has "decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements" today but said that her symptoms were still mild and that she would continue with other light work.
The update, issued just after 10:30 a.m. UK time, read, "As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties."
A source added that decisions on further engagements this week will be decided in due course, but the announcement may cause some concern as it does suggest that the 95-year-old Queen did not feel well enough to carry out today's virtual engagements.
Since her diagnosis was announced, two messages have been issued on the Queen's behalf, signaling business as usual for the royal household.

     Queen cancels virtual engagements as she is still experiencing mild Covid symptoms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II canceled her planned virtual engagements on Tuesday as she continues to suffer from mild Covid-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace has said.
The palace announced Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch had contracted the virus.
"As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties," the palace said.
Light duties likely refer to her head of state responsibilities such as reading and answering documents and letters, which she receives daily in her famous red despatch boxes.
A source close to the palace told CNN that the Queen's further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.

     Queen cancels virtual engagements as she is still experiencing mild Covid symptoms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II canceled her planned virtual engagements on Tuesday as she continues to suffer from mild Covid-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace has said.
The palace announced Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch had contracted the virus.
"As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties," the palace said.
Light duties likely refer to her head of state responsibilities such as reading and answering documents and letters, which she receives daily in her famous red despatch boxes.
A source close to the palace told CNN that the Queen's further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.

     Queen Elizabeth II Tests Positive for COVID-19: Everything We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement cited by the BBC.
She's lived an extraordinary healthy life, with few known medical issues, and her mother, Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived to be 101.
At least one Twitter account reported the queen's death on Tuesday, but that looks to be untrue.
Elizabeth and Philip were on a royal tour in Kenya, and she flew back to England as its new queen.
But in a recent statement marking her platinum jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II made it clear she wants Camilla to be known as queen consort when Charles takes the throne.
