     ‘Hank the Tank,’ a 500-pound black bear, is wanted for ravaging California homes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     California officials around Lake Tahoe are on the hunt for an unlikely menace: a 500-pound black bear dubbed “Hank the Tank” who has broken into more than two dozen homes while foraging for food.
Hank is twice the size of an average black bear and has reportedly broken windows and doors in communities.
The black bear population has exploded in recent years, tripling in size over the last three decades.
“I was like, 'Oh, my God, there is a bear and it is taking my dog,'” she told TODAY in June just after the encounter.
“We believe he’s one of our neighbors, and he’s only doing what he’s been taught to do,” Bear League Executive Director Ann Bryant told TODAY.

     Big bear Hank the Tank breaks into dozens of Lake Tahoe homes, eludes captureAssociated PressSOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) — Hank the Tank strikes again.
The 500-pound black bear has damaged more than 30 properties around Lake Tahoe, and last week broke into yet another home in an endless quest for a quick meal.
A homeowners association agreed during a meeting last week to allow state wildlife personnel to capture the bear.
After the break-in Friday, officials collected DNA evidence to make an accurate match if they capture the bear.
“You relocate it to the wilderness, and they starve because they’re not used to hunting for food,” Tira said.

     There’s One Way to End ‘Hank the Tank’s’ Reign of Tahoe Terror, Expert Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a spree that started in July, a black bear known as “Hank the Tank” has caused damage to nearly 30 properties in the Lake Tahoe area.
Los Angeles spoke to bear expert Ann Bryant, director of the Bear League, a non-for-profit organization in the greater Lake Tahoe area working to keep people living in harmony with bears.
Relocation doesn’t work, she said—moving a bear to a completely different area leaves them disoriented and unable to find food.
Bryant recommends a little education about living with bears that Lake Tahoe Basin residents need to adhere to, especially the ones that come down from the city.
He has bulked up from the contents of refrigerators and garbage cans around the Tahoe area instead of sticking to bears’ primarily plant-based diet.

     'Hank the Tank,' a 500-pound bear, has broken into two more California homes, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For months now, the 500-pound black bear has been roaming the streets in the Tahoe Keys area of South Lake Tahoe, about 100 miles east of Sacramento.
The South Lake Tahoe Police Department told CNN on Tuesday it believes Hank is responsible for two more break-ins over the weekend.
Wildlife department spokesperson Peter Tira told CNN they have been tracking incidents with this black bear since the spring of 2021.
A South Lake Tahoe police officer's foot next to Hank's footprint shows the bear's large size.
"While the Lake Tahoe area has a healthy and dense bear population, euthanizing an animal is always our last option," Tira said.

     Hank the Tank, the Roundest Bear We’ve Ever Seen, Could Be Eating Himself to His Doom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But we’ve never seen a bear quite as rotund as Hank the Tank.
At an estimated 500 pounds, Hank, a black bear living near South Lake Tahoe, California, doesn’t have the raw weight of his Alaskan cousins.
Since July, Hank has broken into more than 24 homes around Lake Tahoe and torn them apart in search of food.
The BEAR League says at least some of the current bear trouble is due to out-of-towners who haven’t learned to coexist with the animals by securing their homes.
“The BEAR League has offered to pay for everything—transport, veterinary care, everything,” Bryant said.

     (Lake Tahoe Police Department)LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (KRON) – Hank the Tank is bigger than the average bear.
(BEAR League; Lake Tahoe PD)Some locals believe the bear is not only fearless but also friendly.
“Hank is being targeted for death by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,” wrote Ann Bryant, director of the BEAR (Bear Education Aversion Response) League.
So far, they have not reached out to any of the sanctuaries to discuss this dire situation,” the BEAR League wrote.
As detailed in our recently updated Black Bear Policy in California, there are several requirements that must be met to consider placement of a wild adult black bear,” it continued.
