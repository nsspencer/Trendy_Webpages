     ‘Hank the Tank,’ a 500-pound black bear, is wanted for ravaging California homes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     California officials around Lake Tahoe are on the hunt for an unlikely menace: a 500-pound black bear dubbed “Hank the Tank” who has broken into more than two dozen homes while foraging for food.
Hank is twice the size of an average black bear and has reportedly broken windows and doors in communities.
The black bear population has exploded in recent years, tripling in size over the last three decades.
“I was like, 'Oh, my God, there is a bear and it is taking my dog,'” she told TODAY in June just after the encounter.
“We believe he’s one of our neighbors, and he’s only doing what he’s been taught to do,” Bear League Executive Director Ann Bryant told TODAY.

     Petition Launched To Save Black Bear Hank the Tank Who Terrorized California Town
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Supporters of a rogue 500-pound black bear who has rampaged through a California town have called on the state's Governor Gavin Newsom to help save the animal's life.
Adult males typically weigh between 150-350 pounds, meaning Hank is much larger than the average black bear.
He has broken into dozens of homes in South Lake Tahoe Keys but has not hurt anyone so far.
Some Tahoe Keys residents, including the active bear conservation group Bear League, have opposed any plans to harm Hank and instead want to see him relocated.
The CDFW said it would now assess its options but has voiced skepticism of proposals to relocate Hank.

     ‘Hank the Tank’ returns to South Lake Tahoe, damaging at least one home, police say
    </h2>

     A black bear breaking into homes searching for food in a South Lake Tahoe neighborhood is photographed in a tree.
Toogee Sielsch via Los Angeles TimesAn enormous and locally famous black bear, dubbed Hank the Tank, has reemerged in a South Lake Tahoe neighborhood last week.
According to photos and security footage, the 500 pound bear broke into a house on Catalina Drive in the Tahoe Keys neighborhood of South Lake Tahoe Friday morning.
“This bear did not break into a garage where trash was kept that he was sniffing out,” the South Lake Tahoe Police Department said in a social media post.
In 2019, officials said bears damaged more than 75 homes in a single west shore Tahoe neighborhood.

     A 500-pound bear is terrorizing Lake Tahoe. One group says it’s ‘Hank the Tank’ who needs rescuing.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For more than seven months, Hank has been breaking into homes around the Tahoe Keys neighborhood of South Lake Tahoe, the department said.
AdvertisementIn one of Hank’s latest escapades, he “somehow squeezed inside” a home through a small window, South Lake Tahoe police said Friday.
Ann Bryant, director of the Bear League, a local group that works to “educate people about the true nature” of bears and avert conflicts with humans, said in a Facebook post that Hank is “being targeted for death” by the wildlife department.
In light of Hank’s adventures, police said, the Tahoe Keys homeowners association had moved to allow the installation of bear-resistant containers that are often used in campgrounds to store food.
Bryant said the group was “vehemently opposed” to any plan that involved killing Hank because “after all, he is only answering the ring of the dinner bell, as all bears do.” She said she would not be addressing the media further, hoping to give the wildlife department time to develop a plan that “doesn’t involve killing this bear.”

     Hank the Tank, the Roundest Bear We’ve Ever Seen, Could Be Eating Himself to His Doom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But we’ve never seen a bear quite as rotund as Hank the Tank.
At an estimated 500 pounds, Hank, a black bear living near South Lake Tahoe, California, doesn’t have the raw weight of his Alaskan cousins.
Since July, Hank has broken into more than 24 homes around Lake Tahoe and torn them apart in search of food.
The BEAR League says at least some of the current bear trouble is due to out-of-towners who haven’t learned to coexist with the animals by securing their homes.
“The BEAR League has offered to pay for everything—transport, veterinary care, everything,” Bryant said.

     (Lake Tahoe Police Department)LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (KRON) – Hank the Tank is bigger than the average bear.

“Hank is being targeted for death by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,” wrote Ann Bryant, director of the BEAR (Bear Education Aversion Response) League.
So far, they have not reached out to any of the sanctuaries to discuss this dire situation,” the BEAR League wrote.
As detailed in our recently updated Black Bear Policy in California, there are several requirements that must be met to consider placement of a wild adult black bear,” it continued.
