     This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia Promises 'Magic' in Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Milo Ventimiglia knows how the This Is Us series finale will wrap up the NBC drama, and he exclusively told Us Weekly what to expect as season 6 winds down.
The Gilmore Girls alum said the writers are tying up all kinds of loose ends as the Emmy-winning series comes to a close.
This Is Us started shooting finale scenes years ago in order to work around aging child actors.
While the finale won’t shoot until April, Ventimiglia knows what’s coming.
“I think the last day on set will be emotional,” Ventimiglia told Us.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (NBC) — NBC’s “This Is Us” returns with a new episode Tuesday and it’s one that was co-written by one of the series’ stars: Susan Kelechi Watson.
For Watson, getting to play Beth on “This Is Us” has been one thrill, getting to write for her has been another.
“It’s probably my favorite thing I’ve done on the show,” said Watson.
“And that’s saying a lot because so much has happened on the show.”Watson teamed with show writer Eboni Freeman to craft Tuesday’s episode, a follow-up to one from Season 3.
“In all honesty, I thought maybe towards the end, last couple episodes, it would start to hit me,” said Watson.

     What’s your favorite Jack moment?
And I think that’s something that’s important to remember for all of us, is there are things that happen in our lives that sidetrack us or stop us and make us look around and think.
And I think Jack reconnecting with his wife after so many years and having a hard time, that relationship, that dynamic with Mandy Moore has always been the foundation of the character for me.
Milo Ventimiglia (Photo by: Ron Batzdorff/NBC)What is it like on the set this season?
Let’s see, it’s February, we’ve got two and change more months to go, three more months to go roughly.
