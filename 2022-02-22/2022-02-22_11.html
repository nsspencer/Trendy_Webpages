     JJ Redick calls Zion Williamson a ‘detached teammate’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CJ McCollum, who was recently traded by the Portland Trail Blazers to the New Orleans Pelicans, revealed in a an interview that he has not yet talked to the team’s young star Zion Williamson.
According to former NBA player and Zion’s teammate JJ Redick, Williamson is a detached teammate and this episode with McCollum is another example of that.
I was his teammate, I can describe him as a detached teammate.
And the Pelicans yesterday sent out an email for season’s tickets for next year guess whose name was not in the email.
@jj_redick is concerned with how "detached" Zion Williamson has been from the team.

     5 questions for the remainder of the New Orleans Pelicans’ season5 questions for the remainder of the New Orleans Pelicans’ season by Aaron KellerstrassThe drama with Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans never seems to end and has taken a weird turn in recent days.
This, and his absence from the team during his injury, have led to widespread speculation about his future in New Orleans, which Zion has not helped by staying completely silent for months.
QUICK report:The Pelicans are no longer marketing Zion Williamson😬 pic.twitter.com/6y9Tq8zp2o — Fletcher Mackel (@FletcherWDSU) February 22, 2022So what does this mean for Zion Williamson’s future with the New Orleans Pelicans?
Why the New Orleans Pelicans aren’t marketing Zion WilliamsonBecause Zion Williamson has been invisible and silent all season, these types of things carry extra meaning and weight with fans.
Like the McCollum debacle, I don’t think we can make too much of the Pelicans not including Zion on their marketing materials, but I can’t say it’s a great sign either.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zion Williamson's failure to welcome CJ McCollum to the New Orleans Pelicans added to a "pattern of behaviour" that shows the former first overall pick to be "a detached team-mate".
That is the view of JJ Redick, a former Pelicans team-mate.
"This is a pattern of behaviour with Zion that we are seeing again and again.
I was his team-mate; I can describe him as a detached team-mate – that is an accurate statement."
"But as a team-mate, there is a pattern of behaviour; as a fully invested individual in New Orleans, there's a pattern of behaviour.

     The panic alarms should be ringing loudly around Zion Williamson right now.
“This is a little bit insane to me,” Redick, now an analyst for ESPN, said on “First Take” on Tuesday morning.
I was his teammate, I can describe him as a detached teammate,” Redick said.
“I addressed this with Zion in front of the team,” Redick said.
And we have not seen that from Zion… As a teammate there is a pattern of behavior.

(1:23)New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson has been absent from the court this season because of a foot injury, but according to JJ Redick, Williamson has been absent as a teammate his entire time in the NBA.
"There's a responsibility that you have as an athlete when you play a team sport to be fully invested," Redick said Tuesday on First Take.
"You're fully invested in your body, you're fully invested in your work and you're fully invested in your teammates.

Redick, who played parts of two seasons alongside Williamson before he retired, said that Williamson just isn’t invested — and hasn’t been throughout his entire NBA career.
“There's a responsibility that you have as an athlete when you play a team sport to be fully invested," Redick said on ESPN.
