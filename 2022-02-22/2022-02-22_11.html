     Luka Doncic: Michael Jordan knows my name, it’s a lot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic emerged as one of the biggest stars in the NBA.
Despite being an established star, Doncic is still dumbfounded when he meets legendary Michael Jordan.
The Slovenian posted a video of MJ walking up to him and hugging him from behind.
“It’s amazing, I don’t know how to explain that moment,” Doncic said about the Jordan’s hug.
This season Doncic is averaging 27.5 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9 rebounds in 35.4 minutes per game for the Mavericks.

     Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic 'humbled' by criticism over conditioning, owner Mark Cuban says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic scores 49 points and snags 15 rebounds as he leads the Mavericks to a 125-118 win over the Pelicans.
(1:47)Dallas Mavericks governor Mark Cuban credited Luka Doncic's recent dominance in part to the 22-year-old superstar's reaction to criticism regarding his conditioning early in the season.
"I think he was humbled a little bit," Cuban said Tuesday during an appearance on 1310 The Ticket in Dallas.
In his first 21 games of the season, Doncic averaged 25.6 points, 8 rebounds and 8.5 assists with a minus-5.5 net rating, proof of his lackluster defensive performance.
In the 23 games since the layoff, Doncic has averaged 29.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 9.4 assists with a plus-13 net rating, evidence of his drastic defensive improvement.

     ‘It Finally Clicked’: How ‘Humbled’ Luka Doncic Saved Mavs Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic didn’t have the greatest start to his 2021-22 campaign, and Mark Cuban explains how that experience humbled Doncic while also potentially saving the Dallas Mavericks’ season.
A certain level of greatness has come to be the expectation from Luka Doncic by observers of the Dallas Mavericks and NBA as a whole.
SLAM OnlineDuring that absence, there was a focus from Doncic to lose extra weight to maximize his performance.
“I think he was humbled a little bit," Cuban said about Doncic not being voted an All-Star starter.
After moving on from Kristaps Porzingis at the trade deadline, the focus is clear — the offense starts and finishes with Doncic.

     Luka Doncic 'unstoppable' since 'humbling' criticism of weight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Luka Doncic took criticism of his weight at the start of this NBA season to heart and has since been "unstoppable", according to Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.
For the second season running, Doncic was the preseason MVP favourite; for the second season running, the Mavs superstar was accused of turning up for work out of shape.
Doncic himself acknowledged he "maybe" relaxed "too much" after leading Slovenia in a sensational deep run at the Tokyo Olympics.
The 22-year-old vowed to "trim down" and "do better" and has done exactly that – reportedly now at a similar weight to his rookie year.
This calendar year, Doncic ranks third for total points (674), second for total assists (217) and sixth for total rebounds (236) – a response, Cuban suggests, to early-season criticism.

     Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic entered the All-Star break averaging 35.4 points, 9.8 assists and 10.3 rebounds in his last 10 games, including a career-high 51-point outing over the Los Angeles Clippers.
He was looking like the MVP-caliber player many expect him to be, something that Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban attributes to a couple of things.
"He didn't like being called out for his weight and other things and it finally clicked that there's a level of discipline that's required.
All athletes at his level go through it at some level, where things are just easy and you're always used to being the best.
"Once he got a handle on those things it's just been Katy bar the door, he's just been unstoppable."
