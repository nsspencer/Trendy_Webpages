     Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age Singer, Dies at 57
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, a singer for Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age and an integral part of the 1980s and 1990s grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest, died on Tuesday at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
SKH Music, a management company, confirmed his death in a statement but did not specify a cause.
In the statement, SKH Music called Mr. Lanegan “a beloved singer, songwriter, author and musician.”Though his stints in Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and the Gutter Twins never brought him the kind of fame achieved by Nirvana and Soundgarden, other Seattle grunge bands, he was known for his deep, world-weary voice that could take a song to both soaring heights and melancholy lows.
He met the founding members of Screaming Trees in high school, and the band released its first album in 1986, with an aesthetic that married flannel shirts and long hair with angsty songs and rasping guitars.

     Mark Lanegan—solo artist and member of the groups Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and The Gutter Twins—has died, according to his official social media channels.
A statement from Lanegan’s publicist reads, “Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
They started Screaming Trees along with drummer Mark Pickerel, who’d be replaced later on with Barrett Martin, in 1984, and released their first album, Clairvoyance, in 1986.
Lanegan was known for his raspy singing voice, as well as his penchant for dark songwriting, which earned him comparisons to the likes of Tom Waits and Nick Cave, particularly on solo albums such as 1994’s Whiskey for the Holy Ghost.
Lanegan released 12 solo albums, as well as a couple of records of duets with Belle and Sebastian’s Isobel Campbell.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Mark Lanegan, a pioneering vocalist of Seattle's grunge music scene known for helming Screaming Trees, has died, his family and friends confirmed on his verified Twitter account .
Lanegan co-founded Screaming Trees in the mid-1980s, but it wasn't until their sixth album, 1992's "Sweet Oblivion," that the group finally broke through nationally.
Screaming Trees were an influential part of the Seattle grunge scene, where bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Nirvana began their careers.
He collaborated with stars and released solo outingsLanegan's music career took a different path after the Screaming Trees disbanded in 2000.
The band Garbage, which came up a few years after Lanegan's Screaming Trees, praised Lanegan's unique talents in a tweet"A very gifted artist blessed with honey dipped tones, gone far too soon," the band said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, the versatile rock musician and Screaming Trees singer, died Tuesday of unspecified causes at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
From the mid-'80s to 2000 that voice led Screaming Trees, the hard-charging, psychedelic-rock band that got picked up in Seattle's grunge gold rush.
Between albums for Screaming Trees, however, Lanegan began writing and recording solo efforts, starting with an aborted Lead Belly covers project with Kurt Cobain.
The distinction between Screaming Trees and his solo music became more crucial after Cobain's death, in 1994.
Since the break-up of Screaming Trees in 2000, Lanegan proved to be voracious in his collaborators and styles.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, who followed a long stint as lead vocalist for the proto-grunge band Screaming Trees with a distinguished career as an impassioned solo singer-songwriter and adventurous collaborator with Queens of the Stone Age and others, has died.
“Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland,” reads a statement on his Twitter account.
The family asks everyone to respect their privacy at this time.”Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
His ongoing conflict with Gary Lee Conner, which often devolved into physical altercations, ultimately led to the breakup of Screaming Trees, who had failed to capitalize on the success of “Sweet Oblivion,” in 2000.
Thus, eight years after the release of “Bubblegum,” Lanegan returned to solo work with the compelling and sonically eclectic “Blues Funeral,” a one-off for England’s 4AD.

Slack and similar services emerged as essential tools for office workers to stay connected to their colleagues during the pandemic.
“Slack is down which means work is canceled,” one Twitter user joked Tuesday.
Outage tracking website Down Detector showed problem reports about Slack spiking around 9:30 am ET, before tapering off slightly.
Shortly after noon ET, Slack said it was “seeing signs of improvement.” And just before 2:30 pm ET, Slack said it had fully resolved the issue, but it didn’t offer any explanation for the outage.
