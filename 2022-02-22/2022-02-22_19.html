     Are Daft Punk back? Something seems to be going on with their social media accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Something appears to be going on with Daft Punk.
At the time, they posted an eight-minute-long video, titled ‘Epilogue’, alongside confirmation from the band’s publicist they were calling it a day.
Today, their Instagram and Twitter accounts have sparked back into life.
To date, they’ve posted two images, which you can check out below.
Originally forming back in 1993, Daft Punk released their debut album ‘Homework’ in 1997.

     Daft Punk streamed a 1997 concert on Twitch, and it may have been your only chance to see it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Daft Punk may have announced their split exactly one year ago today, but the famous electronic music duo made a surprise reappearance on the internet Tuesday and streamed footage from a 1997 concert on Twitch.
The stream featured footage from a concert Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the two people behind Daft Punk, played at a Los Angeles nightclub near the release of the band’s debut Homework album, according to Pitchfork.
Daft Punk also announced a 25th anniversary vinyl reissue of the album, and after the concert ended, posted that the reissue is available on streaming services, too.
While it’s unclear if this is the beginning of more from Daft Punk, you might want to follow the group’s accounts on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook just in case.
Update February 22nd, 6:57PM ET: The stream on Twitch has ended.

     Daft Punk Reissuing Homework on Vinyl, Livestreamed Rare 1997 Concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today, on the first anniversary of their breakup, Daft Punk are airing a one-off stream of a rare 1997 concert, recorded before they began wearing helmets.
The duo has also announced a vinyl reissue of its landmark debut album, Homework, for its 25th anniversary.
The Homework vinyl LP and a vinyl reissue of Alive ’97 are out April 15.
Homework (25th Anniversary Edition), which will also get released digitally, includes numerous remixes.
Daft Punk called it quits a year ago today, eight years after releasing their final album, Random Access Memories.

     Leave your robot mask off and put on your disconcerting dog mask: It’s time to go back to Daft Punk’s Homework era—when Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter were just human DJs and not cool robots (historians will recall that they became robots on 9/9/99 for the album Discovery).
AdvertisementAs for the box set, it’s available digitally right now and includes 15 remixes of songs off Homework—most of which have never been available on streaming services, according to Variety.
The vinyl version of Homework (25th Anniversary Edition) and a vinyl reissue of Alive 97 will be available on April 15.
The track list for new version of Homework is below.

Daft Punk have also announced a vinyl reissue of Homework in celebration of the seminal album's 25th anniversary.
