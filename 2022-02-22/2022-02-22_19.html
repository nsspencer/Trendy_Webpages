     YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Lil Durk Seemingly Trade Shots on Newly Released Songs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The ongoing feud between Youngboy Never Broke Again and Lil Durk continues as the two rappers trade insults in new bars aimed at each other.
After Durk seemingly took shots at Youngboy and his ex-girlfriend on his recent song “AHHH HA,” Youngboy responded by dropping a diss track of his own, “I Hate Youngboy,” where he takes aim at Durk, his fiancée India, Gucci Mane, King Von, and several other artists and industry figures.
Later in the same verse, Youngboy also reference’s Durks diss song as well as the track “Rumors” he made with Gucci Mane, sending shots at the rap vet as well.
“Used to fuck with Gucci ‘til I seen he like them pussy niggas,” he raps.
Youngboy dedicates the end of the song to call out several other artists and facets of the industry that he does not enjoy, including Boosie, Youtube streamers, Apple, Chinese Kitty, and more.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On the bright side, Durk has given fans “AHHH HA,” a punishing new track loaded with intrigue.
Produced by Southside, “AHHH HA” opens with a disclaimer that doesn’t seem 100% genuine.
Don’t respond to shit with Von (Yeah, yeah, yeah)I’m like, “Fuck it, you tripping, go get your gun” (Let’s get it, yeah, gun)A few lines later, Durk reminds us that actions speak louder than social media posts.
They dropping locations, I’m getting it done (Woo, woo, woo, gang)Fuck tweeting, we sliding, the feds will come (Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, what?)
