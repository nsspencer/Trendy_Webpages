     AVERAGE GAS PRICES GO UP IN PA, ACROSS US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The average cost of a gallon of gas in Pennsylvania and the United States continues to go up.
The hike in crude oil prices is offsetting a decrease in demand for gas, which normally would help drive the price of gas down.
Over the last month, gas prices in Pennsylvania have gone up 21 cents.
Last year at this time, gas prices were at $2.90 a gallon.
Gas prices in Indiana Borough, White Township, Homer City, Shelocta, Clymer and Blairsville are all at $3.69 a gallon this morning.

     'The weeks ahead could be rather ugly': Gas prices are continuing to climb in Ohio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gas prices have hit their highest average in Ohio since September 2014, according to a study from GasBuddy.
Prices currently average $3.33 in the state, which is lower than the national average of $3.52.
The national average is up 20.7 cents from a month ago and 88.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago.
Why gas prices could go even higherDe Haan added that a traditional rise in gas during the spring season could drive gas prices even higher.
"The weeks ahead could be rather ugly with rising prices, especially if Russia pursues a strong-arm invasion of Ukraine.”Where to find current gas pricesFor a complete listing of all 50 state averages, please visit https://www.gasbuddy.com/usa.

     The average price of a gallon of gas in Multnomah County is $3.928, according to the U.S. National Gas Station Price Heat Map at GasBuddy.com, though prices at many gas stations in Portland are comfortably over $4.
The average gallon in Jackson County costs $4.149.
At least you’re not in California, where the average gallon is going for $4.27 right now.
Last year at this time, average gas prices in the U.S. stood at $2.64 per gallon, AAA states.
The threat of war in Europe, with major oil- and- gas producer Russia on the verge of invading Ukraine, is having an impact on prices.

     Gas prices soar to record levels in California amid Ukraine crisis, tax hikes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Analysts are warning motorists in California to hold on to their wallets as a host of factors will take already record-high gas prices to new levels.
The state averaged $4.742 a gallon on Tuesday, about $1.20 more than the national average, according to AAA.
Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which tracks gas prices across the nation, told ABC News that the statewide average is likely to cross the $5 a gallon average threshold soon.
California's regulations have also affected prices, specifically its gas tax of 51.1 cents per gallon, according to De Haan.
Gavin Newsom has proposed to halt a scheduled gas tax increase, but has not received support from Democratic members of the state legislature, the Associated Press reported.

     Gas Buddy is predicting those gas prices will keep going up as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues.
“The concern is that they could disrupt or slow down oil exports to inflict a good bit of pain on the global economy," said De Haan.
Gas Buddy representatives predict people could be paying an extra .70 cents per gallon by Memorial Day.
But adding those higher prices could actually help drive costs down in the long run.
"The higher prices go, the more Americans want to stay home and stop filling up.

     AAA: Gas prices soar in southern Ohio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The average price of gasoline across South Central Ohio is nine cents higher this week at $3.357 per gallon, according to AAA East Central’s Gas Price Report.
According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 1.3 million barrels to 247.1 million barrels last week.
On the other hand, gasoline demand fell from 9.13 million barrels per day to 8.57 million barrels per day.
Typically, a decrease in gas demand during the winter would put downward pressure on pump prices, but elevated crude prices continue to push pump prices higher.

     Russia-Ukraine Crisis Will Cause Prices On Gas And Other Items To Go Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At the gas pump Tuesday night, people in Newton were not thrilled by the knowledge that already high gas prices will likely rise.
“[It’s] not just the price of driving, the price of a lot of goods will go up when the price of oil goes up.
How steeply prices will rise and for how long is unclear and is contingent upon the ongoing uncertainty in Ukraine.
“I think if we were told tomorrow ‘that’s it, that’s as far as [sanctions are] going to go,’ oil prices will come back down and things will calm down,” Gruber explained.
“I think [prices] will remain unstable as long as we are uncertain, and I don’t see that uncertainty resolving any time soon.”

A year ago, gas prices hovered around $3.573 a gallon in the state.
Chief among the reasons for the nationwide climb in gas prices is the threat of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
That could send gasoline prices up by an additional 10%, said Shon Hiatt, an associate professor of management and organization at USC’s Marshall School of Business.
In an address Tuesday announcing sanctions against Russia, President Biden said the White House would work to keep gas prices from skyrocketing.

     Oil prices are surging toward $100 a barrel.
Here's what to know as crude oil prices hover within striking distance of the triple digits last seen in 2014.
Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and natural gas, accounting for 17% of the world's natural gas and 12% of its oil.
Surging oil prices benefit oil producers, but they raise costs for everyone else.
This is a messy situation, and high oil prices add to the muddle.
