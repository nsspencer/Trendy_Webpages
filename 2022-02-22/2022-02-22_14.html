     White Supremacists Found Guilty of Federal Hate Crimes Against Ahmaud Arbery

     Our federal hate crimes laws exist for horrific events like this.
We must defend communities targeted for hate and confront white supremacy as the scourge on society it is.
The three men were indicted on federal hate crimes and attempted kidnapping charges by a federal grand jury in April of this year.

     Three Men Are Found Guilty of Hate Crimes in Arbery Killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The department tends to be careful in selecting such cases, pursuing 17 percent of the hate crime incidents it was presented between 2005 and 2019.
When the department does decide to prosecute, the cases usually end with defendants pleading guilty.
She has not yet sentenced the men in the trial that ended on Tuesday, and it was uncertain whether they would start serving their time in a state prison for the murders or in a federal prison for the hate crimes.
On Feb. 23, 2020, the three men used a pair of trucks to chase Mr. Arbery, who was running through their neighborhood, until the younger Mr. McMichael shot him three times at close range with a 12-gauge shotgun.
Balbo, told the jury that Mr. McMichael had not been out to hunt down a Black person that day, but rather to go after Mr. Arbery specifically, after a police officer showed him security camera images of Mr. Arbery entering a nearby house that was under construction.

They knew what they were going to do," Perras told jurors.
Copeland declined to call any witnesses to testify for Travis McMichael during the trial.

     Federal Jury Finds Three Men Guilty of Hate Crimes in Connection with the Pursuit and Killing of Ahmaud Arbery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Although we welcome the jury’s verdict, the only acceptable outcome in this matter would have been Mr. Arbery returning safely to his loved ones two years ago.
The pursuit passed by the home of defendant William “Roddie” Bryan, who did not know Mr. Arbery, but decided to get into his own truck to join the McMichaels in their pursuit of Mr. Arbery.
For four to five minutes, the three defendants pursued Mr. Arbery through the neighborhood and tried to box in Mr. Arbery with their trucks.
During the chase, Mr. Arbery was running with his hands empty and in plain view.
Ultimately, after Mr. Arbery had already changed direction multiple times, trying to escape from the defendants, Travis McMichael got out of his truck and pointed a shotgun directly at Mr. Arbery.

Advertisement“Tomorrow will be the two-year mark for when their son Ahmaud Arbery was lynched for jogging while Black,” Crump said.
Lyons was heard whispering to one of her co-counsel that the verdict was personal for her, as the mother of a Black son.
She has since been accused of showing favoritism toward Gregory McMichael and directing that his son should not be arrested.
