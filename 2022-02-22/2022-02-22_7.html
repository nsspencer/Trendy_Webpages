     Mark Lanegan, 57, Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age Singer, Dies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, a singer for Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age and an integral part of the 1980s and 1990s grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest, died on Tuesday at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
SKH Music, a management company, confirmed his death in a statement but did not specify a cause.
In the statement, SKH Music called Mr. Lanegan “a beloved singer, songwriter, author and musician.”Though his stints in the bands Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and the Gutter Twins never brought him the kind of fame achieved by Nirvana and Soundgarden, other Seattle grunge bands, he was known for his scratchy yet full-bodied voice that could take a song to both soaring heights and melancholy lows.
Mr. Lanegan’s voice was a defining element of hits like Screaming Trees’ 1992 song “Nearly Lost You” and Queens of the Stone Age’s 2000 record “Feel Good Hit of the Summer.” He wrote candidly about drugs and a self-destructive lifestyle.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Mark Lanegan, a pioneering vocalist of Seattle's grunge music scene known for helming Screaming Trees, has died, his family and friends confirmed on his verified Twitter account .
Lanegan co-founded Screaming Trees in the mid-1980s, but it wasn't until their sixth album, 1992's "Sweet Oblivion," that the group finally broke through nationally.
Screaming Trees were an influential part of the Seattle grunge scene, where bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Nirvana began their careers.
He collaborated with stars and released solo outingsLanegan's music career took a different path after the Screaming Trees disbanded in 2000.
The band Garbage, which came up a few years after Lanegan's Screaming Trees, praised Lanegan's unique talents in a tweet"A very gifted artist blessed with honey dipped tones, gone far too soon," the band said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, who followed a long stint as lead vocalist for the proto-grunge band Screaming Trees with a distinguished career as an impassioned solo singer-songwriter and adventurous collaborator with Queens of the Stone Age and others, has died.
“Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland,” reads a statement on his Twitter account.
“A beloved singer, songwriter, author and musician he was 57 and is survived by his wife Shelley.
His ongoing conflict with Gary Lee Conner, which often devolved into physical altercations, ultimately led to the breakup of Screaming Trees in 2000.
Thus, eight years after the release of “Bubblegum,” Lanegan returned to solo work with the compelling and sonically eclectic “Blues Funeral,” a one-off for England’s 4AD.

     Mark Lanegan—solo artist and member of the groups Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and The Gutter Twins—has died, according to his official social media channels.
A statement from Lanegan’s publicist reads, “Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
They started Screaming Trees along with drummer Mark Pickerel, who’d be replaced later on with Barrett Martin, in 1984, and released their first album, Clairvoyance, in 1986.
Lanegan was known for his raspy singing voice, as well as his penchant for dark songwriting, which earned him comparisons to the likes of Tom Waits and Nick Cave, particularly on solo albums such as 1994’s Whiskey for the Holy Ghost.
Lanegan released 12 solo albums, as well as a couple of records of duets with Belle and Sebastian’s Isobel Campbell.

     Mark Lanegan, Grunge Pioneer and Screaming Trees Singer, Dead at 57
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, the gruff-voiced singer who fronted Screaming Trees before embarking on a successful solo career, has died.
Lanegan rose to prominence in the late Eighties and early Nineties as frontman for Screaming Trees, the psychedelic-leaning, Ellensburg, Washington hard-rock group that foreshadowed grunge.
Thank god that through all of that he will live forever.”“May you truly rest in peace, big brother,” former Screaming Trees drummer Mark Pickerel tweeted.
“I was not a great influence on Layne, but [drugs] were a mutual thing,” Lanegan told Rolling Stone.
I got no pleasure or anything out of music: Music that I had loved before, new music, music on the radio, any kind of music — I did not want to hear it.

     Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees singer and voracious collaborator, dies at 57Enlarge this image toggle caption Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images Sylvain Lefevre/Getty ImagesMark Lanegan, the versatile rock musician and Screaming Trees singer, died Tuesday of unspecified causes at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
From the mid-'80s to 2000 that voice led Screaming Trees, the hard-charging, psychedelic-rock band that got picked up in Seattle's grunge gold rush.
Between albums for Screaming Trees, however, Lanegan began writing and recording solo efforts, starting with an aborted Lead Belly covers project with Kurt Cobain.
The distinction between Screaming Trees and his solo music became more crucial after Cobain's death, in 1994.
Since the break-up of Screaming Trees in 2000, Lanegan proved to be voracious in his collaborators and styles.
