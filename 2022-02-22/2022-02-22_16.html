     The Russia Issue Is Hurting the Stock Market. How Things Could Get Worse.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While stocks are reeling in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there isn’t full-blown panic.
Several developments need to occur for the stock market to take another nosedive.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%, 1%, and 1.2%, respectively.
But that was well up from the lows of the day for all three indexes.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday fell into a correction for the first time in two years, joining the Nasdaq Composite, as Russia sent troops into pro-Russian regions in Ukraine.
The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -1.01% ended down 1% at 4,304.76, below the correction level at 4,316.91, which would represent a 10% drop from its Jan. 3 record close.
A correction is commonly defined by market technicians as a fall of at least 10% (but not greater than 20%) from a recent peak.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Any feelings of relaxation from the long holiday weekend were snuffed out Monday, as the worsening Ukraine-Russia conflict sent the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory for the first time since 2020.
Over the weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops to enter areas of eastern Ukraine – a move that President Joe Biden dubbed an "invasion" and was met with international sanctions.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonBENGALURU, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Global stock markets were already headed for a volatile year with modest gains even before the latest escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, according to a Reuters poll of around 120 equity market analysts and brokers around the world.
Most major stock market indexes are in the red for the year or barely up.
The UK's FTSE 100 index was the only major index to be upgraded.

     The S&amp;P 500 more than doubled between late March 2020 and early January, when it set its last all-time high.
The larger fear, which always accompanies a correction, is that a correction could augur a bear market, which is what Wall Street defines as a stock-index drop of at least 20%.
Much of this drop is the result of fears about an abrupt shift to higher interest rates.
Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&amp;P 500 suffered five corrections, according to CFRA.
That sent the S&amp;P 500 on a breathtaking drop of nearly 34% in about a month.

     Fox News' Neil Cavuto Was in the ICU with COVID Due to His 'Very Compromised Immune System'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The host of Your World with Neil Cavuto, 63, was back on air for the first time in weeks on Monday after finally recovering from COVID-19.
Cavuto is fully vaccinated and previously tested positive for the virus in October, but has a "very compromised immune system" because he has multiple sclerosis, underwent triple bypass heart surgery in 2016 and is in remission from stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma.
"I did get COVID again — but a far more serious strand, what doctors call COVID pneumonia.
Cavuto explained that the vaccine did not make him sick, and that it's his immune system that's at fault.
"No, the vaccine didn't cause this … my very compromised immune system did," he said.
