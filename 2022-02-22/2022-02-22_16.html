     ‘It was touch-and-go’: Fox News host Neil Cavuto says he nearly died from COVID-19
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News host Neil Cavuto has returned to work after surviving a bout of COVID-19 and pneumonia that he says included time in an intensive care unit and some “touch-and-go” periods.
Cavuto, who hosts the 4 p.m. Eastern hour on Fox News Channel and a two-hour program at noon on the Fox Business Network, was back on the air Monday after being off since the week of Jan. 10.
Cavuto, 63, is a cancer survivor who has multiple sclerosis and said he was vulnerable to the coronavirus despite being vaccinated.
“It really was touch-and-go,” Cavuto said.
He read portions of letters from some viewers, including a woman named Janice who wrote, “dead or alive, as long as he isn’t on my TV, it’s a good day.”“Well then, sorry about today, Janice,” Cavuto said.

     Fox's Neil Cavuto reveals another Covid bout that nearly killed him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fox Business News anchor Neil Cavuto on Monday revealed that he survived another bout with Covid-19, saying this one nearly killed him but didn't due to vaccinations against the deadly virus.
“It landed me in intensive care for quite a while and it really was touch and go,” Cavuto said.
But no, the vaccine didn’t cause that.”As a cancer survivor who has battled multiple sclerosis for decades, the immunocompromised Cavuto doesn’t sustain full protection of Covid vaccines.
“But let me be clear, doctors say had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn’t be here,” Cavuto said.
Nearly 69 percent of Americans 5 and older have received at least two shots of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or one dose by Johnson &amp; Johnson, according to a rolling CDC count.

     Fox Business host Neil Cavuto returned after an unexplained, five-week absence to reveal he almost died of Covid-19.
The latest infection caused Covid-induced pneumonia, he said, insisting that the vaccine saved his life while hitting back at speculation he had died due to injection.
Mr Cavuto has received treatment for cancer, undergone open-heart surgery, and suffers from multiple sclerosis, making him immunocompromised.
He has previously encouraged Fox viewers to get the vaccine, and said had he “wouldn’t be here” had he not been vaccinated.
"It provided some defence, but that is still better than no defence, maybe not great comfort for some of you, and frankly not great comfort for me either," he said.

     Lauding vaccines, Fox's Neil Cavuto says a 2nd bout of COVID nearly killed himEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Drew/AP Richard Drew/APVeteran Fox Business host Neil Cavuto's extended, unexplained absence from the network over the past five weeks has raised questions for many viewers — some wondered whether something sinister was afoot, others feared he had suddenly died.
Cavuto, who has multiple sclerosis and survived stage 4 cancer and open-heart surgery, counted himself among the roughly 3% of Americans who has a weakened immune system and "cannot sustain the full benefits" of the COVID-19 vaccine.
A Fox spokesperson confirmed over email that Cavuto addressed his absence on Fox News Channel's Your World with Neil Cavuto as well as Fox Business Network's Cavuto: Coast to Coast.
Cavuto was careful to stress that he was "not here to debate vaccinations for you, just offer an explanation for me."
Some 64% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to NPR's vaccine tracker — check on your state here.

     The host of Your World with Neil Cavuto, 63, was back on air for the first time in weeks on Monday after finally recovering from COVID-19.
Cavuto is fully vaccinated and previously tested positive for the virus in October, but has a "very compromised immune system" because he has multiple sclerosis, underwent triple bypass heart surgery in 2016 and is in remission from stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma.
"I did get COVID again — but a far more serious strand, what doctors call COVID pneumonia.
Cavuto explained that the vaccine did not make him sick, and that it's his immune system that's at fault.
"No, the vaccine didn't cause this … my very compromised immune system did," he said.
