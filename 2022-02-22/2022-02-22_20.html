     Are Daft Punk back? Something seems to be going on with their social media accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Something appears to be going on with Daft Punk.
At the time, they posted an eight-minute-long video, titled ‘Epilogue’, alongside confirmation from the band’s publicist they were calling it a day.
Today, their Instagram and Twitter accounts have sparked back into life.
To date, they’ve posted two images, which you can check out below.
Originally forming back in 1993, Daft Punk released their debut album ‘Homework’ in 1997.

     Daft Punk streamed a 1997 concert on Twitch, and it may have been your only chance to see it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Daft Punk may have announced their split exactly one year ago today, but the famous electronic music duo made a surprise reappearance on the internet Tuesday and streamed footage from a 1997 concert on Twitch.
The stream featured footage from a concert Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the two people behind Daft Punk, played at a Los Angeles nightclub near the release of the band’s debut Homework album, according to Pitchfork.
Daft Punk also announced a 25th anniversary vinyl reissue of the album, and after the concert ended, posted that the reissue is available on streaming services, too.
While it’s unclear if this is the beginning of more from Daft Punk, you might want to follow the group’s accounts on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook just in case.
Update February 22nd, 6:57PM ET: The stream on Twitch has ended.

     Daft Punk tops Twitch with stream of famous '97 concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The duo’s Twitch channel went live at 2.22pm PT on Feb. 22 (notably, 2/22/2022), and thousands poured into the “one-time-only” stream.
For much of the set, the Daft Punk channel boasted 120,000 viewers, double the next closest broadcast.
The concert being streamed comes from the duo’s Daftendirektour world tour.
Before the French duo’s Twitch stream today (their first-ever on the Amazon-owned platform), the Daftendirektour setlist has been famously difficult to confirm.
The one-time-only Daftendirektour livestream comes exactly one year after Daft Punk announced the end of their partnership following 28 years together.

Daft Punk is marking the one-year anniversary of their end with a one-time-only stream of a 1997 performance filmed at Los Angeles’ Mayan Theater.
1997 was also the year Daft Punk released their all time classic LP, Homework, and in celebration of the album’s 25-year anniversary the duo is releasing Homework Digital Deluxe.
