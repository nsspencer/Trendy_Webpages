    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Five observations from Iowa’s 86-60 win over Michigan State on Tuesday night.
DOMINATING THE SPARTANS, AGAINThe Hawkeyes had a 30-point win over Michigan State last season.
“He’s a star.”The Spartans found out what everyone else in the Big Ten has learned, that there’s no way to stop Murray.
KRIS WAS GOOD, TOOKris Murray, Keegan’s twin brother, had 11 points all in the second half.
Iowa missed eight of its first nine shots of the second half, but maintained its double-digit halftime lead by making seven consecutive free throws.

     IOWA CITY, Iowa — Tom Izzo walked back to the locker room at halftime, looked up at the scoreboard and shook his head.
He returned to Michigan State basketball’s sideline after halftime and, while watching A.J.
Hoggard’s shot get blocked by Keegan Murray and bounce toward another Iowa fastbreak, walked out onto the court to argue the call.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan State will next have a chance to prove itself on Tuesday night on the road at Iowa.
25 in the AP poll, just a single point ahead of Michigan State.
When Rebraca is not in the game, Iowa tends to play the 6-foot-8-inch Murray twins together in the front-court.
If the Spartans can get positive results in more than one of those areas, the chances for a Michigan State victory improve dramatically.
As for the NCAA Tournament, most mock brackets currently project Michigan State as either a No.
