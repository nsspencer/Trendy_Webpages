     Lil Durk Bails On Kanye West 'Donda 2' Showdown By Pushing Back '7220' At Last Minute
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chicago, IL – When Lil Durk announced that his new album 7220 would be arriving on February 22, the same day as Kanye West‘s Donda 2, many fans expected Kanye, if anyone, to miss the deadline given the repeated delays of last year’s installment.
On Monday night (February 21), Durk announced on Instagram that 7220 will now arrive on March 11 instead.
Meanwhile, Kanye West‘s Donda 2 remains on course for a February 22 release.
Mr. West is expected to debut Donda 2 at a listening event at Miami’s LoanDepot Park on Tuesday (February 22).
Presumably, the album will be made available on Ye’s stem player following the event — although how soon after exactly remains to be seen.

     Lil Durk Shares Video for New Track “AHHH HA,” Announces Updated ‘7220’ Release Date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lil Durk’s new album, originally set for a release date that would have seen the Voice of the Heroes collaborator dropping on the same day as the artist formerly known as Kanye West, is now set to arrive next month.
Tuesday, Durk rolled out the @jerryphd-shot video for his new track “AHHH HA,” which will indeed appear on his previously announced Voice follow-up 7220.
In an Instagram post shared late Monday evening, Durk alerted fans to the video’s availability while also revealing presumed 7220 cover art and announcing a new drop date of March 11.
“I missed the half time performance for allstar to give y’all this album,” Durk informed fans in a separate IG Stories update.
Durk’s 7220 era will be further complemented with a U.S. tour that kicks off in April at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix.

     Lil Durk Shares Video for New Track “AHHH HA,” Announces Updated ‘7220’ Release Date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lil Durk’s new album, originally set for a release date that would have seen the Voice of the Heroes collaborator dropping on the same day as the artist formerly known as Kanye West, is now set to arrive next month.
Tuesday, Durk rolled out the @jerryphd-shot video for his new track “AHHH HA,” which will indeed appear on his previously announced Voice follow-up 7220.
In an Instagram post shared late Monday evening, Durk alerted fans to the video’s availability while also revealing presumed 7220 cover art and announcing a new drop date of March 11.
“I missed the half time performance for allstar to give y’all this album,” Durk informed fans in a separate IG Stories update.
Durk’s 7220 era will be further complemented with a U.S. tour that kicks off in April at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix.

     Lil Durk Bails On Kanye West 'Donda 2' Showdown By Pushing Back '7220' At Last Minute
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chicago, IL – When Lil Durk announced that his new album 7220 would be arriving on February 22, the same day as Kanye West‘s Donda 2, many fans expected Kanye, if anyone, to miss the deadline given the repeated delays of last year’s installment.
On Monday night (February 21), Durk announced on Instagram that 7220 will now arrive on March 11 instead.
Meanwhile, Kanye West‘s Donda 2 remains on course for a February 22 release.
Mr. West is expected to debut Donda 2 at a listening event at Miami’s LoanDepot Park on Tuesday (February 22).
Presumably, the album will be made available on Ye’s stem player following the event — although how soon after exactly remains to be seen.

     Lil Durk Packs In With His Crew For Crowded ‘Ahh Ha’ Music Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lil Durk is packed in with his crew in the music video for his latest single “Ahhh Ha,” which he shared last week after a few days of teasing the song on Instagram.
The Jerry Production video fits at least a dozen of the Chicago rapper’s closest confidants into most frames.
Along with dropping the “Ahh Ha” video, Lil Durk announced a new release date for his upcoming album 7220: The record was supposed to arrive Feb. 22, but is now slated to drop March 11.
7220 will be Lil Durk’s first solo full-length since The Voice arrived at the tail end of 2020.
Last year, he teamed up with Lil Baby for the collaborative record The Voice of the Heroes.
