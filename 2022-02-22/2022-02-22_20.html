     Are Daft Punk back? Something seems to be going on with their social media accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Something appears to be going on with Daft Punk.
At the time, they posted an eight-minute-long video, titled ‘Epilogue’, alongside confirmation from the band’s publicist they were calling it a day.
Today, their Instagram and Twitter accounts have sparked back into life.
To date, they’ve posted two images, which you can check out below.
Originally forming back in 1993, Daft Punk released their debut album ‘Homework’ in 1997.

     Daft Punk streamed a 1997 concert on Twitch, and it may have been your only chance to see it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Daft Punk may have announced their split exactly one year ago today, but the famous electronic music duo made a surprise reappearance on the internet Tuesday and streamed footage from a 1997 concert on Twitch.
The stream featured footage from a concert Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the two people behind Daft Punk, played at a Los Angeles nightclub near the release of the band’s debut Homework album, according to Pitchfork.
Daft Punk also announced a 25th anniversary vinyl reissue of the album, and after the concert ended, posted that the reissue is available on streaming services, too.
While it’s unclear if this is the beginning of more from Daft Punk, you might want to follow the group’s accounts on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook just in case.
Update February 22nd, 6:57PM ET: The stream on Twitch has ended.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     You gotta rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.” Well, that simile may even prove true for Daft Punk, as the groundbreaking electronic duo has shown signs of life exactly one year after announcing its retirement by explosion.
On Tuesday afternoon, a new verified Daft Punk account appeared on Instagram.
An hour later, Daft Punk posted another photo on Facebook, this one of a concert poster for the group’s December 17th, 1997 show at L.A.’s Mayan Theater.
Daft Punk has not released a new album since 2013’s Grammy-winning Random Access Memories.
