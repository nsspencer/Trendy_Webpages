     PGA Tour Refuses To Comment On Phil Mickelson Suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The PGA Tour has said it "does not plan to comment" on an alleged Phil Mickelson suspension following his outspoken remarks and his use of the rumoured Saudi-backed Super League for leverage.
He would go on to describe the PGA Tour’s approach to player media rights, which is a key component in his backing of the rumoured breakaway league, as "obnoxious greed."
One PGA Tour spokesperson said, “Phil’s making stuff up that’s just not true.”Mickelson’s comments did not stop there.
Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it?” Mickelson added, “the Saudi money has finally given us that leverage.
In a statement, the reigning PGA champion said he was "deeply sorry" for his choice of words which he "sincerely" regretted.
