     Green Bay TV Anchor’s Observation About Aaron Rodgers’s Cryptic Instagram Post Goes Viral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Adriana Torres, a reporter and anchor for WBAY-TV 2 in Green Bay, explained on Twitter that the last picture in the quarterback’s post was the only one he was not in.
In the 10-picture Instagram post, Rodgers included photos of himself with Shailene Woodley, Cobb, linebacker Preston Smith and others.
I love you guys, and cherish the memories we’ve made.”The four-time MVP ended the post by saying he wants everyone to spread love and gratitude.
“To everyone else, spread love and gratitude you beautiful people, and read a book once in a while too while you’re at it.
While the motives behind his Monday night Instagram post remain unclear, the quarterback’s social media activity is just the latest in a long line of cryptic messaging.

     "Let me just put this disclaimer out there right away for the few people watching that are tuning in just for a specific, maybe news, and decision," Rodgers said.
"There will be no news today, no decision on my future.
But no decision about my future today."
"I understand also today, I believe, might be the first day to tag players," Rodgers said.
While he puts off any announcement, Rodgers noted that he's not fretting his future one way or another.

     Aaron Rodgers: No decision made over my future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aaron Rodgers insisted he has not made a decision on his future despite a cryptic Instagram post on Monday that fuelled speculation around a potential exit from the Green Bay Packers.
However, speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers quickly dismissed any notion that post was related to a potential decision regarding leaving the Packers or retiring from the sport altogether.
No decision on my future," the NFL MVP said.
Rodgers hinted his future may be linked to the Packers' ability to retain the services of his top receiver and soon to be unrestricted free agent Davante Adams.
Among quarterbacks with 200 passing attempts, only Justin Herbert (2.30) threw a lower percentage of pickable passes than Rodgers (2.36).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Everything remains on the table for Rodgers: retire, remain in Green Bay or demand a trade.
"There is nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said of his social media post after emerging from a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse his body, if not clear his mind.
Last offseason, Rodgers exhibited passive aggressive behavior during an acrimonious offseason with the Packers.
The timing of Rodgers' gratitude post aligns with the NFL calendar.
The window is open from Tuesday until March 8 with Green Bay expected to tag receiver Davante Adams.
