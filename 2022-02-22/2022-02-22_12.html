     Now, many fans are still hoping Sophie and Kevin end up together by the This Is Us series finale.
From the couple’s marriage and breakup to recent events, here’s what happened to Sophie and Kevin on This Is Us.
In season 1, Kevin and Sophie reconnected, and it seemed like the two were ready to go all-in.
But at this point, it’s clear that he could marry any of his exes, including Sophie, Madison, Zoe (Melanie Liburd), or Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison).
“Ultimately, I hope that Kevin and Sophie end up together,” Breckenridge said.

     This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia Promises 'Magic' in Series Finale

     Milo Ventimiglia knows how the This Is Us series finale will wrap up the NBC drama, and he exclusively told Us Weekly what to expect as season 6 winds down.
The Gilmore Girls alum said the writers are tying up all kinds of loose ends as the Emmy-winning series comes to a close.
This Is Us started shooting finale scenes years ago in order to work around aging child actors.
While the finale won’t shoot until April, Ventimiglia knows what’s coming.
“I think the last day on set will be emotional,” Ventimiglia told Us.

     And “Our Little Island Girl: Part Two” puts a few Thanksgiving-related storylines on the stove to simmer as it places Beth’s emotional journey front and center.
But within those parameters, I think “Part Two” does a solid job of giving Beth a moving emotional arc, even as it keeps things ticking along elsewhere.

The climax of “Our Little Island Girl: Part Two” focuses on giving Beth emotional closure and a firm new direction in life.

     (NBC) — NBC’s “This Is Us” returns with a new episode Tuesday and it’s one that was co-written by one of the series’ stars: Susan Kelechi Watson.
For Watson, getting to play Beth on “This Is Us” has been one thrill, getting to write for her has been another.
“It’s probably my favorite thing I’ve done on the show,” said Watson.
“And that’s saying a lot because so much has happened on the show.”Watson teamed with show writer Eboni Freeman to craft Tuesday’s episode, a follow-up to one from Season 3.
“In all honesty, I thought maybe towards the end, last couple episodes, it would start to hit me,” said Watson.

In their college era, Randall and Beth are dining out in D.C., when Beth sees her former ballet teacher, Vincent.
Beth approaches Vincent, to chastise him for ruining dance for her in that way, but she can't find the words.
Beth says her mother was similar, pushing her to be an educator and never understanding dance, but Beth fought for dance, and she recognizes the same fire in Stacey.
When the showcase arrives, Beth is terrified of failing in dance again via her dancers' performances.

     For the final time, This Is Us told the story of Susan Kelechi Watson's beloved character, Beth Pearson.
Watson had a significant part in co-writing the last Beth-centric episode, titled "Our Little Island Girl: Part Two," with writer Eboni Freeman.
Viewers last saw a glimpse of Beth as a renowned dance teacher in the flashforward scene during the season 3 finale.
Now, in Tuesday's episode, fans finally saw how Beth achieved a fulfilling career in the dance industry — which did not accept her at first.
There are some scars there and there is sort of this moment that happens with her dance teacher Vincent (Goran Visnjic).
