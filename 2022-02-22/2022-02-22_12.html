     USFL 2022 draft: Shea Patterson, Jordan Ta'amu among top QBs picked in first round of lottery draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The United States Football League (USFL), a new take on the spring league of the same name that ran from 1983-1985, kicks off with eight new franchises this April.
The clubs, some of which reside in NFL cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Houston, will begin their inaugural 10-game regular season in Birmingham, with the playoffs set for Canton, Ohio.
But first, each of the upstart franchises kicked off their lottery draft, which opened Tuesday and saw dozens of players selected.
Below, find complete results from the first round of the 2022 USFL Draft, which required teams to draft by pre-set position groups in each round (for example, only quarterbacks could be taken in the first, only defensive ends in the second, and so forth), as well as other notable day one selections:Note: Team abbreviations are as follows: Birmingham Stallions (BIRM), Houston Gamblers (HOU), Michigan Panthers (MICH), New Jersey Generals (NJ), New Orleans Breakers (NO), Philadelphia Stars (PHI), Pittsburgh Maulers (PIT), Tampa Bay Bandits (TB).

     The United States Football League is back and I have never been more excited.
If you are not familiar with the greatness that was the USFL, please take a second to dive into the history.
The USFL has had some exciting talent in its former glory including Steve Young, Herschel Walker, and Reggie White.
If you are curious which former Ohio State players shined in the original version of the league, have no fear that information is here.
The following are five former Buckeyes that could hear their name called during the USFL draft.

     2022 USFL Draft: Mid-American Conference Prospect Tracker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Per the USFL, the draft system will utilize “an analytical modified snake system between positional rounds so that each team has two No.
1 picks at two positions — the first time such a draft order has been used in a major professional sports draft.”Day 1 will see two minutes per draft pick, with quarterbacks, edge rushers, offensive tackles and cornerbacks selected.
Day 2 will see 60-90 seconds per pick, with the remaining positions draft eligible by round.
A compensatory draft later this month will bring that total to 48, split between the regular roster and practice squad.
Assoua was rostered on the Alphas roster in the 2021 Spring League.
