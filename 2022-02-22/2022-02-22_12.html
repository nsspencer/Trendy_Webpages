    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now, many fans are still hoping Sophie and Kevin end up together by the This Is Us series finale.
From the couple’s marriage and breakup to recent events, here’s what happened to Sophie and Kevin on This Is Us.
In season 1, Kevin and Sophie reconnected, and it seemed like the two were ready to go all-in.
But at this point, it’s clear that he could marry any of his exes, including Sophie, Madison, Zoe (Melanie Liburd), or Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison).
“Ultimately, I hope that Kevin and Sophie end up together,” Breckenridge said.

     This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia Promises 'Magic' in Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Milo Ventimiglia knows how the This Is Us series finale will wrap up the NBC drama, and he exclusively told Us Weekly what to expect as season 6 winds down.
The Gilmore Girls alum said the writers are tying up all kinds of loose ends as the Emmy-winning series comes to a close.
This Is Us started shooting finale scenes years ago in order to work around aging child actors.
While the finale won’t shoot until April, Ventimiglia knows what’s coming.
“I think the last day on set will be emotional,” Ventimiglia told Us.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This Is Us is gearing up for the final Thanksgiving episode of the series, and the chances of it not being a weep-fest are approximately zero.
But with Season 6, Episode 6 spending a large portion of the hour building up to the big day, fans are already ready for helpings of turkey, stuffing, and tears.
But they’ll have a bit of a wait before that can happen, because This Is Us isn’t airing on March 1, 2022, like most viewers expected.
Warning: Spoilers for This Is Us Season 6, Episode 6 follow.
That means everyone’s Tuesday night programming will be upended, including Pearson Thanksgiving.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (NBC) — NBC’s “This Is Us” returns with a new episode Tuesday and it’s one that was co-written by one of the series’ stars: Susan Kelechi Watson.
For Watson, getting to play Beth on “This Is Us” has been one thrill, getting to write for her has been another.
“It’s probably my favorite thing I’ve done on the show,” said Watson.
“And that’s saying a lot because so much has happened on the show.”Watson teamed with show writer Eboni Freeman to craft Tuesday’s episode, a follow-up to one from Season 3.
“In all honesty, I thought maybe towards the end, last couple episodes, it would start to hit me,” said Watson.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And “Our Little Island Girl: Part Two” puts a few Thanksgiving-related storylines on the stove to simmer as it places Beth’s emotional journey front and center.
But within those parameters, I think “Part Two” does a solid job of giving Beth a moving emotional arc, even as it keeps things ticking along elsewhere.
Beth herself), this episode is thoughtful in its dissection of the tricky power dynamics between teachers and students in competitive artistic fields like ballet.
Kevin, Kate, Madison, Toby, and Elijah.
The climax of “Our Little Island Girl: Part Two” focuses on giving Beth emotional closure and a firm new direction in life.

     “And right then, you became my little island girl who danced before she walked,” he proudly tells his young daughter.
One evening, Beth walks by one of the school’s practice rooms as Stacey is trying, and failing, to nail her pirouette.
The teen dejectedly tells Beth that her father wants her to be a lawyer, and it’s clear that she’s thinking about giving up dance.
She freezes — “When my dad died, he didn’t even pick up the damn phone,” she tells Randall — but then gathers herself and approaches Vincent to give him a piece of her mind.
After ascertaining that the girl isn’t hurt, Beth tells her that she, too, had a fall of sorts when she was a teen.

In their college era, Randall and Beth are dining out in D.C., when Beth sees her former ballet teacher, Vincent.
Beth approaches Vincent, to chastise him for ruining dance for her in that way, but she can't find the words.
Beth says her mother was similar, pushing her to be an educator and never understanding dance, but Beth fought for dance, and she recognizes the same fire in Stacey.
When the showcase arrives, Beth is terrified of failing in dance again via her dancers' performances.

Viewers last saw a glimpse of Beth as a renowned dance teacher in the flashforward scene during the season 3 finale.
Now, in Tuesday's episode, fans finally saw how Beth achieved a fulfilling career in the dance industry — which did not accept her at first.
There are some scars there and there is sort of this moment that happens with her dance teacher Vincent (Goran Visnjic).

     What’s your favorite Jack moment?
And I think that’s something that’s important to remember for all of us, is there are things that happen in our lives that sidetrack us or stop us and make us look around and think.
And I think Jack reconnecting with his wife after so many years and having a hard time, that relationship, that dynamic with Mandy Moore has always been the foundation of the character for me.
