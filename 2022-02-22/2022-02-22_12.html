    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The United States Football League (USFL), a new take on the spring league of the same name that ran from 1983-1985, kicks off with eight new franchises this April.
The clubs, some of which reside in NFL cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Houston, will begin their inaugural 10-game regular season in Birmingham, with the playoffs set for Canton, Ohio.
But first, each of the upstart franchises kicked off their lottery draft, which opened Tuesday and saw dozens of players selected.
Below, find complete results from the first round of the 2022 USFL Draft, which required teams to draft by pre-set position groups in each round (for example, only quarterbacks could be taken in the first, only defensive ends in the second, and so forth), as well as other notable day one selections:Note: Team abbreviations are as follows: Birmingham Stallions (BIRM), Houston Gamblers (HOU), Michigan Panthers (MICH), New Jersey Generals (NJ), New Orleans Breakers (NO), Philadelphia Stars (PHI), Pittsburgh Maulers (PIT), Tampa Bay Bandits (TB).

     This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia Promises 'Magic' in Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Milo Ventimiglia knows how the This Is Us series finale will wrap up the NBC drama, and he exclusively told Us Weekly what to expect as season 6 winds down.
The Gilmore Girls alum said the writers are tying up all kinds of loose ends as the Emmy-winning series comes to a close.
This Is Us started shooting finale scenes years ago in order to work around aging child actors.
While the finale won’t shoot until April, Ventimiglia knows what’s coming.
“I think the last day on set will be emotional,” Ventimiglia told Us.

     One sign of a great sitcom is its ability to surprise you about a character you thought you’d figured out.
“Can I not do something out of the goodness of my heart?” asks self-centered principal Ava (Janelle James) after she volunteers to help idealistic Janine (Quinta Brunson) teach an extracurricular step class.
Her skeptical staff has reason to doubt her motives when Ava’s unconventional approach upstages Janine’s more disciplined technique.
But there’s more to Ava than meets the eye.
Back in the break room, a debate rages over who makes Philadelphia’s best pizza.

     This Is Us star Susan Kelechi Watson teases Beth showcase episode: 'I realized this was her final opus'This Is Us - Season 3 This Is UsThis Is Us returns tonight after a three-week hiatus, and you might want to slip on some pointe shoes to celebrate, because you're dancing back into the world of Beth.
"Our Little Island Girl: Part Two" — which was written by Susan Kelechi Watson and TIU co-producer Eboni Freeman — finds Beth at her new job, readying a group of dancers for a big recital.
"We get to see Beth become empowered and own herself and her purpose," Watson tells EW of the episode.
This TIU installment — the sixth of the final 18 — also felt like the beginning of the end to Watson.

     This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia Promises 'Magic' in Series Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Milo Ventimiglia knows how the This Is Us series finale will wrap up the NBC drama, and he exclusively told Us Weekly what to expect as season 6 winds down.
The Gilmore Girls alum said the writers are tying up all kinds of loose ends as the Emmy-winning series comes to a close.
This Is Us started shooting finale scenes years ago in order to work around aging child actors.
While the finale won’t shoot until April, Ventimiglia knows what’s coming.
“I think the last day on set will be emotional,” Ventimiglia told Us.

     2022 USFL Draft: Mid-American Conference Prospect Tracker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Per the USFL, the draft system will utilize “an analytical modified snake system between positional rounds so that each team has two No.
1 picks at two positions — the first time such a draft order has been used in a major professional sports draft.”Day 1 will see two minutes per draft pick, with quarterbacks, edge rushers, offensive tackles and cornerbacks selected.
Day 2 will see 60-90 seconds per pick, with the remaining positions draft eligible by round.
A compensatory draft later this month will bring that total to 48, split between the regular roster and practice squad.
Assoua was rostered on the Alphas roster in the 2021 Spring League.
