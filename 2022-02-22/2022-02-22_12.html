     In Georgia, Feb. 23 is now Ahmaud Arbery Day.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The state of Georgia will formally memorialize Ahmaud Arbery on Wednesday, the second anniversary of his death.
The Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution this month declaring Feb. 23 to be Ahmaud Arbery Day in perpetuity.
Lawmakers called Mr. Arbery one of the state’s “most distinguished citizens” and declared that he suffered a “senseless loss of his life because of the color of his skin.”The resolution noted two significant legislative changes in response to Mr. Arbery’s killing in 2020 outside of the South Georgia community of Brunswick: a new state hate crimes law and the dismantling of Georgia’s 19th-century citizen’s arrest law, a statute that was initially cited as justification for the actions of Mr. Arbery’s pursuers.
In Brunswick, several events are planned to mark the anniversary, including a march, a 2.23-mile run in honor of Mr. Arbery and a walk through the Satilla Shores neighborhood where he was killed.

     Federal Jury Finds Three Men Guilty of Hate Crimes in Connection with the Pursuit and Killing of Ahmaud Arbery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Although we welcome the jury’s verdict, the only acceptable outcome in this matter would have been Mr. Arbery returning safely to his loved ones two years ago.
The pursuit passed by the home of defendant William “Roddie” Bryan, who did not know Mr. Arbery, but decided to get into his own truck to join the McMichaels in their pursuit of Mr. Arbery.
For four to five minutes, the three defendants pursued Mr. Arbery through the neighborhood and tried to box in Mr. Arbery with their trucks.
During the chase, Mr. Arbery was running with his hands empty and in plain view.
Ultimately, after Mr. Arbery had already changed direction multiple times, trying to escape from the defendants, Travis McMichael got out of his truck and pointed a shotgun directly at Mr. Arbery.

Advertisement“Tomorrow will be the two-year mark for when their son Ahmaud Arbery was lynched for jogging while Black,” Crump said.
Lyons was heard whispering to one of her co-counsel that the verdict was personal for her, as the mother of a Black son.
She has since been accused of showing favoritism toward Gregory McMichael and directing that his son should not be arrested.

     Jury finds Ahmaud Arbery's killers were racially motivated in chasing him

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Outside the courthouse, Arbery family attorney Ben Crump took the hands of Arbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones and father Marcus Arbery Sr. and raised them in victory.
The McMichaels had agreed to plead guilty before trial, but the the judge overseeing the case rejected the deal after Arbery's family raised concerns that the resulting sentence could lead to favorable imprisonment conditions.
Cooper-Jones said that she spoke to federal prosecutors and "begged them" to not take the plea deal in the case, and "they ignored my cry."
Arbery family attorney Ben Crump (center) clasps hands with Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, and Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery Sr., outside the court on Tuesday.
Federal prosecutors and Arbery's family have said he was out on a jog when the defendants chased and killed him.
