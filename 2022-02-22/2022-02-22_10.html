     A palindrome is something that reads the same way backward and forward.
Dates, numbers, words, concepts and topics can be categorized into a palindrome.
Today is the 22nd day of the second month in the year 2022.
In a numbered sequence the date is 2/22/22 and can be read forward, then backward and vice versa, but remain the same.
Today is also an ambigram, which means it reads the same upside down.

     ‘Twosday’ packs a palindrome punch in a month full of numerical playfulness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     February is the shortest month of the year, but if you’re a fan of numbers you’re in luck.
This month has no shortage of palindrome dates — dates that read the same way from right to left and left to right.
University of Portland Professor Aziz Inan has studied palindrome dates.
On this palindrome date, 2/22/22, a “Twosday,” OPB’s Paul Marshall spoke to Inan.

     Feb. 22, 2022 — or 2/22/22 — is a rare palindrome date, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
Others are happy to use it as an opportunity to use their favorite palindrome words or phrases.
Among a few at the Columbus Metropolitan Library are some that target young people:"If You Were a Palindrome" (2007) by Michael Dahl.
Dress for successWhile it might be too late to order a "Happy Twos Day 2-22-22" shirt, there are plenty of other ones to choose.
The easiest solution for something to wear on 2/22/22, though, might be the simplest — even though it's not a palindrome itself.
