The Generals, the same team Holmes was drafted by on Tuesday, signed running back Herschel Walker from Georgia in the 1980s, fresh off of his Heisman Trophy winning season.Now Holmes joins the team in the league's effort to restart.

     USFL draft: Michigan Panthers pick ex-Michigan football QB Shea Patterson No. 1 overall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The inaugural draft for USFL 2.0 began on Tuesday night and the Michigan Panthers were given the first pick.
Former Michigan football QB Shea Patterson was the first player off the board for the Panthers.
He played college ball at Ole Miss and Michigan, where Patterson was named an All-Big Ten selection in 2018 and 2019.
Wolverines fans looking to see Patterson suiting up for the Panthers in the mitten will have to pump the breaks.
Rounding out the first four picks of Michigan's first day of the draft, the Panthers selected Chase DeMoor.

     Per the USFL, the draft system will utilize ‚Äúan analytical modified snake system between positional rounds so that each team has two No.
1 picks at two positions ‚Äî the first time such a draft order has been used in a major professional sports draft.‚ÄùDay 1 will see two minutes per draft pick, with quarterbacks, edge rushers, offensive tackles and cornerbacks selected.
Day 2 will see 60-90 seconds per pick, with the remaining positions draft eligible by round.
A compensatory draft later this month will bring that total to 48, split between the regular roster and practice squad.
