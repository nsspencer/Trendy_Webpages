     Commentary: Texas GOP candidate Sarah Stogner tells the naked truth

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For example, what could be weirder than a candidate for an important Texas state office stripping off her clothes and striding an oil pumpjack to get voters’ attention for the March 1 primary election?
The Texas version of Lady Godiva is West Texas attorney Sarah Stogner, 37, who is running in the Republican primary for the Texas Railroad Commission — a crucial, but little known and misnamed state agency that is supposed to regulate oil and gas, not railroads.
Stogner is one of four candidates for the open commission seat in the Republican primary.
A five-second video ad of her on the pumpjack appeared on social media last week and drew decent exposure for Stogner.
Some political observers found Stogner’s campaign video to be in poor taste.

     Texas candidate’s risque video costs her an endorsement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A candidate for Texas’ energy commission lost the endorsement of a major newspaper because of a campaign video in which she appeared topless astride an oil pump jack.
Sarah Stogner, an attorney, last week posted the five-second clip on her TikTok channel, @theunicornlawyer.
Two days after the video was posted, the San Antonio Express-News called it “disgraceful” and rescinded the editorial board’s endorsement.
In addition to the partial nudity and implications of corruption, the race has drawn attention because one of the candidates is dead.
Marvin “Sarge” Summers was killed Feb. 8 when his car rear-ended a semi-truck, but his name remains on the ballot.

     West Texas wannabe railroad commissioner, 37, posts TikTok video of herself TOPLESS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A West Texas woman running to be the state's railroad commissioner has turned heads after she posted a TikTok of herself topless and without pants while straddling an oil pumping jack.
But in the wake of the video, Stogner was ridiculed online - and even lost the endorsement of one of the state's major newspapers - while others praised her bravery and success at garnering attention.
I have other assets'After the video was posted on Twitter, one person commented: 'I'm confused.
'We were disappointed to see a disgraceful TikTok video posted Sunday from Sarah Stogner, whom we recently recommended in the Republican primary for railroad commissioner,' the editorial board wrote.
Stogner said she found out that the San Antonio Express-News was going to drop its endorsement after she posted the video.
