     Aaron Rodgers declines to give ‘vision on future’ after cryptic Instagram post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     GREEN BAY, Wis. (WFRV) – In a highly-anticipated interview on the Pat McAfee Show Tuesday, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said “there will be no news today” about his future, despite posting a lengthy “gratitude” post on Instagram that some called cryptic.
“There will be no news today, no vision on my future,” Rodgers told McAffee.
On Monday, Aaron Rodgers posted a lengthy post on Instagram that had loving words for everyone from his ex-fiancée, actress Shailene Woodley, to his backup on the Packers, Jordan Love.
There has been speculation about Rodgers’ future: will he retire, request a trade or return to the Green Bay Packers?
However, Rodgers has also been known to subtly toy with people and say or post things that can cause a stir.

     Aaron Rodgers and Panchakarma, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After sending Twitter into a frenzy with a cryptic Instagram post Monday night, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday to offer some clarity on his future plans—sort of.
What began as an inquiry into the reigning MVP’s thinking turned into a discussion on the benefits of an alternative cleansing and healing method called Panchakarma.
“I just came out of a 12-day cleanse where you're eating a specific diet and you're going through these treatments everyday,” Rodgers said.
But beyond what Rodgers detailed in his conversation with McAfee, what exactly is Panchakarma?
Whatever the future holds for his playing career, it’s a safe bet that Panchakarma will remain in a central role.

     Aaron Rodgers apologizes to 'loved ones' that got caught 'in the middle of' Covid-19 comments controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Aaron Rodgers has apologized to his "loved ones" who got caught "in the middle of" the attention directed at him after his Covid-19 comments earlier in the season .
In November last year, Rodgers missed an NFL fixture due to Covid-19 protocols.
Appearing on his usual slot on the "Pat McAfee Show" on Tuesday, Rodgers apologized to those who got caught up in the reaction to his comments.
Rodgers added: "So many people stepped up to the plate and sent me great messages of support and love.
But speaking to former Indianapolis Colts punter McAfee, Rodgers said he's not made a decision yet on his future.

"There will be no news today, no decision on my future.
But no decision about my future today."
"I understand also today, I believe, might be the first day to tag players," Rodgers said.
While he puts off any announcement, Rodgers noted that he's not fretting his future one way or another.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aaron Rodgers says there's nothing cryptic about his Instagram post and it's just him expressing gratitude for others that have helped him this season.
"There's nothing cryptic about gratitude," Rodgers said.
"When I got that photo from Randall and Davante, it brought tears to my eyes because that's my guys standing before the game," Rodgers said.
Actress Shailene Woodley was a big part of not only Rodgers' Instagram post but also the Tuesday show.
I think that living a life of gratitude is such an important way to keep that joy in your life.

     Aaron Rodgers Agrees to Disagree on His Relationship Status

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shailene Woodley and Aaron Rodgers.
It was the news that Shailene Woodley and NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers had reportedly broken up and called off their engagement.
All we can do is respect their decision as two autonomous adults …… Unless one of those celebrities is real-life Hoodwinked-level unreliable narrator Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers also said that Woodley makes his life “more enjoyable and tasteful and exciting.” All of this sure sounds like Rodgers thinks he is currently dating and/or engaged to Woodley.
But then again, you can’t really believe anything Rodgers says on The Pat McAfee Show; it’s where he said ivermectin would give him the “best immunity possible.”
