     Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age Singer, Dies at 57
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mark Lanegan, a singer for Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age and an integral part of the 1980s and 1990s grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest, died on Tuesday at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
SKH Music, a management company, confirmed his death in a statement but did not specify a cause.
In the statement, SKH Music called Mr. Lanegan “a beloved singer, songwriter, author and musician.”Though his stints in Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and the Gutter Twins never brought him the kind of fame achieved by Nirvana and Soundgarden, other Seattle grunge bands, he was known for his deep, world-weary voice that could take a song to both soaring heights and melancholy lows.
He met the founding members of Screaming Trees in high school, and the band released its first album in 1986, with an aesthetic that married flannel shirts and long hair with angsty songs and rasping guitars.

     Mark Lanegan—solo artist and member of the groups Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and The Gutter Twins—has died, according to his official social media channels.
A statement from Lanegan’s publicist reads, “Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
They started Screaming Trees along with drummer Mark Pickerel, who’d be replaced later on with Barrett Martin, in 1984, and released their first album, Clairvoyance, in 1986.
Lanegan was known for his raspy singing voice, as well as his penchant for dark songwriting, which earned him comparisons to the likes of Tom Waits and Nick Cave, particularly on solo albums such as 1994’s Whiskey for the Holy Ghost.
Lanegan released 12 solo albums, as well as a couple of records of duets with Belle and Sebastian’s Isobel Campbell.

     Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees singer and voracious collaborator, dies at 57Enlarge this image toggle caption Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images Sylvain Lefevre/Getty ImagesMark Lanegan, the versatile rock musician and Screaming Trees singer, died Tuesday of unspecified causes at his home in Killarney, Ireland.
From the mid-'80s to 2000 that voice led Screaming Trees, the hard-charging, psychedelic-rock band that got picked up in Seattle's grunge gold rush.
Between albums for Screaming Trees, however, Lanegan began writing and recording solo efforts, starting with an aborted Lead Belly covers project with Kurt Cobain.
The distinction between Screaming Trees and his solo music became more crucial after Cobain's death, in 1994.
Since the break-up of Screaming Trees in 2000, Lanegan proved to be voracious in his collaborators and styles.

     Mark Lanegan, who followed a long stint as lead vocalist for the proto-grunge band Screaming Trees with a distinguished career as an impassioned solo singer-songwriter and adventurous collaborator with Queens of the Stone Age and others, has died.
