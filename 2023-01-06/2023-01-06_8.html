     Browns send Jadeveon Clowney home from practice, status for Sunday unclear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty imagesOn Thursday, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney said in an interview with Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com that he was “95 percent sure” he wouldn’t be back with the Browns next season.
According to multiple reporters, the Browns have sent Clowney home from Friday’s practice.
Head coach Kevin Stefanski is slated to speak to the media after the session, where he’ll surely be asked about Clowney if he doesn’t address the edge rusher first.
He initially signed with the Browns in 2021 before re-upping with the club in the 2022 offseason.
Clowney has 43.0 career sacks, 11.0 of which have come with Cleveland over the last two seasons.

You never know what can happen.”Jadeveon Clowney APThe Browns responded Friday by sending Clowney home from the facility, according to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo.
“I just feel like I need to be around somebody that believes in me and my ability,” Clowney told Cleveland.com.

     Browns' Myles Garrett 'confused' by Jadeveon Clowney's barbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Myles Garrett acknowledges the frustration circling the Browns' locker room but believes the team can do more.
Clowney has had a disappointing second season for the 7-9 Browns, who were eliminated from the AFC playoff picture two weeks ago.
After racking up nine sacks with the Browns last season, Clowney has only two sacks this year.
But they're also going to be positions where I'm going to get double-teamed.
But when asked whether he'd welcome Clowney back, Garrett said he wants "volunteers, not hostages" on the Browns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney was sent home Friday for critical comments and openly questioning whether Cleveland put him in position to succeed.
Clowney told Cleveland.com it has become apparent the Browns have "their own guys, and I ain't one of them, so it's time for me to get my exit slip."
The comments, published Thursday, pointed to the Browns focusing gameplans around defensive end Myles Garrett.
He said coaches asked him to switch defensive end positions with Garrett after they practiced on one side all week.
I've done my job," Clowney told Cleveland.com.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clowney ended up playing just 23 snaps, or 36% of the Browns' defensive snaps that day.
The next week, the Browns played host to the Cincinnati Bengals on "Monday Night Football."
Those struggles to stop the run started around the same time both Clowney and Garrett missed various amounts of time.
Clowney missed Week 3 against Pittsburgh, the Atlanta game and then the Week 6 game against New England.
In last Sunday's win at the Washington Commanders, Clowney played 51 snaps, which was 74% of the Browns' defensive snaps.
