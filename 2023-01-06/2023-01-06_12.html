     Browns' Myles Garrett 'confused' by Jadeveon Clowney's barbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Myles Garrett acknowledges the frustration circling the Browns' locker room but believes the team can do more.
Clowney has had a disappointing second season for the 7-9 Browns, who were eliminated from the AFC playoff picture two weeks ago.
After racking up nine sacks with the Browns last season, Clowney has only two sacks this year.
But they're also going to be positions where I'm going to get double-teamed.
But when asked whether he'd welcome Clowney back, Garrett said he wants "volunteers, not hostages" on the Browns.

     Browns send Jadeveon Clowney home after critical comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney was sent home Friday for critical comments and openly questioning whether Cleveland put him in position to succeed.
Clowney told Cleveland.com it has become apparent the Browns have "their own guys, and I ain't one of them, so it's time for me to get my exit slip."
The comments, published Thursday, pointed to the Browns focusing gameplans around defensive end Myles Garrett.
He said coaches asked him to switch defensive end positions with Garrett after they practiced on one side all week.
I've done my job," Clowney told Cleveland.com.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jadeveon Clowney might not play in the Browns' season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers after all.
NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo reports that the Browns have sent Clowney home on Friday, per a source informed of the situation.
The move came following comments to Cabot that he's "95% sure" he won't be back next year while criticizing coaches.
Browns coach Kevin Stefanski wouldn't reveal whether Clowney would play Sunday but noted, "nothing comes above the team."
The end of the road in Cleveland came as Clowney took issue with his usage under defensive coordinator Joe Woods.

     Myles Garrett wants 'volunteers, not hostages' after Browns send Jadeveon Clowney home

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clowney ended up playing just 23 snaps, or 36% of the Browns' defensive snaps that day.
The next week, the Browns played host to the Cincinnati Bengals on "Monday Night Football."
Those struggles to stop the run started around the same time both Clowney and Garrett missed various amounts of time.
Clowney missed Week 3 against Pittsburgh, the Atlanta game and then the Week 6 game against New England.
In last Sunday's win at the Washington Commanders, Clowney played 51 snaps, which was 74% of the Browns' defensive snaps.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clowney told Cleveland.com on Thursday that he was “95% sure” that he wouldn’t sign with the Browns again this offseason due largely to how the franchise is comparing him to Garrett.
I know I am.”Clowney has 28 total tackles and two sacks this season in Cleveland, his second with the franchise.
While Clowney insisted that he doesn’t have any personal issues with Garrett, this issue has apparently been brewing for a while.
Before the Browns fell to the Ravens in October, Clowney learned that he’d be swapping sides with Garrett.
But they're also going to be positions where I'm going to get double-teamed.
