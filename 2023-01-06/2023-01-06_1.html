    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Seth Wenig/AP/ShutterstockThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jen Shah was sentenced on January 6 to six and a half years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a telemarketing scam that largely targeted senior citizens.
Shah pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in July.
Prosecutors said an appropriate sentencing range would be between 135 and 168 months, or 11 to 14 years, in federal lockup.
When Judge Sidney Stein handed down Shah’s sentence, she “stood by the defense table and remained expressionless as sentence was read, just looking down,” journalist Marta Dhanis tweeted.
There’s also the matter of the star’s “Shah Ski Chalet.” Impressive as it was, Shah didn’t own the manse, as once implied on the show.
