     Jen Shah of 'Real Housewives of Salt Lake City' gets 6.5 years for fraud scheme
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 6 (Reuters) - Reality TV star Jen Shah was sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison on Friday after pleading guilty to running a nationwide telemarketing scam that bilked elderly victims of tens of millions of dollars.
Prosecutors said Shah was the ringleader of a network of more than two-dozen people indicted in the scheme.
Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 10 years in prison, saying Shah had shown no remorse and went to great lengths to conceal her crimes.
Shah initially denied the allegations after her arrest in March 2021 and sold merchandise attesting to her innocence.
She pleaded guilty a week before trial and said on Friday that the money she made selling "Justice For Jen Shah" apparel will go to victims.
