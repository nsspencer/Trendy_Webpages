     Summary: The LA Clippers are coming off one of the most embarrassing losses in the Kawhi Leonard and Paul George era, having been blown on by the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.
This was not the average blowout that sees a quarter of garbage time, this was a game that the Clippers conceded at halftime.
Pulling all of their starters at the half, the Clippers shifted their focus to tonight's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
As for the others, Nicolas Batum is the only other player out for the Clippers in this game.

     Nuggets blast Clippers by 31 in biggest rout of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In front of a national TV audience, the Nuggets rocked the Clippers, 122-91, for their largest margin of victory of the season, besting a previous 25-point win.
“Don’t be satisfied,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone reminded his team before allowing them to savor the win after the game.
Now 25-13 on the season and 15-3 at home, the Nuggets will try to channel that same energy against Cleveland on Friday.
Dumbfounded by what he saw in the first half, Clippers coach Ty Lue benched his starters to open the second.
That substitution pattern wasn’t necessary in the first half of Thursday’s game as the Nuggets ran roughshod through the Clippers’ defense.

     Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard, Paul George injury updates vs. Timberwolves after ugly Nuggets loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Joey Mistretta · 2 min readLos Angeles Clippers’ stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are both listed as questionable for their clash vs. the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night, per Tomer Azarly.
LA is hopeful that Leonard and George will be available for Friday as they try to snap their current 4-game losing streak.
Paul George is averaging just south of 24 points per contest through 30 games this season.
On the other hand, Kawhi Leonard is averaging just under 17 points per game on 47 percent field goal shooting.
But coming into Minnesota and picking up a win if George and Leonard are inactive would be a challenge for the Clippers.

In a nationally televised game, Denver was pushing the pace and showing why the team is tied with Memphis for the top spot in the Western Conference.

The two-time reigning NBA MVP had 12 points, six rebounds and nine assists before taking the fourth quarter off.
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope helped fuel a 19-0 run in the second quarter to turn the game into a rout.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER — The LA Clippers have played their share of “burn the tape” games under head coach Tyronn Lue.
It is the largest loss of the season for the Clippers, and their four-game losing streak ties the team’s longest of the season.
The Clippers are reeling and continuing to be an unimpressive team heading into their 41st game of the season.
Five teams rank higher in the West standings, led by the Nuggets, and the Clippers are only 1-5 against those teams.
“We have to play harder, play faster, with some urgency, really,” Leonard said after Denver beat the Clippers for the seventh time in nine meetings.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If they don’t play, the Wolves absolutely cannot overlook the rest of this Clippers roster.
This Clippers team was embarrassed in Denver last night, and will surely be looking to right the ship in this one.
It’s part of why he was so good in the play-in game against this same Clippers team just last season.
I wouldn’t necessarily expect a 30-point night from Russell, but I also wouldn’t be surprised to see him turn it around a bit and have a good game.
The thing I am most interested to see is who closes in a close game tonight.
