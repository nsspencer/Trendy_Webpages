     Wednesday Season 2 Renewal Highlights The Show's Biggest New Challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a record-breaking first season, Wednesday has been confirmed to return to Netflix, but the fanfare surrounding its renewal only highlights the challenge that the show’s season 2 will have to face.
In the week following its premiere, Wednesday became the second-most-viewed Netflix series ever.
Fans of the show were calling for a second season immediately, but after a string of surprising Netflix cancelations, Wednesday season 2 was no guarantee.
There was seemingly little to lose with the creation of season 1, but now that it’s one of the biggest shows in the world, season 2 has its work cut out for it.
Wednesday’s first season ended with a cliffhanger, which indicates that Netflix already has a plan for season 2.
