     Jen Shah Sentenced to 6.5 Years in Prison for Wire Fraud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A New York judge sentenced Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jen Shah to 78 months, or six-and-a-half years, in prison, plus five years supervised release, after she pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Shah appeared in Manhattan Federal Court on Friday for her sentencing, where U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein, who also presided over her guilty plea in July 2022, handed down her sentence to a packed courtroom.
The judge attributed the crowd to Shah’s reality television celebrity in his opening statements, cautioning spectators to look beyond her media persona.
“Jen Shah’s role on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, which I guess is why the courtroom is so full today, is just that, a role,” Stein said.
During her court appearance, Shah apologized for her actions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Seth Wenig/AP/ShutterstockThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jen Shah was sentenced on January 6 to six and a half years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a telemarketing scam that largely targeted senior citizens.
Shah pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in July.
Prosecutors said an appropriate sentencing range would be between 135 and 168 months, or 11 to 14 years, in federal lockup.
When Judge Sidney Stein handed down Shah’s sentence, she “stood by the defense table and remained expressionless as sentence was read, just looking down,” journalist Marta Dhanis tweeted.
There’s also the matter of the star’s “Shah Ski Chalet.” Impressive as it was, Shah didn’t own the manse, as once implied on the show.
