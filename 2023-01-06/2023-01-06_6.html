     Summary: "The Dodgers organization believes that allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence should be thoroughly investigated, with due process given to the accused," the Dodgers wrote in a statement.
"From the beginning, we have fully cooperated with Major League Baseball's investigation and strictly followed the process stipulated under MLB’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.
Two extensive reviews of all the available evidence in this case -- one by Commissioner [Rob] Manfred and another by a neutral arbitrator -- concluded that Mr. Bauer's actions warranted the longest ever active player suspension in our sport for violations of this policy.
Now that this process has been completed, and after careful consideration, we have decided that he will no longer be part of our organization."

     Dodgers say Trevor Bauer ‘no longer part of organization’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Dodgers are cutting ties with pitcher Trevor Bauer, whose unprecedented 324-game suspension over sexual misconduct allegations was reduced two weeks ago, allowing him to resume his career with the start of the new season.
“After careful consideration, we have decided that he will no longer be a part of our organization,” the Dodgers said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The Dodgers had until Friday to restore Bauer, the 31-year-old right-hander, to the roster under baseball’s rules and they didn’t announce their decision until late afternoon.
The team has rarely commented on the divisive case since Bauer was put on paid administrative leave in July 2021.
If Bauer, the 2020 NL Cy Young Award winner, is released, Los Angeles would remain responsible for the more than $22.5 million remaining on the pitcher’s contract.

     Los Angeles Dodgers cut ties with embattled pitcher Trevor Bauer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alden Gonzalez lays out the steps the Dodgers took before releasing Trevor Bauer, and speculates if another team could sign him.
(1:21)The Los Angeles Dodgers officially cut ties Friday with starting pitcher Trevor Bauer, the embattled former Cy Young Award winner who was previously handed an unprecedented suspension following allegations of sexual assault.
The ruling triggered a 14-day window for the Dodgers to decide whether to add him to their 40-man roster.
But the prolonged process only triggered outside speculation that the Dodgers might ultimately reinstate Bauer.
"While we were unable to communicate throughout the administrative leave and arbitration process, my representatives spoke to Dodgers leadership immediately following the arbitration decision," Bauer wrote in his statement.
