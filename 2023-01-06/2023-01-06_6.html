     Country Music Recording Engineer Mark Capps Shot And Killed By Nashville SWAT Team After Allegedly Holding Wife &amp; Stepdaughter Hostage At Gunpoint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Grammy-award winning country music recording engineer was shot and killed by a Nashville SWAT team yesterday after a warrant was issued for his arrest for allegedly holding his wife and stepdaughter hostage at gunpoint.
The women escaped when Capps fell asleep and drove to the police department, who obtained a warrant for Capps and called in a SWAT team to execute the warrant due to the threats Capps had made overnight.
As the SWAT team prepared to move in, Capps allegedly opened the door with his pistol in his hand.
When officers demanded that Capps show his hands, according to Aaron, officers “deemed that Capps’ movements posed an immediate, imminent threat” and opened fire.
Mark Capps has worked with names like Alabama, Tracy Lawrence, Blake Shelton, Amy Grant, the Dixie Chicks and Brooks &amp; Dunn.
