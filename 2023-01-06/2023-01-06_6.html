     Brooklyn Nets To Guarantee Contracts Of Three Key Players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are expected to guarantee the contracts of Yuta Watanabe, Edmond Sumner and Markieff Morris.
Early on in the season, many were writing off the Brooklyn Nets as being championship contenders, especially since they were 2-6 through their first eight games.
Well, that is about to change, as the Nets are expected to guarantee the contracts of all three players according to HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto.
Starting with Watanabe, he came to Brooklyn this season after spending the last two seasons with the Toronto Raptors and he is having a career-year off-the-bench.
From being a valuable defender to shooting 48.7 percent from three-point range, Morris is a great locker room player for this team to have.

     Summary: The most challenging stretch of the season is here — well, for as long as a number of very important players continue to miss games.
The New Orleans Pelicans will welcome the fireball that is the Brooklyn Nets tonight and then immediately embark on a five-game road trip that includes stops in Dallas, Boston and Cleveland.
The Pelicans will then have to deal with five consecutive road games, where they’re 7-10 on the season and have won just once in their last six attempts.
On the road, outcomes have been a toss-up overall (0.0 net rating) but a much scarier proposition of late (-7.8 net rating over last six road games).
Incidentally, the Nets had won seven straight away from Brooklyn until losing 121-112 in Chicago a few days ago.

     Summary: Yuta Watanabe, Edmond Sumner and Markieff Morris will have their contracts guaranteed by the Nets for the rest of the season, tweets Michael Scotto of HoopsHype.
Saturday marks the deadline for teams to waive players on non-guaranteed contracts and avoid paying their full-season salaries.
He’s making 51.4% of his three-point shots, the best percentage in the league, and is averaging a career-high 7.7 points per game in his fifth NBA season.
The Nets acquired him in a trade with Indiana before the start of the 2021/22 season, then re-signed him last offseason.
Sumner has appeared in 33 games, averaging 6.8 PPG in 14.4 minutes per night.

Kyrie Irving dribbles during the Nets’ win over the Pelicans on Jan. 6.
The Nets went into an offensive funk to start the fourth, a nearly 4 ½ minute scoreless drought.
And Irving — who’d been 4-for-16 to that point — followed with a pull-up 3-pointer to put the Nets back up 93-90.
They led 101-97 with two minutes left, and held the Pelicans at arm’s length to some clutch free throw shooting.

     Summary: By Erik Slater · 3 min readThe Brooklyn Nets have reportedly made decisions on three role players for the rest of the season, according to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype.
The Nets will guarantee the contracts of three minimum signings from this offseason: Yuta Watanabe, Edmond Sumner and Markieff Morris.
Watanabe has now carved out a valuable role as a 3-and-D spark plug off the bench for the streaking Nets.
More than anything, the 33-year-old was viewed as a valuable veteran presence following a 2021-22 Nets season that was plagued by internal dysfunction.
Watanabe, Sumner and Morris fill out one of the deepest Brooklyn rosters in recent memory.
