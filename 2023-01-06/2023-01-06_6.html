     Browns' Jadeveon Clowney sent home one day after criticizing Cleveland's coaching staff, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clowney, who won't practice with the team, is doubtful for the team's season finale and faces a possible suspension as well.
"I just feel like I need to be around somebody that believes in me and my ability," Clowney told Cleveland.com on Thursday.
I'm doing this because I love the game, but keep [doing things like that] and making me not love the game."
The pressure percentage of 10.2 is his lowest since 2018, while Clowney's four quarterback hits are the lowest since his rookie season -- when he played just four games.
He hasn't finished with 20 quarterback hits in a season since 2018 and has been held to under 30 pressures in a season two of the past three years.

     Browns send Jadeveon Clowney home after critical comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney was sent home Friday for critical comments and openly questioning whether Cleveland put him in position to succeed.
Clowney told Cleveland.com it has become apparent the Browns have "their own guys, and I ain't one of them, so it's time for me to get my exit slip."
The comments, published Thursday, pointed to the Browns focusing gameplans around defensive end Myles Garrett.
He said coaches asked him to switch defensive end positions with Garrett after they practiced on one side all week.
I've done my job," Clowney told Cleveland.com.

     Browns' Myles Garrett 'confused' by Jadeveon Clowney's barbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:38)BEREA, Ohio -- Myles Garrett said Friday that he was "disappointed" and "a little bit confused" by comments from fellow defensive end Jadeveon Clowney that prompted the Cleveland Browns to send Clowney home before Friday's practice.
Clowney has had a disappointing second season for the 7-9 Browns, who were eliminated from the AFC playoff picture two weeks ago.
After racking up nine sacks with the Browns last season, Clowney has only two sacks this year.
But they're also going to be positions where I'm going to get double-teamed.
But when asked whether he'd welcome Clowney back, Garrett said he wants "volunteers, not hostages" on the Browns.
