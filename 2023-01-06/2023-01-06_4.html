     6-year-old in custody after Virginia teacher injured in elementary classroom shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 6-year-old who police say opened fired in a Virginia classroom and seriously injured a teacher was in custody Friday, police said.
"This was not an accidental shooting," Newport News police Chief Steve Drew said.
No students were injured in the afternoon shooting at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, police said in a statement.
The shooting happened in a first-grade classroom, and the child and teacher, who knew each other, were apparently alone, Drew said at an evening news conference.
"The altercation was between a 6-year-old, the student, who did have the firearm, and the teacher, and then a round was fired," the chief said.

     Summary: A 6-year-old shot a teacher in a Virginia classroom, police sayEnlarge this image toggle caption Billy Schuerman/The Virginian-Pilot via AP Billy Schuerman/The Virginian-Pilot via APNORFOLK, Va. — A 6-year-old student shot and wounded a teacher at his school in Virginia during an altercation inside a first-grade classroom Friday, police and school officials in the city of Newport News said.
A school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Boston's Northeastern University.
Another factor that stands out about the Virginia shooting is that it occurred in a classroom, Fox said.
"There are students who killed teachers, more typically high school students," Fox said.
"I don't know of other cases where a 6-year-old shot a teacher."
