     Introspective Kyrie Irving lifts Nets late despite off night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS -- Despite finishing with a 7-for-22 shooting night, Kyrie Irving couldn't help but smile as he walked off the floor following a 108-102 win over the Pelicans on Friday at Smoothie King Center.
In a game that could have gotten away from the Nets, it was a reflective Irving who helped save the day.
The Nets have made winning a habit since new head coach Jacque Vaughn officially took over in early November.
The Nets continue finding ways to win games instead of finding ways to lose them, as they did early in the season.
"We've had a lot of wins so far this season, this one really stands out for me," Vaughn said.
