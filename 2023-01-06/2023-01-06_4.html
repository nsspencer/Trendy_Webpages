     Kevin McCarthy’s Hollow Victory Will Have Economic and Political Consequences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps the most revealing image of the ugly night came shortly after the final ballot had been completed.
In February, 2021, eleven House Republicans voted with the Democrats to strip Greene of her committee assignments.
But McCarthy’s humiliation has made clear how little flexibility he will have in managing his own caucus during the debt-ceiling brinkmanship.
More immediately, McCarthy’s hollow victory opens the way for months more of G.O.P.
Along the way, the enduring fealty of many House Republicans to Donald Trump is also likely to become clear.

     The Shakespearean Tragedy of Kevin McCarthy, Prince of Washington
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McCarthy must concede and concede even more to slake his own.”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) holds up the Speaker's gavel after winning the House speakership election in the 15th round of voting at the U.S. Capitol Jan. 7, 2023.
Although Young and Marcus opted for Macbeth, it was also hard not to think of Julius Caesar, Shakespeare’s recounting of the most famous betrayal of all time.
And it was power that McCarthy wanted and power that a tenth of the House GOP caucus wanted to wrest from him.
“I don’t care if we go to plurality and elect Hakeem Jeffries,” Gaetz declared in the meeting, according to McCarthy.
“Seasoned legislator, an experienced leader, a friend to so many of us, a proud conservative with a tireless work ethic, Kevin McCarthy has earned the speakership of the People’s House,” she said, echoing his words.
