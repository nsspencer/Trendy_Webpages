    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chiefs finished with a 14-3 record atop the AFC West, giving them 64 regular season wins from 2018 through 2022.
As a result, they join the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts as the only NFL franchises ever to win 64 or more regular season games in a five-year span.
They won 66 games from 2003 through 2007, and they won 64 games from 2007 through 2011.
It's important to note the Patriots and Colts earned those wins in 16-game seasons, whereas the Chiefs have benefited from a 17-game schedule in 2021 and 2022.
The defending AFC champion Bengals have beaten the Chiefs three straight times, including Week 13 of this season.

     WATCH: Chiefs deploy spinning huddle on wild gadget play vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a Week 18 rout of the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to do seemingly whatever they wanted on their way to the No.
On a 2nd and 3 in the red zone, the Chiefs ran a spinning huddle that resembled a "Ring Around the Rosie" before assembling on the line of scrimmage to run a gadget play.
Toney would end the play with a touchdown by breaking several tackles, but the play would be called back due to center Creed Humphrey committing a holding penalty.
Legendary quarterback Len Dawson was known to run a "choir huddle," which was run by the Chiefs as a preseason tribute to Dawson after his death last August.
The Chiefs also used a spin at the line of scrimmage on their first touchdown in Super Bowl LV, a play that was taken from the 1948 Rose Bowl.

"Something that was instilled with me right when I got here is we were gonna focus on the AFC West opponents,'' he said.
