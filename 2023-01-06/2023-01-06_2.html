     Bam Margera said he was "pronounced dead" after 5 seizures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just under a month after his hospitalization, Jackass star Bam Margera has recounted the experience that left him briefly pronounced dead in December 2022.
Margera says that his dire condition came as the result of an untreated case of COVID-19, and multiple prolonged seizures.
“Basically, I was pronounced dead on December 8,” Margera tells costar Steve-O on a Thursday episode of the latter’s “Wild Ride” podcast (via Variety) .
he did not participate in 2022's Jackass Forever, allegedly the result of a positive Adderall test that violated a “wellness agreement” Margera had signed.
Margera fired a wrongful termination lawsuit against Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine (who has a restraining order against Margera) in 2021.

     Summary: “I basically was pronounced dead on ... Dec. 8," Margera explained during his third visit to Steve-O's show.
