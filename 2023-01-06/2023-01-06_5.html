     Police: 6-year-old shoots teacher in Virginia classroom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Billy Schuerman/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A 6-year-old student shot and wounded a teacher at his school in Virginia during an altercation inside a first-grade classroom Friday, police and school officials in the city of Newport News said.
School officials have already said that there will be no classes at the school on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENTA school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Boston’s Northeastern University.
Another factor that stands out about the Virginia shooting is that it occurred in a classroom, Fox said.
“I don’t know of other cases where a 6-year-old shot a teacher.”___Barakat reported from Falls Church, Virginia.
