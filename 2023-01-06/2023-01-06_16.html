     Hakeem Jeffries Goes Through Democratic ABCs in Minority Leader Speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video contentRep. Hakeem Jeffries was feeling musical on the House floor after being elected House Minority Leader for the Democratic Party ... and he let his song be heard by all, from A to Z.
We'll get to him in a minute, but first ... listen to Jeffries' ABCs of red, white and blue.
Jeffries got huge applause throughout, and what sounds like a standing O at the end.
You could argue there was just as much enthusiasm within the GOP, when now-House Speaker McCarthy delivered his remarks to cap off the long night ... when he promised to push a strong conservative agenda and to reign in a lot of Pres.
