     Tennessee Titans' season ends with loss to Jacksonville Jaguars after backbreaking sack-fumble
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€• One play turned the Tennessee Titans from AFC South champs into postseason nonparticipants.
The Titans didn't outlast the Jacksonville Jaguarson Saturday, falling 20-16 to end their season on a seven-game losing streak while surrendering their AFC South crown to the Jaguars.
The Titans (7-10) lost on a crushing sack-fumble stripped out of the hands of quarterback Joshua Dobbs by Jaguars safety Rayshawn Jenkins.
Dobbs played as well as any Titans quarterback has all year, withstanding hits and evading pressure to keep drives alive and find targets downfield.
But as the second half wore on, Dobbs succumbed to some of the flaws that have recurred all season for this Titans offense.
