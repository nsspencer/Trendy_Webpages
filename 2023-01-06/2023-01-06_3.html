     What the Epiphany Teaches Us About Political Hatred
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The word epiphany itself doesn’t have anything to do with gift-giving.
On the contrary, we’re told the magi return to their own land and, presumably, to their roles as astronomers and priests.
The other significant character in Matthew’s tale is King Herod, the local Judean ruler, a puppet of the Romans.
Traditionally this slaughter is known as the massacre of the Holy Innocents, still a holy day in many Christian calendars.
They are more like King Herod than the Three Kings.

     Bulgarians celebrate Epiphany with traditional rituals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the cross is fished out, the priest sprinkles believers with water using a bunch of basil.
The celebration of Epiphany, or the Apparition of Christ, as Bulgarians call it, began on Friday in Sofia with a water blessing ceremony.
Epiphany marks the end of the 12 days of Christmas, but not all Orthodox Christian churches celebrate it on the same day.
AdvertisementWhile the Orthodox Christian churches in Greece, Bulgaria and Romania celebrate the feast on Jan. 6, Orthodox Churches in Russia, Ukraine and Serbia follow the Julian calendar, according to which Epiphany is celebrated on Jan. 19, as their Christmas falls on Jan. 7.
Some Western Christian churches celebrate the religious holiday of Epiphany as Three Kings Day, which marks the visit of the Magi, or three wise men, to the baby Jesus, and closes out the Christmas season.

     Maine Compass: Take Jan. 6 to search for your own ‘Epiphany’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An epiphany is an “aha” moment, a moment of clarity, when one intuitively sees the true nature or meaning of something.
In the Christian church, the time between Dec. 25 and Jan. 6 is known as the Twelve Days of Christmas.
The Feast of the Epiphany points to a great truth for every living human being.
The anniversary of the insurrection at our nation’s Capitol falls on no better day of self-evaluation than the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6, 2022.
Sadly, our Christian America is split on the epiphany of Jan 6.
