     Full Injury Report: Clippers vs. Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers are coming off one of the most embarrassing losses in the Kawhi Leonard and Paul George era, having been blown on by the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.
This was not the average blowout that sees a quarter of garbage time, this was a game that the Clippers conceded at halftime.
Pulling all of their starters at the half, the Clippers shifted their focus to tonight's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
As for the others, Nicolas Batum is the only other player out for the Clippers in this game.

     Nuggets blast Clippers by 31 in biggest rout of the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In front of a national TV audience, the Nuggets rocked the Clippers, 122-91, for their largest margin of victory of the season, besting a previous 25-point win.
“Don’t be satisfied,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone reminded his team before allowing them to savor the win after the game.
Now 25-13 on the season and 15-3 at home, the Nuggets will try to channel that same energy against Cleveland on Friday.
Dumbfounded by what he saw in the first half, Clippers coach Ty Lue benched his starters to open the second.
That substitution pattern wasn’t necessary in the first half of Thursday’s game as the Nuggets ran roughshod through the Clippers’ defense.

     Clippers are reeling, and Ty Lue and Kawhi Leonard offer different ideas to get past it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER — The LA Clippers have played their share of “burn the tape” games under head coach Tyronn Lue.
It is the largest loss of the season for the Clippers, and their four-game losing streak ties the team’s longest of the season.
The Clippers are reeling and continuing to be an unimpressive team heading into their 41st game of the season.
Five teams rank higher in the West standings, led by the Nuggets, and the Clippers are only 1-5 against those teams.
“We have to play harder, play faster, with some urgency, really,” Leonard said after Denver beat the Clippers for the seventh time in nine meetings.

     Summary: Friday was what the Timberwolves front office, fans and team had envisioned when Rudy Gobert came to town.
Gobert had his best game statistically in a Wolves uniform in Friday's 128-115 victory over the Clippers with 25 points and 21 rebounds.
"I don't think we've seen the best Rudy yet," he said.
Gobert was asked after the game why fans haven't seen "the best Rudy" yet.
It's on me to handle myself and to be on the court as the best Rudy I can be," Gobert said.
