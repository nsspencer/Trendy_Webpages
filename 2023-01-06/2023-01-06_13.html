    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN's Tim MacMahon reported Friday that the Dallas Mavericks are waiving Walker before his salary becomes guaranteed on Sunday.
Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum responded to MacMahon's tweet with a shamrock and eye emojis.
It doesn't take much to get NBA Twitter excited, especially if emojis are involved.
However, as an end-of-the-bench guy, Walker would be a good fit for the Celtics.
He's a good guy to have in the locker room.

Here’s what you should know:Walker signed with Dallas on Nov. 29 and appeared in nine games with one start.

Add in the guaranteed money that the team would’ve been on the hook for on Saturday, and Walker being waived by the team isn’t any surprise.
In fact, from the moment he was signed, it always seemed possible he wouldn’t finish the season in Dallas.
