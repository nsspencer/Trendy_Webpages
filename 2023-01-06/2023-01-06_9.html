     Dodgers' statement on Trevor Bauer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers organization believes that allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence should be thoroughly investigated, with due process given to the accused.
From the beginning, we have fully cooperated with Major League Baseball's investigation and strictly followed the process stipulated under MLB’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.
Two extensive reviews of all the available evidence in this case - one by Commissioner Manfred and another by a neutral arbitrator - concluded that Mr. Bauer's actions warranted the longest ever active player suspension in our sport for violations of this policy.
Now that this process has been completed, and after careful consideration, we have decided that he will no longer be part of our organization.

     Trevor Bauer designated for assignment by Los Angeles Dodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Dodgers are cutting ties with pitcher Trevor Bauer, whose unprecedented 324-game suspension over sexual misconduct allegations was reduced two weeks ago, allowing him to resume his career with the start of the new season.
If the 2020 NL Cy Young Award winner is released, Los Angeles would remain responsible for the more than $22.5 million remaining on the pitcher’s contract.
The team has rarely commented on the divisive case since Bauer was put on paid administrative leave in July 2021.
Bauer has maintained he did nothing wrong, saying that everything that happened between him and the woman was consensual.
Bauer joined his hometown Dodgers before the 2021 season on a $102 million, three-year contract.

     Dodgers Designate Trevor Bauer For Assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers have cut ties with Trevor Bauer.
That would have kept Bauer out for the entire 2022-23 seasons (and a few weeks in 2024); Bauer immediately appealed, becoming the first player to appeal a suspension levied under the domestic violence policy.
As the Dodgers mentioned in their statement, the panel found that Bauer had violated the Domestic Violence policy.
Suspensions under the domestic violence policy are unpaid.
As with any player designated for assignment, there’s now a seven-day window for the Dodgers to trade Bauer or place him on waivers.
