     Browns' Myles Garrett 'confused' by Jadeveon Clowney's barbs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Myles Garrett acknowledges the frustration circling the Browns' locker room but believes the team can do more.
Clowney has had a disappointing second season for the 7-9 Browns, who were eliminated from the AFC playoff picture two weeks ago.
After racking up nine sacks with the Browns last season, Clowney has only two sacks this year.
But they're also going to be positions where I'm going to get double-teamed.
But when asked whether he'd welcome Clowney back, Garrett said he wants "volunteers, not hostages" on the Browns.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney was sent home Friday for critical comments and openly questioning whether Cleveland put him in position to succeed.
Clowney told Cleveland.com it has become apparent the Browns have "their own guys, and I ain't one of them, so it's time for me to get my exit slip."
The comments, published Thursday, pointed to the Browns focusing gameplans around defensive end Myles Garrett.
He said coaches asked him to switch defensive end positions with Garrett after they practiced on one side all week.
I've done my job," Clowney told Cleveland.com.

The move came following comments to Cabot that he's "95% sure" he won't be back next year while criticizing coaches.
Browns coach Kevin Stefanski wouldn't reveal whether Clowney would play Sunday but noted, "nothing comes above the team."
The end of the road in Cleveland came as Clowney took issue with his usage under defensive coordinator Joe Woods.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns sent Jadeveon Clowney home Friday morning, one day after he criticized the coaching staff in an interview with Cleveland.com.
AdvertisementClowney told Cleveland.com that he chose to only play on third downs in the Browns’ Week 7 game at Baltimore after the game plan called for Myles Garrett to move around in passing situations.
Kiffin said Clowney never directly said he’d only play on third downs in that game at Baltimore, but said Clowney basically refused to go in the game unless it was third down.
Tensions rising in ClevelandThe Browns signed Clowney twice, so they knew what they were signing up for.
Stefanski’s refusal to discuss really any part of it publicly is frustrating, especially since we now know that this dates back to Week 7.
