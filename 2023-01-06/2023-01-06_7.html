     Dodgers cut ties with pitcher Trevor Bauer after MLB reinstatement, 194-game suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers designated Trevor Bauer for assignment Friday, ending a two-season partnership with the pitcher who was recently reinstated after a 194-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy.
An independent arbitrator reinstated Bauer on Dec. 22 and the Dodgers had two weeks to decide whether they would put the player back on their roster.
The 2020 National League Cy Young winner, Bauer signed a three-year, $102 million contract with the then-defending champion Dodgers in January 2021.
In a statement Friday, Bauer claimed the Dodgers told him a day earlier that the team wanted him to return and pitch for them.
"While we were unable to communicate throughout the administrative leave and arbitration process, my representatives spoke to Dodgers leadership immediately following the arbitration decision," Bauer said in his statement.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The Dodgers organization believes that allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence should be thoroughly investigated, with due process given to the accused," the Dodgers wrote in a statement.
"From the beginning, we have fully cooperated with Major League Baseball's investigation and strictly followed the process stipulated under MLB’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.
Two extensive reviews of all the available evidence in this case -- one by Commissioner [Rob] Manfred and another by a neutral arbitrator -- concluded that Mr. Bauer's actions warranted the longest ever active player suspension in our sport for violations of this policy.
Now that this process has been completed, and after careful consideration, we have decided that he will no longer be part of our organization."

     Dodgers say Trevor Bauer ‘no longer part of organization’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Dodgers are cutting ties with pitcher Trevor Bauer, whose unprecedented 324-game suspension over sexual misconduct allegations was reduced two weeks ago, allowing him to resume his career with the start of the new season.
“After careful consideration, we have decided that he will no longer be a part of our organization,” the Dodgers said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The Dodgers had until Friday to restore Bauer, the 31-year-old right-hander, to the roster under baseball’s rules and they didn’t announce their decision until late afternoon.
The team has rarely commented on the divisive case since Bauer was put on paid administrative leave in July 2021.
If Bauer, the 2020 NL Cy Young Award winner, is released, Los Angeles would remain responsible for the more than $22.5 million remaining on the pitcher’s contract.

     Dodgers Designate Trevor Bauer For Assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers have cut ties with Trevor Bauer.
That would have kept Bauer out for the entire 2022-23 seasons (and a few weeks in 2024); Bauer immediately appealed, becoming the first player to appeal a suspension levied under the domestic violence policy.
As the Dodgers mentioned in their statement, the panel found that Bauer had violated the Domestic Violence policy.
Suspensions under the domestic violence policy are unpaid.
As with any player designated for assignment, there’s now a seven-day window for the Dodgers to trade Bauer or place him on waivers.
