     Summary: AdvertisementIn the West, the Epiphany principally celebrates the visit of the Magi to the child Jesus.
This year Catholics will celebrate the feast of the Epiphany on Sunday, Jan. 8, with the Gospel reading about the Magi from Matthew 2:1-12.
The Orthodox celebrate Epiphany on Jan. 19.
Catholics will celebrate the baptism of the Lord on the day after the Epiphany with the baptismal account from Matthew.

     What the Epiphany Teaches Us About Political Hatred
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The word epiphany itself doesn’t have anything to do with gift-giving.
On the contrary, we’re told the magi return to their own land and, presumably, to their roles as astronomers and priests.
The other significant character in Matthew’s tale is King Herod, the local Judean ruler, a puppet of the Romans.
Traditionally this slaughter is known as the massacre of the Holy Innocents, still a holy day in many Christian calendars.
They are more like King Herod than the Three Kings.

     Maine Compass: Take Jan. 6 to search for your own ‘Epiphany’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An epiphany is an “aha” moment, a moment of clarity, when one intuitively sees the true nature or meaning of something.
In the Christian church, the time between Dec. 25 and Jan. 6 is known as the Twelve Days of Christmas.
The Feast of the Epiphany points to a great truth for every living human being.
The anniversary of the insurrection at our nation’s Capitol falls on no better day of self-evaluation than the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6, 2022.
Sadly, our Christian America is split on the epiphany of Jan 6.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You can probably see a similarity between “magi” and the word “magic.” That’s no coincidence.
If you were writing a story about people looking for Jesus, Magi would be the most unlikely characters to describe doing such a thing!
The miracle of the Magi is that the God of Jesus spoke to them in their context so that they could find Jesus and worship him.
If you took a moment to think about a person that you think is farthest from God than any other person you know, just remember: you never know what God may be doing in their life.
They may be on their way to finding the hope, joy, love and peace of God.
