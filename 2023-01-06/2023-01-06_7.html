     ‘Call Me Kat’: Dolly Parton Pays Surprise Tribute to Leslie Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Country music legend Dolly Parton made a surprise appearance on Thursday’s (January 5) winter premiere of Fox‘s Call Me Kat, paying tribute to her good friend Leslie Jordan.
The emotional episode gave a heartfelt send-off to Jordan’s character, Phil, the beloved baker who worked at Kat’s (Mayim Bialik) cafe.
It wasn’t just the characters saying goodbye, though, as Parton popped up in a surprise video message at the end of the episode.
You made us happy while you were here, and we’re happy that you’re at peace.
What we’re really doing is mourning the loss of our dear friend, Leslie Jordan,” Bialik said.
