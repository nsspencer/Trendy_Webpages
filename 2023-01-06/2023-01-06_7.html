     Mendy fails to defy critics in his toughest season at Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He may not be the only one to blame for the defeat at Villarreal, but Ferland Mendy has not managed to defy critics who question his presence in Real Madrid's first team.
Antonio Rudiger has yet to impress at the back and opponents are making the most of Real Madrid's defensive frailties.
Real Madrid are waiting for offers to arrive and anything could happen if Mendy fails to live up to expectations.
Going back to what was Real Madrid's second LaLiga Santander defeat, the team were clumsy in defence, struggling to build from the back against Villarreal.
Poor mistakesMendy does not provide balance to the Real Madrid defence as he used to do in the past.

     Setién's Villarreal beats Real Madrid 2-1 in Spanish league
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pulsating Spanish league match at Villarreal’s remodeled Estadio de la Cerámica could have ended with more goals, especially for the all-yellow hosts.
Villarreal, which held Madrid to five consecutive draws at its stadium, took the initiative and forced Madrid’s defenders into sloppy passing.
“We played an extraordinary match against an extraordinary team,” Setién said.
Once back in Spain, Madrid will face another trip to Villarreal in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals.
According to Opta statistics, this was the first time Madrid did not have a Spaniard on the field at kickoff in a Spanish league game in this century.

     Real Madrid slump to 2-1 defeat at Villarreal as Moreno shines

     Summary: [1/3] Soccer Football - LaLiga - Villarreal v Real Madrid - Estadio de la Ceramica, Villarreal, Spain - January 7, 2023 Villarreal's Gerard Moreno scores their second goal from the penalty spot REUTERS/Pablo MoranoJan 7 (Reuters) - Real Madrid suffered a 2-1 defeat at Villarreal on Saturday after a goal and assist from striker Gerard Moreno, giving leaders Barcelona a chance to move ahead in the title race.
Real stay second, level on 38 points with Barca who visit fourth-placed Atletico Madrid on Sunday, while Villarreal's third straight league win moves them up to fifth spot.
Yeremy had the best chance of the first half after he was played through on goal by Moreno, but Thibaut Courtois was quickly off his line to block the shot.
Madrid grew into the game following Villarreal's goal, with Benzema and Vinicius continuing to orchestrate the champions' attacking efforts.
Moreno converted after Madrid's protests had calmed down, sending Courtois the wrong way to put his side back in the lead.
