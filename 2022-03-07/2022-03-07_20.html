     Teen with firearm apprehended at Joint Base Andrews
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 17-year-old male with a firearm was apprehended Sunday after a vehicle ignored security personnel commands at the Main Gate of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, and another individual from the vehicle remains at large.
According to Joint Base Andrews, the 316th Security Forces Group and local authorities conducted a search of the base to confirm the second individual was no longer on the base premises.
Joint Base Andrews’ Main Gate closed at roughly 9 p.m. on Sunday, and reopened at approximately 3 a.m. Monday.
The Pentagon announced in February the Air Force Inspector General was launching an investigation into base security worldwide, after an intruder obtained unauthorized access and entered a jet at Joint Base Andrews.
“The acting secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force chief of staff are going to order the Air Force Inspector General to fully investigate this.”

     One Joint Base Andrews intruder in custody, another still at large following sweep of the Maryland post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A teenage intruder with a gun was apprehended, and a second remained at large Monday, after an overnight sweep of Joint Base Andrews determined there was no threat on the Maryland military post, officials said.
They fled the vehicle on foot, ignoring commands of Air Force security personnel, officials said.
The incident was under investigation, and a Joint Base Andrews spokesman said he could not detail precisely what occurred before the suspects ran from the vehicle.
After an hourslong sweep of the installation, including in its housing areas, Security Forces determined the individual was no longer on Joint Base Andrews, according to the statement.
The Air Force launched a service-wide review of security procedures after that incident, but the inspector general found no systemic issues with installation access security at Joint Base Andrews.
