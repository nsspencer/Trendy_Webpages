     Fashion Nova CEO outed as $126M buyer of LA’s biggest mansion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fast fashion company Fashion Nova keeps its prices affordable — but its owner splashed out nine figures to buy a roughly 105,000-square-foot Los Angeles mansion.
The estate sold far below its intended $500 million asking price, and its most recent one of $295 million while listed by real estate brokers on the open market.
At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported the buyers are local to Los Angeles who won’t live there, but planned to use it as an investment.
Saghian founded Fashion Nova in Vernon, Calif. — a city southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Other home features include 360-degree views of the Pacific Ocean, the Los Angeles skyline and the San Gabriel Mountains.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementThe buyer of the cut-price Bel Air mega-mansion, once dubbed America's most expensive home, has been revealed as fast-fashion tycoon, Richard Saghian, the CEO of Fashion Nova.
Saghian started Fashion Nova in 2006 in the industrial southern L.A. suburb of Vernon and continues to serve as its CEO and owns the business outright.
More so, Versace claims Fashion Nova uses other tactics to confuse fashionistas, even using trademarks that are 'confusingly similar.'
'Moreover, Fashion Nova uses other unauthorized search engine optimization tactics and/or social media spamming so that Fashion Nova webpages show up at or near the top of relevant search results and misdirect consumers searching for Versace Apparel,' it adds.
These are example of the design Versace claims were ripped off by Fashion Nova in a lawsuit from 2019.
