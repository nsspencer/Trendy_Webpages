     Summary: What Is Andrew Cuomo Up To?
Andrew Cuomo spoke at God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in Brooklyn on Sunday, in his first public appearance since his resignation.
While he has some loyal supporters, many formerly close allies have said they do not see space in public life for Mr. Cuomo.
“There is absolutely no future for Andrew Cuomo in public life in New York State or anywhere else,” said Christine Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council who was once a close Cuomo ally.
As he continues his march back into the public eye, here are five possible scenarios for Mr. Cuomo and their significant attendant challenges, based on interviews with New York Democratic strategists, officials and Cuomo associates.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York last year over sexual harassment allegations, is a “sick, pathetic man”, the state attorney general said on Sunday in a stinging rebuke.
Cuomo had spoken at a Brooklyn church, complaining about cancel culture and the accusations against him and also appearing to hint at a political comeback.
“Even though multiple independent investigations found his victims to be credible, Cuomo continues to blame everyone but himself.”The attorney general also said New Yorkers were “ready to move forward from this sick, pathetic man”.
“They used cancel culture to effectively overturn an election.”Cuomo resigned days after being found to have sexually harassed women.
Last month, a New York state trooper sued Cuomo, claiming he caused severe mental anguish and emotional distress by touching her inappropriately and making suggestive comments.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the same time, Cuomo appeared to tease a return to public life during the speech, which he delivered in person at a church in Brooklyn on Sunday.
New York Attorney General Letitia James brought in attorneys Joon Kim — a former federal prosecutor — and Anne Clark — a discrimination attorney — to conduct the investigation.
The New York Attorney General’s Office has pushed back on that argument , framing it as a misleading attempt by Cuomo to save face after the barrage of controversies.
Cuomo has denied that he touched anyone inappropriately, but has admitted to making remarks to women that made them uncomfortable.
But, by the way I don't want to be at peace,” Cuomo said.
