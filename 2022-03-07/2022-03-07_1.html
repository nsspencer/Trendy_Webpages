     It wasn’t even two years ago when oil prices were negative.
One of the few buyers of oil then, legendary financier Carl Icahn, has completely sold out of his stake in oil-and-gas producer Occidental Petroleum now, which is one way of saying that not everyone is convinced that oil has just one direction to move.
Pretty much everyone else is, though.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oil futures remained sharply higher early Monday after the U.S. benchmark briefly topped the $130 level in electronic trade overnight as momentum builds for a ban on Russian oil imports.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. was considering an embargo of Russian oil imports “in coordination” with European and NATO allies in response to Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
CL.1, CLJ22, was up $2.80, or 2.4%, at $118.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after trading as high as $130.50 overnight.

Doubts about achieving a nuclear disarmament agreement between Iran and world powers also was helping to push prices of crude higher, Reuters reported.

     Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices surged past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Russian oil has so far been spared western sanctions, at least directly, in an effort to minimize economic fallout in the U.S. and Europe.
However, if the U.S. and its allies act in concert to restrict Russian exports, global prices could climb higher.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.
