     As Oil Blasts Higher, It’s Worth Remembering What Happened the Last Time Prices Reached a Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It wasn’t even two years ago when oil prices were negative.
One of the few buyers of oil then, legendary financier Carl Icahn, has completely sold out of his stake in oil-and-gas producer Occidental Petroleum now, which is one way of saying that not everyone is convinced that oil has just one direction to move.
Pretty much everyone else is, though.

     Oil Prices Jump as U.S. Discusses Russian Import Ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The price of oil has jumped again as the United States considers an embargo on Russian imports in response to the war in Ukraine.
The cost of Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up about 14 percent on Monday, trading at about $129 a barrel.
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was up about 8 percent, at around $125 a barrel.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the United States was considering a ban on Russian oil imports.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been pushing President Biden to ban Russian oil as they search for new ways to punish the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.

     Russia-Ukraine war to keep crude oil prices elevated at high levels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The intensifying Russian war on Ukraine should keep crude prices elevated at their highest levels in more than a decade for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
If oil prices continue to rise, it could usher in a global recession.
Nevertheless, a growing chorus on Congress is calling for an outright ban on Russian crude oil imports.
North America, however, only gets a small fraction of its crude oil from Russia.
The oil market, however, is a global one and no matter who buys Russian oil, the market is tacitly out millions of barrels of oil per day that will be difficult to replace.

     Brent crude reached $139.13 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) hit $130.50 in early trading, the highest levels for the benchmarks since July 2008.
Global oil prices have spiked about 60% since the start of 2022, along with other commodities, raising concerns about world economic growth and stagflation.
The head of Japan's largest business lobby said the country's imports of Russian crude could not be replaced immediately.
Russia is Japan's fifth-biggest supplier of crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

     U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
