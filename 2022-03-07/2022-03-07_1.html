games last year, one of the harshest penalties a major American sports league has doled out since the N.F.L.
Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement on Monday that Ridley, 27, placed bets on N.F.L.
games during a five-day period in late November 2021 when he was away from the club to focus on his mental health.
After an investigation, the league “uncovered no evidence indicating any inside information was used or that any game was compromised in any way,” Goodell said in the statement.

In a series of tweets posted Monday, Ridley wrote that he had bet $1500 in total and expressed disbelief in the length of the punishment.
Ridley's gambling took place over a period of five days in late November, the league wrote.
At the time, Goodell wrote that legalized sports gambling could "damage irreparably the integrity of, and public confidence in, NFL football."
He was suspended for the entire 2020 season and was reinstated by the league last year, although he did not play last season.

"For decades, gambling on NFL games has been considered among the most significant violations of league policy warranting the most substantial sanction.
NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported that Ridley used his personal phone to place parlay bets.

Now, based on the ongoing legalization of sports betting across the U.S., I can understand if someone believes that an NFL player should be able to wager on, say, a fight or an NBA game.
There are massive signs in every NFL locker room that remind players every day they can’t bet; trust me, I’ve seen them.
If you miss them, or all the other reminders the league and teams have given, then it’s on you.
As part of the process, the NFL found that no Atlanta players, staff or coaches had any idea of Ridley’s activity.
