     Oil Jumps Near $123 as Chance of Russian Ban Spurs Crisis Fears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oil had its biggest daily swing ever, surging to near $140 before pulling back, on the prospect of even tighter supplies after the U.S. said it was considering a ban on Russian crude imports.
Brent subsequently eased to about $121, a level that’s exacerbating fears of a major inflationary shock to the global economy.
The Biden administration is mulling whether to prohibit Russian oil imports without the participation of allies in Europe, at least initially, according to people familiar with the matter.
Germany said it has no plans to halt Russian energy imports, bolstering the volatility in the market.

     Russia-Ukraine war to keep crude oil prices elevated at high levels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The intensifying Russian war on Ukraine should keep crude prices elevated at their highest levels in more than a decade for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
If oil prices continue to rise, it could usher in a global recession.
Nevertheless, a growing chorus on Congress is calling for an outright ban on Russian crude oil imports.
North America, however, only gets a small fraction of its crude oil from Russia.
The oil market, however, is a global one and no matter who buys Russian oil, the market is tacitly out millions of barrels of oil per day that will be difficult to replace.

     Stocks drop, oil prices hit decade highs as US considers Russian import ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Prices have jumped to record highs as the war interrupts shipments and prompts fears of a wheat shortage in Europe.
US gas prices have risen in tandem with oil.
As The Post previously reported, analysts warned gas prices could reach $5 per gallon – and potentially much higher – if there were further interruptions to Russian gas and oil exports.
The legislation would ban imports of Russian oil and energy products into the US, among other measures, according to Pelosi.
“We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil, while making sure that there’s still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets.

     US stocks open lower, oil still high but off earlier peak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street but keeping their losses in check as an early spike in crude oil prices abated.
A surge in oil prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought worries that inflation could get worse if energy prices continue to soar.
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
