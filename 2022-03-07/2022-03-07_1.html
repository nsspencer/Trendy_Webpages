     Hold onto your wallets, gas prices are heading to an all-time record high. Here are a few ways to protect yourself
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With gasoline prices at a 14-year high, it's hard to imagine paying even more at the pump.
On Sunday, the national average for a gallon of gas hit $4.009, the highest since July 2008, according to data from AAA.
An increase in demand along with a reduction in supply is quickly driving up prices at gas stations, the automotive group said.
According to GasBuddy, the average price of gasoline will likely set a new all-time record within a day.
In Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio, gas prices jumped 30 cents or more in about a week, according to AAA.

     There are ways experts said you can try to save money at the pump as gas prices surge.
All over Georgia, gas prices are surging as expensive oil pushes costs to new heights.
According to AAA, gas costs in the Peach state are pushing $4 per gallon statewide.
AAA said the most expensive Georgia metro markets are in Brunswick at $3.94, Macon at $3.91, and Valdosta at $3.90.
The entire nation is feeling the pressure in their pockets due to rising gas costs.

     Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesOil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices jumped past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Gasoline prices have jumped by 45 cents a gallon in the last week, to a national average of $4.06, according to AAA.
Diesel fuel prices jumped even more rapidly, to a national average of $4.61 per gallon.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gasoline prices are pushing even farther above $4 a gallon, the highest price that American motorists have faced since July 2008, as calls grow to ban imports of Russian oil.
In today’s terms, the record price would be equal to about $5.24 after accounting for inflation.
The increasingly violent Russian attack on Ukraine has increased calls to cut off Russia from the money it gets from oil and natural gas exports.
READ MORE: U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surgePresident Joe Biden has been reluctant to ban Russian oil, fearing it could further fuel inflation heading into the midterm elections this November.
Talk of a ban on Russian oil has led U.S. officials to consider other sources that are currently limited.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.

     Stocks fell again on Monday as inflation fears, rising oil prices and continued tensions with Russia added to economic worries for global markets.
London CNN Business —The run-up in oil prices since Russia invaded Ukraine has been dramatic.
Breaking it down: For many in the West, there’s already a de facto ban on Russian oil.
JPMorgan’s strategists said last week that if disruptions to Russian oil last “throughout the year,” prices could rise to $185 per barrel.
But Tonhaugen thinks oil prices may need to jump to $200 per barrel before demand really starts to take a hit and a rebalancing of the market begins.
