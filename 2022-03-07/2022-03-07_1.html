     Oil Climbs as Chance of Russian Ban Spurs Supply Crisis Fears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Oil had its biggest daily swing ever with Brent surging to near $140 before pulling back sharply after the U.S. said it was considering a ban on Russian crude imports.
The international benchmark subsequently pulled back to about $120 and West Texas Intermediate traded above $116, exacerbating fears of a major inflationary shock to the global economy.
The Biden administration is mulling whether to prohibit Russian oil imports without the participation of allies in Europe, at least initially, according to people familiar with the matter.

     Russia-Ukraine war to keep crude oil prices elevated at high levels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The intensifying Russian war on Ukraine should keep crude prices elevated at their highest levels in more than a decade for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
If oil prices continue to rise, it could usher in a global recession.
Nevertheless, a growing chorus on Congress is calling for an outright ban on Russian crude oil imports.
North America, however, only gets a small fraction of its crude oil from Russia.
The oil market, however, is a global one and no matter who buys Russian oil, the market is tacitly out millions of barrels of oil per day that will be difficult to replace.

     Stocks drop, oil prices hit decade highs as US considers Russian import ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Prices have jumped to record highs as the war interrupts shipments and prompts fears of a wheat shortage in Europe.
US gas prices have risen in tandem with oil.
As The Post previously reported, analysts warned gas prices could reach $5 per gallon – and potentially much higher – if there were further interruptions to Russian gas and oil exports.
The legislation would ban imports of Russian oil and energy products into the US, among other measures, according to Pelosi.
“We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil, while making sure that there’s still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets.

     Stocks fall on Wall Street as US oil price briefly hits $130
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are falling in early trading on Wall Street, as more gains for oil prices threaten to worsen the world's already high inflation.
Gold and a measure of nervousness on Wall Street were also higher, but not by as much as they had been when oil prices were at their peak.
Markets took much of their cue from oil prices, which have soared recently on worries that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will upend already tight supplies.
A barrel of U.S. crude oil was trading at $117.67 per barrel, up 1.7%, after earlier touching $130.50.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
