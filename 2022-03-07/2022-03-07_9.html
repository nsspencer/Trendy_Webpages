    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he was later diagnosed with a left middle finger injury, the team announced Monday.
The news on Allen is a tough blow for a team trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
Sunday’s win gave Cleveland (37-27) a three-game lead over Toronto for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All-Star center Jarrett Allen will be sidelined indefinitely after fracturing his left middle finger in Sunday's win over Toronto, the latest setback for a Cleveland team that can't seem to catch a break.
The 7-footer may have hurt his finger when he bashed his left hand into the rim while blocking a a shot.
The Cavs were able to hold on without Allen and beat the Raptors 104-96 to tighten their grip on the No.
The 20-year-old Mobley has been unflappable in his first season, and the Cavs will count on him more than ever.
He’s learning on the fly.”Fortunately for the Cavs, 10 of their final 14 regular-season games are at home.
