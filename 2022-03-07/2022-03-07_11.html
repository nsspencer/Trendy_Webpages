     Supreme Court Will Not Review Decision to Overturn Bill Cosby’s Conviction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled last June that Mr. Cosby’s due process rights had been violated when the Montgomery County District Attorney’s office pursued a criminal case against him despite what the appellate court found was a binding verbal promise not to prosecute given to him by a previous district attorney.
But he held out the possibility of a civil action “with a much lower standard of proof.” Ms. Constand later received $3.38 million as part of a settlement in her civil case against Mr. Cosby.
During the civil case, Mr. Cosby acknowledged giving narcotics to women as part of an effort to have sex with them, a statement that was later introduced as evidence at Mr. Cosby’s trial.
Following Mr. Cosby’s conviction in 2018, an intermediate appeals court in Pennsylvania found that no formal agreement never to prosecute had ever existed, a position that aligned with what the trial court had ruled.
But in a 6-to-1 ruling, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that Mr. Cosby had, in fact, relied on Mr. Castor’s assurances that he wouldn’t be prosecuted, and that charging Mr. Cosby and using his testimony concerning drugs at the criminal trial had violated his due process rights.

     Supreme Court rejects appeal of Bill Cosby's overturned conviction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailThe Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal of a Pennsylvania court ruling that overturned comedian Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction.
Why it matters: Cosby had been sentenced to 3–10 years in prison for drugging and molesting a woman in 2004 before his conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
The big picture: The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in June that an agreement he struck to provide testimony in a civil lawsuit in 2005 and 2006 should have given him immunity in the case.
Prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to review the ruling that led to Cosby's conviction being overturned and the origins of the testimonial agreement.
The Supreme Court rejected the appeal and many others without commentary.

     Supreme Court declines to revive Bill Cosby prosecution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Supreme Court left in place Monday an opinion by Pennsylvania's highest court that overturned comedian Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction, rejecting a bid from Pennsylvania prosecutors to review the decision.
Cosby was convicted of aggravated indecent assault in 2018 for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in his Pennsylvania home in 2004.
He was released from prison in June after the state's Supreme Court overturned his sexual assault conviction on the grounds that his due process rights had been violated.
The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court justices said in their opinion that a former Montgomery County district attorney's decision to not prosecute Cosby in 2005 in return for his deposition in a civil case was ultimately used against him at trial.
"Mr. Cosby's Constitutional Rights were a 'reprehensible bait and switch' by Kevin Steele, Judge Steve T. O'Neill and their cohorts," Wyatt said.

     Supreme Court turns away appeal in Bill Cosby case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) — The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid by a Pennsylvania prosecutor to appeal a state court ruling last summer that overturned actor Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction.
The justices’ move, which came in a brief unsigned order without noted dissent, leaves intact a June ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that led to Cosby’s release from prison.
That ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court in November by the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pa., whose office played a central role in Cosby’s sexual assault case.
The dispute traces back to a 2005 determination by then-Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor that there was insufficient evidence to convict Cosby for the assault.
Cosby’s legal team had urged the justices to let the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling stand.

     Supreme Court will not review decision that freed Bill Cosby from prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Supreme Court will not review the sexual assault case against Bill Cosby, leaving in place a decision by Pennsylvania’s highest court that vacated the comedian's 2018 indecent assault conviction and freed him from prison in June.
A former Montgomery County district attorney said he would not prosecute Cosby in 2005 in return for his testimony.
Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law,” he said at the time.
Gloria Allred, who represented 33 Cosby accusers, said in a statement she is “not surprised” by the Supreme Court's decision.
“Although Mr. Cosby will not testify at our civil trial, our case will still proceed and our brave client and other witnesses will testify,” Allred said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Constand and her lawyers, in a statement, called the decision an "unfortunate outcome for everyone, especially sexual assault survivors."
He was arrested in the Constand case on Dec. 30, 2015, just days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.
Steele had reopened the case after The Associated Press went to federal court to unseal Cosby's long-buried testimony in Constand's lawsuit.
Scores of women have come forward to say Cosby also sexually assaulted them, but Constand's is the only one that led to an arrest.
Constand later sued Castor for defamation and won a settlement from him.
