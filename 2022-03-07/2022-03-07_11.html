     Andrew Cuomo Decries Cancel Culture In Recent Church Appearance

     Andrew Cuomo Decries Cancel Culture In Recent Church AppearanceFormer New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has been trying to work his way back into the spotlight — this time by giving a speech at a church.
Cuomo shot back, saying his resignation would be "reckless and dangerous" and claiming that Schumer and Gillibrand, among other Democrats, wanted him to "bow to cancel culture."
Cancel culture has a few different definitions.
But self-declared victims of cancel culture, like Cuomo, define the movement as something different.
Erica Vladimer, co-founder of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, explained to the New York Post that "cancel culture is a term people who don't believe in accountability use to advise their own narrative."

     What Is Andrew Cuomo Up To?
Andrew Cuomo spoke at God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in Brooklyn on Sunday, in his first public appearance since his resignation.
While he has some loyal supporters, many formerly close allies have said they do not see space in public life for Mr. Cuomo.
“There is absolutely no future for Andrew Cuomo in public life in New York State or anywhere else,” said Christine Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council who was once a close Cuomo ally.
As he continues his march back into the public eye, here are five possible scenarios for Mr. Cuomo and their significant attendant challenges, based on interviews with New York Democratic strategists, officials and Cuomo associates.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York last year over sexual harassment allegations, is a “sick, pathetic man”, the state attorney general said on Sunday in a stinging rebuke.
Cuomo had spoken at a Brooklyn church, complaining about cancel culture and the accusations against him and also appearing to hint at a political comeback.
“Even though multiple independent investigations found his victims to be credible, Cuomo continues to blame everyone but himself.”The attorney general also said New Yorkers were “ready to move forward from this sick, pathetic man”.
“They used cancel culture to effectively overturn an election.”Cuomo resigned days after being found to have sexually harassed women.
Last month, a New York state trooper sued Cuomo, claiming he caused severe mental anguish and emotional distress by touching her inappropriately and making suggestive comments.

     Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo slammed CNN over the weekend for firing his brother Chris Cuomo during a speech at God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in Brooklyn, New York.
Chris Cuomo was fired in December following a brief suspension for his extensive involvement in his brother's political machinations as he sought to head off harassment charges.

     New York governor Andrew Cuomo delivers remarks on COVID-19 in Manhattan, N.Y., November 15, 2020.
AdvertisementAdvertisementCuomo claimed he had been “vindicated” in the months since his resignation, noting that five district attorneys have not pressed charges against him after concluding their investigations into some of the claims, according to the New York Times.
Still, Cuomo used the prosecutors’ decisions not to bring charges as evidence that state attorney general Letitia James’s report was false.
He used the phrase “cancel culture” more than a dozen times in his speech, according to the Times.
“I resigned as governor, the press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired,” Andrew Cuomo said.
