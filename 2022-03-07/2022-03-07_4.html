Now, an undisclosed company has reportedly negotiated for a 20-year deal for naming rights to the stadium, which has a capacity of 62,000.
It’s not clear how long the franchise would be able to hold out on securing a deal of that magnitude.
In November, Tottenham posted a $106.9 million loss for its fiscal 2021.for its fiscal 2021.
The club’s debt increased to $943 million from $808.1 million after 2020.from $808.1 million after 2020.

It doesn’t happen very often, so when Spurs are able to beat the brakes off of another club it sticks in the memory.
If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK.

     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Tottenham stayed in the race for the English Premier League top four after a 5-0 hammering of…LONDON (AP) — Tottenham stayed in the race for the English Premier League top four after a 5-0 hammering of an Everton side that is in grave relegation danger after Monday.
Harry Kane scored twice and Son Heung-min and Sergio Reguilon also netted.
It was another Kane masterclass, with his second goal a particular highlight, and he took his tally to 14 goals in 15 games against Everton.
Spurs equalled their best ever Premier League win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will have real belief that they can gate-crash the Champions League qualification places.
But it was clear from early on that this was going to be a good night as they took early control of the game.

     Summary: Although Everton are still in the FA Cup, having seen off Boreham Wood in midweek, their league form is still a significant concern.
Bar a 3-0 win at home to Leeds, Everton's recent games have given their fans little to cheer, with their last three away games seeing them lose at Southampton, Newcastle, and Norwich.
Tottenham lost their last two league games in their own stadium, with a 3-2 defeat against Southampton followed by a 2-0 defeat against Wolves.
Antonio Conte has never lost three consecutive league games at home in his career, and he'll be looking to continue that record today.
With Son Heung-Min scoring six in his last 11 league games, as well as picking up four assists, he could be the dangerman for Spurs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it dropped Richarlison pulled back his favoured left foot, swung and, to joyful cheers from the home support, missed completely.
Everton were bright enough in the opening exchanges, snapping into challenges and denying the home side space as they tried to play out of defence.
The problem was that they seemed much less motivated when it came to denying Spurs space to play into theirs.
Tottenham were excellent, with Kulusevski providing a lesser goal threat than Harry Kane and Son Heung-min but offering real creativity both with crosses and through-balls.
Michael Keane’s own goal gives Tottenham a 1-0 lead over Everton.

     Tottenham thrash Everton to close the gap to the top four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet, that will be the least of Lampard's concerns after this harrowing night; one of the worst in recent memory for Everton.
Before Everton even had time to regroup, they found themselves two-down; Son Heung-min firing Dejan Kulusevski's pass straight through Jordan Pickford.
Soon after the goal, the in-stadium cameras panned to the Everton keeper in the midst of pulling his jersey over his face.
By the time half-time came around they were 3-0 down, Kane breaking Everton's offside trap to finish clinically past Pickford.
The Everton youngster has a big future ahead of him, but his colleagues were letting him down.
