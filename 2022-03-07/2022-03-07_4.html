     Here's What Twitter Is Saying About Cam Reddish's Big Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday night in California by a score of 116-93, and Cam Reddish had his best game since joining the Knicks.
The former Duke star had 17 points and was a +22 in 25 minutes of playing time.
He began his career as the tenth overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2019 NBA Draft, and was traded from the Hawks to the Knicks earlier this month.
On the Hawks, he had been averaging over 23 minutes of playing time per game this season, but since being traded to the Knicks, he has only been playing 14.2 minutes per game.
A lot of people were talking about Reddish on Twitter on Sunday night, and some of those tweets can be seen embedded below.

     “You ready to watch me become a mental patient over the Knicks?” I tell Joan, my girlfriend’s dog.
In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.

     Young, wild and free: Knicks team ‘Tank’ snaps 7-game funk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

     Taking the ball out of his hands has allowed him to return to the style that made Knicks fans fall in love with him.
When Randle and Burks subbed in for Barrett and Fournier at the 6:21 mark of the second quarter, the score was 41-22.
The same unit that started the second quarter for the Knicks started the fourth, and the result was remarkably similar.
But Knicks fans’ eyes remained glued to the screen.
So they watched each of the final six minutes with jubilant interest until the final buzzer sounded and the scoreboard read: Knicks 116, Clippers 93.

     LOS ANGELES – The LA Clippers taking on the New York Knicks on Sunday night marked the second meeting between head coaches Tyronn Lue and Tom Thibodeau.
Reggie Jackson is playing great, [Marcus] Morris has played great, [Ivica] Zubac has played great, [Luke] Kennard is shooting the ball unbelievable.
“I try anything man because I don’t care,” Tyronn Lue said of Tom Thibodeau calling him a gambler.

Tyronn Lue will remain as creative as he possibly can in finding lineups and defenses that can reel in wins.

     The Sports Report: Clippers routed by the Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AdvertisementThree days after the Clippers’ dead-eye accuracy against the Lakers marked one extreme – the Clippers’ 63% three-point shooting was their best against the Lakers since 1994 – Sunday’s revealed the other in stark contrast.
The Clippers needed six minutes and 14 attempts to make their first shot of the second quarter.
Amir Coffey scored 16 points off the bench to lead the Clippers, who also got 14 points from Hartenstein.
Just as the Knicks grabbed 12 more rebounds and saw R.J. Barrett score 28 points in their matinee victory against the Clippers in January, Barrett dropped 24 points and the Knicks’ size, led by center Mitchell Robinson, caused problems yet again.
George Mikan and the Lakers win 65-63.
