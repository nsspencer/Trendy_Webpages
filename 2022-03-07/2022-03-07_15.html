     Alec Baldwin Says 'Rust' Lawsuits Are Targeted Towards 'Deep-Pocket' Litigants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin is addressing the lawsuits surrounding the tragic death cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.
During an appearance at the Boulder International Film Festival on Saturday (March 5), Alec claimed that the lawsuits he’s been named in are targeting “deep-pocket litigants” and are not necessarily directed at those most responsible for the shooting.
“Of course, this is to me sometimes it’s, it’s so surreal, I don’t even know what to say,” Alec continued.
The gun was then given to first assistant director Dave Halls, who said it was a “cold gun” when handing it to Alec.
“This woman was a lovely woman, she was a lovely woman, and she was talented.”Last month, Halyna Hutchins‘ husband Matt spoke out about her death.

     Summary: Alec Baldwin has accused the family of the late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins of trying to get money out of him.
Hutchins, 42, was killed in October 2021 when a prop gun that Baldwin was rehearsing with fired a live round that struck her in the chest.
Director Joel Souza, 48, was also hit during the incident on the New Mexico set but survived.
“I’ve relied on the safety experts there to declare the gun is safe and hand me the gun.
Never had a problem.”And he added that actors are “not allowed” to declare a weapon safe on set.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin has told film festival goers in Colorado that he believes he is the subject of lawsuits regarding a fatal shooting on the Rust movie set because of his money.
Mr Baldwin is being sued by the family of slain cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, as well as script supervisor Mamie Mitchell, who made the initial call to emergency services following the shooting.
Mr Baldwin did not specify which lawsuit he was referring to in his comments.
During the panel, Mr Baldwin reiterated his stance that he was not to blame for the incident.

     Summary: One of the people suing Baldwin is Matt Hutchins, the grief-stricken husband of Halyna Hutchins and the father of Hutchins’ 9-year-old son Andros.
I just feel — are we really supposed to feel bad about you, Mr. Baldwin?” Hutchins said.
Immediately after the shooting, Baldwin enjoyed an outpouring of public goodwill from people who believed that the veteran film and TV star had been inadvertently caught up in a tragic accident.
But within weeks of the shooting, Baldwin began trying to shift blame to others.
Late last week, Hilaria Baldwin announced that she was taking a social media break, but she made at appearance at the film festival Saturday night by phone.
