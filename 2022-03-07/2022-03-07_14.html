     Lakers vs. Spurs: Lineups, injury reports and broadcast info for Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers play the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, and if you’re wondering how you can watch the action live, you’ve come to the right place.
After losing four games in a row and 11 of 14, the Lakers finally gained a much-needed win over the weekend — against the Golden State Warriors of all teams.
LeBron James dealt a huge blow to Father Time, scoring 56 points to power his team to victory.
The Spurs may not be the team they used to be; they are 12th in the Western Conference and will, in all likelihood, miss the playoffs.
But Gregg Popovich is still on the sideline for them, and therefore they must not be taken lightly.

     LeBron James won’t play for Lakers vs. Spurs because of knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers star LeBron James will not play Monday night against the San Antonio Spurs because of a left knee injury, coach Frank Vogel said before the game.
The injury comes after James scored 56 points on Saturday night to lead the Lakers to a win against the Golden State Warriors.
He was listed as “questionable” like usual because of the injury, which cost him five games beginning in late January.
“With the heavy load that he’s carrying for us this year, we know that it’s always a possibility,” Vogel said.
In 46 games, James is averaging 29.4 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.2 assists on 52.2% shooting from the field.

*The Lakers enter play on Monday following a 56-point resurgence from LeBron James as he carried the team to a win over the Golden State Warriors.

     Without LeBron James, Lakers falter late vs. Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With LeBron James sidelined with left knee soreness, the Lakers were forced into super small ball on Monday in San Antonio against the Spurs, but could not make it work eventually falling 117-110.
Offensively, a host of Lakers stepped up in James’ absence with five Lakers scoring in double figures.
Only 53.3% shooting at the line by the Spurs allowed the Lakers to remain in the game as long as they did.
The loss does have playoff-seeding implications, as the Spurs are one of the teams that could catch the Lakers in the play-in game.
With the loss, the Lakers lead New Orleans by just one game for the ninth seed, while San Antonio moves to 3.5 games back of the Lakers.
