     Report: Phil Jackson advising Lakers owner Jeanie Buss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, if LeBron’s misalignment with Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka didn’t already cause concern…Lakers owner Jeanie Buss is reportedly standing by Pelinka and consulting Jackson.
Sources say Jackson, the Lakers legend and ex-fiancé of Buss, whose presence at Saturday’s win against Golden State was highlighted by the team’s Twitter account, has been in frequent contact with Buss about team matters all season long.
It’s unsurprising Buss still holds loyalty toward Jackson, a two-time former Lakers coach and Buss’s former fiancé.
The 11-time-champion coach (six with the Bulls, five with the Lakers) might even offer sound advice, especially with the Russell Westbrook fiasco.
Still, Jackson – along with Pelinka, Kurt Rambis, Linda Rambis and Magic Johnson – fits into Buss’ circle of trust.

     Report: Rob Pelinka has the ‘full support and trust’ of Jeanie Buss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the Los Angeles Lakers’ disappointing season, Rob Pelinka still has the support of Jeanie Buss, according to a recent report.
Sam Amick and Bill Oram of The Athletic offered some insight into the relationship between Pelinka and Buss.
Take Pelinka, for example, the longtime agent for [Kobe] Bryant and close friend of Buss, who sources say still has her full support and trust.”The meeting referenced by Amick and Oram included Buss, Pelinka and Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.
Speculation about major shakeups in L.A. has risen due to the Lakers’ disappointing season.
Exactly how bad things would have to get for Buss to change her mind remains to be seen.

     Phil Jackson in frequent contact with Jeanie Buss on Lakers matters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former coach and 13-time NBA champion Phil Jackson is in frequent contact with Lakers president Jeanie Buss regarding team matters, according to The Athletic’s Sam Amick and Bill Oram.
Jackson, who has no title or position with the Lakers organization, has had Buss’s ear when it comes to important team matters all season, per Amick and Oram.
Jackson referred to James’s associates as his “posse” in a 2016 interview with ESPN, and James later slammed Jackson for his comments.
Anthony, James’s close friend and now teammate, was playing for New York when Jackson was serving as team president and traded him to the Thunder.
“I’m not a fan of Phil Jackson,” James said in 2017.

     Summary: Lakers Owner Jeanie Buss Is 'Unapologetic' About Her Inner Circle Of Advisors, Still Has 'Full Trust' In Rob PelinkaCredit: Los Angeles TimesIn Los Angeles, the Lakers are being examined like a patient during surgery.
Jeanie Buss, who took over the Lakers completely in 2017, has been the subject of conversations so far, with critics pointing to her inner circle as the source of poor decision-making.
Nevertheless, Jeanie remains unshaken by the calls for her to abandon her current group of advisors, which includes team President/GM, Rob Pelinka.
Jeanie's inner circle also apparently includes Kurt and Linda Rambis, who have been longtime friends of hers.
Jeanie Buss herself?

     Phil Jackson has been in contact with Jeanie Buss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources say [Phil] Jackson, the Los Angeles Lakers legend and ex-fiancé of Buss, whose presence at Saturday’s win against Golden State was highlighted by the team’s Twitter account, has been in frequent contact with Buss about team matters all season long.
The complicated and often uncomfortable dynamics surrounding the Westbrook situation, in particular, are known to have drawn his interest.
As unofficial consultants go, they don’t get much more experienced or credible than Jackson.
ANALYSIS: For sentimental reasons, it would be exciting to see Jackson go for Round Three with the Lakers at some capacity, but from a basketball perspective, this may not be the best move.
Jackson is only five years removed from his disastrous tenure in New York, and, as long as LeBron James is around, there's no way Jackson would get a bigger say than James in LA.

     Lakers legend Phil Jackson has been in contact with Jeanie Buss all season regarding team matters, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it turns out, former Lakers head coach Phil Jackson has quietly been in contact with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss (also his former fiancée) all season long regarding team matters, according to Sam Amick and Bill Oram of The Athletic.
Sources say Jackson, the Lakers legend and ex-fiancé of Buss, whose presence at Saturday's win against Golden State was highlighted by the team's Twitter account, has been in frequent contact with Buss about team matters all season long.
Truth be told, Buss' desire to hear Jackson's point of view on this team should surprise no one.
Is he simply a sounding board for Buss, someone he's had a very close relationship with for a long time?
While you can understand why Buss would reach out to Jackson, the shadowy aspect of his influence is just not what this team needs right now.

     Lakers news: Jeanie Buss' stance on Rob Pelinka amid job security rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Right now, it’s team general manager and vice president for basketball operations Rob Pelinka that has been unceremoniously placed on the hot seat.
Previous reports have emerged about Pelinka potentially being in danger of losing his job in Hollywood.
The main reason behind this is the support he has from team owner Jeanie Buss.
You could say that above anything else, this is the most important thing for Pelinka right now.
Once Jeanie Buss feels that Pelinka is no longer living up to her lofty expectations as the team’s VP and GM, then Buss likely won’t hesitate to fire him.
