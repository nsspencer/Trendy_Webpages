     Ivan Kuliak: Gymnast faces disciplinary action after appearing to wear Russian war symbol on podium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ivan Kuliak is facing disciplinary action from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) after appearing to wear a Russian war symbol on the podium at a World Cup event in Doha.
Russian gymnast Kuliak finished third at the event in Qatar, which was won by Ukrainian Illia Kovtun amid the backdrop of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
As the athletes stood on the podium, Kuliak was seen with a 'Z' taped across the front of his shirt - a symbol which has been reported to mean 'victory' in Russian and which has been seen on tanks taking part in the invasion.
The 'Z' was in place of the Russian flag, which had been banned by gymnastics' governing body, and the federation confirmed it was now asking the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to investigate the incident.

     Russian gymnast faces discipline after wearing 'Z' symbol next to Ukrainian gold medalist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Russian gymnast is being called out for his "shocking behavior" after wearing a symbol in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on a medals podium.
According to The Guardian, Ivan Kuliak sported a "Z" on his leotard while standing next to Ukrainian gymnast Illia Kovtun at the Gymnastics World Cup event in Doha, Qatar on Saturday.
Kovtun had won gold, while Kuliak won the bronze medal.
The letter "Z" symbolizes support for the Russian invasion and has been painted on Russian tanks and streets as the conflict between the two countries continues to escalate.
According to a statement, the International Gymnastics Federation said it will ask the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to open disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak for his "shocking behavior" at the event.

     Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak facing ban for pro-invasion symbol on podium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is expected to be investigated after displaying a symbol on his uniform supporting the invasion of Ukraine.
The International Gymnastics Federation, known as FIG, denounced the "shocking behaviour" by Kuliak and pledged to ask its independent integrity unit to investigate.
"We can confirm that [FIG] has informed us that they will formally be seeking the opening of disciplinary proceedings against male artistic gymnast Ivan Kuliak," the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation said Monday.
Kuliak, a former national junior all-around champion who did not compete at the Tokyo Olympics, now faces a ban under the FIG disciplinary code.
The sport's ethics foundation was created in 2018 following the sex abuse scandal involving former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.

     Ivan Kuliak: Russian gymnast criticized for 'shocking behavior'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CNN —The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has criticized the “shocking behavior” of Russian athlete Ivan Kuliak at a gymnastics World Cup event in Doha, Qatar.
The organization that oversees Russian gymnasts acknowledged in a statement that Kuliak’s display violated FIG rules, but expressed the organization’s support for his actions.
​On Monday, Head of the Artistic Gymnastics Federation of Russia (FSGR) Vasily Titov told Russian publication MK that Kuliak has the governing body’s full support.
“I don’t think that Ivan wanted to make a special demonstration, but we will support him in any case,” he said.
It comes as the United Nations estimates that ​more than 1.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24.
