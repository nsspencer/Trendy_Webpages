     Kings vs. Knicks Preview: Start spreading the news
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sacramento Kings return to Golden 1 Center tonight after a 5-game road trip, hosting the New York Knicks on their West Coast swing.
The Kings return from traveling with a 2-3 record, winning against the Thunder and the Spurs, while falling to the Nuggets, Pelicans and Mavericks.
Meanwhile, the Knicks enter Sacramento on their second night of a back-to-back, handling the Los Angeles Clippers with ease in a blowout on Sunday night.
The Knicks currently sit at 12th in the Eastern Conference, teetering closer to the bottom of the barrel than hopeful for a play-in push.
Despite the size disadvantage between the Knicks and Kings, Sacramento can and should take care of business at home tonight as they look to stay in the play-in conversation for a few weeks more.

     Summary: “You ready to watch me become a mental patient over the Knicks?” I tell Joan, my girlfriend’s dog.
In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.
