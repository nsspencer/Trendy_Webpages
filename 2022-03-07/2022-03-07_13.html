     The Cavs standout for their slate of games from March 2-6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cleveland lost three of its four games this past week, with the low point being a blowout loss to the Charlotte Hornets.
All of that said, there were some positives from this past week, as Cedi Osman and Jarrett Allen played well, and Garland himself looked great.
In that realm, regarding the Cavs standout, it was clearly Garland, who hopefully can be involved in most games looking onward.
Garland was the Cavs standout for the rest of the past week after that loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and we know how valuable he is for Cleveland.
Here, we’re going to highlight the last three contests for Cleveland, though, whereas Cedi Osman was the Cavs standout for that initial slate of post-All-Star games.

The Cavs were able to hold on without Allen and beat the Raptors 104-96 to tighten their grip on the No.
After Allen went down, Cavs rookie Evan Mobley stepped up with 20 points and 17 rebounds against the Raptors.

     The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he was later diagnosed with a left middle finger injury, the team announced Monday.
The news on Allen is a tough blow for a team trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
Sunday’s win gave Cleveland (37-27) a three-game lead over Toronto for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

Obviously, the news is a brutal blow for Cavs fans, but it also just continues a string of horrendous luck for the team.
The injury continues the Cavs’ horrendous luck this seasonAs mentioned earlier, the Cavs lost both Collin Sexton and Ricky Rubio to season-ending injuries this year.
It’s unclear how many games Jarrett Allen could miss, but he, thankfully, isn’t as vital to the Cavs’ success as Darius Garland.
