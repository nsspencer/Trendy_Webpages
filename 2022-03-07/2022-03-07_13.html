    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their WCC semifinal opponent is San Francisco.
San Francisco isn't a name that resonates in the sport — but the Dons are legitimately good this season.
Based on the current KenPom numbers, San Francisco would be a favorite on a neutral-court over Big Ten champion Wisconsin and Big East champion Providence.
Saint Mary's vs. Santa Clara represents Monday's second WCC semifinal.
