     Cavs Top 3: Lauri Markkanen leads a crowded field to a victory
    </h2>

     Lauri Markkanen was among the Cleveland Cavaliers who helped vs. the Raptors.
Lauri Markkanen was among five key players that had huge games for the Cleveland Cavaliers in their win over the Toronto Raptors.
that wasn’t an issue on Sunday, as the Cavs held the Raptors to just 25% from behind the arc.
For the two-pointer, we’re going with Kevin Love, who had 15 points and nine rebounds on 50% shooting from the floor.
For the three-pointer, Lauri Markkanen takes it.

     One key play from Cavaliers-Raptors explained: Evan Mobley, crashing the offensive glass
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is why this play — and Mobley pulling down a career-high seven offensive rebounds in Sunday’s win over the Raptors — matters.
In part because of Mobley’s work on the offensive glass, Cleveland 26 second-chance points.
Think of peak crashing the glass Mobley as a supercharged, long-as-hell Tristan Thompson.
At his Cleveland peak, Thompson was an offensive rebounding machine, pulling down offensive rebounds at one of the highest rates in the league.
“We want him to dominant the paint in all facets,” Bickerstaff said, “whether that’s the the offensive rebounds, that’s running, that’s rim runs, that’s lobs.

     Jarrett Allen’s Untimely Injury Continues String of Horrendous Luck for Cavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But Allen’s injury is just a continuation of horrendous luck for the Cavs, especially in recent weeks.
| Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesJarrett Allen has become one of the best big men in the NBA this season for the Cavs.
Obviously, the news is a brutal blow for Cavs fans, but it also just continues a string of horrendous luck for the team.
The injury continues the Cavs’ horrendous luck this seasonAs mentioned earlier, the Cavs lost both Collin Sexton and Ricky Rubio to season-ending injuries this year.
It’s unclear how many games Jarrett Allen could miss, but he, thankfully, isn’t as vital to the Cavs’ success as Darius Garland.

     Report: Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen suffers fractured finger, out indefinitely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he then reportedly suffered a fractured finger and will be out indefinitely.
The Cavs only said Allen had suffered a bruised quadriceps and said nothing about a finger injury following the game.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
The 23-year-old center is averaging 16.3 points, 10.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks while shooting 67.7 percent and made his All-Star debut in 2021-22.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Cavaliers have been struck with injuries all season, and it doesn’t seem to be stopping.
Jarrett Allen left Sunday night’s game against the Toronto Raptors with a left quad contusion in the first quarter and did not return to the game.
Allen was driving to the basket, bumped into Raptors forward Precious Achiuwa , and did not convert the driving hook shot.
During his postgame news conference, Bickerstaff said he had not talked to the training staff or Allen yet, and could not see what exactly happened on the play.
But they felt the loss of Allen out on the floor.His absence required Evan Mobley
