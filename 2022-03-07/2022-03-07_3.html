     1 stud and 1 dud for Cavs in win over Raptors on Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Heading into Sunday night’s contest against the Toronto Raptors at home, the Cleveland Cavaliers had lost four of their five games post-All-Star break and six of seven games dating back to before then.
From there, Caris LeVert has missed all of Cleveland’s six post-All-Star break contests due to a foot sprain, and Rajon Rondo, with playmaking depth in mind, has missed Cleveland’s past five outings with a big toe sprain.
Both could seemingly be back for the Cavs soon, on the plus side, but we’ll have to see how long things will be until both can get in-rhythm.
The Raptors are a team that’s just getting started too, similarly to the Cavs, and Toronto also have its share of good young players.
Regarding Sunday’s game, we’ll highlight the standout performer from that one for the Cavs, but also do the same for Cleveland’s dud.

“I think everybody is (ticked) in the right way,” forward Lauri Markkanen said after the morning shootaround at Cleveland Clinic Courts in Independence.
That’s what we’re trying to do.”#Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff answers a question about how his team responded to losing Jarrett Allen to a quadriceps injury.
“When it’s expressed the right way, it could be very helpful,” Bickerstaff said in his pregame news conference.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All-Star center Jarrett Allen reportedly suffered a fractured finger during the first quarter of Sunday's 104-96 win over the Toronto Raptors, a potentially damaging blow to Cleveland's playoff hopes.
Following the game, The Athletic, citing unnamed sources, said Allen broke his finger and will be sidelined indefinitely.
The Cavs only said Allen had suffered a bruised quadriceps and said nothing about a finger injury following the game.
Allen had six points and two rebounds in 10 minutes.
The news on Allen is a tough blow for a team trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018.

     The Cleveland Cavaliers have been struck with injuries all season, and it doesn’t seem to be stopping.
Jarrett Allen left Sunday night’s game with a left quad contusion in the first quarter and did not return to the game.
Allen was driving to the basket, bumped into Raptors forward Precious Achiuwa , and did not convert the driving hook shot.
During his postgame news conference, Bickerstaff said he had not talked to the training staff or Allen yet, and could not see what exactly happened on the play.
But they felt the loss of Allen out on the floor.His absence required Evan Mobley

     Report: Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen suffers fractured finger, out indefinitely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he then reportedly suffered a fractured finger and will be out indefinitely.
The Cavs only said Allen had suffered a bruised quadriceps and said nothing about a finger injury following the game.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
The 23-year-old center is averaging 16.3 points, 10.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks while shooting 67.7 percent and made his All-Star debut in 2021-22.
