Are gas stations price gouging?
Analysts say not but oil companies need to be careful what they say about supplies and production.
With gasoline prices poised to reach a new all-time high within days, President Joe Biden recently issued a stern warning to the nation’s oil producers and gas retailers.
“American oil and gas companies should not – should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits,” Biden said in a speech.

     U.S. Weighs Russian Oil Ban as Gas Prices Surge and Ukraine War Grows
    </h2>

     “Europe has deliberately exempted energy supplies from Russia from sanctions,” he said in a statement on Monday.
That could lessen the economic shock to oil markets given the United States does not import much Russian crude.
The United States can easily find a way to make up for any loss of Russian oil, while Europe would have a harder time doing so, analysts said.
But any disruption in the flow of oil could further rattle global markets, including oil prices, which have surged because of the uncertainty over Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“There could be impact on our energy prices, so we are taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices.”

     Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesOil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices jumped past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Gasoline prices have jumped by 45 cents a gallon in the last week, to a national average of $4.06, according to AAA.
Diesel fuel prices jumped even more rapidly, to a national average of $4.61 per gallon.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.

     U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.

     What soaring oil prices mean for the stock market as Dow tumbles into correction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Joe Biden has not made a decision about banning Russian oil imports into the U.S., White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday.
Nonetheless, oil shocks have spelled trouble for the stock market in the past, he noted, and likely offer some lessons even if the economic circumstances have changed.
The S&amp;P 500 rose by around 40% in 1979-80 despite a roughly 150% rise in oil prices in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution and amid the Iran-Iraq war.
And while the index fell by around 15% after Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait — when oil prices doubled — it recovered swiftly as oil prices fell back down, returning to its previous peak within three months.
The examples also indicate that the long-run effect of oil disruptions on the stock market depend on the effect they have on the economy and monetary policy.

     Gas prices are soaring. Here’s why.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gas prices closely track the cost of oil, and a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped 17 percent since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, hitting $122 Monday.
(Though it’s worth noting, when adjusted for inflation, gas prices hovered around $4.50 a gallon in today’s dollars from 2011 to 2014, and topped $5 for a time in 2008.)
Instead, the consequences may be more dire for Europe, which has grown more dependent on Russian oil in recent years.
Advertisement“They were sleepwalking into a propeller” by importing more Russian oil, said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College.
“And in this case, the propeller is Putin.”In the United States, gas prices have been climbing for other reasons, chiefly the supply and demand shocks of the COVID pandemic.

Oil prices have soared recently on worries that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will upend already tight supplies.
Markets worldwide have swung wildly recently on worries about how high prices for oil, wheat and other commodities produced in the region will go because of Russia’s invasion, inflaming the world’s already high inflation.
