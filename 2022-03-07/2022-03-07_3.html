     Summary: Gasoline prices near new all-time highs.
Are gas stations price gouging?
Analysts say not but oil companies need to be careful what they say about supplies and production.
With gasoline prices poised to reach a new all-time high within days, President Joe Biden recently issued a stern warning to the nation’s oil producers and gas retailers.
“American oil and gas companies should not – should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits,” Biden said in a speech.

     U.S. Weighs Russian Oil Ban as Gas Prices Surge and Ukraine War Grows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That could lessen the economic shock to oil markets given the United States does not import much Russian crude.
Last fall, it imported about 700,000 barrels per day from Russia, less than 10 percent of its total oil imports, U.S. officials said.
The United States can easily find a way to make up for any loss of Russian oil, while Europe would have a harder time doing so, analysts said.
But any disruption in the flow of oil could further rattle global markets, including oil prices, which have surged because of the uncertainty over Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“There could be impact on our energy prices, so we are taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices.”

     Summary: Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesOil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices jumped past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Gasoline prices have jumped by 45 cents a gallon in the last week, to a national average of $4.06, according to AAA.
Diesel fuel prices jumped even more rapidly, to a national average of $4.61 per gallon.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gasoline prices are pushing even farther above $4 a gallon, the highest price that American motorists have faced since July 2008, as calls grow to ban imports of Russian oil.
In today’s terms, the record price would be equal to about $5.24 after accounting for inflation.
The increasingly violent Russian attack on Ukraine has increased calls to cut off Russia from the money it gets from oil and natural gas exports.
READ MORE: U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surgePresident Joe Biden has been reluctant to ban Russian oil, fearing it could further fuel inflation heading into the midterm elections this November.
Talk of a ban on Russian oil has led U.S. officials to consider other sources that are currently limited.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TOKYO (AP) — Oil prices jumped and shares were sharply lower Monday as the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
Brent crude oil briefly surged above $130 a barrel but was trading around $125 a barrel later Monday.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.

Those crude prices are rising because oil traders are getting nervous about a possible ban on Russian oil exports.
Sanctions on Russian oil would likely cause oil prices to rise in the future.
It usually takes about three weeks for a jump in oil prices to show up at the pump, McNally added.
“You should start to see a roughly 10% to 15% increase in gasoline prices, assuming these crude oil prices stick,” he said.

     Summary: Why are gas prices so high right now?
Crude oil prices respond to a number of factors, including economic and political outlooks, as well as supply and demand.
How high will gas prices go?
Gasoline prices will continue to rise as long as crude oil prices rise and consumers continue to pay the higher costs.
The high oil and gas prices induced producers to develop new methods for fracking shale formations to extract oil and gas, leading to a dramatic growth in U.S. energy production.

Gold and a measure of nervousness on Wall Street were also higher, though not by quite as much as when oil prices hit their peak.
Oil prices have soared recently on worries that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will upend already tight supplies.
A barrel of U.S. crude oil was trading at $120.74 per barrel, up 4.1 percent, after earlier touching $130.50.

     How Do Gas Prices Work? Costs Responding to Rising Crude Oil Prices
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gas prices are expected to continue rising across the U.S. as the price of crude oil climbs in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to industry experts.
The country's war with Ukraine has raised concerns about how the fighting could impact Russian oil production and distribution.
In the U.S., a majority of the costs imposed at gas stations—about 56 percent—derives from the cost of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
When crude oil prices increase, gas prices are typically quick to follow.
The American Automobile Association (AAA) also linked rising gas prices to the impact Russia's war with Ukraine is having on crude oil costs.

     Summary: Gas prices continue to increase because of skyrocketing oil prices related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Pretty much everyone wants to see prices lower, and there’s been a lot of talk about the “good ol’ days” when gas prices were under $2 a gallon.
Yes, gas prices had been very low a few times, but those weren’t good times.
Three significant storms battered the United States in 2017, but Hurricane Harvey had the most significant effect on gas prices.
In mid-July, oil prices ($147 a barrel) and gas prices ($4.11 a gallon) hit record highs.
