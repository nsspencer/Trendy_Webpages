     Oil Prices Keep Climbing. Americans Face Record-High Prices at the Gas Pump.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oil prices rose on Tuesday, with supply in the global crude market remaining incredibly tight as American consumers face the highest prices at the gas pump on record.
Futures for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude lifted 2% on the day to near $122 a barrel, still short of the $126 hit in volatile Monday trading.
International oil benchmark Brent climbed similarly to almost $126, having topped $130 in the previous session.

     Rising Gas Prices Have Drivers Asking, ‘Is This for Real?’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The extreme prices — which for some types of gas have hovered near $6 a gallon in parts of California — could be fleeting.
“The long-term impact should be somewhat minimal,” Mr. Feroli said.
Since moving to the United States from Torreón, Mexico, in 2007, Jesús López, 36, was used to gas prices rising steadily for a few days, but eventually coming back down.
Mr. López said this time felt different because he wasn’t seeing a stop to the climb when he filled up the tank of his 2008 Ford Expedition.
Mr. López, who works as a school janitor in Dallas, said that if prices kept skyrocketing, he would have to cut back on leisure activities.

     Russia warns oil price will hit $300 if West bans imports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 on Monday after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington and European allies were considering banning Russian oil imports.
"It is absolutely clear that a rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on state television.
"The surge in prices would be unpredictable.
It would be $300 per barrel if not more."
Novak said it would take Europe more than a year to replace the volume of oil it receives from Russia and it would have to pay significantly higher prices.

     Summary: Brent oil pushed higher as European oil giant Shell Plc announced it will stop buying Russian crude and the International Energy Agency said it was disappointed in the actions producers have taken in the market so far.
Futures in London rose near $127 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate also gained after settling at the highest level since 2008 on Monday.
The surge in oil has helped push retail fuel prices higher with gasoline at a record in the U.S., according to the American Automobile Association, underscoring the inflationary impact of higher energy costs.

     Summary: Andrew Lipow, the president of Lipow Oil Associates, said traders were steering clear of Russian oil ahead of a possible embargo.
Climbing prices at the pump are the most visible reminder of the rising cost of oil.
Rising oil prices will also show up at the grocery store.
Oil is part of many building materials and furnishings, including asphalt roof shingles, plywood and shag carpet.
Unlike gas prices, which are rarely out of view, analysts say, prices on many of those other products will creep up over weeks or months.

     Summary: Gas prices continue to increase because of skyrocketing oil prices related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Pretty much everyone wants to see prices lower, and there’s been a lot of talk about the “good ol’ days” when gas prices were under $2 a gallon.
Yes, gas prices had been very low a few times, but those weren’t good times.
Three significant storms battered the United States in 2017, but Hurricane Harvey had the most significant effect on gas prices.
In mid-July, oil prices ($147 a barrel) and gas prices ($4.11 a gallon) hit record highs.

     Summary: Gasoline prices are pushing even farther above $4 a gallon, the highest price that American motorists have faced since July 2008, as calls grow to ban imports of Russian oil.
In today’s terms, the record price would be equal to about $5.24 after accounting for inflation.
The increasingly violent Russian attack on Ukraine has increased calls to cut off Russia from the money it gets from oil and natural gas exports.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TOKYO (AP) — Oil prices jumped and shares were sharply lower Monday as the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
Brent crude oil briefly surged above $130 a barrel but was trading around $125 a barrel later Monday.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
