     (Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)Antonio Conte will be searching for more consistency from his Tottenham side as they host Everton in the Premier League this evening.
At the other end of the table, Everton are looking to build some momentum that will take them out of the relegation battle.
Frank Lampard will hope to use their midweek FA Cup victory over Boreham Wood as a springboard to reignite their season.
They sit just one point above the drop zone and picking up points in the league is the priority for the Toffees starting against Spurs tonight.

With Manchester United, West Ham and Wolves all losing over the weekend, Antonio Conte's side have the opportunity to stake their claim for a Champions League spot.

     Although Everton are still in the FA Cup, having seen off Boreham Wood in midweek, their league form is still a significant concern.
Bar a 3-0 win at home to Leeds, Everton's recent games have given their fans little to cheer, with their last three away games seeing them lose at Southampton, Newcastle, and Norwich.
Tottenham lost their last two league games in their own stadium, with a 3-2 defeat against Southampton followed by a 2-0 defeat against Wolves.
Antonio Conte has never lost three consecutive league games at home in his career, and he'll be looking to continue that record today.
With Son Heung-Min scoring six in his last 11 league games, as well as picking up four assists, he could be the dangerman for Spurs.
