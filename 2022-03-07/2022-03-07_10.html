     Summary: Ivan Kuliak is facing disciplinary action from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) after appearing to wear a Russian war symbol on the podium at a World Cup event in Doha.
>>>>>>> 53d5b1280b2719e9a162900b8b10532be9acd07b
Russian gymnast Kuliak finished third at the event in Qatar, which was won by Ukrainian Illia Kovtun amid the backdrop of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
As the athletes stood on the podium, Kuliak was seen with a 'Z' taped across the front of his shirt - a symbol which has been reported to mean 'victory' in Russian and which has been seen on tanks taking part in the invasion.
The 'Z' was in place of the Russian flag, which had been banned by gymnastics' governing body, and the federation confirmed it was now asking the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to investigate the incident.

     Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak facing ban for pro-invasion symbol on podium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is expected to be investigated after displaying a symbol on his uniform supporting the invasion of Ukraine.
The International Gymnastics Federation, known as FIG, denounced the "shocking behaviour" by Kuliak and pledged to ask its independent integrity unit to investigate.
"We can confirm that [FIG] has informed us that they will formally be seeking the opening of disciplinary proceedings against male artistic gymnast Ivan Kuliak," the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation said Monday.
Kuliak, a former national junior all-around champion who did not compete at the Tokyo Olympics, now faces a ban under the FIG disciplinary code.
The sport's ethics foundation was created in 2018 following the sex abuse scandal involving former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.

     Summary: (CNN) The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has criticized the "shocking behavior" of Russian athlete Ivan Kuliak at a gymnastics World Cup event in Doha, Qatar.
>>>>>>> 53d5b1280b2719e9a162900b8b10532be9acd07b
The FIG did not give details about the behavior they condemned, but the statement came after the 20-year-old ​ gymnast wore a 'Z' symbol taped to his leotard while standing next to Ukrainian athlete ​Illia Kovtun on the podium -- Kovtun won gold and Kuliak picked up bronze in the parallel bars on Saturday.
The organization that oversees Russian gymnasts acknowledged in a statement that Kuliak's display violated FIG rules, but expressed the organization's support for his actions.
The 'Z' insignia has been displayed on tanks and vehicles used by the Russian military in its Ukraine operations and has since become a symbol of support for the invasion of Ukraine.
Propaganda videos on social media appear to show supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin ​wearing clothing featuring the 'Z' symbol, waving Russian flags and chanting pro-Russia slogans.​Read More
