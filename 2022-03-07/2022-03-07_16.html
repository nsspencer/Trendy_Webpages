    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York last year over sexual harassment allegations, is a “sick, pathetic man”, the state attorney general said on Sunday in a stinging rebuke.
Cuomo had spoken at a Brooklyn church, complaining about cancel culture and the accusations against him and also appearing to hint at a political comeback.
“Even though multiple independent investigations found his victims to be credible, Cuomo continues to blame everyone but himself.”The attorney general also said New Yorkers were “ready to move forward from this sick, pathetic man”.
“They used cancel culture to effectively overturn an election.”Cuomo resigned days after being found to have sexually harassed women.
Last month, a New York state trooper sued Cuomo, claiming he caused severe mental anguish and emotional distress by touching her inappropriately and making suggestive comments.

     Summary: What Is Andrew Cuomo Up To?
Andrew Cuomo spoke at God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in Brooklyn on Sunday, in his first public appearance since his resignation.
While he has some loyal supporters, many formerly close allies have said they do not see space in public life for Mr. Cuomo.
“There is absolutely no future for Andrew Cuomo in public life in New York State or anywhere else,” said Christine Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council who was once a close Cuomo ally.
As he continues his march back into the public eye, here are five possible scenarios for Mr. Cuomo and their significant attendant challenges, based on interviews with New York Democratic strategists, officials and Cuomo associates.

     Summary: Andrew Cuomo took to the pulpit Sunday not to beg forgiveness but preach fire and brimstone on the “political sharks” who supposedly drove him from office.
He claimed to be “truly, truly sorry” and that he “learned a powerful lesson,” but only because he hadn’t “appreciated” changing norms in the workplace.
I resigned as governor, the press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired,” Cuomo moaned.
In the Siena survey, 58% say they believe Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women as governor against just 21% who think him innocent.
Cuomo’s spending big from the millions that special interests put in his political warchest in his salad days to try reversing those numbers.

"If you want to cancel something, cancel federal gridlock, cancel the incompetence, cancel the infighting, cancel crime, cancel homelessness, cancel education inequality, cancel poverty, cancel racism, be outraged but be outraged at what really matters and what really matters to you," he said.
