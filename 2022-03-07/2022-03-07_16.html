    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now it gets worse, as All-Star center Jarrett Allen is out indefinitely with a fractured finger, on top of a potential quad injury.
Allen is the defensive linchpin of the Cavs’ 4th-ranked defense, and he has become one of the league’s best finishers.
The Cleveland Cavaliers might need to sign a big man to fill in for Jarrett Allen.
If Mobley, Love or Davis were to miss time, the Cavs would be seriously thin at a position that used to be one of its deepest.
With a roster spot opening up as Tim Frazier‘s 10-day contract expires, which free agent centers might be available and helpful to the Cavs?

     Summary: The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he was later diagnosed with a left middle finger injury, the team announced Monday.
The news on Allen is a tough blow for a team trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
Sunday’s win gave Cleveland (37-27) a three-game lead over Toronto for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings.
