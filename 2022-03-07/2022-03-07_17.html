    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls dropped their fifth straight game Monday night, falling 121-106 to the 76ers in a contest that clinched a season-series sweep for Philadelphia.
In the four games Harden played with the 76ers (who rank second in free-throw attempt rate) before playing the Bulls, Philadelphia averaged 36.3 free-throw attempts.
The result drops the Bulls to 0-9 against the Eastern Conference’s top three teams — Miami, Philadelphia, Milwaukee — and 6-17 against playoff teams, overall.
While all five of the losses from the Bulls’ current skid have come against playoff teams, five of their wins against playoff teams came before the calendar flipped to 2022.

     Sixers vs. Bulls: Joel Embiid scores 43 points, Sixers move to 5-0 with James Harden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The team exceeded 120 points for the fifth consecutive time with James Harden in the lineup on Monday night.
Former teammate Tony Bradley picked up two quick ones, too, and Embiid scored 11 efficient points in his 11 first-quarter minutes.
Harden still fine-tuningOne fascinating aspect with Harden on the Sixers has been his teammates’ adjustment to all the attention he commands.
He opened the fourth quarter alongside bench players Niang, Isaiah Joe, Shake Milton and Jordan.
After Niang made back-to-back threes in the second quarter, Harden sized up Troy Brown Jr. and drained a step-back triple.

     Instant observations: Sixers beat up Bulls behind 43 from Joel Embiid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joel Embiid absolutely dismantled the Bulls in another classic performance on Monday night, leading the Sixers to a 121-106 win with 43 points and 14 rebounds.
The Good• Joel Embiid has had some big performances against the Bulls the last two seasons, and before the game even started, the stars looked to be aligned for another masterpiece.
You know, like these sort of plays:Tristan Thompson's night felt indicative of the sort of season Embiid is having.
(Embiid was even able to laugh with Harden about one of those turnovers in the first half, with Harden going behind the back and Embiid stuck between popping and rolling after the screen.
The Ugly • The Bulls are either the best bad team or the worst good team, I can't decide which.
