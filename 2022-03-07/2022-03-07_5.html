     Tottenham Hotspur vs. Everton: Community Player Ratings

     I tell you what, folks — it’s always fun when Tottenham Hotspur just put a big ol’ thumping on another team.
It doesn’t happen very often, so when Spurs are able to beat the brakes off of another club it sticks in the memory.
If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK.
I will round the stars up/down to the nearest half-star for the player ratings later this week.

     Frank Lampard blames individual errors for Everton’s rout by Tottenham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August.
But rather than being about home and away, if you make those mistakes you’re going to struggle.
“It was an important performance tonight, a really good performance,” Antonio Conte said.
From my arrival to now we are stronger, and I think that we can fight for this target.
To finish in the top four for us would be like we won the Champions League, like we won the Premier League this season.”

Harry Kane scored twice and Son Heung-min and Sergio Reguilon also netted.
It was another Kane masterclass, with his second goal a particular highlight, and he took his tally to 14 goals in 15 games against Everton.
Spurs equalled their best ever Premier League win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will have real belief that they can gate-crash the Champions League qualification places.
But it was clear from early on that this was going to be a good night as they took early control of the game.

     Although Everton are still in the FA Cup, having seen off Boreham Wood in midweek, their league form is still a significant concern.
Bar a 3-0 win at home to Leeds, Everton's recent games have given their fans little to cheer, with their last three away games seeing them lose at Southampton, Newcastle, and Norwich.
Tottenham lost their last two league games in their own stadium, with a 3-2 defeat against Southampton followed by a 2-0 defeat against Wolves.
Antonio Conte has never lost three consecutive league games at home in his career, and he'll be looking to continue that record today.
With Son Heung-Min scoring six in his last 11 league games, as well as picking up four assists, he could be the dangerman for Spurs.

     As it dropped Richarlison pulled back his favoured left foot, swung and, to joyful cheers from the home support, missed completely.
Everton were bright enough in the opening exchanges, snapping into challenges and denying the home side space as they tried to play out of defence.
The problem was that they seemed much less motivated when it came to denying Spurs space to play into theirs.
Tottenham were excellent, with Kulusevski providing a lesser goal threat than Harry Kane and Son Heung-min but offering real creativity both with crosses and through-balls.
Michael Keane’s own goal gives Tottenham a 1-0 lead over Everton.
