     Tottenham Hotspur vs. Everton: Community Player Ratings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     I tell you what, folks — it’s always fun when Tottenham Hotspur just put a big ol’ thumping on another team.
It doesn’t happen very often, so when Spurs are able to beat the brakes off of another club it sticks in the memory.
If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK.
I will round the stars up/down to the nearest half-star for the player ratings later this week.

     Frank Lampard blames individual errors for Everton’s rout by Tottenham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August.
But rather than being about home and away, if you make those mistakes you’re going to struggle.
“It was an important performance tonight, a really good performance,” Antonio Conte said.
From my arrival to now we are stronger, and I think that we can fight for this target.
To finish in the top four for us would be like we won the Champions League, like we won the Premier League this season.”

     Here's What Twitter Is Saying About Cam Reddish's Big Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday night in California by a score of 116-93, and Cam Reddish had his best game since joining the Knicks.
The former Duke star had 17 points and was a +22 in 25 minutes of playing time.
He began his career as the tenth overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2019 NBA Draft, and was traded from the Hawks to the Knicks earlier this month.
On the Hawks, he had been averaging over 23 minutes of playing time per game this season, but since being traded to the Knicks, he has only been playing 14.2 minutes per game.
A lot of people were talking about Reddish on Twitter on Sunday night, and some of those tweets can be seen embedded below.

Harry Kane scored twice and Son Heung-min and Sergio Reguilon also netted.
It was another Kane masterclass, with his second goal a particular highlight, and he took his tally to 14 goals in 15 games against Everton.
Spurs equalled their best ever Premier League win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will have real belief that they can gate-crash the Champions League qualification places.
But it was clear from early on that this was going to be a good night as they took early control of the game.

     Although Everton are still in the FA Cup, having seen off Boreham Wood in midweek, their league form is still a significant concern.
Bar a 3-0 win at home to Leeds, Everton's recent games have given their fans little to cheer, with their last three away games seeing them lose at Southampton, Newcastle, and Norwich.
Tottenham lost their last two league games in their own stadium, with a 3-2 defeat against Southampton followed by a 2-0 defeat against Wolves.
Antonio Conte has never lost three consecutive league games at home in his career, and he'll be looking to continue that record today.
With Son Heung-Min scoring six in his last 11 league games, as well as picking up four assists, he could be the dangerman for Spurs.

     Knicks 116, Clippers 93: “We needed this bad. Losing is boring and is wack”

In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.

     Young, wild and free: Knicks team ‘Tank’ snaps 7-game funk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

     Harry Kane leads Tottenham thrashing of Frank Lampard’s inept Everton

     As it dropped Richarlison pulled back his favoured left foot, swung and, to joyful cheers from the home support, missed completely.
Everton were bright enough in the opening exchanges, snapping into challenges and denying the home side space as they tried to play out of defence.
The problem was that they seemed much less motivated when it came to denying Spurs space to play into theirs.
Tottenham were excellent, with Kulusevski providing a lesser goal threat than Harry Kane and Son Heung-min but offering real creativity both with crosses and through-balls.
Michael Keane’s own goal gives Tottenham a 1-0 lead over Everton.

The Knicks currently sit at 12th in the Eastern Conference, teetering closer to the bottom of the barrel than hopeful for a play-in push.
Despite the size disadvantage between the Knicks and Kings, Sacramento can and should take care of business at home tonight as they look to stay in the play-in conversation for a few weeks more.

     NBA Odds: Knicks vs. Kings prediction, odds, pick and more – 3/7/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks and Sacramento Kings will square off on Monday night in a battle between two of the league’s weaker teams.
Despite the lack of playoff impact this game will have, there’s still plenty to be excited about as we dive into our NBA odds series with a Knicks-Kings prediction and pick.
He’ll look to continue to carry the torch for the Knicks, especially as Julius Randle has struggled in recent games.
In that same span, Sabonis is averaging 14.0 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 6.6 assists, emerging as a constant triple-double threat for the Kings.
The Kings will get De’Aaron Fox going early in the game and cruise to victory, covering the spread handily against the Knicks on Monday night.

     Betting odds and best bets for Sacramento Kings vs. New York Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kings, meanwhile, are coming off a 114-113 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, who were without Luka Doncic, and Sacramento has now lost five of its last seven games.
Knicks +3.5 (-110)The one thing to expect in Kings games is a lack of defense and a lot of scoring, as Sacramento ranks 28th in defensive efficiency.
Seven consecutive Kings games have totaled at least 220 combined points.
The Knicks have allowed at least 115 points in five of their last seven games, so we’re eyeing the over for Fox’s points prop tonight.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cam Reddish blue jersey close upThe Knicks finally held on to a double-digit lead and snapped a seven-game losing streak while taking down the Los Angeles Clippers, 116-93.
- The Knicks opened up the second quarter with a 16-0 run, as the Clippers started 0-for-13 from the floor.
The Knicks didn’t get a lot of volume from behind the arc in the second, shooting just two of six, but Los Angeles missed 10 of their 14 three-pointers.
Reddish scored 15 of his 17 points in the fourth, which could earn him plenty more minutes down the line.
- Six Knicks were in double-digits: Barrett (24), Quickley (21), Reddish (17), Burks (15), Robinson (12), and Randle (10).
