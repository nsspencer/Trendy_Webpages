     No end in sight for ‘unprecedented rise’ in gas prices: GasBuddy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (GasBuddy) Americans have seen one of the most profound weeks at the pump with energy prices skyrocketing, marking the 10th straight weekly rise.
“There are few words to describe the unprecedented rise in gasoline prices over the last week, with massive spikes coast to coast in both gasoline and diesel prices, as oil prices jump to their highest since 2008.
Volatility will likely remain as rumors swirl about the potential for the U.S. to officially target Russia’s energy sector for severe sanctions, which could push oil prices up further.
FUEL DEMANDAccording to GasBuddy demand data driven by its Pay with GasBuddy card, U.S. retail gasoline demand saw a rise last week (Sun-Sat).
The states with the lowest average prices: Arkansas ($3.64), Missouri ($3.67), and South Dakota ($3.68).
