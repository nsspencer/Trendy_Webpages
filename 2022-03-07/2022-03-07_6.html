     ‘American Idol’: Second platinum ticket goes to Kenedi Anderson as judge Katy Perry tells her she was ‘born to be a star’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kenedi Anderson was born into a large family of athletes but she was “born to be a star,” Katy Perry told the 17-year-old during her audition for “American Idol.”“You might be the biggest star we’ve ever seen,” judge Luke Bryan said.
They then brought in Anderson’s mom and presented them both with the second platinum ticket, rather than a gold ticket.
The platinum ticket is a new kind of ticket for the 20th season of “American Idol.” There will only be three platinum tickets given to contestants this year.
The first platinum ticket was given to Huntergirl, whose real name is Hunter Wolkonowski.
She had already received a gold ticket earlier in the first episode.
