    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday night in California by a score of 116-93, and Cam Reddish had his best game since joining the Knicks.
The former Duke star had 17 points and was a +22 in 25 minutes of playing time.
He began his career as the tenth overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2019 NBA Draft, and was traded from the Hawks to the Knicks earlier this month.
On the Hawks, he had been averaging over 23 minutes of playing time per game this season, but since being traded to the Knicks, he has only been playing 14.2 minutes per game.
A lot of people were talking about Reddish on Twitter on Sunday night, and some of those tweets can be seen embedded below.

     “You ready to watch me become a mental patient over the Knicks?” I tell Joan, my girlfriend’s dog.
In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.

     Young, wild and free: Knicks team ‘Tank’ snaps 7-game funk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

     Injuries have forced head coach Tom Thibodeau to play the entirety of the New York Knicks youth, and it’s resulted in some of the best basketball they’ve played all season.
Those frustrations largely centered around wing Cam Reddish, who the team acquired mid-season for Kevin Knox and a first-round pick in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks.
Twitter Reacts to Reddish’s PerformanceNothing about the New York Knicks fanbase’s discussions online in recent weeks have been optimistic by any means.
But all of that came to a halt on Sunday night as Cam Reddish instilled a renewed hope for the remaining weeks, and beyond that, the future.
Cam Reddish and RJ Barrett need to be playing 20-25 minutes on the court together for the rest of the season.

In that same span, Sabonis is averaging 14.0 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 6.6 assists, emerging as a constant triple-double threat for the Kings.

Reddish scored 15 of his 17 points in the fourth, which could earn him plenty more minutes down the line.
