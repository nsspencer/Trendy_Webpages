     Invasive Joro spider expected to swarm DMV in summer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Joro spider, known for its distinctive yellow and blue color, could invade the entire East Coast soon, a new study says.
Based on new research showing that the palm-sized arachnid can survive in colder temperatures, researchers expect them to arrive in the D.C. area by summer.
In September 2021, researchers found the invasive species, which first made its way to the United States in 2013, spinning its webs all over northeast Georgia.
They have also been found in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and even Oklahoma, according to the study.
The Joro — Trichonephila clavata — is part of a group of spiders known as orb weavers for their highly organized, wheel-shaped webs.

     Large, Parachuting Spiders Could Soon Invade the East Coast, Study Finds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last year in Georgia, the non-native Joro spider population exploded.
The spiders are large and eye-catching, about the size of a human adult’s palm, with bright yellow, blue and red coloration.
Their new study, published in Physiological Entomology, found that Joro spiders can survive in colder temperatures, making it likely that the species will take over much of the East Coast.
Researchers compared the Joro spider to the golden silk spider, a species in the same genus that has not expanded beyond the southeast, per the study.
Don’t blame the Joro spider.”

     Joro spider, venomous species from East Asia, poised to spread across East Coast, scientists say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They may attach themselves to a car or shipping container to get around, he said.Last summer, a UGA graduate student accidentally transported a Jor to Oklahoma, Frick noted.
"The reality of the situation, though, is that for every spider that we might see being transported, there are likely 10 more that evade detection," he said.Jor spiders are venomous, meaning they can poison certain creatures like insects for a meal, according to Paula Cushing, senior curator of invertebrate zoology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
"The biggest danger to humans is that you might get a face-full of lovely golden silk if you walk through the web," she said in an email.While the study showed the spiders can travel farther north, some experts are not convinced that will happen on a large scale.
"Although it can withstand somewhat colder climates, I doubt it could withstand the climatic conditions found in the northern and western US," Cushing said.Jor spiders can tolerate a brief freeze, but not much more, said Anne Danielson-Francois, an associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Michigan in Dearborn.
She was not involved in the study.

     Summary: If you haven't met the colorful, massive Joro spider yet, you may soon be introduced to the invasive species if you live on the East Coast, scientists predict.
Scientists came to their conclusion by comparing the Joro spider to its relative, the golden silk spider.
But as much as the golden silk spider population has grown, it has yet to expand into the North because the spider is susceptible to the cold.
He said he heard reports of someone "accidentally" transporting a Joro spider to Oklahoma.

     Summary: Millions of palm-sized flying spiders, a species known as Trichonephila clavata or Joro spiders, could take over the East Coast, a new study shows.
Researchers suggest that the Joro spiders won’t stick to traditional means of flying along with the breeze to colonize their new home.
Researchers compared the Joro spider to its close cousin the gold silk spider, which migrated from tropical climates to the Southern states 160 years ago, to predict the future for Joro spiders.
But the Joro spider is more resilient, with the ability to withstand cold temperatures, double the metabolic rate and a 77% higher heart rate.

     Giant Joro: Could invasive spider species spread into Middle Tennessee?

     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — The Giant Joro spider is native to Asia and was first detected in Georgia in 2013.
This large spider has thrived in North Georgia and with the population booming, scientists are expecting it to spread to other states in the south, including Tennessee.
“One is via ballooning and spiders, all spiders, so many spiders do this.
Joro spiders have already been detected in the Chattanooga area and will likely continue to spread.
If you think you may have found a Giant Joro in Middle Tennessee, there are a couple of ways you can report them.
