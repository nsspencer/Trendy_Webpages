     INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 2022 International Women’s Day: a day for fighting, not just celebrating
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For years, I have accepted a narrative that women’s achievements in equal opportunities, political or economical independence and bodily autonomy were stark proof that patriarchy has been overthrown.
Women’s achievements around the world do not prove that women are not oppressed any more, but an account that women are fighting.
I suffered obstetric violence, but I didn’t have a name for it at the time.
And women’s struggles may even be getting worse — some say that the pandemic risked regress on women’s achievements by at least 50 years.
International Women’s Day could be a day for the visibility of women’s struggles, and for women to voice their concerns, their lives and their experiences in a world ruled by men, and for men.

     International Women’s Day 2022: Is the Tech revolution being led by women?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For example, many business sectors are still predominantly male and the Tech sector is no different.
Because of this, for International Women’s Day , we wanted to draw a portrait of the women in the tech sector (especially cybersecurity!)
More and more women are being attracted to the tech sector even though only 3% say it was their first choice.
To support women looking at careers in the cybersecurity industry, the association “WiCys – Women in cybersecurity” is considered an excellent source for guidance.
However, wouldn’t the best way for a better inclusion of women in the Tech sector be through better integration?

     Summary: She tells it like it is and stands for the American and democratic values of peace, freedom, human rights and women’s rights.
Like her boss, Ukraine President Zelenskyy, she has been adept at using all forms of media to rally the international community to Ukraine’s aid, while also working the levers of geopolitical power.
A municipal help point for war refugees from Ukraine was opened in Wroclaw.
Jiill Hruby, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, in the United States Department of Energy and ... [+] the Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administration U.S. Dept.
