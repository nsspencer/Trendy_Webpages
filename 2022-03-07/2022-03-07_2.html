     Summary: It's International Women's Day 2022 and here at The Manufacturer, we're excited and proud to champion women in industry and all the amazing things they are doing.
Celebrated annually worldwide on March 8, International Women’s Day (IWD) is designed to recognise women’s achievements and reinforce equality.
This year’s campaign theme is #BreakTheBias and there is also an associated pose:My colleague Lanna has interviewed some amazing women in manufacturing for articles she’s produced to celebrate IWD (link at the bottom).
However, even though the manufacturing industry has made great strides and more women are now a part of it, we’re not there yet.
Indeed, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), women make up just 37% of the manufacturing workforce.

     International Women’s Day 2022: What’s the theme and when is it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: International Women’s Day – celebrated annually on March 8 – is a day that commemorates the social, political and economic achievements of women.
What’s the theme for International Women’s Day in 2022?
The predecessor of International Women’s Day, previously known as National Women’s Day, was first observed in the United States on February 28, 1909, at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel.
The idea of an international women’s day was unheard of until 1910 during an International Socialist Women’s Conference that took place in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Happy International Women's Day!

     Summary: There’s an old saying: “you cannot be what you cannot see.” Now girls and young women observe women in all kinds of leadership roles.
My nephew and his wife in Colorado pay $2000 a month for child care for two children for three days a week!
While statistics vary, especially by state, the average cost of child care for one child averages nearly $10,000 a year.
The United States spends less on child care than virtually any other developed nation.
The gig economy takes advantage of those who need flexibility the most – often women with child care responsibilities.

     Summary: gettyInternational Women’s Day is March 8, 2022 and this year’s theme is #BreakTheBias.
“Gender bias and gender stereotypes are so deeply entrenched in our culture that people of all genders fall into gender pitfalls,” says Rachel Thomas, co-founder &amp; CEO of LeanIn.Org and OptionB.Org.
“For example, most of us tend to underestimate women's performance and are more likely to challenge women's competence—even in their area of expertise.
The research on feedback during performance reviews finds that women are more likely to be criticized for their personal style as compared to men.
For example, one study found that 66% of women’s performance reviews contained negative personality feedback such as, “You could be less abrasive,” compared to only 1% of men’s reviews.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the world marks International Women’s Day, we asked two of the authors of the upcoming Global Gender Gap Report what they expect for gender equality in the workplace in 2022.
Global Gender Gap Report 2021Last year’s report sounded a warning that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had increased the global gender gap by a generation from 99.5 years to 135.6 years.
The World Economic Forum has been measuring gender gaps since 2006 in the annual Global Gender Gap Report.
The Global Gender Gap Report tracks progress towards closing gender gaps on a national level.
In 2019 Egypt became the first country in the Middle East and Africa to launch a Closing the Gender Gap Accelerator.
