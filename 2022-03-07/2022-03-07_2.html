     As Oil Blasts Higher, It’s Worth Remembering What Happened the Last Time Prices Reached a Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It wasn’t even two years ago when oil prices were negative.
One of the few buyers of oil then, legendary financier Carl Icahn, has completely sold out of his stake in oil-and-gas producer Occidental Petroleum now, which is one way of saying that not everyone is convinced that oil has just one direction to move.
Pretty much everyone else is, though.

     By Will HornerSaudi Arabian Oil Co. raised its oil prices for April across the board, with the price for some varieties hitting their highest ever level, amid the war in Ukraine and disruption to Russian oil supplies.
The state-run company, known as Saudi Aramco, raised its prices for sales of its Arab Light crude to Asia by $2.15 a barrel to $4.95 a barrel above the Oman/Dubai average, its highest ever level.

     Russia-Ukraine war to keep crude oil prices elevated at high levels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The intensifying Russian war on Ukraine should keep crude prices elevated at their highest levels in more than a decade for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
If oil prices continue to rise, it could usher in a global recession.
Nevertheless, a growing chorus on Congress is calling for an outright ban on Russian crude oil imports.
North America, however, only gets a small fraction of its crude oil from Russia.
The oil market, however, is a global one and no matter who buys Russian oil, the market is tacitly out millions of barrels of oil per day that will be difficult to replace.

     Markets slide as soaring oil and gas prices stoke stagflation worries – business live
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     08:25The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is announcing a “trailblazing” greener way of generating inertia in the electricity grid, to make the UK less reliant on gas supplies, including those from Russia, my colleague Rob Davies writes.
If all goes to plan, it could also reduce carbon emissions, rein in household bills and recoup the £336m investment funding it.
In the electricity system, inertia is crucial in maintaining a stable electrical frequency on the grid, keeping the lights on.
They respond instantaneously to a power outage happening elsewhere, spinning ever so slightly slower to offset the disruption and keep the system stable.
With only a small amount of energy fed into them, they can spin at the required rate of 3,000RPM, the speed that ensures synchronicity with the 50hz Grid system.

     US markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
