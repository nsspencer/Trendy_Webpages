     As Oil Blasts Higher, It’s Worth Remembering What Happened the Last Time Prices Reached a Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It wasn’t even two years ago when oil prices were negative.
One of the few buyers of oil then, legendary financier Carl Icahn, has completely sold out of his stake in oil-and-gas producer Occidental Petroleum now, which is one way of saying that not everyone is convinced that oil has just one direction to move.
Pretty much everyone else is, though.

     Stocks sink and oil prices soar as US and allies consider Russian import ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hong Kong (CNN Business) Stocks are tumbling on Monday as oil prices soared above $120 barrel to their highest level in 13 years, raising fears about an inflationary shock to the global economy .
The latest market turmoil came as US crude futures surged 6% to trade at $123 a barrel, the highest level since August 2008.
"In the event of any implementation [of the ban], the move will further exacerbate the supply-demand imbalance in an already tight oil market," wrote Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist for IG Group.
JP Morgan estimates more than 4 million barrels per day of Russian oil has already been effectively sidelined, sending oil and gasoline prices skyrocketing in recent days.
The European Union is much more reliant than the United States on Russian crude — it accounts for about 27% of all oil imports into the 27-country bloc.

     06:02EY has followed its rivals and fellow big four global accountancy firms, KPMG and PwC, by cutting off businesses in Russia and Belarus, piling pressure on Deloitte, which has yet to pull out.
KPMG has more than 4,500 workers and partners in Russia and Belarus, while PwC has 3,700 and EY has 4,700.
KPMG and PwC confirmed the businesses will no longer be able to use their brands or name once separated.
Companies across the world have been scrambling to work out their exposure to Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions.
None of those have imposed blanket bans on Russia or Belarus, which supported the invasion by its bigger ally, but many have judged that reputational or financial risks were too great.

     US markets set for lower open as oil prices climb higher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Courtney Crow/New York Stock Exchange via AP) (Courtney Crow)NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
European markets opened lower and the price of gold surged above $2,000 an ounce briefly as investors bought the precious metal viewed as a safe haven in times of crisis.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
U.S. crude jumped $5.21 to $120.89 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.
