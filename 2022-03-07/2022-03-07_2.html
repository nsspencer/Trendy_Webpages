     Stocks Drop After Crude Oil Prices Touch $130 Per Barrel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell sharply on Wall Street Monday after another big leap for oil prices threatened to squeeze inflation’s grip on the global economy.
Get our free mobile appThe S&amp;P 500 fell 3%, its biggest drop in 16 months, after a barrel of U.S. crude surged to nearly $120 on the possibility that Washington could bar imports from Russia.
Overseas markets also fell, taking their cue from oil’s movements.
Oil prices had gone as high as $130 a barrel.
Gold and a measure of nervousness on Wall Street also rose.

     U.S. Weighs Russian Oil Ban as Gas Prices Surge and Ukraine War Grows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That could lessen the economic shock to oil markets given the United States does not import much Russian crude.
Last fall, it imported about 700,000 barrels per day from Russia, less than 10 percent of its total oil imports, U.S. officials said.
The United States can easily find a way to make up for any loss of Russian oil, while Europe would have a harder time doing so, analysts said.
But any disruption in the flow of oil could further rattle global markets, including oil prices, which have surged because of the uncertainty over Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“There could be impact on our energy prices, so we are taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you drove anywhere over the weekend, you probably know that gasoline prices are a little crazy.
Those crude prices are rising because oil traders are getting nervous about a possible ban on Russian oil exports.
Sanctions on Russian oil would likely cause oil prices to rise in the future.
It usually takes about three weeks for a jump in oil prices to show up at the pump, McNally added.
“You should start to see a roughly 10% to 15% increase in gasoline prices, assuming these crude oil prices stick,” he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gasoline prices are pushing even farther above $4 a gallon, the highest price that American motorists have faced since July 2008, as calls grow to ban imports of Russian oil.
In today’s terms, the record price would be equal to about $5.24 after accounting for inflation.
The increasingly violent Russian attack on Ukraine has increased calls to cut off Russia from the money it gets from oil and natural gas exports.
READ MORE: U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surgePresident Joe Biden has been reluctant to ban Russian oil, fearing it could further fuel inflation heading into the midterm elections this November.
Talk of a ban on Russian oil has led U.S. officials to consider other sources that are currently limited.

     Summary: Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesOil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices jumped past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Gasoline prices have jumped by 45 cents a gallon in the last week, to a national average of $4.06, according to AAA.
Diesel fuel prices jumped even more rapidly, to a national average of $4.61 per gallon.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.

     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets were heading for a lower open Monday, following global markets as oil prices jumped and the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
“It should be clear by now that economic sanctions will not deter any aggression from the Russians, but will serve more as a punitive measure at the expense of implication on global economic growth.
Elevated oil prices may pose a threat to firms’ margins and consumer spending outlook,” Yeap said.

     Summary: Red-hot prices at the pump are not only showing no signs of cooling down -- but are instead set to soar even higher.
Oil had already been edging higher at the start of the year, as consumer demand outpaced global supply.
Traders fear the market will become even tighter if Russia's oil supply to the rest of the world is cut off.
"We are already in the process of losing a chunk of Russian crude oil supplies."
So as long as oil prices remain near multi-year highs in anticipation of further disruptions in the global market, consumers and businesses will feel the pinch.

Pretty much everyone wants to see prices lower, and there’s been a lot of talk about the “good ol’ days” when gas prices were under $2 a gallon.
Yes, gas prices had been very low a few times, but those weren’t good times.
Three significant storms battered the United States in 2017, but Hurricane Harvey had the most significant effect on gas prices.
In mid-July, oil prices ($147 a barrel) and gas prices ($4.11 a gallon) hit record highs.
