     International Women’s Day 2022: What’s the theme and when is it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: International Women’s Day – celebrated annually on March 8 – is a day that commemorates the social, political and economic achievements of women.
What’s the theme for International Women’s Day in 2022?
The predecessor of International Women’s Day, previously known as National Women’s Day, was first observed in the United States on February 28, 1909, at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel.
The idea of an international women’s day was unheard of until 1910 during an International Socialist Women’s Conference that took place in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Happy International Women's Day!

The first National Woman’s Day kicked off a busy couple of years for Malkiel.
AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe strike ended about the same time as the second National Woman’s Day on Feb. 27, 1910.
When she died in 1949 at age 76, a Times obituary didn’t mention her contribution to International Women’s Day, which by then used the plural “women’s” and was a big deal, if you lived in a communist country.
Then, in 1917, International Women’s Day events in Russia snowballed into a general strike that ended with Czar Nicholas II’s abdication.

     How To #BreakTheBias At Work On International Women’s Day, And Every Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: gettyInternational Women’s Day is March 8, 2022 and this year’s theme is #BreakTheBias.
“Gender bias and gender stereotypes are so deeply entrenched in our culture that people of all genders fall into gender pitfalls,” says Rachel Thomas, co-founder &amp; CEO of LeanIn.Org and OptionB.Org.
“For example, most of us tend to underestimate women's performance and are more likely to challenge women's competence—even in their area of expertise.
The research on feedback during performance reviews finds that women are more likely to be criticized for their personal style as compared to men.
For example, one study found that 66% of women’s performance reviews contained negative personality feedback such as, “You could be less abrasive,” compared to only 1% of men’s reviews.
