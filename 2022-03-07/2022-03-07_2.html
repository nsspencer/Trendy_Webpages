     Summary: She tells it like it is and stands for the American and democratic values of peace, freedom, human rights and women’s rights.
Like her boss, Ukraine President Zelenskyy, she has been adept at using all forms of media to rally the international community to Ukraine’s aid, while also working the levers of geopolitical power.
A municipal help point for war refugees from Ukraine was opened in Wroclaw.
Jiill Hruby, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, in the United States Department of Energy and ... [+] the Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administration U.S. Dept.

     International Women’s Day 2022: Is the Tech revolution being led by women?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For example, many business sectors are still predominantly male and the Tech sector is no different.
Because of this, for International Women’s Day , we wanted to draw a portrait of the women in the tech sector (especially cybersecurity!)
More and more women are being attracted to the tech sector even though only 3% say it was their first choice.
To support women looking at careers in the cybersecurity industry, the association “WiCys – Women in cybersecurity” is considered an excellent source for guidance.
However, wouldn’t the best way for a better inclusion of women in the Tech sector be through better integration?

     International Women’s Day 2022: Manufacturing has made some great progress but we’re not there yet…

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's International Women's Day 2022 and here at The Manufacturer, we're excited and proud to champion women in industry and all the amazing things they are doing.
Celebrated annually worldwide on March 8, International Women’s Day (IWD) is designed to recognise women’s achievements and reinforce equality.
However, even though the manufacturing industry has made great strides and more women are now a part of it, we’re not there yet.
Indeed, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), women make up just 37% of the manufacturing workforce.
A great place to start is the IWD website and in particular the ‘Get Involved’ submenu.
