    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     International Women’s Day Cocktail Week 2022 aims to celebrate badass women with a slew of creative cocktails and events.
The theme of International Women’s Day Cocktail Week is to celebrate women who have contributed to the development of Malaysia.
An initiative to celebrate and recognise the women who raise us, inspire us, who broke barriers and smashed through glass ceilings.
Therefore, till the 21 March 2022, participating outlets in Malaysia will be running their IWDCW cocktails created in honour of these women – by choosing any woman, (preferably a Malaysian [past or present]), who they think have contributed to the development of the nation, and craft a cocktail in their honour.

     World body marks International Women's Day by upping diversity pledges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - World Athletics (WA) is marking the March 8 International Women's Day with a new series of pledges aimed at increasing female participation on the field of play but also among coaches, officials and administrators up to the highest level.
Among the pledges announced by the governing body under the banner #WeGrowAthletics are plans to ensure gender equality in remuneration, gather "inspirational stories" from women athletes and ensure member federations have safeguarding policies in place by 2023.
"Reaching gender equality requires deliberate and ongoing effort at all levels of athletics – from the governing bodies down to the local clubs.
“We know that actions speak louder than words, and I am proud to say that World Athletics has either implemented or put into action every single pledge that we made last year."
"The majority of athletes that win world junior championships medals don't go on to compete individually for their nation as a senior.
