     Summary: It's International Women's Day 2022 and here at The Manufacturer, we're excited and proud to champion women in industry and all the amazing things they are doing.
Celebrated annually worldwide on March 8, International Women’s Day (IWD) is designed to recognise women’s achievements and reinforce equality.
This year’s campaign theme is #BreakTheBias and there is also an associated pose:My colleague Lanna has interviewed some amazing women in manufacturing for articles she’s produced to celebrate IWD (link at the bottom).
However, even though the manufacturing industry has made great strides and more women are now a part of it, we’re not there yet.
Indeed, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), women make up just 37% of the manufacturing workforce.

When she died in 1949 at age 76, a Times obituary didn’t mention her contribution to International Women’s Day, which by then used the plural “women’s” and was a big deal, if you lived in a communist country.
Then, in 1917, International Women’s Day events in Russia snowballed into a general strike that ended with Czar Nicholas II’s abdication.

     INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 2022 International Women’s Day: a day for fighting, not just celebrating
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For years, I have accepted a narrative that women’s achievements in equal opportunities, political or economical independence and bodily autonomy were stark proof that patriarchy has been overthrown.
Women’s achievements around the world do not prove that women are not oppressed any more, but an account that women are fighting.
I suffered obstetric violence, but I didn’t have a name for it at the time.
And women’s struggles may even be getting worse — some say that the pandemic risked regress on women’s achievements by at least 50 years.
International Women’s Day could be a day for the visibility of women’s struggles, and for women to voice their concerns, their lives and their experiences in a world ruled by men, and for men.

     Summary: gettyInternational Women’s Day is March 8, 2022 and this year’s theme is #BreakTheBias.
“Gender bias and gender stereotypes are so deeply entrenched in our culture that people of all genders fall into gender pitfalls,” says Rachel Thomas, co-founder &amp; CEO of LeanIn.Org and OptionB.Org.
“For example, most of us tend to underestimate women's performance and are more likely to challenge women's competence—even in their area of expertise.
The research on feedback during performance reviews finds that women are more likely to be criticized for their personal style as compared to men.
For example, one study found that 66% of women’s performance reviews contained negative personality feedback such as, “You could be less abrasive,” compared to only 1% of men’s reviews.
