     World body marks International Women's Day by upping diversity pledges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - World Athletics (WA) is marking the March 8 International Women's Day with a new series of pledges aimed at increasing female participation on the field of play but also among coaches, officials and administrators up to the highest level.
Among the pledges announced by the governing body under the banner #WeGrowAthletics are plans to ensure gender equality in remuneration, gather "inspirational stories" from women athletes and ensure member federations have safeguarding policies in place by 2023.
"Reaching gender equality requires deliberate and ongoing effort at all levels of athletics – from the governing bodies down to the local clubs.
“We know that actions speak louder than words, and I am proud to say that World Athletics has either implemented or put into action every single pledge that we made last year."
"The majority of athletes that win world junior championships medals don't go on to compete individually for their nation as a senior.

A municipal help point for war refugees from Ukraine was opened in Wroclaw.
Jiill Hruby, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, in the United States Department of Energy and ... [+] the Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administration U.S. Dept.
