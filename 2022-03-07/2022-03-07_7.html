     Summary: The Kings, meanwhile, are coming off a 114-113 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, who were without Luka Doncic, and Sacramento has now lost five of its last seven games.
Knicks +3.5 (-110)The one thing to expect in Kings games is a lack of defense and a lot of scoring, as Sacramento ranks 28th in defensive efficiency.
Seven consecutive Kings games have totaled at least 220 combined points.
The Knicks have allowed at least 115 points in five of their last seven games, so we’re eyeing the over for Fox’s points prop tonight.

In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.
