     The Kings, meanwhile, are coming off a 114-113 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, who were without Luka Doncic, and Sacramento has now lost five of its last seven games.
Knicks +3.5 (-110)The one thing to expect in Kings games is a lack of defense and a lot of scoring, as Sacramento ranks 28th in defensive efficiency.
Seven consecutive Kings games have totaled at least 220 combined points.
The Knicks have allowed at least 115 points in five of their last seven games, so we’re eyeing the over for Fox’s points prop tonight.

In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!

     New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

     NBA Odds: Knicks vs. Kings prediction, odds, pick and more – 3/7/2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks and Sacramento Kings will square off on Monday night in a battle between two of the league’s weaker teams.
Despite the lack of playoff impact this game will have, there’s still plenty to be excited about as we dive into our NBA odds series with a Knicks-Kings prediction and pick.
He’ll look to continue to carry the torch for the Knicks, especially as Julius Randle has struggled in recent games.
In that same span, Sabonis is averaging 14.0 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 6.6 assists, emerging as a constant triple-double threat for the Kings.
The Kings will get De’Aaron Fox going early in the game and cruise to victory, covering the spread handily against the Knicks on Monday night.
