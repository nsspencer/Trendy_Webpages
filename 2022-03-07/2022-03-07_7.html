We also decided that we’re not just going to have him get shot and killed in the line of duty.
We just felt like that ending of them having to knock on the door and tell Tali was so powerful.
Sarah and Byron are still around for a few more episodes as we sort of process Jess’ exit.
As part of planning Jess’ exit, we had obviously talked about who the new person coming aboard would be.
