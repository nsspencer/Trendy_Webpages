     Richard Jefferson breaks down Jarrett Allen's finger injury and how that affects the team down the final stretch of the regular season.
(1:38)CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star center Jarrett Allen will be sidelined indefinitely after breaking his left middle finger in Sunday's win over the Toronto Raptors.
Allen got hurt in the first quarter, when he also suffered a bruised quadriceps while driving to the basket.
He went to the locker room, but the Cavs held on to win 104-96 and tighten their grip on the No.
After Allen went down, Cavs rookie Evan Mobley stepped up with 20 points and 17 rebounds against the Raptors.

     Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen suffers fractured finger, out indefinitely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cleveland Cavaliers’ inspiring but injury-riddled 2021-22 season stuck to that theme on Sunday with a win over Toronto and the loss of its All-Star big man.
After Jarrett Allen initially exited the game in the second quarter with a quad contusion, he was later diagnosed with a left middle finger injury, the team announced Monday.
The news on Allen is a tough blow for a team trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018.
“I’ll have to play more big and Kevin Love will play my position,” Mobley said.
Sunday’s win gave Cleveland (37-27) a three-game lead over Toronto for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings.

     But Allen’s injury is just a continuation of horrendous luck for the Cavs, especially in recent weeks.
| Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesJarrett Allen has become one of the best big men in the NBA this season for the Cavs.
Obviously, the news is a brutal blow for Cavs fans, but it also just continues a string of horrendous luck for the team.
The injury continues the Cavs’ horrendous luck this seasonAs mentioned earlier, the Cavs lost both Collin Sexton and Ricky Rubio to season-ending injuries this year.
It’s unclear how many games Jarrett Allen could miss, but he, thankfully, isn’t as vital to the Cavs’ success as Darius Garland.

“I think everybody is (ticked) in the right way,” forward Lauri Markkanen said after the morning shootaround at Cleveland Clinic Courts in Independence.
That’s what we’re trying to do.”#Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff answers a question about how his team responded to losing Jarrett Allen to a quadriceps injury.
“When it’s expressed the right way, it could be very helpful,” Bickerstaff said in his pregame news conference.
