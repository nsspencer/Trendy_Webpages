In contrast to last season, being a Knicks fan means preparing for catastrophe to happen before tip-off even starts.
Jericho Sims looked great at the beginning of the second quarter, with an alley-oop that scared my very tired partner.
It’s incredible how the thing we’ve been calling for all season actually worked!
Quick, RJ, Sims, and Reddish put the game away for the Knicks, a welcome outcome for any fan of the Knicks that has wished Thibs unemployment.
