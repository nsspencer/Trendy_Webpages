     Tottenham vs Everton LIVE: Premier League final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)Tottenham kept themselves in the top-four race with a 5-0 hammering of Everton, who are in grave relegation danger after a gutless showing in north London.
It was another Kane masterclass, with his second goal a particular highlight, and he took his tally to 14 goals in 15 games against Everton.
There is little doubt that they are involved in a relegation dogfight as they are just a point above 18th-placed Burnley, though they do have a game in hand.
Spurs equalled their best ever Premier League win at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will now have real belief that they can gate-crash the Champions League qualification places.
Follow the reaction and analysis after Spurs thrash Everton in the Premier League:

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Spurs have been inconsistent in recent weeks but showed their best as, after Michael Keane's own goal put them ahead early on, they ran riot.
Harry Kane scored twice and Son Heung-min and Sergio Reguilon also netted.
It was another Kane masterclass, with his second goal a particular highlight, and he took his tally to 14 goals in 15 games against Everton.
Spurs equalled their best ever Premier League win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and will have real belief that they can gate-crash the Champions League qualification places.
But it was clear from early on that this was going to be a good night as they took early control of the game.

Antonio Conte, meanwhile, is trying to will Spurs into the top four, which they currently find themselves six points away.
While they have three matches in hand on West Ham and Manchester United, Arsenal have gone on a four match winning streak and are on the same number of matches played going into tonight.

     Although Everton are still in the FA Cup, having seen off Boreham Wood in midweek, their league form is still a significant concern.
Bar a 3-0 win at home to Leeds, Everton's recent games have given their fans little to cheer, with their last three away games seeing them lose at Southampton, Newcastle, and Norwich.
Tottenham lost their last two league games in their own stadium, with a 3-2 defeat against Southampton followed by a 2-0 defeat against Wolves.
Antonio Conte has never lost three consecutive league games at home in his career, and he'll be looking to continue that record today.
With Son Heung-Min scoring six in his last 11 league games, as well as picking up four assists, he could be the dangerman for Spurs.

     Now they return to Manchester, where they beat City last month, to face United on Saturday having won three out of four.
Michael Keaneâ€™s own goal gives Tottenham a 1-0 lead over Everton.
Few would have been surprised to see Kane and Son spearhead Tottenhamâ€™s attack, but it was at this point that Matt Doherty more unexpectedly took over.
Finally Doherty produced a splendid first-time defence-splitting pass to send Kane clear to extend Spursâ€™ lead to three.
Finally, Everton gave the ball away midway into their own half, Doherty crossed and Kane scored with a beautifully measured left-foot volley.

     Yet, that will be the least of Lampardâ€™s concerns after this harrowing night; one of the worst in recent memory for Everton.
Before Everton even had time to regroup, they found themselves two-down; Heung-min Son firing Dejan Kulusevskiâ€™s pass straight through Jordan Pickford.
Soon after the goal, the in-stadium cameras panned to the Everton keeper in the midst of pulling his jersey over his face.
By the time half-time came around they were 3-0 down, Kane breaking Evertonâ€™s offside trap to finish clinically past Pickford.
The Everton youngster has a big future ahead of him, but his colleagues were letting him down.

     Spurs struck while the iron was still burning hot and doubled their advantage through Heung-min Son after a neat pass from Dejan Kulusevski.
Here, Express Sport looks at five things we learned from Mondayâ€™s game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadiumâ€¦ JUST IN: Tottenham boss Conte has decisions to make on four playersHarry Kane: The Tottenham striker scored twice in the win over EvertonKane back to his best It really is a pleasure to watch Harry Kane at his devastating best.
This was collectively an impressive display for Spurs, but Kane was one of those to steal the show alongside Kulusevski, Doherty and Son.
But that suited how Spurs wanted to play, with quick direct moves worked through Harry Kane.
If this Everton side did go down, it would be one of the biggest shocks in Premier League history.
