     Will The Knicks Miss The Playoffs?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ben Stinar and Haley Jordan sat down to talk about the New York Knicks in the latest episode of Stinar For 3.
The New York Knicks went 41-31 last season, which gave them the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference and home-court advantage in the playoffs.
The play-in tournament is not out of the question, but they will have to go on a big winning-streak at some point in the next few weeks.
Even if they pulled off the unthinkable and got into the play-in tournament, the playoffs will still be a tall task.
The question for the Knicks should turn to their future, and if Thibodeau is the right coach and if Randle is the right star to lead the franchise going forward.

     Kings defense evaporates in abysmal fall to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sacramento Kings returned home to Golden 1 Center with an embarrassing loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night.
If Randle has struggled in a Knicks’ uniform this season Golden 1 Center wouldn’t know it, handling his business at the cup in strong, seasoned fashion.
He accumulated three fouls mid-way through the second quarter, a wise defensive decision by the Kings to keep him at bay.
Sacramento’s three-point shooting kept their head above water as the Knicks’ run left them within striking distance, and an evaporated lead.
Blowing another 20-point lead in only a way that the Sacramento Kings can, we’ll log this in the disappointing, but not surprising file and hope for a better outcome on Wednesday.

     Young, wild and free: Knicks team ‘Tank’ snaps 7-game funk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

They racked up 83 points in the second half, their most after intermission since 1969.
Instead of going back to Robinson, Thibodeau put in the veteran Taj Gibson for the first time since the All-Star break.
