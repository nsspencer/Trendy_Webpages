     Lakers’ LeBron James makes history in loss to Clippers, moves closer to all-time scoring record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth time this season, James scored at least 40 points, putting up 46 points as the LA Lakers lost to the LA Clippers Tuesday night, 133-115.
James made history in the losing effort, becoming the first player to score 40 points against all 30 NBA teams .
In his 20th NBA season, James has not skipped a beat, averaging 30.2 points per game as the Lakers have struggled just to hover around .500.
"I was able to make a few shots tonight and try to help us stay in the game," James said.
James’ fourth 40-point game of the 2022-23 season moved him to within 177 points of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time NBA scoring record.

     Anthony Davis injury update: Lakers star to return Wednesday after missing nearly six weeks, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis will return to the lineup Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs barring any setbacks in his pre-game warmups, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
From that moment, at which point LeBron James was injured, Davis led the Lakers to a 9-6 record up until his injury.
Davis carried the Lakers when James was out, but since Davis went down, LeBron has returned the favor.
James has averaged roughly 34 points per game since Davis went down.
The last time the two of them did so over a full season, the Lakers won a championship.

     Lakers reportedly plan to make Rui Hachimura a starter, but that raises other rotation questions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Part of the appeal of the Rui Hachimura trade the Los Angeles Lakers made on Monday was the relatively meager price.
By all accounts, the Lakers are treating Hachimura as if he's a significant part of not just their present, but their future.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported after the deal that the Lakers hope to re-sign Hachimura after the season.
The more pressing matter is Hachimura's role, and according to The Athletic's Jovan Buha, the Lakers expect Hachimura to eventually be a starter for them once their rotation settles.
Further, by starting Hachimura, the Lakers are essentially committing to keeping Davis at center for the rest of the year.

     LeBron James scores 46 points in Lakers loss, moves closer to NBA's all-time scoring record

     Summary: CNN —LeBron James moved to within 177 points of the NBA’s all-time scoring record as the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 133-115 by the Los Angeles Clippers.
James scored 46 points in the losing cause but in the process made history as the first player to hit 40 points against every franchise in the league.
“I’ve put a lot of work into it and was able to make a few shots tonight to try to help us stay in the game,” James told reporters.
When will James pass the scoring record?
With his season average of 30.2 points per game, James could pass Abdul Jabbar’s 34-year-old scoring record in the NBA against the Pacers on February 2.

     Rui Hachimura roundtable: His strengths, weaknesses and his fit with Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rui Hachimura was officially introduced as a Lakers player on Tuesday night ahead of the Lakers’ 133-115 loss to the LA Clippers.
To dissect Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and fit with the Lakers, The Athletic has gathered Lakers beat writer Jovan Buha and Wizards beat writer Josh Robbins for a roundtable discussion about Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and expected role in L.A.Jovan Buha: Josh, thanks for doing this.
Robbins: His weaknesses are significant, and big picture, his weaknesses revolve around how awkwardly he often fits into a five-man game.
The Wizards and Hachimura did not reach an extension agreement during the window for rookie-scale extensions, and Hachimura wanted the Wizards to trade him.
Also, while he probably has the athleticism to guard many wings in short doses, I think he’s better off defending players who aren’t quite as quick.

By the end of the Clippers win, Lue laughed with a fan sitting near the team’s bench — the boxer Floyd Mayweather, no stranger to landing knockout blows.
Clippers Clippers guard Luke Kennard could return as soon as Thursday Luke Kennard and the Clippers have opened the possibility that the guard could return Thursday should his health continue to show encouraging progress.
Jackson had two turnovers, but five assists, and the Clippers outscored the Lakers by 11 in his minutes.
“I think he’s finding his niche, he’s finding his way, he’s figuring out how to play, he’s found his rhythm,” George said.

     Summary: At the same time, standing pat beyond the Hachimura trade is akin to punting on the season.
Beyond that, history shows that nearly every champion was a top-three seed, suggesting the Lakers’ championship odds are low with or without a move.
“Rob is going to do his job, that’s his job,” James said.
He had a lukewarm response when asked about the Hachimura trade.
The Lakers made the trade with the intention of retaining him, and Pelinka made it clear that the Lakers view Hachimura as a member of their young core.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers star is set to return Wednesday for the team's game against the San Antonio Spurs, barring any setback in warmups, after missing 20 games due to a foot injury, according to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.
Davis will be on a minutes restriction and shouldn’t play more than 24 minutes in the game at Crypto.com Arena.
It’s unclear how long that minutes restriction will be in place moving forward.
He went up with Nuggets star Nikola Jokic in the paint and started hopping in pain almost instantly after landing on his feet.
The Lakers went 10-10 without Davis and leaned heavily on Thomas Bryant during that stretch.
