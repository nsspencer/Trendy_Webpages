     Anthony Davis scores 21 while coming off bench in Lakers return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES -- Lakers star big man Anthony Davis returned to the lineup Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 21 points in a 113-104 Los Angeles victory while coming off the bench for the first time in nearly a decade.
"I'm happy for him, first and foremost," Lakers coach Darvin Ham said before the game.
Davis checked in for the first time with 4:22 remaining in the opening quarter and played 26 minutes as the team managed his workload.
The last time Davis came off the bench in a game was Dec. 18, 2013, in Los Angeles against the Clippers in his second season with the New Orleans Pelicans.
Ham was asked if Davis was fully recovered or if the team had any lingering concerns about the eight-time All-Star reinjuring himself.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers star is set to return Wednesday for the team's game against the San Antonio Spurs, barring any setback in warmups, after missing 20 games due to a foot injury, according to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.
Davis will be on a minutes restriction and shouldn’t play more than 24 minutes in the game at Crypto.com Arena.
It’s unclear how long that minutes restriction will be in place moving forward.
He went up with Nuggets star Nikola Jokic in the paint and started hopping in pain almost instantly after landing on his feet.
The Lakers went 10-10 without Davis and leaned heavily on Thomas Bryant during that stretch.

     Rui Hachimura roundtable: His strengths, weaknesses and his fit with Lakers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rui Hachimura was officially introduced as a Lakers player on Tuesday night ahead of the Lakers’ 133-115 loss to the LA Clippers.
To dissect Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and fit with the Lakers, The Athletic has gathered Lakers beat writer Jovan Buha and Wizards beat writer Josh Robbins for a roundtable discussion about Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and expected role in L.A.Jovan Buha: Josh, thanks for doing this.
Robbins: His weaknesses are significant, and big picture, his weaknesses revolve around how awkwardly he often fits into a five-man game.
The Wizards and Hachimura did not reach an extension agreement during the window for rookie-scale extensions, and Hachimura wanted the Wizards to trade him.
Also, while he probably has the athleticism to guard many wings in short doses, I think he’s better off defending players who aren’t quite as quick.

     Summary: CNN —LeBron James moved to within 177 points of the NBA’s all-time scoring record as the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 133-115 by the Los Angeles Clippers.
James scored 46 points in the losing cause but in the process made history as the first player to hit 40 points against every franchise in the league.

With his season average of 30.2 points per game, James could pass Abdul Jabbar’s 34-year-old scoring record in the NBA against the Pacers on February 2.
