     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers made a trade for Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimua, and Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green applauded the move on a recent podcast episode.
"I will say the Lakers won the trade," Green said.
I think Kendrick Nunn is going to go to Washington and rediscover the Kendrick Nunn that we saw in Miami...
On Rui as a player, Green added, "The Rui trade is very good for the Lakers because any time you can get length and athleticism, it's always helpful.

     LeBron James scores 46 points in Lakers loss, moves closer to NBA's all-time scoring record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —LeBron James moved to within 177 points of the NBA’s all-time scoring record as the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 133-115 by the Los Angeles Clippers.
James scored 46 points in the losing cause but in the process made history as the first player to hit 40 points against every franchise in the league.
“I’ve put a lot of work into it and was able to make a few shots tonight to try to help us stay in the game,” James told reporters.
When will James pass the scoring record?
With his season average of 30.2 points per game, James could pass Abdul Jabbar’s 34-year-old scoring record in the NBA against the Pacers on February 2.

     NBA trade rumors: Lakers' Rob Pelinka explains what it would take to move future first-round picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers made their first trade of the season on Monday when they landed Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura.
If, at the end of next month's trade deadline, Hachimura is the Lakers' only pickup, their fortunes likely won't change much.
"I think the calculus for the Lakers is to win a championship or not," Pelinka said.
The Lakers have a flawed roster that probably needs more than a single move or trade deadline to be fixed.
Nothing the Lakers do matters if James isn't one of the best players in the world.

Clippers Clippers guard Luke Kennard could return as soon as Thursday Luke Kennard and the Clippers have opened the possibility that the guard could return Thursday should his health continue to show encouraging progress.

     Rui Hachimura roundtable: His strengths, weaknesses and his fit with Lakers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rui Hachimura was officially introduced as a Lakers player on Tuesday night ahead of the Lakers’ 133-115 loss to the LA Clippers.
To dissect Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and fit with the Lakers, The Athletic has gathered Lakers beat writer Jovan Buha and Wizards beat writer Josh Robbins for a roundtable discussion about Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and expected role in L.A.Jovan Buha: Josh, thanks for doing this.
Robbins: His weaknesses are significant, and big picture, his weaknesses revolve around how awkwardly he often fits into a five-man game.
The Wizards and Hachimura did not reach an extension agreement during the window for rookie-scale extensions, and Hachimura wanted the Wizards to trade him.
Also, while he probably has the athleticism to guard many wings in short doses, I think he’s better off defending players who aren’t quite as quick.

     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis will return to the lineup Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs barring any setbacks in his pre-game warmups, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
From that moment, at which point LeBron James was injured, Davis led the Lakers to a 9-6 record up until his injury.
Davis carried the Lakers when James was out, but since Davis went down, LeBron has returned the favor.
James has averaged roughly 34 points per game since Davis went down.
The last time the two of them did so over a full season, the Lakers won a championship.

On Tuesday night, James was exceptional, going 16 of 29 from the field, including nine three-pointers, for 46 points with eight rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block against the Los Angeles Clippers.
LAKERS' LEBRON JAMES MAKES HISTORY IN LOSS TO CLIPPERS, MOVES CLOSER TO ALL-TIME SCORING RECORDThere’s still time left – the Lakers are just a couple of games out of at least the play-in tournament – but James’ efforts have not mattered in multiple games this season.
But no one has come close to averaging his 27.4 points and 12.1 rebounds per game in his 25 contests this season.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers star is set to return Wednesday for the team's game against the San Antonio Spurs, barring any setback in warmups, after missing 20 games due to a foot injury, according to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.
Davis will be on a minutes restriction and shouldn’t play more than 24 minutes in the game at Crypto.com Arena.
It’s unclear how long that minutes restriction will be in place moving forward.
He went up with Nuggets star Nikola Jokic in the paint and started hopping in pain almost instantly after landing on his feet.
The Lakers went 10-10 without Davis and leaned heavily on Thomas Bryant during that stretch.

     Summary: At the same time, standing pat beyond the Hachimura trade is akin to punting on the season.
Beyond that, history shows that nearly every champion was a top-three seed, suggesting the Lakers’ championship odds are low with or without a move.
“Rob is going to do his job, that’s his job,” James said.
He had a lukewarm response when asked about the Hachimura trade.
The Lakers made the trade with the intention of retaining him, and Pelinka made it clear that the Lakers view Hachimura as a member of their young core.
