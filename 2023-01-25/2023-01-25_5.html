     Lakers' Russell Westbrook: Drops 17 points in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Westbrook amassed 17 points (4-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-13 FT), one rebound, five assists and two steals in 25 minutes during Tuesday's 133-115 loss to the Clippers.
Dennis Schroder and Patrick Beverley made no headway in the early stages of Tuesday's loss, leaving Westbrook to do a good amount of the heavy lifting.
LeBron James dominated all facets of LA's production, so it wasn't a surprise to see Westbrook perform a bit below his seasonal averages.

     Russell Westbrook Gets Offended After Reporter Asks Him Totally Fair Question About A Turnover
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook had two turnovers during the Lakers’ 18-point loss to the Clippers on Tuesday night.
When asked after the game about the specific play, Westbrook decided to act offended.
During his postgame press conference, a reporter asked “where did you and Dennis get crossed up on that inbounds play?”It’s a totally valid question from the reporter, especially after a blowout loss, but Westbrook didn’t appreciate it.
“What’d you mean crossed up?” Westbrook asked the reporter.
How were we crossed up?”“I mean I assume the turnover wasn’t the goal of the play,” the reporter responded.

Westbrook had an inbounds pass on the baseline with a chance to get L.A. within single digits.
Afterward, Schroder and Westbrook were seen having an argument on the sidelines.
Schroder explained the reason behind the argument and the result of it following the loss.

     Dennis Schroder reveals reason for dust-up with Russell Westbrook vs. Clippers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers got the better of the Lakers in the battle of Los Angeles on Tuesday night, and Dennis Schroder opened up about the tense conversation he had with teammate Russell Westbrook in the fourth quarter of the contest.
Schroder said the conversation between him and Russ was borne out of frustration with his own mistakes and that they were on the same page now, according to Lakers beat writer Kyle Goon.
Yeah, of course,” Schroder responded to being asked if it was a one-game issue between the two veterans.
He also scored a career high nine three-pointers, while grabbing eight boards and adding seven assists.
Westbrook finished with 17 points, one rebound and five assists in the contest, while Dennis Schroder scored just seven points and added two boards over 32 minutes.
