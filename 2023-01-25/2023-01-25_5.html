     Summary: In his first interview since the death of former Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis spoke about his health, his critics and the future of the papacy.
He also criticized laws that criminalize homosexuality as unjust.
Pope Francis told the Associated Press that, while Catholic teaching holds that homosexual acts are a "sin," being homosexual is not a "crime."
He added that the Catholic Church should work to put an end to laws in some countries that criminalize homosexuality.
Asked about the wave of criticism against him from conservative cardinals and bishops following Benedict's death, Francis acknowledged the knives are out, but he appeared unruffled.

     Summary: “Being homosexual isn’t a crime,” Francis said during an exclusive interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
Declaring such laws “unjust,” Francis said the Catholic Church can and should work to put an end to them.
On Tuesday, Francis said there needed to be a distinction between a crime and a sin with regard to homosexuality.
“Fine, but first let’s distinguish between a sin and a crime.”“It’s also a sin to lack charity with one another,” he added.
Despite such outreach, Francis was criticized by the Catholic LGBTQ community for a 2021 decree from the Vatican’s doctrine office that said the church cannot bless same-sex unions.

     Summary: Rome — Pope Francis has called laws criminalizing homosexuality as fundamentally "unfair," making it clear that in the mind of the leader of the Catholic Church, "being homosexual is not a crime."
Pope Francis pauses during an interview with The Associated Press at the Vatican, January 24, 2023.
Francis reiterated, however, church teaching that engaging in homosexual activity is sinful.
"It's a sin," Francis said, adding: "Let's make the distinction first between sin and crime."
However, Pope Francis has repeatedly championed homosexual rights and advocated for inclusion of LGBTQ people in Catholic life.
