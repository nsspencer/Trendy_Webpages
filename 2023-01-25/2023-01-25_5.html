     Report: Kyrie Irving wants to sign long-term deal with Nets, who are yet to communicate a similar desire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Irving hasn't done or said anything stupid, and instead has decided to remind everyone what an incredible talent he is.
According to Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes, Irving wants to stay with the Nets, who, to this point, have not communicated a similar desire.
I have reached out to the Nets regarding this," his agent Shetellia Irving told Bleacher Report.
Short of a sign and trade, Brooklyn's choices are to give him a long-term deal or lose him for nothing.
Again, this speaks to Irving value restoration.

     Summary: It was a tale of two halves for Brooklyn Nets point forward Ben Simmons in Wednesday's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.
So if you're thinking about being aggressive, you will be aggressive," said Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn on Simmons' flipping the scoring switch in the second half postgame.
For Brooklyn, the team wants Simmons to play with force on each possession.
So we're gonna get our guys to do that every single night.”Outside of the head coach, Simmons has the support of his teammates.
Did you play that single possession so that's how I watched the games?

     Summary: Brooklyn went down the wire with the Philadelphia 76ers in what was a very chippy (and long!)
The Nets have now lost five of their seven total games while playing without Kevin Durant.
For the second game in a row, Nic Claxton set a career-high in points with 25 to go with 11 rebounds.
Ben Simmons, notably playing in his second game in Philadelphia after his unceremonious exit that resulted in a season-long holdout, had an odd performance.
After Philly jumped out to an early 16-8 lead, the Nets’ defensive effort smoothed out the deficit to 21-19.

     Summary: Nets could make 3 notable veteran players available in trade?
The Brooklyn Nets have gotten their act together on the court and could be looking to improve ahead of the trade deadline.
They don’t have a lot of draft picks to offer other teams in exchange for potential trade additions, but they do have some veteran rotation players they could dangle.
He mentioned veterans Joe Harris, Seth Curry and Patty Mills as potential trade chips.
Harris has one more season left on his current contract, which pays him $18.6 million this season and $19.9 million next season.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets v Philadelphia 76ersAre the Brooklyn Nets title contenders?
Rule any team with Kevin Durant out at your own risk, especially if Kyrie Irving is next to him as a secondary shot creator and scorer.
League sources say the Nets are one of the teams more actively looking for upgrades before the stretch run.
Joe Harris ($18.6 million), Seth Curry ($8.5 million), and Patty Mills ($6.5 million) could be involved in trades because of their short-term salaries and the fact that they’ve been playing lesser roles lately.

     Summary: Embiid's Sixers prevailed in a chaotic, offense-centric affair over Simmons' Nets, extending their winning streak to six games and improving to 31-16 with a 137-133 victory.
Simmons was peripheral in Brooklyn’s half-court offense and the Sixers allowed the Nets few true fast-break chances.
A couple of those looks were inexcusably open, but Curry also made one three through a Maxey foul and burned Tobias Harris with his pump fake before draining another.
Harden plowed over Simmons for an offensive foul and Embiid was whistled for two quick fouls against Claxton.
Despite allowing the Nets to shoot 64.5 percent from the floor and 53.8 percent from three-point range, the Sixers emerged victorious.
