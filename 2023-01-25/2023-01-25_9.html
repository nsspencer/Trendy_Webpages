     Why Germany delayed sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another German concern has been that, while European countries including the UK, Poland and the Netherlands, say it's clearly the Kremlin that is escalating this conflict, many in Germany say they fear delivering heavy tanks and other offensive weaponry to Ukraine could push Vladimir Putin to even wilder extremes.
Even the use of nuclear weapons.

     Germany U-turns over battle tanks, saying it will send Leopard 2s to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Wednesday that Germany will provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 tanks out of its own Bundeswehr (German armed forces) stocks.
Germany said its goal was to "quickly assemble two tank battalions with Leopard 2 tanks for Ukraine.
As a first step, Germany will supply a company with 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks from Bundeswehr stocks.
Reports emerged late Tuesday that Chancellor Scholz was ready to agree to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, while the Biden administration was potentially prepared to provide a couple dozen M1 Abrams tanks.
Warsaw on Tuesday sent a request to Berlin, asking permission to re-export 14 of its own Leopard tanks to Kyiv.

     Summary: Germany agrees to send its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine after weeks of pressureEnlarge this image toggle caption David Hecker/Getty Images David Hecker/Getty ImagesBERLIN — After weeks of intense pressure from allies, Germany has agreed to allow its state-of-the-art Leopard 2 tanks to be donated to Ukraine, in a marked shift from its leaders' reluctance to significantly increase military support to help the country fight Russia.
The White House appeared to be leaning toward a decision on whether to send its Abrams tanks to Ukraine as well.
Germany will initially send a company of 14 tanks, and Ukrainian crews will soon begin training on them in Germany, said Steffen Hebestreit, a spokesman for Scholz.
Germany will also authorize other countries that have their own stocks of Leopard 2 tanks to export them to Ukraine.
U.S. officials had been pressing Germany to send Leopard tanks but previously said the Biden administration was not sending the American-made tanks because of challenges with training and maintenance.

     Explainer: Why has Ukraine sought Leopard 2 battle tanks?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyiv has been pushing for the Leopard 2 tank in particular because it has several advantages over the alternatives, such as Britain's Challenger 2 and the U.S. M1 Abrams tanks.
With some 20 nations operating the Leopard 2, several nations could each chip in a small portion of their tanks to support Ukraine.
Germany has about 350 Leopard 2 tanks today, compared to some 4,000 battle main tanks at the height of the Cold War, according to German military expert Carl Schulze.
At the same time, it is all but impossible to buy a large amount of Leopard 2 tanks quickly.
However, unlike the Leopard 2, it is not widely used, which limits how many can be made available for Ukraine.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier, Scholz told lawmakers in Germany’s parliament the decision to send Leopard 2 tanks had come after consultations with western allies.
US to send 31 Abrams tanksThe US decision to provide Abrams tanks to Ukraine represents an abrupt about-face from its earlier stated position.
Poland on Tuesday formally asked for approval from Germany to transfer some of its German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.
Although Ukraine has stocks of Soviet-era tanks, modern Western tanks provide a greater level of speed and agility.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff welcomed the news and reiterated the country needed “a lot” of Leopard tanks.
