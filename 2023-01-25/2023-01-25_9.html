     Nets' Ben Simmons reacts to 'F--k Ben Simmons' chants from fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s also no surprise that former Sixers star Ben Simmons was in the middle of a heated moment during the game.
Simmons got into it with former Sixers teammate Georges Niang with the Nets star ended up getting whistled for a technical foul for shoving Niang.
It’s possible that he was just making a signal to one of his teammates as well, but I’m not so sure Philly fans are going to see it that way.
There’s no love lost between Simmons and the Sixers fans after his high-profile exit from the team last year.
Clearly, the Philly fans had a lot more in store for Ben Simmons as the game went on.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesIn their first meeting since he was traded to the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid made quick work of Ben Simmons.
The 76ers defeated the Nets 137-133 on Wednesday night at Wells Fargo Center to improve to 31-16 on the season.
Embiid, unsurprisingly, was the best player on the court for Philadelphia, finishing with 26 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals in 35 minutes.
He made six of 18 shots from the floor and one of five shots from deep.
The 26-year-old entered Wednesday's game averaging just 7.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists in 35 games while shooting 56.9 percent from the floor.

     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers fans will never get tired of booing Brooklyn Nets star Ben Simmons whenever he plays at Wells Fargo Center.
The Sixers faithful made sure to remind him of that on Wednesday as the two teams meet again.
As the Nets’ starting lineup was introduced, Sixers fans let Simmons hear it when his name was announced.
It is interesting to note, however, that it’s the first time that Simmons will be facing up against Joel Embiid since his trade to the Nets in 2022.
Philadelphia won their previous meeting with Brooklyn early in the season, and sure enough, Sixers fans are hoping for the same this time around.

That left the Nets with the Sixers’ 2023 pick which they subsequently shipped out for the former Jazz wingman, O’Neal.
We’re still patiently waiting to see if and when the Nets trade the Sixers 2027 first they possess for even more help.

     BK Nets Player Ben Simmons Teams Up With Nonprofit to Provide New Coats to Children

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets player Ben Simmons recently partnered with nonprofit organization Operation Warm to provide brand-new coats to children.
During his annual Ben Simmons Coat Giveback event — which took place at Brooklyn’s PS 124 Silas B Dutcher Elementary — Simmons gifted new warm winter coats to over 2,600 local kids in total.
Since then, Simmons has been able to provide a total of over 7,800 new coats to children in need.
All new coats have been handed out through elementary schools and nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in New York.
“Our partnership with Ben and the Simmons Family Foundation these last five years has positively impacted thousands of children,” said Grace Sica, executive director for Operation Warm.

     Ben Simmons benched late in Nets’ loss to Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — This is what Jacque Vaughn means when he says Ben Simmons needs to play an entire game with force.
He missed his only shot attempt and refused to look at the rim, often passing out of situations where most other players would shoot.
After going scoreless with just one shot attempt in the first half, Simmons scored 10 points in the third quarter alone.
By the time Simmons decided to look at the rim, it was too little, too late.
The issue is that Simmons remains the same — inconsistent — and the Nets don’t know what they’ll get from him on a nightly basis.
