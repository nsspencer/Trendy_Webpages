     U.S. will send Abrams tanks to Ukraine ahead of expected Russian offensive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – The Biden administration announced Wednesday it will equip Ukraine with the mighty M1A1 Abrams tank, a key reversal in the West's effort to arm Kyiv as it prepares for a fresh Russian offensive.
Washington plans to purchase the new M1s using funds from that package, the congressionally approved Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.
It will "take some time" for the tanks to be delivered to Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said Wednesday.
The Pentagon has been tasked with providing the training, maintenance and logistics support for the M1A1 tanks, according to the official.
He also declined to provide a timeline of when the M1A1 Abrams tanks would be ready for Ukrainian forces.

     Summary: In a major increase of U.S. support to Ukraine, President Joe Biden has signed off on sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to the war-torn country as concerns mount over a new Russian offensive this spring.
For weeks, Pentagon officials said publicly that the Abrams tanks weren't suited for the fight in Ukraine, including because of the fuel they need to operate.
As I told President Zelenskyy when he was here ... in December: 'We're with you for as long as it takes, Mr.
"The Abrams tanks are the most capable tanks in the world.
Administration officials had confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that they were considering sending the Abrams tanks to Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.

     US finalizing plans to send approximately 30 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, two US officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington CNN —The US is finalizing plans to send approximately 30 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, two US officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN.
The Biden administration announcement to send the US-made tanks could come as early as this week, CNN reported earlier Tuesday.
The pending announcement appears to break a diplomatic logjam with Germany about the provision of tanks to Ukraine.
The German government announced on Wednesday it will send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, following weeks of diplomatic pressure to make the move.
Germany had indicated to the US last week that it would not send its Leopard tanks unless the US also agreed to send its own M1 Abrams tanks.

     Summary: The U.S. will now sign contracts for the 31 Abrams tanks, along with 120mm rounds and other ammunition, eight tactical recovery vehicles, other support vehicles and equipment, training, maintenance and sustainment, according to the State Department.
But Berlin stood firm, with senior German leaders privately telling Washington that they would only send Leopards if the U.S. sent Abrams.
He ultimately decided to send American tanks after Austin’s recommendation, according to two other U.S. officials.
The decision comes after Pentagon leaders argued publicly and privately that now may not be the right time to send the Abrams.
