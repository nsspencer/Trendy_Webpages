     NBA rumors: Bob Myers' Warriors future appears uncertain as contract nears end

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bob Myers is entering the final months of his contract as the Warriors' general manager and president of basketball operations.
Golden State's two-timeline plan is one of the reasons Myers' future appears to be in question.
Despite all the uncertainty around the team, Myers has stated his belief in the 2022-23 Warriors' ability to win another championship.
Myers arrived in the Bay Area as the Warriors' assistant general manager to Larry Riley in 2011.
He was promoted to general manager the following year and added president of basketball operations to his job title in 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Grizzlies return to San Francisco comes at the perfect time, even following a head-shaking loss to the Brooklyn Nets.
The Warriors are the defending champions who still are led by 34-year-old Steph Curry and 32-year-olds Draymond Green and Thompson.
Trying to find that extra gear, the Warriors brought everything they had in their first contest this season with the Grizzlies.
"Just the force that is required," Kerr said Tuesday about what the Warriors can take from their earlier game with the Grizzlies.
The Grizzlies have lost three games in a row, and the Warriors would love nothing more than to extend that streak to four straight.

Against the Grizzlies, it felt like more Grizzlies than usual were able to blow by their defenders on the perimeter.
