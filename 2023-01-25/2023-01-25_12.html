Ladies and gentlemen, Russell Westbrook and Dennis Schroder pic.twitter.com/0dVqrwXGHP — Brono$ (@Fire_Westbrook) January 25, 2023Westbrook was asked about that moment where he and Schroder got “crossed up” during the Lakers presser and safe to stay he wasn’t as open to discussing it, as you can imagine.
How were we crossed up?” asked Russell Westbrook.

     Russell Westbrook Gets Offended After Reporter Asks Him Totally Fair Question About A Turnover
    </h2>

“What’d you mean crossed up?” Westbrook asked the reporter.
How were we crossed up?”“I mean I assume the turnover wasn’t the goal of the play,” the reporter responded.
