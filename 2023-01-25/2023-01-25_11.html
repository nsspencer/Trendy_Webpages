    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — Is a 2008-like housing plummet headed for the Valley?
The New York Post cited the Goldman Sachs note, saying four markets — San Jose, California; Austin, Texas; San Diego, California; and Phoenix — will likely see housing price declines of around 25%.
ABC15 has extensively covered the rising housing prices in the Valley over the last few years, as well as the affordable housing crisis.
Last year, we reported about the Phoenix housing market's inventory problem.
Aside from Phoenix housing costs, experts say Arizona has been experiencing among the highest inflation rates in the country.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that the housing market is beginning to cool off, a major investment firm is giving an ominous look at Phoenix’s housing market.
While most experts, including Goldman Sachs, agree that the housing market is beginning to normalize after pandemic-driven demand there is still a lot of uncertainty.
Goldman Sachs is calling for a “gradual return of affordability” as part of the report.
Firm researchers say that households should experience greater incomes, outweighing any effects that high mortgage rates are having on the housing market.
“While higher mortgage rates weigh on affordability, we expect strong nominal income growth,” the report detailed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Goldman Sachs’ latest home price predictions could be cause for concern.
The company notified its clients earlier this month that based on the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price NSA Index’s projected decline, the housing market has fallen out of favor with Goldman Sachs.
The company is eyeing the San Jose, Austin, Phoenix, and San Diego markets in particular.
These “overheated” housing markets will see “peak-to-trough declines” of more than 25%, according to Goldman Sachs.
Although Goldman Sachs’ predictions are likely to concern real estate investors, a New Western report states that investors are confident going into 2023, despite the current housing market trends.

     Summary: articleGoldman Sachs expects home values to worsen through 2023 amid continued skyrocketing interest rates and declining housing prices.
The firm wrote to clients earlier this month that it predicts four U.S. cities will suffer the most catastrophic dips, drawing comparisons to the 2008 housing crash.
"This [national] decline should be small enough as to avoid broad mortgage credit stress, with a sharp increase in foreclosures nationwide seeming unlikely," Goldman Sachs wrote.
Goldman Sachs also forecasts that many Northeastern, Southeastern, and Midwestern markets could see milder corrections.
FEDERAL RESERVE INVESTIGATING GOLDMAN SACHS' CONSUMER BUSINESS"Assuming the economy remains on the path to a soft landing, avoiding a recession, and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate falls back to 6.15% by year-end 2024, home price growth will likely shift from depreciation to below-trend appreciation in 2024," Goldman Sachs wrote.

Goldman Sachs, in a note to clients earlier this month obtained by the New York Post, predicted Phoenix, San Diego, San Jose, California, and Austin, Texas will see declines of more than 25%.
Phoenix headed a skyrocketing housing market, but if Goldman Sachs predictions play out, it could be at the front of the fall.

     The worst is over for the US housing market – and prices will stop crashing within 6 months, Goldman Sachs says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A painful period for the US housing market looks like it's coming to an end, according to Goldman Sachs.
"The sharpest declines for the US housing market are now behind us," a team led by Goldman Sachs' chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a research note.
That pushed up mortgage rates to multi-year highs, leading to a slowdown in housing demand.
The retreat in mortgage rates should eventually filter through into the market by making it cheaper to borrow to buy a house, which Goldman Sachs believe will eventually halt the slide in prices.
Two-thirds of Americans believe that a housing market crash is "imminent in the next three years", according to a NerdWatch survey that sought to gauge views about the current slowdown.
