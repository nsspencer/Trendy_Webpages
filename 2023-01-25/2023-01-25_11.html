     Tesla reports record earnings but tighter profit margins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —Tesla reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the full year, but said its profit margins were tighter due to higher costs, recent price cuts, and sales in the quarter that were weaker than hoped.
Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading.
Its previous aggressive growth rates and strong profit margins were factors that made Tesla the most valuable automaker in the world by far, despite having a fraction of the sales volume of other global automakers.
It had previously said volume production of that vehicle is expected in 2024.
Tesla also said it will reveal details of its next generation vehicle platform at an investors’ day in March.
