    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES -- Lakers star big man Anthony Davis returned Wednesday night against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 21 points in a 113-104 Los Angeles victory while coming off the bench for the first time in nearly a decade.
"It was definitely new for me since I've been playing," Davis said.
"I'm happy for him, first and foremost," Lakers coach Darvin Ham said before the game.
Before the game, Ham was asked if Davis was fully recovered or if the team had any lingering concerns about the eight-time All-Star reinjuring himself.
"He can really, really help us on both ends of the floor," Davis said of Hachimura.

     Anthony Davis returns from 20-game absence, Hachimura makes Lakers' debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are starting to get key pieces of their lineup back as he makes his push toward becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.
Anthony Davis scored 21 points in his return from a right foot injury and Rui Hachimura added 12 in his Lakers debut as they bounced back from a rough loss to beat the San Antonio Spurs 113-104 on Wednesday night.
“He makes the game look so easy and takes the pressure off us,” Ham said of Davis.
Los Angeles goes on a five-game road trip with their next game at home being Feb. 7 against Oklahoma City.
Los Angeles’ largest lead would be 14 late in the quarter as it swept the four-game season series.

     Anthony Davis returns as Lakers bounce back with win over Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the seconds before he checked in, the San Antonio Spurs pounded the offensive glass to steal two points.
Davis led them in scoring and rebounds, the Lakers beating the Spurs 113-104, dominating the fourth quarter.
“I thought he looked good,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said after the win.
As a result of Davis and Hachimura being available, Ham didn’t use Wenyen Gabriel or Juan Toscano-Anderson in his rotation.
They’re the good kind of problems to have, difficult decisions that matter only once the Lakers and Davis are healthy.

     Lakers star Anthony Davis to return from 20-game absence due to foot injury vs. Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers star is set to return Wednesday for the team's game against the San Antonio Spurs, barring any setback in warmups, after missing 20 games due to a foot injury, according to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.
Davis will be on a minutes restriction and shouldn’t play more than 24 minutes in the game at Crypto.com Arena.
It’s unclear how long that minutes restriction will be in place moving forward.
He went up with Nuggets star Nikola Jokic in the paint and started hopping in pain almost instantly after landing on his feet.
The Lakers went 10-10 without Davis and leaned heavily on Thomas Bryant during that stretch.
