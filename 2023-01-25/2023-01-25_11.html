     Benfica to bid for USMNT prospect Joshua Wynder as renowned scouting network identifies talented American
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USMNT prospect Joshua Wynder is reportedly the subject of transfer interest from Benfica, with a significant bid on the way.
Captained United States' U19sCurrently plays for Louisville CityHas already trained with BenficaWHAT HAPPENED?
Benfica will set the USL's transfer record with its bid for Wynder, according to Manuel Veth, and the club is set to land the player after Louisville turned down interest from several MLS teams.
AND WHAT'S MORE: If he keeps up his current trajectory and eventually breaks through with Benfica, it won't be long before he's in the discussion for senior USMNT action.
Wynder will not be involved when the senior squad plays friendlies against Serbia and Colombia this month, however other exciting youngsters have been included in camp.

Right back Julian Gressel, also making his USMNT debut, delivered the cross from the right flank to earn the assist.
The goal came from a spell of control from the Stars and Stripes, who looked far more threatening than Serbia.
Though most of the danger emerged from Cade Cowell's side on the left flank, Gressel flipped the switch on the opposite flank for the opener.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Brunskill/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesThe United States men's national team officially kicks off the 2026 FIFA World Cup cycle on Wednesday.
However, the friendly match against Serbia will be more of an afterthought compared to situations off the field involving the USMNT.
The Club América midfielder will only be available for Wednesday's game before he returns to the Liga MX club.
But the USMNT resides in a new position this January because it does not have to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on home soil.
Aaronson's older brother, Brenden, plays for Leeds United in the English Premier League and featured at the World Cup for the USMNT.
