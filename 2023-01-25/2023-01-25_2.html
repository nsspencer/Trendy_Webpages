     Lakers' Russell Westbrook: Drops 17 points in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Westbrook amassed 17 points (4-13 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 8-13 FT), one rebound, five assists and two steals in 25 minutes during Tuesday's 133-115 loss to the Clippers.
Dennis Schroder and Patrick Beverley made no headway in the early stages of Tuesday's loss, leaving Westbrook to do a good amount of the heavy lifting.
LeBron James dominated all facets of LA's production, so it wasn't a surprise to see Westbrook perform a bit below his seasonal averages.

     Dennis Schroder reveals reason for dust-up with Russell Westbrook vs. Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers got the better of the Lakers in the battle of Los Angeles on Tuesday night, and Dennis Schroder opened up about the tense conversation he had with teammate Russell Westbrook in the fourth quarter of the contest.
Schroder said the conversation between him and Russ was borne out of frustration with his own mistakes and that they were on the same page now, according to Lakers beat writer Kyle Goon.
Yeah, of course,” Schroder responded to being asked if it was a one-game issue between the two veterans.
He also scored a career high nine three-pointers, while grabbing eight boards and adding seven assists.
Westbrook finished with 17 points, one rebound and five assists in the contest, while Dennis Schroder scored just seven points and added two boards over 32 minutes.

     Russell Westbrook Gets Offended After Reporter Asks Him Totally Fair Question About A Turnover
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook had two turnovers during the Lakers’ 18-point loss to the Clippers on Tuesday night.
When asked after the game about the specific play, Westbrook decided to act offended.
During his postgame press conference, a reporter asked “where did you and Dennis get crossed up on that inbounds play?”It’s a totally valid question from the reporter, especially after a blowout loss, but Westbrook didn’t appreciate it.
“What’d you mean crossed up?” Westbrook asked the reporter.
How were we crossed up?”“I mean I assume the turnover wasn’t the goal of the play,” the reporter responded.

     Summary: After the turnover, Westbrook and Schroder got into a bit of a verbal altercation on the bench.
What was the discussion about trying to get that right moving forward?”“What’d you mean crossed up?” Westbrook quickly fired back.
How were we crossed up?”“I mean I assume the turnover wasn’t the goal of the play,” the reporter pressed.
“It was a turnover,” Westbrook bluntly answered.
This wasn’t the first time Westbrook lashed out at a Lakers reporter, having been embroiled in some battles with the media last year.

     LeBron James' frustrations with Lakers seem to go beyond Dennis Schroder-Russell Westbrook argument
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lakers coach Darvin Ham waved the white flag at the next timeout break, and James' exasperation was visible.
Here's what happened when James was asked about general manager Rob Pelinka's comments regarding the Lakers' trade deadline strategy.
How does that analysis, philosophy sit with you pertaining to the trade deadline?
After the Lakers finished 33-49 and missed the Play-In Tournament in 2021-22, James doesn't want to go down that road again.
He didn't need to say anything about the trade deadline — his play has been loud enough.

     Russell Westbrook gets into a heated exchange with a reporter after being asked about a “cross-up” with Dennis Schroder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That turnover happened in the middle of a Lakers run when they cut the lead to 10.
However, the turnover also happened to be the final nail in the coffin for the Lakers, costing them a potential comeback.
This also happened to be the reason why Westbrook and Dennis Schroder had a heated argument on the bench.
When Westbrook was asked post-game what the argument was about, the 9-time All-Star ended up going back and forth with a reporter instead.
Unfortunately for the Lakers, though, Tuesday's game felt like a one-man show spearheaded by LeBron James.
