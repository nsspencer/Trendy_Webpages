     4.2 magnitude earthquake strikes off Malibu coast, USGS says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4.2 magnitude earthquake strikes off Malibu coast, USGS saysA preliminary-magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck near Malibu early Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
MALIBU, Calif. (KABC) -- A preliminary-magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck near the coast of Malibu early Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake occurred at 2 a.m. and was centered just offshore, with an epicenter located about 15 miles southwest of Santa Monica, the USGS said.
Although the ShakeAlert system was activated by the earthquake, it "was too small to trigger the delivery of #ShakeAlert-powered alerts to cell phones," the USGS said on Twitter.
In a somewhat remarkable coincidence, Wednesday's earthquake comes exactly five years after a magnitude 4.0 earthquake struck Southern California -- also around 2 a.m.
