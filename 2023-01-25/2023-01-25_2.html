     Anthony Davis injury update: Lakers star to return Wednesday after missing nearly six weeks, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis will return to the lineup Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs barring any setbacks in his pre-game warmups, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
From that moment, at which point LeBron James was injured, Davis led the Lakers to a 9-6 record up until his injury.
Davis carried the Lakers when James was out, but since Davis went down, LeBron has returned the favor.
James has averaged roughly 34 points per game since Davis went down.
The last time the two of them did so over a full season, the Lakers won a championship.

     Lakers’ LeBron James makes history in loss to Clippers, moves closer to all-time scoring record

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth time this season, James scored at least 40 points, putting up 46 points as the LA Lakers lost to the LA Clippers Tuesday night, 133-115.
James made history in the losing effort, becoming the first player to score 40 points against all 30 NBA teams .
In his 20th NBA season, James has not skipped a beat, averaging 30.2 points per game as the Lakers have struggled just to hover around .500.
"I was able to make a few shots tonight and try to help us stay in the game," James said.
James’ fourth 40-point game of the 2022-23 season moved him to within 177 points of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time NBA scoring record.

     NBA trade rumors: Lakers' Rob Pelinka explains what it would take to move future first-round picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers made their first trade of the season on Monday when they landed Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura.
If, at the end of next month's trade deadline, Hachimura is the Lakers' only pickup, their fortunes likely won't change much.
"I think the calculus for the Lakers is to win a championship or not," Pelinka said.
The Lakers have a flawed roster that probably needs more than a single move or trade deadline to be fixed.
Nothing the Lakers do matters if James isn't one of the best players in the world.

     LeBron James scores 46 points in Lakers loss, moves closer to NBA's all-time scoring record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —LeBron James moved to within 177 points of the NBA’s all-time scoring record as the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 133-115 by the Los Angeles Clippers.
James scored 46 points in the losing cause but in the process made history as the first player to hit 40 points against every franchise in the league.
“I’ve put a lot of work into it and was able to make a few shots tonight to try to help us stay in the game,” James told reporters.
When will James pass the scoring record?
With his season average of 30.2 points per game, James could pass Abdul Jabbar’s 34-year-old scoring record in the NBA against the Pacers on February 2.

     Was Clippers-Lakers an NBA Play-In preview? Beat writer roundtable

     Summary: At long last, The Athletic brings the NBA Los Angeles duo of Jovan Buha (Lakers beat writer) and Law Murray (Clippers beat writer) to the roundtable after another win by the LA Clippers over the Los Angeles Lakers.
Ten percent of the Clippers’ points come from the midrange, ranking fifth in the NBA.
It’s a Clippers home game, and it will be the only game the Clippers play in a six-day span.
But a lot will have to be determined before the Lakers and Clippers see each other 10 weeks from now.
Because both teams are hovering so close to .500 with win-now rosters, it might even be a Play-In Tournament preview.

     Rui Hachimura roundtable: His strengths, weaknesses and his fit with Lakers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rui Hachimura was officially introduced as a Lakers player on Tuesday night ahead of the Lakers’ 133-115 loss to the LA Clippers.
To dissect Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and fit with the Lakers, The Athletic has gathered Lakers beat writer Jovan Buha and Wizards beat writer Josh Robbins for a roundtable discussion about Hachimura’s strengths, weaknesses and expected role in L.A.Jovan Buha: Josh, thanks for doing this.
Robbins: His weaknesses are significant, and big picture, his weaknesses revolve around how awkwardly he often fits into a five-man game.
The Wizards and Hachimura did not reach an extension agreement during the window for rookie-scale extensions, and Hachimura wanted the Wizards to trade him.
Also, while he probably has the athleticism to guard many wings in short doses, I think he’s better off defending players who aren’t quite as quick.

Jackson had two turnovers, but five assists, and the Clippers outscored the Lakers by 11 in his minutes.
