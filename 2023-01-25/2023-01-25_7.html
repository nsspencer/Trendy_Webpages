     BEASTMODE: McCarthy Savages Press on Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During a press pool Tuesday, reporters pressed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) on his decision to boot Democratic congressmen Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Eric Swalwell (Calif.) from the House Intelligence Committee.
After one reporter accused McCarthy of avoiding the question, the California Republican shot down the journalist.
Schiff "used his position as chairman—knowing he has information the rest of America does not—and lied to the American public," said the speaker.
"It wasn't just us who were concerned about it.
The FBI was concerned about putting a member of Congress on the intel committee—that has the rights to see things others don't—because of his knowledge and relationship with a Chinese spy," McCarthy said of Swalwell.

     Summary: Democrats are crying foul as House Republicans sort key committee assignmentsEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/APReps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell accused House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of "political vengeance" for blocking the California Democrats from serving on the House Intelligence Committee.
"This is, I think, not an unexpected but nonetheless, destructive move by Kevin McCarthy," Schiff said during a press conference Wednesday morning.
McCarthy rejected a request from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to keep Schiff and Swalwell on the committee.
As House speaker, McCarthy has authority to approve or reject spots on the intelligence committee because it is a "select" committee, while positions on standing committees ultimately require a vote of the House.
"So he is now, I think, carrying the dirty water for the former president in trying to remove me from the intel committee."

     Summary: Kevin McCarthy says he'll block Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell from House Intelligence committeeSpeaker Kevin McCarthy reiterated that he will block Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California from serving on the House committee that oversees national intelligence.
Speaker Kevin McCarthy reiterated Tuesday that he will block Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California from serving on the House committee that oversees national intelligence, saying the decision was not based on political payback but because "integrity matters, and they have failed in that place."
Unlike most committees, appointments to the Intelligence panel are the prerogative of the speaker, with input from the minority leader.
The Intel committee's responsibility is the national security to America."
McCarthy tried to have Swalwell removed from the Intelligence panel in March 2021 based on his contact with a suspected Chinese spy.

"Kevin McCarthy just kicked me and @RepSwalwell off the Intelligence Committee," he said.
A reporter on Capitol Hill asked McCarthy about his decision to not reappoint Swalwell and Schiff to the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, and the House speaker did not hold back.
Omar was also left out of being appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, mainly because of her past antisemitic remarks.
"If McCarthy wants to denigrate the House and its committees, we will always stand up to these efforts."

     McCarthy officially denies Schiff and Swalwell seats on House Intelligence Committee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday officially denied seats on the House Intelligence Committee to Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, the former chairman of the panel.
Integrity matters more,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he posted on Twitter Tuesday night.
McCarthy has cited a “new standard” from Democrats for why he would strip Schiff and Swalwell, both of California, of their committee assignments.
Schiff will sit on the Judiciary Committee, according to a Democratic aide, while Swalwell told CNN he will sit on the Judiciary and Homeland Security panels.
McCarthy expanded both of the select committees, naming more people to the rosters than initially expected due to “overwhelming interest” from members, according to a GOP source familiar.
