     Summary: The U.S. men’s national soccer team, currently without a permanent coach, general manager or any real sense of direction, doesn’t know either of those things.
With the U.S. co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, alongside Canada and Mexico, the pressure already is building for the Americans to make a deep run in the tournament.
AdvertisementWednesday’s young, inexperienced team won’t be the World Cup one; lacking a FIFA competition window, the U.S. was unable to call in the European-based core of its roster.

     Three takeaways as USMNT's 2026 World Cup cycle gets off to shaky start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are big questions for the US men’s national team right now, ones that weren’t ever going to be answered on Wednesday night in Los Angeles.
They are questions of coaching, and of big players and bigger attitudes, and of all the other myriad things that any team faces each time they start a new World Cup cycle.
Tell me if this sounds familiar: pressing 4-3-3 single pivot with high fullbacks and strong elements of positional play.
If you’ve watched the US since the start of 2019, then it should, because that was the US’s blueprint under Gregg Berhalter.
This is the kind of cycle-to-cycle consistency the best teams in the world have even as the personnel – both on the field and on the sidelines – changes.

     USMNT Instant Match Ratings From 2-1 Loss Vs. Serbia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USMNT instant match ratings from 2-1 loss vs. Serbia originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoAfter a valiant effort, the United States men’s national team started 2023 with a 2-1 loss to Serbia in an international friendly on Wednesday.
San Jose Earthquakes left winger Cade Cowell provided incredible energy and directness from his flank throughout, but the opening goal came from the opposite side.
Then, right after halftime, Veljko Semić pounced on a loose ball in a dangerous area to make it 2-1.
It was all USMNT from that point on, but they just didn’t have enough end product to see out a result.
73” LW Paul Arriola – 5.5: He didn’t get the ball much either, but his lone key chance barely demonstrated power.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heavy Mexican-American influenceAll four players on the roster eligible to represent Mexico -- Vazquez, Alejandro Zendejas, Cade Cowell and Jonathan Gomez -- were in the starting XI.
For all the attention Zendejas' inclusion drew coming in midseason from Club America, he was outshined by Cowell on the opposite wing.
Best: Cade Cowell, USAAs mentioned above, Cowell was consistently impactful playing down the left wing.
He's a really, really exciting player.
Technically really, really strong.

Drama surrounding the team revolving around Gregg Berhalter, Gio Reyna, his parents and the 2022 World Cup.
First goal of 2023 goes to …Brandon Vazquez delivered in his first national team cap.
One of the larger talking points when looking at the USMNT roster in relation to the next few years ahead of the 2026 World Cup is of course the striker position.
He should be a key piece to the U.S. squad in the U-20 World Cup, and more performances like these will only keep boosting that stock.
