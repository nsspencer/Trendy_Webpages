     BK Nets Player Ben Simmons Teams Up With Nonprofit to Provide New Coats to Children
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets player Ben Simmons recently partnered with nonprofit organization Operation Warm to provide brand-new coats to children.
During his annual Ben Simmons Coat Giveback event — which took place at Brooklyn’s PS 124 Silas B Dutcher Elementary — Simmons gifted new warm winter coats to over 2,600 local kids in total.
Since then, Simmons has been able to provide a total of over 7,800 new coats to children in need.
All new coats have been handed out through elementary schools and nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in New York.
“Our partnership with Ben and the Simmons Family Foundation these last five years has positively impacted thousands of children,” said Grace Sica, executive director for Operation Warm.

     Ben Simmons gets harsh fan treatment in first battle vs. Joel Embiid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers fans will never get tired of booing Brooklyn Nets star Ben Simmons whenever he plays at Wells Fargo Center.
The Sixers faithful made sure to remind him of that on Wednesday as the two teams meet again.
As the Nets’ starting lineup was introduced, Sixers fans let Simmons hear it when his name was announced.
It is interesting to note, however, that it’s the first time that Simmons will be facing up against Joel Embiid since his trade to the Nets in 2022.
Philadelphia won their previous meeting with Brooklyn early in the season, and sure enough, Sixers fans are hoping for the same this time around.

     76ers’ Rivers Brushes Off Hype Surrounding Ben Simmons’ Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doc Rivers and the 76ers claim they aren't focused on the Ben Simmons drama as they gear up to face the Nets.
After spending more than half a season fielding questions about the All-Star holding out from the Philadelphia 76ers, Rivers hoped Simmons’ move to the Brooklyn Nets would cause the drama to simmer down.
While the hype has died down a bit since last season, Simmons’ return to Philly is still a hot topic to those outside of the Sixers’ organization.
While the Simmons drama is apparently out of the Sixers’ heads, Wednesday’s game still holds a lot of weight in the Eastern Conference standings.

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers returned home from a five-game road trip on Wednesday and they played host to former star point guard Ben Simmons and the Brooklyn Nets.

In the end, the Sixers were able to come away with a wild 137-133 win over the short-handed Nets who were missing Kevin Durant due to injury.
The Sixers saw a 17-point lead slip away as the Nets put on a furious comeback, but Philadelphia was able to escape late.

Royce O’Neal, the player the Nets acquired using the Sixers 2023 pick will play.
That left the Nets with the Sixers’ 2023 pick which they subsequently shipped out for the former Jazz wingman, O’Neal.
We’re still patiently waiting to see if and when the Nets trade the Sixers 2027 first they possess for even more help.
Last time the teams met, Philadelphia handled Kevin Durant, Irving and Simmons without Embiid, James Harden, or Tyrese Maxey.
