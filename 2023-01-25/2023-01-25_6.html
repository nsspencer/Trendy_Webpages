     Stephen Curry ejected in fourth quarter of Golden State Warriors' win over Memphis Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry didn't see the end of the Golden State Warriors' 122-120 win over the Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday, as the All-Star guard was ejected with 1:14 left in the fourth quarter at Chase Center.
Curry threw his mouthpiece after being upset with teammate Jordan Poole for not passing him the ball and rushing a 3-point shot after an offensive rebound.
"When you want something really bad, like getting a win, fourth quarter execution, clutch time type situation, all that stuff does matter.
The Warriors (24-24) defeated the Grizzlies on a last-second layup by Poole after overcoming a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter.
When Poole saw Curry in the tunnel after the game, he playfully threw his mouthpiece at him before hugging Curry.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors overcame 21 turnovers, and a Steph Curry ejection to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-120 on Wednesday night.
The Warriors strung some stops together at the start of the fourth quarter, but poor shot selection and continued turnovers allowed the Grizzlies to extend their lead.
With a 116-114 lead, Poole launched a deep three that could have put the game out of reach.
A referee noticed and ejected him from the game (throwing any equipment into the stands is an automatic ejection).
After a pair of empty possessions, Green gave the Warriors a 117-116 lead with 30.4 seconds left.
