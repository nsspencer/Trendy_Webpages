     Summary: Sent on the pope’s behalf by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, it said: “As a pledge of strength and peace in the Lord, the Holy Father sends his blessing.”Two days after the shooting in Monterey Park, seven people were killed in a mass shooting in northern California’s Half Moon Bay, which authorities suspect was a workplace grievance at a mushroom farm.
In an interview following the back-to-back shootings, Pope Francis was asked about the large number of weapons in the U.S. and the frequency of mass shootings.
“I say when you have to defend yourself, all that’s left is to have the elements to defend yourself.
Another thing is how that need to defend oneself lengthens, lengthens, and becomes a habit,” the pope told AP in an interview published on Jan. 25.
“Instead of making the effort to help us live, we make the effort to help us kill,” he added.

He also criticized laws that criminalize homosexuality as unjust.
Pope Francis told the Associated Press that, while Catholic teaching holds that homosexual acts are a "sin," being homosexual is not a "crime."
He added that the Catholic Church should work to put an end to laws in some countries that criminalize homosexuality.

     Good News: Pope Francis Calls on World to Decriminalize Homosexuality
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an exclusive interview with Associated Press reporter Nicole Winfield, published this morning, Pope Francis said homosexuality should not be a crime and called upon all countries with such laws — 67 of them in total — to decriminalize.
There are also a few countries with a substantial Catholic population that criminalize homosexuality, Rwanda (49.5%) being the most prominent in this group.
Francis was intentional about making a distinction between homosexuality being a “sin” — which he believes it to be — and being a criminal act, which he believes it should not be.
This is arguably the strongest statement of support for LGBTQ rights from Francis since the beginning of his papacy.

     Summary: “Being homosexual isn’t a crime,” Francis said during an exclusive interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
Declaring such laws “unjust,” Francis said the Catholic Church can and should work to put an end to them.
On Tuesday, Francis said there needed to be a distinction between a crime and a sin with regard to homosexuality.
“Fine, but first let’s distinguish between a sin and a crime.”“It’s also a sin to lack charity with one another,” he added.
Despite such outreach, Francis was criticized by the Catholic LGBTQ community for a 2021 decree from the Vatican’s doctrine office that said the church cannot bless same-sex unions.
