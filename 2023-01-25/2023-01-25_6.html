     Nasdaq closes slightly lower for a second day as earnings season rolls on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nasdaq closed lower Wednesday for a second day as investors studied the latest batch of corporate earnings, and assessed how the largest companies are faring amid rising rates and mounting recession fears.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a small gain, rising 9.88 points, or 0.03%, to end at 33,743.84.
That's pretty much the message we're getting from earnings season so far," said Adam Sarhan CEO of 50 Park Investments.
Through Wednesday's open, more than 19% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings, with 68% of them posting stronger-than-expected results, according to FactSet.
As of Wednesday's close, all three major averages are higher for the week, with the Nasdaq up 1.55%.

     Summary: Those seven companies lost $119.9 billion in market capitalization as of 1 p.m. EST, led by Alphabet’s $43 billion dip.
Long bastions of growth, the largest tech stocks largely underperformed the market in 2022, when all three indexes suffered their worst annual performance since 2008.
Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Alphabet each fell 27% or more last year, and Meta and Tesla’s 68% and 64% respective declines were among the 10 largest drops on the S&amp;P.
Microsoft said earlier this month it will cut 10,000 jobs, joining Amazon (18,000), Alphabet (12,000) and Meta (11,000) in dramatically reducing their headcounts in recent weeks.

     Microsoft Stock Slides As Weakened Cloud Outlook Reverses Earnings Jump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment, and we saw results weaken through December," said CFO Amy Hood.
Updated at 1:31 pm ESTMicrosoft (MSFT) - Get Free Report shares slumped lower Wednesday after the tech giant's near-term outlook for its key cloud computing business offset a better-than-expected December quarter earnings report.
Investors had originally cheered Microsoft's December quarter gains, particularly with revenue from Azure, its flagship cloud division, rising 31% from last year and topping Street forecasts.
Productivity and business division revenues, which includes Office 365, rose 7% to $17 billion, Microsoft said, while Intelligent Cloud revenues were up 18% to $21.5 billion, a tally the company had guided in late October.
Microsoft shares were marked 0.5% lower in early afternoon trading Wednesday following last night's earnings release to change hands at $240.83 each.

     Summary: Nevertheless, revenue missed the mark, and prompted Microsoft to issue a dismal fiscal third-quarter revenue forecast.
At least six brokerages have slashed their price targets on MSFT in response, with J.P. Morgan Securities lowering its objective to $265 from $275.
However, two other raised their price targets.
Still, 25 of the 29 firms in coverage call Microsoft stock a "buy" or better.
Digging deeper, Microsoft stock has once again run into a ceiling at the $245 level, after failing at that level twice in December.

We have two simple things to say about Microsoft and its stock.
That the stock isn't down more than is the case tells us more about market appetite than it does about Microsoft fundamentals.
