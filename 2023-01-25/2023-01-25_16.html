     Novak Djokovic isn’t on a revenge tour in Australia—he just wants his title back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The only chance I have is if I play my best tennis,” Andrey Rublev said before his Australian Open quarterfinal with Novak Djokovic on Wednesday night.
That’s the only chance.”When the time came to get on court with Djokovic, though, Rublev seemed to have lost his belief even in that one chance.
It felt like Djokovic started this match already up two sets to love.
It wasn’t just the fact that he is a nine-time Australian Open champion, or the fact that he has played the best tennis of anyone on the men’s tour since the US Open.
When Rublev tried to put something extra on his second ball, the result was that double fault at break point.

     Summary: Srdjan Djokovic, the father of Novak Djokovic, has been pictured posing for photos with Vladimir Putin supporters at the Australian Open on Wednesday night.
It came after TA banned Russian flags at the Australian Open after an incident during the first-round match between Ukraine’s Kateryna Baindl and Russian Kamilla Rakhimova, when spectators showed up with Russian flags.
“Tennis Australia, brace yourselves … for fans, for people who love tennis, if you know what I mean.
One patron is now assisting police with unrelated matters,” said Tennis Australia in a statement.
Among the Serbian flags, there is: a Russian flag, Putin, Z-symbol, so-called Donetsk People’s Republic flag.

     EXPLAINER: Novak Djokovic's successful return to Australia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If he makes that 28 in a row with victories over the unseeded Paul and then either No.
AdvertisementThere was, of course, a pause during Djokovic’s streak: He did not play in last year’s Australian Open, which is part of what he calls the “something extra” that made made him want “to really do well” this time around.
A judge later reinstated the visa and ordered Djokovic’s release, ruling he wasn’t given enough time to speak to his lawyers.
But Australia had a change of government, the country’s pandemic border rules changed, and the current immigration minister granted him a visa this time.
Sorry, my bad.” As for head-to-head against the semifinalists, Djokovic has never played Paul, is 10-2 against Tsitsipas (winning the last nine) and 8-1 against Khachanov (winning the last seven).

Oi, Oi, Oi!” or “Go, Gators!”Advertisement“He had a pretty good trip,” Paul noted.
I feel like hopefully 2023 is the year where I really make a big jump.”Paul’s next opponent will be 21-time Grand Slam singles champion Novak Djokovic, who overwhelmed No.

For all of his positive qualities, compared with the best players in the world the Russian is one dimensional.
He is helpless when the best players neutralise his obvious strengths.
It remains to be seen if there is anyone left who could offer anything more on the most important court of Djokovic’s career.
I’ve been in this situation in so many times in my life, in my career, never lost a semi-finals in Australian Open.
