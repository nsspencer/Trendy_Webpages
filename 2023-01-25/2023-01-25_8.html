     U.S. will send Abrams tanks to Ukraine ahead of expected Russian offensive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – The Biden administration announced Wednesday it will equip Ukraine with the mighty M1A1 Abrams tank, a key reversal in the West's effort to arm Kyiv as it prepares for a fresh Russian offensive.
Washington plans to purchase the new M1s using funds from that package, the congressionally approved Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.
It will "take some time" for the tanks to be delivered to Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said Wednesday.
The Pentagon has been tasked with providing the training, maintenance and logistics support for the M1A1 tanks, according to the official.
He also declined to provide a timeline of when the M1A1 Abrams tanks would be ready for Ukrainian forces.

     In reversal, US to send 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON ― U.S. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday he would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, reversing course after Germany cleared the way for Europe to send scores of main battle tanks.
“Today I am announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine,” Biden said.
The Abrams tanks are the most capable tanks in the world.”“They’re also extremely complex to operate and maintain.
So we’re also giving Ukraine the parts and equipment necessary to effectively sustain these tanks on the battlefield,” he added.
U.S. officials said ahead of the announcement the Abrams tanks, which are enough to outfit a Ukrainian tank battalion, will come at the end of a monthslong contracting process.

     U.S. to send 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, in major reversal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. will now sign contracts for the 31 Abrams tanks, along with 120mm rounds and other ammunition, eight tactical recovery vehicles, other support vehicles and equipment, training, maintenance and sustainment, according to the State Department.
But Berlin stood firm, with senior German leaders privately telling Washington that they would only send Leopards if the U.S. sent Abrams.
He ultimately decided to send American tanks after Austin’s recommendation, according to two other U.S. officials.
The decision comes after Pentagon leaders argued publicly and privately that now may not be the right time to send the Abrams.
“The Abrams tanks are the most capable tanks in the world.

     U.S. Abrams Tanks Not Expected in Ukraine for Months
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden Administration reversed course on its policy stance on whether to send M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine after publicly arguing for weeks that such a move would hinder Ukrainian forces more than help.
The Abrams tank weighs more than 60 tons with a 120 millimeter cannon that can hit targets a mile away.
The hope is the influx of heavy weapons will tip the fighting in Kyiv’s favor and enable Ukrainian forces to retake occupied territory.
In providing Abrams, Biden opened the door for other allied nations to send their own additional firepower to Kyiv.
Scholz had privately insisted that Washington provide U.S. tanks first, according to U.S. officials, before he would greenlight sending German-made tanks.

     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — For months, U.S. officials balked at sending M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, insisting they were too complicated and too hard to maintain and repair.
M1 Abrams tanks have led American battle assaults for decades.
“The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment.
U.S. officials would only say that it will take “many months” to deliver the Abrams tanks, but that the Leopards will arrive faster.
“We can often abbreviate and accelerate what we can do in terms of training for Ukrainian army soldiers,” he told reporters Wednesday.
