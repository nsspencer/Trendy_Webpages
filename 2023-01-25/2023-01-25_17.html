     Dennis Schroder reveals reason for dust-up with Russell Westbrook vs. Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers got the better of the Lakers in the battle of Los Angeles on Tuesday night, and Dennis Schroder opened up about the tense conversation he had with teammate Russell Westbrook in the fourth quarter of the contest.
Schroder said the conversation between him and Russ was borne out of frustration with his own mistakes and that they were on the same page now, according to Lakers beat writer Kyle Goon.
Yeah, of course,” Schroder responded to being asked if it was a one-game issue between the two veterans.
He also scored a career high nine three-pointers, while grabbing eight boards and adding seven assists.
Westbrook finished with 17 points, one rebound and five assists in the contest, while Dennis Schroder scored just seven points and added two boards over 32 minutes.

How were we crossed up?”“I mean I assume the turnover wasn’t the goal of the play,” the reporter responded.
